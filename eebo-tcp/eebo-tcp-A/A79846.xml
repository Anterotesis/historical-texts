         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It was the judgment of the Parliament in the 2 year of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.

            <p>It was the <hi>language of the Law</hi> in the 36 year of K. <hi>H.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Dyer, fol. 60. pl. 19.</note> reported by my Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> that <hi>the King is the head, and that the Lords are chief and principall Members, and the Commons, to wit, the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes, the inferiour Members, and that they all make the Body of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi> and doubtleſſe the Priviledge of Parliament was not in that time held ſo ſacred a thing, when an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Debt</hi> was brought againſt the Sheriffe of <hi>Cornwall</hi> for having diſcharged one <hi>Trewynnard,</hi> a Burgeſſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, taken in Execution during the Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a Writ of priviledge directed to the ſaid She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, and the Kings Bench (where the Action was brought, and the Sheriffe juſtified) was in thoſe daies the proper place to judge what was the priviledge of Parliament, the Law being the moſt proper Judge of that priviledge, as well as of all other rights.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is the language of the Parliament in the 1 year of<note place="margin">1 Iac. c. 1.</note> King <hi>James,</hi> when to the firſt Act that was paſt, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired His Majeſties royall aſſent, <hi>without which</hi> (they ſay) <hi>it can neither be compleat or perfect, nor remaine to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is the <hi>language of this preſent Parliament,</hi> and<note place="margin">Exact Collect. p 207.</note> in a time in which they were not very modeſt in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, for in their Declaration of the 19 of <hi>May,</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>that by the conſtitution of this Kingdome, the power is in His Majeſty and Parliament together,</hi> albeit they conclude in the ſame Declaration, <hi>that if He refuſed to joyne with them, they will doe their work themſelves without Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no one Propoſition that hath more miſ-led men, then the diſcourſe of the Parliaments being the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Court of Judicature, and therefore that they have the ſole power to declare Law; It is confeſſed, that the Houſe of Peers in Parliament (for any pretence of the Houſe of Commons to judicature is groundleſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and unheard of, till within theſe laſt ſeven years) is the ſupream Court of Judicature, whither any perſon that conceives himſelf oppreſſed by the judgment of any other Court, may by writ of Error remove that judgment, of which he Complaines, and from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of that Court there is no Appeale; which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty well expreſſed in His Anſwer to that Declaration of the 19 of <hi>May,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>We deny not, but they may</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exact Collect. p. 251.</note> 
               <hi>have a power to declare in a particular doubtfull caſe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly brought before them what Law is, but to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Declaration, whereby the known rule of the Law may be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116687:7"/>
croſſed or altered, they have no power, nor can exerciſe any without bringing the Life and Liberty of the Subject to a lawleſſe and arbitrary ſubjection:</hi> Which aſſertion the too ſad experience of all men hath evinced to be moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The truth is, that power of declaring in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe ſo brought before them, is rather a power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what ſhall be done in that caſe, then what the law is; for if they reverſe a judgment brought before them, and determine the right otherwiſe, then it hath been judged by the ſworne Judges, that judgement is no rule to the ſworne Judges to judge by, but they may in the like caſe without imputation of Crime or error, judge as they did formerly; which ſhews that the Judges are the onely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of the Law, in their ſeverall Courts, though in theſe caſes, removed regularly before the Lords, the party muſt <hi>acquieſce,</hi> there being no other Court to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to.</p>
            <p>Adde to this, that there hath been in all times, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the ſworne Judges of the Law, that the Lords in Parliament have alwaies guided themſelves by their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in matters of law; neither will it be ever found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Parliament, that the Houſe of Peers ever decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or judged the law in any particular caſe againſt the unanimous opinion of the Judges, who are aſſiſtants only for that purpoſe; neither is it reaſon that any ſhould be thought fit Interpreters or Declarers of the law, but they who have ſtudied it, and are ſworne to doe it truly. And to this point, though there are multitude of examples and Preſidents, there ſhall be one only remembred: In the Parliament in the 28 year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. upon the 16 of <hi>January,</hi> the Commons deſired, That <hi>William de la Poole Duke of Suffolk</hi> ſhould be Committed to priſon for many Treaſons &amp; other hainous Crimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by him; The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116687:8"/>
Lords in Parliament were in doubt, what Anſwer to give, they demanded the opinion of the Judges, their opinion was, that he ought not to be Committed; And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, for that the Commons did not charge him with any particular Offence, but with generall Slanders and Reproaches; And therefore becauſe the ſpecialties were not ſhewed, he was not to be Committed: this opinion was allowed, and the <hi>Duke</hi> was not Committed, till a Fortnight after that the Commons had exhibited ſpeciall Articles againſt him, that he conſpired with the French King, to invade the Realme, &amp;c. And then he was ſent to the <hi>Tower:</hi> So great reſpect did thoſe times beare to the Judges of the Law, and ſo much courage had the Judges then to declare what the Law was.</p>
            <p>Having now made it manifeſt, that this moſt deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <hi>maxime</hi> or <hi>principle,</hi> is no <hi>new poſition,</hi> but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>antiquity, Conſcience, truth,</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not like to be <hi>a fit foundation for all Tyranny;</hi> It will not be unſeaſonable, to obſerve that theſe words were ſpoken by His Majeſty at the firſt Seſſion of Parliament in the 3 year of his Reigne, and that though the matter of them hath been often ſince, and muſt be alwaies aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him; the very words have not been uſed in Speech or Declaration by His Majeſty ſince the beginning of this Parliament, and that that very Parliament continued many Months after, and never in the leaſt degree made queſtion of them, nor hath any objection been made to them, till this new Declaration of the Commons, near 18 years after, and therefore it is not probable, that they have been before miſ-interpreted or cenſured.</p>
            <p>It may be likewiſe in this place fit to inform the people, what theſe men meane by <hi>the power of Declaring Law,</hi> which they are ſo ambitious of; that they may know
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116687:8"/>
how little elſe they would need to deſtroy King and people, if they were poſſeſſed of this power, in the ſenſe they intend; which will beſt appear by the inſtances in which they have aſſumed it.</p>
            <p>The King proclaimes Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> guilty of high Treaſon, for having ſhut the Gates of <hi>Hull,</hi> and having made <hi>reſiſtance with armed men in defiance of His Majeſty,</hi> which he ſaies is high Treaſon by the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25<note place="margin">Exact Collect. p. 276, 277.</note> year of <hi>Edw. 3. c.</hi> 2. They declare that Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> did not ſhut the Gates againſt Him in defiance, <hi>but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to His Majeſty,</hi> and that the meaning of that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is onely againſt thoſe, who levyed War againſt <hi>the Kings laws and authority;</hi> that the Kings <hi>Authority is only in them; and they only can judge of the laws;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they who ſhall levy War by their authority, (though againſt the perſonall <hi>Commands of the King, and accompanied with his preſence</hi>) incur no danger by that Statute: And that they who did <hi>attend His Perſon againſt them,</hi> are guilty of Treaſon within that Statute.</p>
            <p>The King for the information of his Subjects, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers them of the Statute made in the 11 year of K. <hi>Hen. 7. cap.</hi> 1. by which it is enacted, <hi>That no manner of perſon, whoſoever he be, that attends upon the King and Soveraign Lord of this Land for the time being in His Perſon, and doe Him true and faithfull ſervice of allegiance in the ſame, or be in other places by His Commandement in His Wars, ſhall be convict or attaint of high Treaſon, nor loſe Lands, Goods, &amp;c.</hi> They declare that by the <hi>King,</hi> in this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,<note place="margin">Exact Collect. p. 280.</note> is meant <hi>the Parliament.</hi> If they are told the King is <hi>Supreme head and Governour over all perſons within His Dominions,</hi> and that He is ſo acknowledged to be by the Oaths themſelves have taken, They preſently declare,<note place="margin">Exact Collect. p. 703.</note> that it is meant of <hi>ſingular perſons rather then of Courts,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:116687:9"/>
or of <hi>the collective body of the whole Kingdome:</hi> Examples innumerable of this kind might be remembred, and the conſequence needs not be preſſed.</p>
            <p>That the abſurdity may a little appeare, as well as the miſchief, they apply this faculty of declaring to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their Curioſity, and ſupporting their Credit, to matter of right, and matter of fact, or to any purpoſe that may advance their Deſignes: They intercept a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter directed to the <hi>Queens</hi> Majeſty from the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> before the War began, and declare it would <hi>be diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>

               <hi>to His Majeſty and dangerous for the Kingdome, if it ſhould not be opened;</hi> and thereupon with unheard-of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, they open and peruſe the Letter, Her Majeſty being within a daies journey of them: And when the King cauſed Sir <hi>John Hotham's</hi> Letters to be opened, which were intercepted after he was in Rebellion, They declare, that it was <hi>a high breach of Priviledge,</hi> which by<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 156.</note> the <hi>Laws of the Kingdome,</hi> and by the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> we <hi>are bound to defend with our lives and fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Maſter <hi>Booth,</hi> a Gentleman of quality of <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> delivered a Petition to the King at <hi>Yorke,</hi> in which he complained of certaine Gentlemen, who as Deputy-Lieutenants, had put the Ordinance for the <hi>Militia</hi> in execution in that County; and ſet forth in his Petition ſeverall Actions done and words ſpoken by them at that time, and both himſelf and one Maſter <hi>Scroope</hi> made <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavit</hi> before a Maſter of the Chancery, that the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Petition was punctually and preciſely true; which Petition and Oath being printed, the Houſe of Commons frankly declared, That it was falſe; Not to<note place="margin">Ex.

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:116687:9"/>
He publiſhed <hi>for the apprehenſion of thoſe Members,</hi> was falſe; So that this ſole power of declaring, would not ſtand in need of any other power to ſubvert the whole frame of Government, and ſo diſpoſe of the intire rights of Prince and People according to the variety of their appetites and humour; For they ſay, as <hi>ſome preſidents</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And in truth the inconſtancy and contradiction in their rules and reſolutions is no leſſe obſervable then the other extravagancy; In their Petition of the 14 of <hi>Decem.</hi> 1641. they declared, that <hi>the King ought not to manifeſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare His conſent, or diſſent, approbation or diſlike of any Bill in preparation or debate, before it be preſented to Him in due courſe of Parliament;</hi> yet within few daies after, in the Petition that accompanied the Remonſtrance of the State of the Kingdome, they deſired His Majeſty that He would <hi>concur with them, for the depriving the Biſhops of their Votes in Parliament,</hi> the Bill for that purpoſe being ſtill depending in the Lords Houſe, and then not like to paſſe.</p>
            <p>By the Order of the 3 of <hi>January</hi> 1641. and many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations after, they declared, <hi>that if any Perſon whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhall offer to Arreſt or detain the Perſon of any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without first acquainting the Houſe, that it is lawfull for him to ſtand upon his defence and make reſistance, and for any other Perſon to aſsiſt him in ſo doing;</hi> but in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the 2 of <hi>November</hi> following, <hi>they deny that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 727.</note> 
               <hi>they had ſaid ſo,</hi> and acknowledged <hi>that a Member in the caſes of Treaſon, Felony, or the Peace, may be Arreſted and detained</hi> in ordine <hi>to his appearance before the Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There would be no end of theſe inſtances, not to ſpeak of thoſe, where the Houſe of Peers have declared the Law

            </p>
            <p>2. The next Charge is, the private <hi>Articles agreed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
               <hi>in order to the Match with</hi> Spaine, <hi>and thoſe other private Articles upon the</hi> French <hi>Marriage, ſo prejudiciall to the Peace, Safety, Laws, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What thoſe private Articles were, or are, is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which doubtleſſe would have been, if a reaſonable advantage might have been hoped from it; all thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers being ſeized and peruſed by thoſe, who have neither reſpect to the dignity of their Soveraigne, or regard of the honour of their Country. The Articles with both Kingdomes, were tranſacted by the great wiſdome of King <hi>James,</hi> and cannot be imputed to His Majeſty that now is; neither is there in one, or the other, any one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle that was not in the Kings power to agree to, in the manner in which he did agree; and that neither of them were prejudiciall to the Peace, Safety, Laws, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion here eſtabliſhed, is moſt evident, for that Peace and Safety were never more viſible, nor the Laws and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſhed did ever flouriſh more in any age, then from the time of thoſe Articles to the beginning of this unhappy Parliament, which no diſcourſe of correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Rome,</hi> can hinder from being acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>3. The third matter objected is, a Diſcourſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the Death of King</hi> JAMES, in which there is mention of a Clauſe in the Impeachment carried up againſt the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> by the Houſe of Commons, in the 2 year of this King; &amp; that the King came into the Lords Houſe and took notice of that Charge, and ſaid, He could be a Witneſſe to clear him in every one of them; and that ſhortly after the <hi>Parliament</hi> was diſſolved, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116687:10"/>
that <hi>they leave it to the world to judge where the guilt remaines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the life of King <hi>James,</hi> and to the hour of his death, there was no earthly thing He took equall joy and comfort in, as in the obedience &amp; piety of His Son; who was not more reputed and known to be Heire apparent to the Crown, then to be the moſt dutifull and pious Son in the Kingdome, and was never known to diſpleaſe His Father in His life; The King died in the 59 year of his age, after many terrible fits of an <hi>Ague</hi> which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a <hi>quotidian Fever,</hi> a diſeaſe uſually mortall to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that age and corpulency of body, which K. <hi>James</hi> was of.</p>
            <p>After His death, in the 1 year of His Majeſties Reigne, there was a Parliament called, during which time there was never the leaſt whiſper or imagination of the King's death, to be otherwiſe then naturall, and yet the King had many great perſons in His Councel, and there were more afterwards in that Parliament, who did not pretend any kindneſſe to the <hi>Duke of Buckingham;</hi> many of whom muſt neceſſarily have obſerved, or at leaſt have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of any Arguments for ſuch a notorious and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice, and would not have ſuffered any jealouſie, that could reflect on the <hi>Duke,</hi> to be untaken notice of.</p>
            <p>By that time the Parliament in the 2 year of the King began, one <hi>George Egliſham,</hi> an infamous Scotch-man, and a Papiſt, having an ambition to be taken notice of as an Enemy to the <hi>Duke,</hi> tranſported himſelf into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and from thence about the beginning of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſent over a ſmall Pamphlet in the form of a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his owne name to the Parliament, accuſing the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> of having poyſoned the <hi>Marqueſſe of Hamilton, and King</hi> JAMES; which Pamphlet was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly

ſcattered up and down the ſtreets in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and the Houſe of Commons being at the ſame time incenſed againſt the Duke, in their Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Remonſtrance againſt him, thought fit to inſert <hi>the giving of that Drink,</hi> and <hi>applying that Plaiſter</hi> (which was all that was mentioned in that Pamphlet concerning King <hi>James) as a tranſcendent preſumption in the Duke,</hi> as is ſet forth in this Declaration.</p>
            <p>If they had been ingenuous, they would likewiſe have ſet forth the <hi>Duke's anſwer</hi> to that Clauſe, and then the people would have underſtood that there was nothing <hi>adminiſtred to the King, without the privity of the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and His own importunate deſire and Command;</hi> the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications being ſuch, as unlearned people upon obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and experience in thoſe known and common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, believe to do much good, and the learned acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can doe no hurt; And the Parliament continued above a Week after that Anſwer was put in, and no one perſon appeared in that time to offer the leaſt evidence concerning that Clauſe; and the King might very well in juſtice to the honour of a faithfull Servant diſcharge His owne knowledge to free him from ſo horrible an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; And after the diſſolution of that Parliament, all imaginable care was taken to examine the grounds, and to diſcover the Authours of that Suggeſtion; And it is known the miſerable wretch, who raiſed the Scandal, with great penitence afterwards acknowledged his Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and died with the horrour of his guilt.</p>
            <p>In the year following, there was another Parliament ſummoned, which continued and ſate many Months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before the Dukes death, and which was not more devoted to him then the former had been; where thoſe two Gentlemen mentioned in the Declaration bore great
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116687:11"/>
ſway, and were nothing reconciled to the Duke or the Court, yet in all their Remonſtrances, not the leaſt word of that aſperſion, all men believing and knowing it to be the moſt groundleſſe, that could be imagined.</p>
            <p>After the beginning of this Parliament when the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Talking and Preaching ſeditiouſly was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, it was whiſper'd amongſt ſome of the chief Agents for the confuſion which hath ſince followed, that they would examine the matter of the Death of King <hi>James,</hi> and ſhortly after the buſineſſe of the <hi>five Members,</hi> when the King was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and the two Houſes governed ſo abſolutely; This Pamphlet written ſo long ſince by <hi>Egliſham</hi> was printed, and publickly ſold in Shops, and about the Streets, and a very powerfull perſon of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with ſome ſeeming trouble in his countenance, told one of the Secretaries of State, that many took the liberty abroad to diſcourſe too boldly of the Death of King <hi>James,</hi> and that he would ſend one to him, a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy man, who could give him a particular information of it; the ſame night the man came to him, who told him that there was a Papiſt, who lived about <hi>London,</hi> or in the neareſt part of <hi>Surrey,</hi> who reported, that <hi>he could prove, that King</hi> James <hi>was poyſoned;</hi> the Secretary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Informer to attend him at an houre the next day; and early in the morning, aſſembled the Privy Councell, acquainted them with the Information, and the Informer; and deſired their Lordſhips advice and opinions what ſhould be done upon it; the moſt of them were very ſhy in the matter, and he who had firſt ſpoken of it, and ſent the Informer, ſeemed wonderfully trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that it was Communicated ſo publickly; by which it was evident he had in the intimation ſome Deſigne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon that Honourable Perſon or his Maſter, of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116687:12"/>
which he hoped to have made another uſe: The Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary immediately after he had received the intelligence, ſent an Expreſſe to His Majeſty with the account, and that he intended forthwith to impart it to the Councell, ſince it was no hard matter to gueſſe what was meant by thoſe, who were privy to it, and therefore deſired His further pleaſure upon it; and finding the ſwaying part of the Councell at that time unwilling to meddle in it, he expected the King's Command, and in the mean time on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent a Warrant to apprehend that Papiſt, which could not be done without the diligence and advice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, who only knew where he was, and whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to aſſiſt. The ſame, or the next day the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned His poſitive and expreſſe Command, <hi>That the Lords of His Councell ſhould uſe all poſsible Induſtry and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the examination, and leave no way unattempted for the full diſcovery:</hi> which Command was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately delivered by the Secretary to their Lordſhips, who thereupon gave ſome directions, but thoſe Lords who deſired to conceale them, knowing onely who the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were, though a formall Order was given for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, no further diſcovery was made, or any avowed Diſcourſe of it till this Declaration; It being then ſaid privately amongſt themſelves, <hi>that the time was not yet come, that they might make uſe of that matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is too much to be ſaid, upon the occaſion of this moſt impoſſible Calumny and Scandall, which hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor can make impreſſion upon any ſober honeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, except to beget a horrour againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of it; And all true Engliſh hearts will ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it, as to expreſſe a deteſtation of the Authours, who being drunk with the bloud they have ſpilt, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſenſe of their own wickedneſſe, have by this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116687:12"/>
laſt impotent Act, declared, that they are at the bottome of their malice; and that by the juſt judgment of God, their wits are as near an end as their Allegiance; and that they have no other ſtock left, but of deſpaire and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to carry them through their impious underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.</p>
            <p>4. The next reproach is the buſineſſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and that His Majeſty let divers of <hi>the Navy Royall, and other Merchant Ships to be imployed against thoſe, whom he was engaged to have aſsiſted;</hi> and the King's Letter to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Penington,</hi> which they ſay they can ſhew under his own hand, and <hi>that hereby Rochel was betrayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the age, quality, and education of moſt of thoſe who conſented to this Declaration will not admit a Suppoſition, that they knew much of the tranſaction of this matter, yet there are ſome amongſt them, who might well have remembred, that there was only one Ship of the Navy Royall (the <hi>Vantguard</hi>) lent by His Majeſty to the French King, and that the ſame was returned long <hi>before Rochel was beſieged,</hi> and <hi>neer if not full two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was rendered;</hi> and therefore it would not be very eaſie to prove, that it was loſt (much leſſe betrayed) by that Action, or that the Ships were imployed againſt <hi>thoſe, whom His Majeſty was engaged to have aſsiſted;</hi> But becauſe much unskilfull diſcourſe hath been of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to the prejudice of the King, and many wel-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning people have been too credulous in it, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Actions of that nature <hi>between</hi> great Princes, are grounded upon deep reaſons of State, above the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of vulgar underſtandings; and that the King upon this new alliance, having at the ſame time a Warre with <hi>Spaine,</hi> had great reaſon to gratifie <hi>France</hi> in all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of friendſhip; It may be worth the labour briefly to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116687:13"/>
ſet down the truth of that matter, and the proceedings thereupon.</p>
            <p>About the time of His Majeſties Marriage with the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>French King</hi> had many deſignes upon <hi>Italy,</hi> and a particular difference and conteſt with the <hi>States of Genoa,</hi> and upon concluſion of that Treaty, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the antient League and amity, confirmed &amp; ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this Marriage, His Majeſty was content to lend the <hi>Vantguard,</hi> and to give licence that ſix or ſeven Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Ships might be hired (if the Owners were willing) to ſerve the <hi>French King</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean Sea,</hi> and upon a preciſe promiſe, <hi>that they ſhould not be imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of the Religion in France:</hi> Accordingly the <hi>Vantguard</hi> (and no other Veſſell of the Navy Royall) was delivered, and the Merchants Ships likewiſe hired by the <hi>French Agents,</hi> with the full conſent of the <hi>Owners,</hi> One of which (or one by their nomination) Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded each Ship and carried the ſame into <hi>France,</hi> and there themſelves delivered the Ships into the poſſeſſion of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe Ships were thus engaged in the <hi>French ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and joyned to their <hi>Fleet,</hi> in which were 20 Ships of Warre likewiſe borrowed of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Hauthaine</hi> the Admirall, and <hi>Dorpe</hi> his Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, who it is very probable, nor their Maſters, were privy, or conſenting to that enterprize, and with which they were much ſuperiour to thoſe of the Religion, though the <hi>Engliſh Ships</hi> had been away, they fell upon the <hi>Rochel Fleet,</hi> and took and deſtroyed many of them; The King was no ſooner informed of this, then he highly reſented it by His Ambaſſadour, and the French King excuſed it upon thoſe of the Religion, who, He Alleaged, had without cauſe, broken the peace; the <hi>Duke of Subeſe</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:116687:13"/>
having when all was quiet, ſeized all the French Ships at <hi>Blauet,</hi> which very Ships made the beſt part of the Fleet he had now incountred and broken; And that the King of <hi>England</hi> ought to be ſenſible of the injury, the peace (thus broken) having been made and conſented to by the French King, upon His Majeſties earneſt mediation and interpoſition; Notwithſtanding which His Majeſty juſtly incenſed, that His Ships ſhould be imployed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to His pleaſure and the promiſe made to Him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly required the reſtitution of His, and all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ships, the which was no ſooner made, then to publiſh to the world how much He was diſpleaſed with that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, He entred into Hoſtility with <hi>France,</hi> the chief ground of that quarrell being, that the Engliſh Ships had been imployed againſt thoſe of the Religion, contrary to the expreſſe promiſe made that they ſhould not be uſed againſt them, as appears as well by the <hi>Manifeſt</hi> of the<note place="margin">Life of <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> 13. p. 79.</note> 
               <hi>Duke of Buckingham,</hi> dated 21 <hi>July,</hi> and printed ſince this Parliament, as by the <hi>Records of State</hi> of that time. Let the world now judge with what colour the loſſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> (which as is ſaid before hapned not till neer or full two years after the return of the Engliſh Ships) can be imputed to the King.</p>
            <p>5. The fifth Article, is, the deſigne of the <hi>Germane-Horſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 18</note> 
               <hi>Loanes, Privy Seales, Coat and Conduct mony, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the many Monopolies;</hi> all which, are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mentioned in the firſt <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of the Houſe of Commons of the 15 of <hi>December,</hi> 1642. as the effects of evill Counſellours, and with a Proteſtation in that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which accompanied it to His Majeſty, that <hi>it was without the leaſt intention to lay a blemiſh upon His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exact Col. p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Royall Perſon, but only to repreſent how His Royall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and truſt had been abuſed:</hi> And finding that the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116687:14"/>
vile language and aſperſions which they caſt upon the King were generally cenſured and ill ſpoken of, The Lords and Commons afterwards in their Declaration of<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 198, 199.</note> the 19 of <hi>May,</hi> tell the people, <hi>that if they ſhould ſay that all the ill things done of late in His Majeſties name have been done by Himſelf, they ſhould neither follow the direction of the Law, nor the affection of their owne hearts,</hi> which (they ſay) is as much as may be to clear His Majeſty of all imputation of miſgovernment, and to lay the fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Miniſters; and then finding fault with thoſe, who make His Majeſty the Authour of evill Counſels, they uſe theſe words, <hi>We His Majeſties loyall and dutifull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, can uſe no other Stile, according to that Maxime of the Law, [The King can doe no wrong:] but if any ill be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in matter of State, the Councell; if in matters of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the Judges muſt anſwer for it:</hi> So that if they would guide themſelves either by the <hi>good old,</hi> or <hi>their own new laws</hi> (from which in truth they ſwerve no leſſe, then from the other) they have themſelves anſwered, and declared againſt this Article; but ſince that is not currant, examine the particulars.</p>
            <p>The time when this deſigne is ſuppoſed to have been, was when His Majeſty had a War with the two greateſt Kings of Chriſtendome, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if He had purpoſed to have drawn auxiliary Forces into His Service, it had been no wonder, nor more then all Princes uſe, yet in truth, there was never any deſigne to bring in <hi>Germane Horſe,</hi> only in thoſe unquiet times when the Kingdom was ſo much threatned from abroad, amongſt other expedients, for ſtrength and defence, ſuch a propoſition was made, or rather ſome diſcourſe upon it, which the King rejected, and did never conſent that it ſhould be put in practice; and therefore it may ſeem
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116687:14"/>
ſtrange, that this deſigne ſhould be now objected againſt His Majeſty, who alone refuſed and hindred it, and that <hi>Balfore</hi> and <hi>Dalbiere,</hi> (who were the principall, if not the only Projectors of it) ſhould be in ſuch high reputation and eſteem with the Declarers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Loanes, Privy Seales,</hi> and other courſes of raiſing Money were upon extraordinary, and immergent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of the ſame nature, that have been in all times practiced, upon reaſon and <hi>neceſsity of State;</hi> And <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies</hi> are weeds, that have alwaies grown in the fat ſoile which long peace and plenty makes, and of that kind they may find a larger Catalogue in their <hi>Journall book</hi> of the 43 year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (a time that no ſober man complaines of) then in any time ſince, and which was not then, nor reaſonably can be imputed to the Crowne, ſince new inventions have juſtly ſo great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and priviledges by the Law, that if thoſe Miniſters, through whoſe hands ſuch grants are to paſſe, are not very vigilant, it is not poſſible, but upon ſpecious pretences, many things unwarrantable, of that nature, will have the countenance of the <hi>Kings hand;</hi> yet thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were no ſooner complained of to His Ma<hi rend="sup">ty</hi>, then He willingly applied the remedies w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were propoſed; &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe <hi>troubles</hi> began, paſſed ſuch <hi>excellent laws</hi> for the prevention of the like inconveniences for the future, that a better ſecurity cannot be provided: So that men muſt think <hi>this Rebellion</hi> to have been raiſed on the behalf of, not againſt thoſe exorbitances, which without it, could never probably have been again exerciſed in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>And here the people cannot enough obſerve, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that theſe grievances ſhould in this manner be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt the King, who removed and aboliſhed them,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116687:15"/>
in a time when, and by thoſe, who have renued and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the ſame, and introduced new vexations upon His Subjects in an illimited manner, and intolerable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>That, They ſhould complain of a deſigne of bringing in <hi>German Horſe</hi> to enſlave us (which (if any ſuch deſigns were) by the goodneſſe of the King was fruſtrated and rejected) who have actually brought in an Army of all Rations upon us, and have no pretence of continuing it, but that they may ſubdue us, diſſolve the Government of the Kingdome, and make us Slaves to their own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and appetite.</p>
            <p>That, They ſhould remember the King of <hi>inforced Loanes, Privy Seales, Coat and Conduct mony,</hi> who (ſince<note place="margin">Ex.

            <p>That, They ſhould complaine of the <hi>ingroſsing of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,</hi> in which His Majeſty did nothing but what by His legall Prerogative He might do, who by their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the 3 of <hi>April,</hi> 1644. for the <hi>making of Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter,</hi>

worſe circumſtances, as the juriſdiction their Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees exerciſe (to whom appeales are to be made) is more grievous, chargeable, and inſupportable, then that was of the Councell Table.</p>
            <p>That, They ſhould mention the <hi>Patent of Wine,</hi> which was to pay <hi>forty Shillings</hi> upon the Tun to His Majeſty, when by the Ordinance of the 22 of <hi>July,</hi> 1643. they have laid an impoſition upon it of <hi>ſix pounds,</hi> over and above all Cuſtomes, and by the Ordinance of the 9 of <hi>October</hi> following, have authorized the <hi>Vintners</hi> to ſell it at as great, and ſome at greater prices, then was ever to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated during the time of His Majeſties impoſition.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (to omit the other particulars of <hi>Salt, Allum, Tobacco,</hi> and the reſt, upon every one of which they have by their particular Ordinances laid much heavier taxes then was thought of in thoſe times) that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the King with the Ship mony (which by their own computation came not to above 200000l. by the year) as the <hi>compendium of all oppreſsion and ſlavery,</hi> for which His Majeſty had a <hi>judgment</hi> in a Court of Law, before all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> and which was alwaies leavied by the due formes of Law, and which His Majeſty, when He was informed of the injuſtice of it, frankly quitted, and did His beſt to pull it up by the roots, that no branch of it may hereafter grow up to the diſquiet of His people, when themſelves have almoſt ever ſince by that one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the 1 of <hi>March,</hi> 1642. impoſed a Weekly tax<note place="margin">Ex.

            <p>It is pity that <hi>parentheſis</hi> of the Spaniſh Fleet with a great Army therein brought into the <hi>Downes,</hi> 1639. (of which out of their goodneſſe, they ſay, they will ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) ſhould receive no Anſwer; That having been often unskilfully ſpoken of, as it is now inſinuated, as a deſigne againſt <hi>England,</hi> whereas they who know any thing, know, that Fleet was bound from <hi>Spaine</hi> to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> with mony to pay their Army, and new leavied Souldiers to recruit it, of which there was the greater number, becauſe it was purpoſed to carry many old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from thence to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> but all thoſe Souldiers in the Fleet were without Armes, and without Officers, and the Fleet ſo far from being provided for an invaſion, that in a little Fight with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> before the winde brought them into the <hi>Downes,</hi> they had ſo near ſpent their Powder, that they had a ſupply for their mony from <hi>London,</hi> which the King could not in honour and juſtice deny, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> themſelves offering them what Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they wanted for ready mony.</p>
            <p>6. Next follows the torture our bodies heretofore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered<note place="margin">Page 18.</note> by <hi>whipping, cutting off Eares, Pillories,</hi> and the like, with <hi>cloſe impriſonment,</hi> aggravated with the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion exerciſed over our Soules, by Oathes, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116687:16"/>
new Canons, &amp;c.</hi> by which they would have it concluded that His Majeſties Government was full of <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>oppreſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an undeniable evidence of the excellent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sobriety, and obedience of that time, that there were not above ſix infamous perſons, from the beginning of His Majeſties Reigne, to the firſt day of this unhappy Parliament, who were publickly taken notice of to have merited thoſe corporall puniſhments and ſhame; and of the mercy of that time, that thoſe ſuffered no greater, there being not one of them who was not guilty of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that degree, that by the Law they were liable to heavier judgments then they underwent: And for the Oathes, Excommunications, Ceremonies, and Canons, they were no other, and no otherwiſe exerciſed, then was agreeable to the Laws, and the Government eſtabliſhed; Of and for which, the Sects, Schiſmes, and Hereſies, the diſſoluteneſſe, profaneneſſe and impiety, which have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that ſince bleſſed Order hath bin diſcountenanced and ſuppreſſed, hath made a fuller and more ſenſible Vindication, then any diſcourſe can doe.</p>

               <hi>the ſhort Parliament,</hi> and the Kings proceeding after the diſſolution.</p>
            <p>That the calling that Parliament was an Act of the Kings great wiſdome and goodneſſe, was then juſtly and generally acknowledged, and that it was in His owne power to diſſolve it when He thought fit, is as little doubted, but that He did unhappily for Himſelf, by falſe Information in matter of fact, and evill advice diſſolve that Parliament, is believed by all men, and upon the matter confeſſed by Himſelf, and that that information and advice was moſt pernicious, and the riſe of all the miſeries we have ſince undergone, is not denied; and 'tis therefore the more wondred at, that the charge of that guilt being part of the impeachment againſt two great perſons, whoſe bloud they have ſince drunk, that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular was declined in the proſecution of them both; and that though it be enough known by whoſe falſe informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inſtigation that unfortunate counſell was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, extraordinary care hath been taken, that he ſhould not be queſtioned for it, which, together with the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive joy that the principall Actors in theſe late miſchiefs expreſſed at that ſad time, gives men reaſon to conclude, that it was contrived by thoſe who have reaped the fruit and advantage of the error: What the King took from His Subjects by power, which He could not otherwiſe obtain, after that diſſolution is not particularly ſet forth, and therefore it is very probable there was no ground for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116687:18"/>
the calumny, nor indeed was any man a loſer by any ſuch Act of His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>10. Thus far the catalogue reaches of the Kings enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous<note place="margin">Page 20.</note> crimes during the <hi>firſt ſixteen years of His Reigne to the beginning of this Parliament,</hi> in which they confeſſe they proceeded with eaſe, as long as there was any hope, that they would <hi>comply with His Majeſty againſt the Scots,</hi> and give aſſiſtance to that war; but when <hi>He found that hope vaine,</hi> and that they began to queſtion the Authours of thoſe pernicious Counſells, His Majeſty diſcovered Himſelf ſo <hi>ſtrongly and paſsionately affected to malignant Counſellours, and their Councells,</hi> that He would ſooner <hi>deſert and force the Parliament and Kingdome,</hi> then alter His courſe, and deliver up His wicked Counſellours to Law and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>There are not ſo many years expired ſince the beginning of this Parliament, (though it hath been a tedious age of miſery and confuſion) but that all mens memories will recollect and repreſent to them the folly and the falſhood of this Charge: It is not imaginable that the King could expect after the beginning of this Parliament, that it would comply with Him and give Him aſſiſtance in a War againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> when He plainly diſcover'd, that they who were like to be, and afterwards proved, the chief Leaders, and Directors in that Councell, were of the ſame party; and how far He was from ſheltring any Counſellour or Servant from juſtice, or any colourable proceeding of the Law, is as well known: neither did He deny His royall aſſent to any one Bill, till after He was by force &amp; Tumults driven from <hi>White Hall,</hi> and after he had indeed conſented to whatſoever <hi>could be honeſtly asked of Him for the ſecurity and benefit of the Kingdome.</hi>

Parliament any way it ſhould direct; And (as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſaies) if in the managery of this debate, any raſh diſcourſes hapned of bringing up the Army, it is evident whether they were propoſed in earneſt or no, that they were never entertained, and the whole matter was laid aſide, above two Months before any diſcovery, ſo that that danger was never prevented by the power or wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Parliament.</p>

            <p>It is a wonderfull preſumption theſe men have upon the credulity of the people, that they will not examine the truth of any thing they alleage, how eaſie ſoever it is to diſprove them; otherwiſe they would not affirme that at the meeting of Officers at <hi>Burrough-Bridge,</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made, and private inſtructions brought from the King, whereas it appears, by their own evidence, that Capt. <hi>Chudleigh,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to have brought thoſe

            <p>For the diſcourſe of the Prince his meeting the Army, with the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and a body of Horſe, it is<note place="margin">Ex.

It is not imaginable that the King knew not the temper of that time, (which he ſo grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt) well enough, to conclude that the Parliament and the <hi>Scots</hi> were too faſt combined, to be ſever'd for any intereſt of his; and the offer of four Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (a thing ſo confeſſedly out of the King's power to give) is ſo ſenſleſſe a calumny, that no man, out of the higheſt fit of madneſſe can believe it, and they to whom this Offer is ſuppoſed to be made, would in all this time have accuſed the King of it, if they had been able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie any thing like it.</p>
            <p>However it is to be obſerved, that though theſe men hold theſe imaginable overtures and deſignes to be very hainous crimes in the King, they reckon the reducing ſuch deſignes into reall and compleat execution, no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in themſelves; and that though the King may not wiſh His Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſtand <hi>newters</hi> in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between His Majeſty and His Engliſh people, yet it is no fault in them to engage that Nation to aſſiſt them in Armes againſt the Soveraigne of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; and though a curſory diſcourſe by other men of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116687:22"/>
bringing up the Army to awe the Parliament, be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as a breach of truſt againſt the King never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, yet the actuall bringing up an Army upon them, and thereby awing it ſo far, as the driving away many Members, and making thoſe who remained do any thing that Army directs, is no offence in them, either againſt the freedome or priviledge of Parliament.</p>

            <p>15. Now ſucceeds the high Charge of the buſineſſe<note place="margin">Pa. 24.</note> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if they hoped to perſwade the people, that the King is acceſſary to a Treaſon and Rebellion againſt Himſelf; and that in a time when there were ſo great diſtractions in two of His Kingdoms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſhould Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf put the third into a flame, that ſo He might have none to help Him, to quench the fire that was kindled in the other; the particulars out of which this grand Charge is compounded ſhall be ſeverally examined.</p>
            <p>They who have uſed no kind of conſcience or civility in the publiſhing all Letters of His Majeſties, (by what ill means ſoever the ſame have come into their hands) which they imagined might by the ſimplicity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the people, or the moſt malitious gloſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations they could put upon them, beget any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to His Majeſty, cannot be imagined now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale any thing that would contribute to their purpoſe, and therefore their not publiſhing thoſe Letters, which they ſay the King ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> immediately before the Rebellion, is argument ſufficient, that either there were no ſuch Letters, or nothing in them, which can in any ſenſe reflect upon His Majeſty; nor can it find credit with any (not malitiouſly and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly ſottiſh) that after ſo many reiterated infuſions into the people by their ſeverall Declarations that the Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> avowed, that they had a Commiſſiion under the great Seale of <hi>England</hi> for what they did; It is now inverted into a Commiſſion under the great Seale of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Sealed at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> when the King was laſt there;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116687:23"/>
when it is knowne He could no more have affixed that Seale (in whoſe hands ſoever it was) to any ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (if He had had the will, which no Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves He had) then He can now diſpoſe of that at <hi>London,</hi> of which Commiſſion, the world ſhould long ſince have been informed by the <hi>Scots,</hi> if they could have found a probable ground for the Suggeſtion: And ſurely theſe men would have publiſhed the Depoſitions of thoſe, who (they ſay) have ſeen it, if they had believed them ſuch, as would find credit amongſt men.</p>
            <p>What was promiſed to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Committee at <hi>London,</hi> is like to be much better known to the Authours of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> then to His Majeſty, the greater part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being Papiſts, and ſince Active Rebels, having during their ſtay in <hi>London,</hi> ſo great an intereſt in the powerfull and active Members there, that they were able to prevaile with them to interpoſe in the affairs of that Kingdome in ſuch manner as they deſired; and very probably then laid the foundation, and deſigne of their future Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the principles they then ſaw introduced and countenanced here: By the earneſt advice, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate interpoſition of ſome of thoſe principall Members, they prevailed, that after the death of the Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Wansford,</hi> no ſuch perſon might be appointed tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarily to ſucceed, as was like by his power and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to prevent the wickedneſſe they intended; and if the King gave away, or promiſed them more then five Counties, it was not upon their private mediation, but their publique addreſſe according to their inſtructions from the Parliament, after the Houſe of Commons had made the recovery of, and intit'ling His Majeſty to thoſe Counties, a particular Article of their Impeachment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and ſo blemiſhed His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116687:24"/>
juſt and legall intereſt, and what His Majeſty did thereupon, was by the full and deliberate advice of His Councell Board, according to uſuall forms obſerved in the affairs of that Kingdome: It is very probable that His Majeſty might think Himſelf at that time oppreſſed by the two Houſes of Parliament, as He had great cauſe, but that He ſhould expreſſe ſo much, and wiſh that He could be revenged on them, to, or before that Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, whom at that time He had reaſon to believe to be combined with the other, is more then very unlikely.</p>
            <p>The not Disbanding the <hi>Iriſh Army</hi> is next remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and indeed ought not to be forgotten; the not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably diſpoſing that body, giving (no doubt) a great riſe, and contributing much to the Rebellion, that ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after brake out; but where the fault of that was, is as evident.</p>
            <p>That Army was juſtly and prudently raiſed, when the intention in <hi>Scotland</hi> was clearly known to invade <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and with a purpoſe to reſtraine or divert that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and if need were, to reduce that Kingdome to their Allegiance, which was the ſenſe, and could be no other of thoſe words charged upon the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> if any ſuch words were ſpoken: And after the <hi>Scots Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> was entred <hi>England,</hi> it was no wonder if the King were not forward to Disband that Army, till He could diſcerne that the other did in truth intend to return, and He no ſooner was confident of the one, then He reſolved the other; but then He wiſely conſidered that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding ſuch a body at that time, when ſo much licence was tranſplanted out of this, into that Kingdome, was not ſo like to contribute to the peace of it, as the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them; and therefore His Majeſty agreed with the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſadour,</hi> that he ſhould have leave to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116687:24"/>
three or four thouſand of them for his Maſters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which was no ſooner known, but the <hi>Iriſh Committee</hi> then at <hi>London</hi> (who, it may be, had otherwiſe deſign'd the ſervice of thoſe men) prevailed with the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to interpoſe, and hinder the execution of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, who (principally, upon conſideration of the umbrage the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> might take at ſuch an aſſiſtance given to <hi>Spaine</hi>) preſſed the King to revoke that grant, and to conſent to the Disbanding; That ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was eaſily anſwered by His Majeſty, having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed likewiſe with the <hi>French Ambaſſadour,</hi> that the like number ſhould be likewiſe tranſported for <hi>France,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole Army, would have been diſpoſed of; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the <hi>Iriſh Committee</hi> more preſſed then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, alleaging that there were not men in that Kingdome to ſpare: whereupon, the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (by their private Agents) prevailed with the <hi>French Ambaſſadour</hi> (who more deſired to hinder the ſupply for <hi>Spaine,</hi> then to procure the like for his Maſter, and it may be, to ſee the King controlled by the Parliament then either of the other) to releaſe the King of His promiſe to him, ſo that they would prevent the <hi>Spaniard's</hi> having any men; And thereupon they re-inforced their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to the King for the preſent Disbanding, and not ſending any of that Army out of <hi>Ireland</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as His Majeſty was forced to yeild to it; and thereby (no queſtion) much was contributed to the opportunity and diſpoſition of rebelling; and to whoſe account that advantage is to be put, all the world may judge: yet it may be fit to obſerve, that of that <hi>Iriſh Army</hi> (which theſe men would have believed to be no leſſe then a <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem</hi> againſt the Proteſtant Religion) not one Officer above the quality of Captaine, and not above two of

to all Chriſtians, by which in this diſtraction, ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might poſſibly inſue to His Majeſties Perſon and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, as He was well aſſured his Houſe of Commons would uſe their utmoſt endevours to prevent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſaid, <hi>He expected that they ſhould name thoſe perſons,</hi> who by his Licence had paſſed into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and were there in the head of the Rebels; or that if upon their examination they did not find particular evidence to prove that aſperſion (as <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was confident they never could) as that affirmation which did reflect upon <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was very publick; ſo they would publiſh ſuch a Declaration whereby that miſtake might be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> being moſt tender in that particular, which had reference to <hi>Ireland,</hi> as being moſt aſſured, that he had been and was from his Soule reſolved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his duty (which God would require at his hands) for the relief of his poore Proteſtant Subjects there, and the utter rooting out that Rebellion.</p>
            <p>It was above a Month before the King could receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Anſwer from them, and then they ſaid, <hi>that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 117.</note> 
               <hi>they had affirmed nothing, but what they had cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was true,</hi> and preſented ſome of their grounds to <hi>His Majeſty;</hi> one of which was, <hi>that thoſe Licences gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the perſons under reſtraint were apt to produce ſuch an effect as was mentioned in that poſitive affirmation;</hi> and another ground was, <hi>that His Majeſty could not be aſſured, that no other did paſſe upon his Licence, and they had cauſe to believe, that ſome did, becauſe they received ſuch generall Information:</hi> which reaſons (with ſome other of the ſame kind) they ſaid, they hoped would be ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>His Majeſty</hi> to believe, that as they had ſome cauſe to give credit to the ſaid Informations, ſo they had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to make any ill uſe of them to <hi>His Majeſties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:116687:29"/>
but did impute the blame to his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>The King replied again to that Meſſage, <hi>That there</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pa. 18.</note> 
               <hi>was nothing yet declared, that would be a ground for what Mr.</hi> Pim <hi>had ſo boldly affirmed, for yet there was not any particular perſon named, that was ſo much as in rebellion, much leſſe in the head of the Rebels to whom His Majeſty had given Licence, and therefore. He expected, that the Houſe of Commons ſhould publiſh ſuch a Declaration, whereby that miſtake might be cleared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since that time to the houre of the publiſhing this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, they have never made the leaſt addreſſe, or given the leaſt information or ſatisfaction to <hi>His Majeſty</hi> in that particular, which they then ſaid <hi>they had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make uſe of to his diſ-honour;</hi> ſo that this laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption could proceed only from a confidence that the people would believe what they ſaid, not examine the truth of it.</p>
            <p>What they mean <hi>by the Commanders and Officers, whom the King</hi> (they ſay) <hi>called off from their truſt againſt the Rebels; and Ships from their guards at Sea, that ſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels might be ſupplied with forain aides,</hi> is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, except by the Ships they meane thoſe under the command of Captain <hi>Kittleby,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Stradling,</hi> who then attended the Iriſh Coaſt, when all <hi>his Majeſties Fleet</hi> was ſeized by the two Houſes, and imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him, and whom <hi>His Majeſty</hi> upon that occaſion, and confidence of the Loyalty of the Commanders, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to attend Him with their Ships about <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> or the North of <hi>England,</hi> that He might have two of his owne Ships at his diſpoſall, and at the ſame time (that any inconvenience might be prevented by the comming of ſupply to the Rebels) His Majeſty gave notice to the two Houſes of his command in that particular, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116687:30"/>
them to take care for the guarding of that Coaſt, which they altogether neglected; notwithſtanding that they found meanes likewiſe to ſeize thoſe two Ships, which <hi>His Majeſty</hi> hoped He ſhould have been poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of.</p>
            <p>Nor is it better underſtood what they mean by <hi>ſupplies from the Earle of</hi> Antrim <hi>and Lord</hi> Aboyne, <hi>or of Armes and Ammunition from the King's Magazines, or from the Queen,</hi> which no ſober man believes, or of which no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or inſtance hath ſo much as been offered: Some few Suits of clothes in the beginning of the War were taken by the Kings Souldiers about <hi>Coventry,</hi> when that City was in open Rebellion, which they pretended were prepared for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and which <hi>His Majeſty</hi> did what could be done to cauſe to be reſtored, but it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and was apparently their fault, that would not ſend for a ſafe conduct, when they were to paſſe through <hi>His Majeſties</hi> Quarters.</p>
            <p>And how far the King was from conſenting to, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving that Action, appears by <hi>His Majeſties</hi> expreſſe Command (which was executed accordingly) for the tranſporting into <hi>Ireland</hi> of three thouſand Suites of<note place="margin">Ex.

            <p>
               <hi>His Maty</hi> never denied <hi>any Pieces of Battery deſired by the Councell of Ireland,</hi> nor is there the leaſt colour to affirm the ſame; what directions the Rebels give in their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Mart, or whether they gave any ſuch directions as are alleaged, is no way materiall as to <hi>His Majeſty;</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116687:30"/>
for Officers and Commanders, who left their truſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rebels, it is ſufficiently known, that the Earle of <hi>Leven,</hi> who by <hi>His Majeſties</hi> conſent was ſent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the Rebels, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from thence to lead an Army into <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>His Majeſty;</hi> and when the King's Commiſſioners at the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> alleaged and complained, that many Officers both <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in the beginning of that War left that Service, and been entertained by the two Houſes againſt the King, all the Anſwer they could receive was, <hi>That they were not ſent for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the caſe (as without any poſſibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction it is) theſe Gentlemen had no more reaſon to believe the Rebels, when they did ſo often ſwear they did nothing without good authority and Commiſſion from the King, then the Rebels had to believe them, when they ſwore on the 22. of <hi>October, 1642. That no private paſsion</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 663.</note> 
               <hi>or reſpect, no evill intention to His Majeſties perſon, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to the prejudice of His juſt honour and authority, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to raiſe Forces,</hi> and the next day gave <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> battle at <hi>Edge-hill:</hi> Nor is it more materiall, that Sir <hi>Phelim Oneale</hi> would not be perſwaded, that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Laeſly</hi> had any authority from the King againſt the Rebels, then that theſe Gentlemen ſhould be perſwaded in the ſame houre to believe that an Army ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the ſafety of the King's perſon, and to ſweare that they would live and die with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 457.</note> they nominated Generall to lead that Army againſt the King.</p>
            <p>What information was given divers Months before to the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and others of the Kings Councel, <hi>of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne amongst the Papiſts for a generall Maſſacre of all the Proteſtants in</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no objection
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116687:31"/>
againſt the King, and as the Archbiſhop was impriſoned divers Months before that Rebellion brake out, ſo it is not like, if they had been able to have charged Him with any concealment, that they would have forborn accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him with it at his Triall, when they ſo much wanted evidence againſt him, that they were faine to make his Chaplains not licencing ſuch Books againſt Popery, as they thought did diſcredit the Proteſtant cauſe, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his Treaſon; and they would likewiſe now have named the others of the King's Counſell, if they could have alleaged any matter, that could have reflected upon them or their Maſter.</p>
            <p>Next follows a huddle of the <hi>Kings Letters to the Pope,</hi> when he was in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of others ſince on the behalfe of the <hi>Duke of Lorainge,</hi> and of the <hi>King's having an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent at Rome</hi> (which it is knowne he never had) ſome Months before the Iriſh Rebellion: all which are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely mentioned, and ſo ridiculous, as to any charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, that they are not worthy any Anſwer; yet becauſe (how impertinently ſoever) by the licence of theſe times, much hath been ſcandalouſly diſcourſed of a Letter written by the King, when he was Prince, and in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to the Pope, and ſuch a Letter tranſlated &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, out of a Copy publiſhed in the French Mercury, it may not be amiſſe to ſay ſomewhat of that buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>The Prince being by the command of his Father ſent into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to conclude a Marriage with the Daughter of that Crowne, which had been long treated of, could not but be obliged, whilſt he was there, to perform all Ceremonies which were requiſite to the compaſſing the buſineſſe he went about; The Kingdome where he was, had a faſt friendſhip with <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuch a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, that a diſpenſation from thence was thought
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:116687:31"/>
neceſſary by the wiſdome of that State to the marriage in treaty, towards the procuring whereof, though the Prince would not contribute the leaſt application of his owne, yet he was not reaſonably to do any thing, which might make that diſpenſation the more difficult to be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; The Pope that then was, writ a Letter to the Prince, which was delivered to his Highneſſe, by his Miniſter there reſident; It was a Letter of reſpect, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of that State, of great kindneſſe; and it would have been thought a very unſeaſonable neglect, if the Prince had vouchſafed it no Anſwer: on the other hand, it was eaſier to reſolve, that it was fit to write, then what; in the mean time, they who were officious that it might be done, prepared the draught of a Letter, and brought it to him; the which, when his Highneſſe had peruſed with his own hand, he expunged thoſe clauſes, which might ſeem to reflect upon the Religion which he profeſſed, and having ſo altered and mended it, he cauſed it to be ſent to the Pope; Copies of the firſt draught were ſpread abroad, by which that was inſerted in the French Mercury, (which is ſo carefully tranſlated and printed, and diſperſed theſe late ill years) and now is given in evidence againſt <hi>His Majeſty:</hi> But admitting it were the ſame, and that the Prince being in a forain Kingdom, (with the policy whereof he was then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply) had written that very Letter, which is printed, with what colour of reaſon can any man make that an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his inclination to Popery, who at that time, and ever ſince hath given the greateſt teſtimony of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Proteſtant Religion, that any Prince or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon hath done? The Authours of this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would not think it juſt, that from their very loving Letters to the <hi>Baſhaw at Argyers,</hi> and his to them, in

which <hi>He thanks God that the Agent of the Parliament of England is come thither to make a peace and love betwixt them to the end of the world,</hi> as appears by the relation of that buſineſſe <hi>fol.</hi> 15. publiſhed by their authority, and from the amity with them, to that Degree, that they have given the Turkes men-of-war the freedome of their Harbours, men ſhould conclude, that they are reſolved to turn Turkes, and yet ſuch a concluſion will more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſult from thoſe Letters, and that ſtrict corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, then of the King's affection to Popery from that Letter to the Pope.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that the ſame deſigne was laid in <hi>England</hi> at the ſame time, and that many thouſands were appointed to cut the Proteſtants throats in this Kingdom alſo, when the King went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that it was confeſſed by ſome of the principall Rebels, that their Popiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee with the King, had communicated that deſigne with many Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> by whoſe advice (though ſome things were altered, yet) it was generally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that about the ſame time, there ſhould be the like proceedings of the Papiſts here; all which if true, (as no ſober man believes it to be) does no way reflect upon the King; and that Popiſh Committee was ſent more to the two Houſes, then to the King, and were more owned by them, who tooke ſpeciall care for their Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>By what is ſaid, it ſufficiently appears, how unjuſt and unreaſonable all the <hi>particular Scandals</hi> are, with relation to the buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which <hi>His Majeſty</hi> (how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently ſoever He hath been aſperſed) never did any, or omitted the doing any thing, but according to thoſe rules, which are moſt juſtifiable before God and man; it were to be wiſhed that the two Houſes of Parliament had
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116687:33"/>
but as well performed their duty, and obligations; but it cannot be forgotten, that neer the beginning of this Rebellion, when the Houſes pretended wonderfull dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to raiſe men for that Service, and when a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſupply would utterly have broken and defeated the Rebels, the King ſent a Meſſage to them on the 28 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 33.</note> 1641. That <hi>His Majeſty being very ſenſible of the great miſeries and distreſſes of His Subjects in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of</hi> Ireland <hi>which daily increaſed, and the bloud which had been already ſpilt, by the cruelty and barbarouſneſſe of thoſe Rebels, crying out ſo loud; and perceiving how ſlowly the ſuccours deſigned thither went on, His Majeſty Himſelf would take care, that by Commiſsions (which He would grant) ten thouſand Engliſh Voluntiers ſhould be ſpeedily raiſed for that ſervice, if the Houſe of Commons would declare, that they would pay them:</hi> which offer from His Majeſty was rejected, and no conſiderable ſupplies ſent till they had compelled His Majeſty to conſent to ſuch a Bill for Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as might deveſt and rob Him of a neceſſary and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall power inherent in His Crowne.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be forgotten, that they reſerved thoſe men, which were raiſed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and would not otherwiſe have been engaged in their Service, but on that pretence, and brought them to fight againſt His Majeſty at <hi>Edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> and afterwards retained them ſtill in their Service; That they imployed the mony, raiſed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and with a particular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it ſhould be imployed no other way, for the ſupport and maintenance of that Army led by the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> againſt the King, and that from the beginning of the Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> (though they received vaſt ſums of mony raiſed only for <hi>Ireland</hi>) they never admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred any conſiderable ſupply thither, that they could

apply to the advancement of their owne Deſignes at home againſt the King.</p>
            <p>Theſe particulars (of which kind every man may call to mind many more) nor their notable compliance with the Iriſh Committee, when they came firſt over, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, to imply that the two Houſes of Parliament were guilty of raiſing the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> (otherwiſe then by their principles, and proceedings in diminution of the King's ſoveraigne power) or that they cheriſhed it after it was begun (otherwiſe then by not wiſely and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly endeavouring to ſuppreſſe it, before it ſpread ſo univerſally) but that which may be juſtly laid to their charge is, their affecting and graſping the power of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on that War, which ſo great a body is not fit for; their imprudent and unpolitique declaring an animoſity againſt the whole Nation, and even a purpoſe for their utter extirpation, and diſpoſing their Lands to thoſe, who would be adventurers for it; which Act and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is known drove many into open Rebellion, who were not before ſuſpected, or at leaſt declared to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the Rebels; and laſtly, their giving all their minds up to the kindling that horrid and monſtrous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion here, rather then to the extinguiſhing the other in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

the Houſes within few daies after raiſed a ſtronger Guard for themſelves, without and againſt the King's Conſent, and with that and other Forces countenanced by that, drove the King from the Towne, is as true and notorious to all the world.</p>
            <p>What is meant by the Fire-works found and taken in Papiſts houſes, is not underſtood, except they intend the Lord <hi>Herbert's</hi> houſe, which being at that time menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and examined, was in the Houſe of Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as an idle bruite, ſome of their principall Members affirming they had been there, and were ſatisfied, that there was nothing in the practice or deſigne, but what was very juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tower</hi> was ſo farre from being filled with new Guards, that there were no new <hi>Guards</hi> put there, till the Houſes took the boldneſſe to doe it; and if the King had made any addition of ſtrength to His own Fort, it would have been no more, then He might well have done: But that the having Granadoes, and all ſorts of Fire-works, Morters and great Pieces of Battery ready prepared in the Tower, ſhould be objected to the King, is wonderfull, ſince it is the proper place, where ſuch Utenſils for war are to be; and if they had been in any other place, it might have adminiſtred ſome occaſion of jealouſie: there were no more pieces of Battery prepared and mounted againſt the City, then had been uſuall and accuſtomed.</p>
            <p>It was in the King's juſt power to remove any man from being Lieutenant of the Tower, whoſe fidelity or affection he ſuſpected or made queſtion of, yet (what juſt reaſon ſoever He had for either) Sir <hi>William Balfore</hi> was removed with his own conſent, and upon ſuch a preſent recompence in mony, as himſelf thought an ample com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation: it is true, ſome factious Citizens (who were

alwaies ready to be applied to any ſeditious action) peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned againſt Sir <hi>John Byron,</hi> who ſucceeded in that Command; and alleaged that their jealouſie was ſuch, that they were forced to forbear the bringing in of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon to the Mint; when in truth there was not one of thoſe who concurred in that Petition, that ever brought Bullyon thither, or uſed thar Trade; and to uſe His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties owne words, it is notoriouſly known, <hi>There was</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 546.</note> 
               <hi>more Bullyon brought into the Mint, in the time, that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was Lieutenant, then in the ſame quantity of time in any mans remembrance:</hi> And ſurely it will be a great brand upon that time, and the City, to poſterity, and an evidence how far they were from lodging Engliſh hearts in their breſts, that they would think themſelves leſſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in Sir <hi>John Byron,</hi> a perſon of Noble Extraction, generous education, unblemiſhed reputation, and a full fortune; then of an indigent Forainer, who had no other Arts to live by, then thoſe of which they juſtly complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and could not ſerve them, without betraying his faith to his Maſter, to whom he was particularly ſworn, and ingaged by infinite Obligations.</p>
            <p>Hitherto they have examined only the errors and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, at leaſt the leſſe raging enormities of the firſt Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or Seventeen years of His Majeſties Reigne, now they are entring into the high waies, where they ſay, <hi>the tract of open force againſt the Parliament and Kingdom did appear more viſible.</hi>

            <p>17. The firſt inſtance is the Charge of <hi>Treaſon againſt</hi>

               <hi>ſome of both Houſes;</hi> and that <hi>unparallel'd Act of violence by the King's coming ſo attended to the Houſe of Commons,</hi> which they ſay was, but <hi>the Prologue to a bloudy Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the tale of the Members did at that time ſerve
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116687:36"/>
their turne, to worke upon the un-skilfull and un-diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing minds of the people, and to apply them to their Service, it was believed they would have now bluſhed to have remembred it, ſince as diſcerning-men were not at that time in any degree ſatisfied of their innocence: ſo all men by the demeanour of thoſe Members afterwards, have concluded that the King had very good reaſon, then, to accuſe them, though it may be the act was not ſo happily deliberated on, as to foreſee thoſe accidents, which might diſturb the progreſſe of it.</p>
            <p>Before any thing be ſaid of the matter it ſelf, how far the King was from doing what was not right, it will not be amiſſe to look back, how far they then imputed this act to the King, which is now ſo principall a part of the Charge againſt Him: After His Majeſty had excepted againſt ſome expreſſions uſed by them of His comming to the Houſe of Commons, as if He had intended vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; in their Petition preſented to Him at <hi>Tiballs,</hi> 1. of<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 93.</note> 
               <hi>March,</hi> 1641. they beſought His Majeſty to believe, that <hi>the dangerous and deſperate deſigne upon the Houſe, was not inſerted with any intention to caſt the leaſt aſpertion upon His Majeſty, but therein they reflected upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant party, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that it ſeems the Houſes then were not of the ſame opinion theſe men are now of.</p>
            <p>For the matter it ſelf, <hi>That any Members of either Houſe may be proſecuted in the ſame manner, as if they were not Members, in the caſe of Treaſon, or Felony, is ſo known a truth, that no man</hi> (who pretends to know the Laws of the Kingdome, or Preſidents of Parliament) <hi>ever thought the contrary,</hi> or heard the contrary ſaid, till ſince the caſe of theſe Members; and the ſame hath been alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in all Parliaments, and may be ſaid to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged<note place="margin">4 Part Inſtit. fol. 25.</note> by this, ſince the Lord chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi>

            <p>That the King had reaſon to accuſe theſe Members of high Treaſon, can be as little doubted, ſince He could make <hi>particular proof againſt them of a ſolemn Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

               <hi>entred into by them for altering the Government of the Church and State; of their ſoliciting and drawing down the Tumults to</hi> Weſtminſter; <hi>and of their bidding the people in the height of their rage and fury to go to</hi> White-hall; <hi>of their ſcornfull and odious mention of His Majeſties Perſon; and their deſigne of getting the Prince into their hands; and of their Treating with Forain power to aſsiſt them, if they ſhould faile in their enterprizes; And why the King's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourny upon theſe reaſons might not as lawfully accuſe thoſe Members of high Treaſon, as the Attourny Generall in the firſt year of this King's Reigne, did accuſe the Earle of</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll <hi>upon a Charge more generall, who was thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower; And why His Majeſty might not as well have expected, that upon his Articles (not ſo generall as a meer verball accuſation) of high Treaſon, either Houſe would have Committed their ſeverall Members, as they had done ſo many this Parliament; and about that time, twelve Biſhops together (upon a confeſſed ground, which every man there, who knew what Treaſon was, knew that fact to be none) meerly, becauſe they were accuſed, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty (upon occaſion of mentioning this paſſage) ſaies, He could neither then, nor yet can understand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the caſe, there remains nothing but His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties own going to the Houſe of Commons, for which, hear His own words in His Anſwer to the Declaration of the 19. of <hi>May,</hi> where that matter was loudly laid to

His charge: <hi>When We reſolved, that it was fit for Our own</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 245.</note> 
               <hi>ſafety and honour, and the peace of the Kingdome, to proceed againſt thoſe perſons, though We well know there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of priviledge in that caſe, yet (to ſhew Our deſire of correſpondence with the two Houſes of Parliament) We choſe rather then to apprehend thoſe perſons by the ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Juſtice (which according to the opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of former times We might have done) to command Our Attourny generall to acquaint Our Houſe of Peers with Our intention, and the generall matters of Our Charge (which was yet more particular then a meer Accuſation) and to proceed accordingly; and at the ſame time ſent a ſworn Servant, a Sergeant at Armes to Our Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to acquaint them, that We did accuſe, and intended to proſecute the five Members of that Houſe for high Treaſon; and did require that their perſons might be ſecured in cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; This We did, not only to ſhew that We intended, not to violate or invade their Priviledges, but uſe more ceremony towards them, then We conceived, in juſtice might be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Us, and expected at leaſt ſuch an Anſwer, as might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Us, if We were out of the way: But We received none at all, only in the inſtant, without offring any thing of their Priviledges to Our conſideration, an Order was made, and the ſame night publiſhed in print, That if any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould offer to arreſt the perſon of any Member of that Houſe, without firſt acquainting that Houſe therewith, and receiving further order of that Houſe, That it ſhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for ſuch Members, or any perſon to aſsiſt them, and to ſtand upon his or their guard of defence, and to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance according to the Protestation taken to defend the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament; and this was the firſt time we heard the Proteſtation might be wreſted to ſuch a ſence, or that in any caſe (though of the moſt undoubted and unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:116687:38"/>
priviledge) it might be lawfull for any perſon to reſiſt, and to uſe violence againſt a publique Miniſter of Juſtice, armed with lawfull authority: though we well know, that even ſuch a Miniſter might be puniſhed for executing ſuch authority: Upon viewing this Order, we muſt confeſſe We were ſomewhat amazed, having neither ſeen nor heard of the like before, though We had known Members of either Houſe Committed, without ſo much formality, as We had uſed, and upon crimes of a far inferiour nature to thoſe We had ſuggeſted: And having no courſe propoſed to Us for Our proceeding, We were upon the matter onely told that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe perſons, We were not to proceed at all, that they were above Our reach of the Law: It was not eaſie for Us to reſolve what to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if We imployed Our Miniſters of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the uſuall way for their apprehenſion (who without doubt would not have refuſed to have executed Our lawfull Commands) We ſaw what reſiſtance and oppoſition was like to be made, which very probable might coſt ſome bloud; if We ſate ſtill, and deſiſted upon this terrour, We ſhould at the beſt have confeſſed Our owne want of Power, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law; in this ſtrait We put on a ſudden reſolution, to try, whether Our own preſence and clear diſcovery of Our intentions (which haply might not have been ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) could remove thoſe doubts, and prevent thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which ſeemed to be threatned: And thereupon We reſolved to go in Our Perſon to Our Houſe of Commons, which we diſcovered not till the minute of our going, when We ſent out, That Our Servants and ſuch Gentlemen as were then in Our Court, ſhould attend Us to</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>but giving them expreſſe command, that no accidents or provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould draw them to any ſuch Action, as might imply a purpoſe of force in Us, and Our ſelf (requiring thoſe of Our traine not to come within the Dore) went into the Houſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:116687:38"/>
of Commons, the bare doing of which, We did not conceive would have been thought more a breach of priviledge, then if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We had then gone to the Houſe of Peers, and ſent for them to come to Us, which is the uſuall cuſtome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was His Majeſties Anſwer formerly to this Charge, which is therefore here inſerted at large, as being ſo full, that nothing need be added; and it appeared by the Depoſition of <hi>Barnard Aſhly,</hi> and others taken by them, that the King gave His Traine expreſſe and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive charge, that <hi>they ſhould give no offence or ill word to any body, what provocation ſoever they met with;</hi> which Depoſitions were carefully ſuppreſſed, and concealed, whilſt they made uſe of the teſtimony of indigent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Fellows, to reproach His Majeſty, from ſome light and unadviſed diſcourſe, which was pretended to be uttered by ſome young Gentlemen, who had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Traine.</p>
            <p>To conclude, it is to be obſerved, that though it were ſo high a tranſgreſſion in the King, (againſt whom Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can onely be committed) to prefer ſuch a Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt five Members of the Houſe of Commons, who were called together by His Writ, and accountable to Him for any breach of Duty, that it did abſolve them from their Allegiance, yet the preferring the like Charge<note place="margin">1 Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the 11 Members.</note> ſince againſt <hi>Eleven Members</hi> by the Army, raiſed and maintained by them, and to which they were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable for any thing they did, hath been held no crime; and it may be no ill exerciſe for thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who with ſuch high contempt of that Soveraigne power, to which they owed their allegiance, took delight to deſpiſe and reſiſt <hi>His Majeſties</hi> juſt Authority, now in their affliction, reſtraint, and baniſhment to conſider the hand of God upon them, which hath compelled
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:116687:39"/>
them to ſubmit to the mercenary power raiſed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuppreſſe their King; That though they broke<note place="margin">1 Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the 5 Members.</note> through the Kings Article, for endeavouring to ſubvert the fundamentall Laws and Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to deprive the King of His legall power, and to place on Subjects, an Arbitrary and tyrannicall power: yet they could not break through the Charge of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for invading, infringing, or endeavouring to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects of this Nation, in arbitrary, violent, and oppreſſing waies, and for endeavouring by indirect and corrupt practiſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and obſtruct Juſtice, to the great damage and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of divers of the poor Commoners of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though they were too mighty to be touched upon the<note place="margin">2 Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the 5 Members.</note> Kings accuſation, of having endeavoured by many foule aſperſions upon <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> and His Government, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate the affections of His people, and to make <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the 11 Members.</note> odious to them; yet they were not able to bear the burthen of an Accuſation of having endeavoured by falſe informations, miſ-repreſentations, or ſcandalous ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions againſt the Army, to beget miſ-underſtandings, prejudices, or jealouſies in the Parliament againſt the Army, and to put inſufferable injuries, abuſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations upon the Army, whereby to provoke and put the Army into diſ-temper.</p>
            <p>Though they ſlighted the King's Charge of having<note place="margin">4 Artic. againſt 5 Members.</note> trayterouſly invited and incouraged a forain power to invade <hi>His Majeſties</hi> Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> yet they cannot throw off the Charge from the Army, of having invited the <hi>Scots,</hi> and other forain Forces to come into<note place="margin">4 Artic. againſt 11 Members.</note> this Kingdome in a hoſtile manner, to abet and aſſiſt them in the proſecution and effecting of their deſignes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, they may with their eyes, hands, and hearts lift
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:116687:39"/>
up to Heaven, remember how they contemned and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">6 Artic. againſt 5 Members.</note> the King, when he charged them, that they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured (as far as in them lay) by force and terrour to compell the Parliament to joyne with them in their tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous deſignes, and to that end had actually raiſed, and countenanced Tumults againſt the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And now their owne Army whereof very many then aſſiſted them in thoſe Tumults to drive away the<note place="margin">5 Artic. againſt 11 Members.</note> King, and the Members of both Houſes, accuſes them of having invited, incouraged, abetted, or countenanced divers Reformadoes and other Officers and Souldiers, tumultuouſly and violently to gather together at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> to affright and aſſault the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in paſſing to and from the Houſe; to offer violence to the Houſe it ſelf; and by ſuch violence, outrages, and threats, to awe and inforce the Parliament.</p>
            <p>As the Charge allowed, and countenanced now from their owne Army, is upon the matter the ſame, which was with ſo much noiſe and inſolence rejected, when it was preſented from the King, and is now objected againſt Him as a hainous crime, ſo with reference to their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges (which, like the <hi>Logitians line,</hi> is <hi>diviſibilis in ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diviſibilia,</hi> and ſerves their turne, to inable them to aske any thing from the King they think fit to demand, and to refuſe any thing to Him He requires from them) the progreſſe and proceedings thereupon, hath been very different; in ſtead of ſuſpending and diſcountenancing them upon the King's accuſation, they are brought in triumph with an Army to the Houſe; the Army upon the bare exhibiting their generall Articles, require that the perſons impeached, may be forthwith ſuſpended from ſitting in the Houſe, and will receive no deniall, it muſt be conſented to, for they will not indure, that the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116687:40"/>
perſons impeached by them ſhall continue in power and capacity to obſtruct due proceedings againſt themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Decl. and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, p. 52.</note> and for their own eſcape from juſtice to threaten ruine to the whole Nation, as by the Letter from the Army of the 21. of <hi>June,</hi> appears.</p>
            <p>The King was checked upon the matter of Priviledge, and then imperiouſly required to ſend the evidence, which He had againſt thoſe He had accuſed, to the Houſe, where they principally governed, and could eaſily judge what was ſecure for themſelves; His Majeſty deſired, <hi>that before His proofs were diſcovered againſt them, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 56.</note> 
               <hi>leſt a new miſtake ſhould breed more delaies, it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, whether His Majeſty were bound in reſpect of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to proceed againſt them by impeachment in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or whether He were at liberty to prefer an Indictment againſt them at Common Law, in the uſuall way, or had His choice;</hi> to which they would give no other Anſwer, then that <hi>they deſired Him to give directions, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be informed before Friday next, what proof there was againſt them, that accordingly they might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a legall triall, it being the undoubted right and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament, that no Member of Parliament can be proceeded againſt without the conſent of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army tells them plainly, by their Letter of the 25. of <hi>June, That they wiſh the name of Priviledges, may not lie in ballance with the Safety of a Kingdome, and the reality of doing juſtice; which (as they had ſaid too often) they could not expect whilſt the perſons they had accuſed, were the Kingdomes and their Judges.</hi> And in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of the Army of the 23. of June, <hi>that no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges ought to protect wicked men, in doing wrong to particulars, or miſchief to the publick; and that whoever moſt adores or tenders thoſe priviledges, will beſt expreſſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:116687:40"/>
his Zeale towards them, in taking care they be not abaſed or extended to private wrong and publique miſchief,</hi> for they ſay, <hi>they clearly find, and all wiſe men may ſee it, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament priviledges as well as Royall prerogative, may be perverted &amp; abuſed, to the deſtruction of thoſe greater ends, for whoſe protection and preſervation they were admitted, or intended</hi> (viz.) <hi>the Rights and Liberties of the people, and ſafety of the whole; and in caſe they be ſo, the abuſe, evill, or danger of them, is no leſſe to be contended againſt, and a remedy thereof no leſſe to be endeavoured, then of the other:</hi> And upon theſe grounds they conclude, that <hi>they ſhall be</hi>
               <note place="margin">Decl. and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, p. 67.</note> 
               <hi>inforced to take ſuch courſes extraordinary, as God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and direct them to, unleſſe by Thurſday night next they receive aſſurance and ſecurity to themſelves and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for a more ſafe and hopefull proceeding in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, by having thoſe things granted, which before they inſiſted on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe have been the proceedings of late in the point of accuſing Members, and in the caſe of Priviledge, all which are ſo far juſtified by the Houſes, <hi>that the Army hath received publique thanks and approbation for all that they have done,</hi> and their accuſations have been received, countenanced, and promoted, and their deſires granted againſt the perſons they accuſed, ſo that as the King did nothing in the accuſation of thoſe Members, but what was juſtifiable by the Law, and former Preſidents of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo whatſoever He did is ſince juſtified by the later Preſidents, which themſelves have conſented to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; And ſo we return to the place from whence this conſideration carried us.</p>
            <p>There is a mention of the Lord <hi>Digby's</hi> appearing in a War-like manner, and afterwards his going beyond the Seas, and from thence giving advice to the King to retire
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:116687:41"/>
to ſome ſtrong place, &amp;c. which are all ſo well known, have been ſo often anſwered, and have ſo little reference to the King, that time is not to be waſted to reply to them.</p>
            <p>18. The next Charge is, <hi>the Commiſsions granted to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> 
               <hi>the Earle of</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>and Colonel</hi> Legg, <hi>for attempting</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>and</hi> Hull, <hi>which</hi> (they ſay) <hi>occaſioned them to provide for their ſecurity;</hi> to which their intelligence of <hi>forain Forces from Denmark contributed;</hi> and then they take great paines to make that <hi>jealouſie of Denmarke</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and fit to ſink into them.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſions granted by the King to the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Legg,</hi> were no other then by Law He might grant; neither did He grant any ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He was aſſured the leading Members in the Houſe of Commons had it in their purpoſe to procure an Order for the ſeizing that Towne, and after they had cauſed a power to be placed about the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> both by land and water under the Command of their new Officer <hi>Skippon,</hi> who was required not to ſuffer any proviſions to be brought in thither by what Authority or Warrant ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>If there had been any expectation, or apprehenſion of forain Forces to be brought from <hi>Denmarke,</hi> that could be no warrant for them to ſeize on <hi>Hull,</hi> without and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King's leave, whoſe peculiar juriſdiction and right it is, to provide againſt forain Invaſions; but as that diſcourſe of Forces from <hi>Denmarke,</hi> was then looked upon as moſt ridiculous by all men of ſenſe, ſo experience hath ſince made it apparent, that there was not the leaſt colour for it: And the arrivall of that Veſſell with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Armes (for there came no Commanders in her) near <hi>Hull,</hi> was near ſix Months after the Houſes

had put a Garriſon into <hi>Hull,</hi> and neer three Months after Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> had ſhut the Gates of it againſt His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; and if it had not been for that rebellious Act, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Armes had not been ſent.</p>
            <p>The Invaſion of the King of <hi>Denmark's</hi> Dominions by the <hi>Swedes</hi> was above two years after the ſeizing of <hi>Hull,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that could not be any interruption to that deſigne, if it had been intended; but that a frivolous report of a diſcourſe between a Servant of the Lord <hi>Digby's,</hi> (that was never na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) with a Mariner, whom he had never ſeen before, to conduct a <hi>Fleet</hi> into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Denmarke;</hi> or an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Letter from the <hi>Hague</hi> to Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which is pretended to be written the 26 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Edge-hill;</hi> and in which is mention of Armes for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and for fifteen hundred Horſe ſhould be thought of moment to juſtifie a rebellious jealouſie of the King's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of countenancing an Invaſion of His owne Kingdome, is below the folly and ſottiſhneſſe of any, to whom ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ought to be applied.</p>
            <p>The imploying of Colonel <hi>Cockram</hi> to the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> was after the Rebellion was begun, and when the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was marching with his Army againſt His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the principall inſtruction given to him, was to preſſe that King to aſſiſt His Majeſty, with Mony, Armes, and Ammunition, (the two Houſes having ſeized all which belonged to His Majeſty) and that the ſame might be ſent by ſome Ships of that Crowne, becauſe all the King's owne were taken from Him, and lay in wait to intercept any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that ſhould be ſent to His Majeſty; and it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the King indevoured by His inſtructions to His Agent, to make His Uncle of <hi>Denmarke</hi> as ſenſible as he could of the injuries and indignities offered to His Majeſty; nor was that very clauſe (with which theſe wicked men ſo inſolently and rudely reproach His Majeſty) without good grounds, it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116687:42"/>
being known that they ordinarily whiſper'd many things then in their private Caballs, which they durſt not publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avow; of which nature were their diſcourſes of the Death of King <hi>James,</hi> which they are now grown up to the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to publiſh, and the other which was mentioned in that inſtruction.</p>
            <p>They ſay <hi>they repeat this rather, becauſe when they declared their intelligence, that</hi> Cockram <hi>was ſent into</hi> Denmarke <hi>to procure Forces thence,</hi> the King diſavowed it, calling it <hi>a vile ſcandall</hi> in His Anſwer to their Decl. of the 22 of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1642.</p>
            <p>Their charge upon the King in that Declaration of the 22 of <hi>Octob.</hi> was, <hi>That Sir</hi> John Henderſon <hi>and Colonel</hi> Cockram <hi>(men of ill report both for Religion and Honeſty) were ſent to</hi> Hanborough <hi>and</hi> Denmarke, <hi>as they were credibly informed, to raiſe Forces there, and to bring them to</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>and to joyne with the Earle of</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this the King made<note place="margin">Ex. Coll. p. 670.</note> Anſwer, <hi>That He had never greater cauſe to be confident of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in His owne Subjects, and therefore He could not believe ſo vile a ſcandall could make any impreſsion in ſober men:</hi> And it is known He did deſire no other aide or ſupply at that time from <hi>Denmarke,</hi> or from any of his Allies, but Mony, Armes, and Ammunition, but if He had not been confident in the ſecurity of His owne Subjects, He would have been juſtly to be blamed, if He had not endeavoured to get any forain ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to preſerve Himſelf, His Crowne, and the Kingdome from being over-run and ſubdued by the power and ſtrength of His rebellious Subjects.</p>
            <p>In the ſame inſtructions to <hi>Cockram,</hi> they ſay, <hi>the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that He then expected aſsistance from His neighbour Princes and Allyes, in particular the greateſt part of the States Fleet from Holland:</hi> which if it were truly ſet forth, needs no Anſwer, it being very reaſonable that the King ſhould have expected that all His neighbour Princes and Allyes ſhould have aſſiſted Him againſt ſo odious and horrid a Rebellion,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:116687:42"/>
and it may be many of them may live to find the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie of not being ſenſible of the aſſault, which hath been made upon Soveraignty, eſpecially, if in ſtead of aſſiſting the King, they have contributed toward the oppreſſing the Regall power; but theſe men are ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to ingenuity, that in the very repeating, what hath been ſaid or done by the King, they will leave out any words that will make the ſenſe otherwiſe underſtood, then fits their purpoſe, though any man that will take the pains to examine it, will quickly find the truth; ſo they who will peruſe theſe inſtructions (by what means ſoever they came by them) publiſhed by themſelves, will find that the King mentioned the <hi>Holland Fleet</hi> only, <hi>as</hi>
               <note place="margin">King's Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, p. 41.</note> 
               <hi>allowed by the States to give Her Majeſty a Convoy into England,</hi> which theſe men would have underſtood, as lent to aſſiſt the King againſt His rebellious Subjects; whereas it is too well known, that at that time the two Houſes found more reſpect and aſſiſtance from thoſe States, then His Majeſty did; and what His Majeſty then ſaid of His neighbour Princes and Allyes (which they would perſwade the people to relate to ſome preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement from them to ſend Forces to Him) being only grounded upon His reaſonable hope of the ſenſe thoſe Princes would have of the indignities offered to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, His words being, <hi>He expects and hopes that all His neighbour Princes and Allyes, will not look upon ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Precedent to their owne Crownes and Monarchies, without contributing to ſuppreſſe this ſo pernicious a deſigne begun in this Kingdome:</hi> God forgive thoſe Princes who ſuffered His Majeſty to be deceived in ſo juſt and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an expectation.</p>
            <p>It is here likewiſe to be remembred, that the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 635.</note> had diſpatched their Agent <hi>Strickland</hi> to the <hi>States</hi> of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:116687:43"/>
the united Provinces, to invite them to their amity and aſſiſtance, and to decline their League with His Majeſty, before Colonel <hi>Cockram</hi> was ſent for <hi>Denmarke,</hi> their Declaration to thoſe Provinces bearing date the 8 of <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctober,</hi> which was before the time that <hi>Cockram</hi> went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Denmarke.</hi>

            <p>19. The <hi>Queens</hi> going into <hi>Holland,</hi> is next objected<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> to the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>that contrary to His truſt He ſent the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jewels of the Crowne of</hi> England, <hi>to be pawned or ſold for Ammunition and Armes, of which,</hi> they ſay, <hi>they had certain knowledge before they took up Armes; and that they had not ſo much as once asked the Militia, till the Queen was going for</hi> Holland; <hi>and that Her going beyond Sea was ſtayed, many Months before Her going into</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>by their motions to the King, becauſe (amongſt other reaſons) they had heard, that She had packed up the Crowne Jewels, by which they might ſee what was then intended by that Iourney, had not they prevented it till the Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are very unwilling to agree upon the <hi>time when they firſt took up Armes,</hi> and would have their <hi>ſeizing upon the King's Forts, poſſeſsing themſelves of the Militia of the Kingdome, of the Royall Navy,</hi> to be thought only an exerciſe of their Soveraigne power, and no taking up of Armes; but though they could perſwade the world that their countenancing and bringing downe the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, by which they firſt drove away many Members from the Houſes, and then the King Himſelf from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> was not taking up Armes, becauſe there was no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Act of both Houſes to bring downe thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, yet ſure they cannot deny their <hi>marching out of the City with all the Trained bands of</hi> London <hi>in a hoſtile manner to</hi> Weſtminſter, where both Houſes gave the chief Officers thanks, approved what they had done,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116687:43"/>
undertook to ſave them harmleſſe, and appointed a new Officer of their own to Command thoſe Traine bands, which was on the 11 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1641. to be taking up Armes.</p>
            <p>When they appointed the next day their own new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer <hi>Skippon</hi> to beſiege the <hi>Tower of London,</hi> with the City Forces, by land and water, and not ſuffer any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to be carried thither, when the King's Lieutenant was in it, and declared, <hi>that whoſoever ſhould trouble him for ſo doing, was an Enemy to the Common-wealth,</hi> which was accordingly executed by him; they muſt confeſſe undoubtedly that they took up Armes; and both theſe high actions (which by the expreſſe Statute of the 25 year of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. are High Treaſon) were before any one <hi>Iewell</hi> belonging to the Crowne or the King, was carried out of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>For the time of asking the <hi>Militia,</hi> though no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time could make it juſtifiable (not to ſpeak of the Bill preferred to that purpoſe many Months before) the Houſe of Commons by their Petition of the 26 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> after the Houſe of Peers had refuſed to concur with them in ſo diſ-loyall a ſuit, <hi>deſired His Majeſty to put the Tower of</hi> London <hi>and the principall Forts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the whole</hi> Militia, <hi>into ſuch hands as they thought fit;</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> went not into <hi>Holland</hi> till the 23 of <hi>February,</hi> neither was her journy reſolved on till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that Month; ſo that their aſſertion of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much as asked the <hi>Militia</hi> till the Queen was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Holland</hi> is utterly untrue, and when they were made acquainted of ſuch Her Majeſties purpoſe, they never in the leaſt degree diſſwaded it.</p>
            <p>But what was the <hi>Queens</hi> going into <hi>Holland,</hi> and the <hi>King's</hi> ſending with Her the <hi>Iewels</hi> of the Crown, to their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116687:44"/>
taking Armes? The <hi>Queen</hi> might very well go to any place the <hi>King</hi> thought fit She ſhould go, &amp; the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> (being at that time to go into <hi>Holland</hi> to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) His Maj. thought it fit that the <hi>Queens Maj.</hi> ſhould accompany Her Daughter thither: And for the Jewels of the Crowne (though moſt of the Jewels carried over by the Queen, were Her owne proper goods) let them ſhew any Law, that the King may not diſpoſe of thoſe Jewels for the ſafety of His life, and to buy Arms &amp; Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to defend Himſelf againſt Rebels, who have ſeized all His Revenue, and have left Him nothing to live upon, but thoſe Jewels, which He had only in His power to convey out of theirs, or to leave them to be ſeized on and ſold by them, who applied all that He had elſe, and His own Revenue to haſten His deſtruction.</p>
            <p>In their mention of the Queens former purpoſe of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond Seas, ſtayed (as they ſay) upon their motion, becauſe they had then heard, She had packed up the Crown Jewels and Plate, they uſe their old and accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med licence.</p>
            <p>If they will examine their own Journall, they will not find amongſt all thoſe reaſons, which were carried up by Maſter <hi>Pim</hi> to the Lords at a Conference on the 14 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and the next day preſented to the King to diſſwade Her Majeſties Journy, the leaſt mention, of Her having packed up the Crown Jewels and Plate, but <hi>that they had received information of great quantity of treaſure in Iewels, Plate and ready Mony packed up to be conveyed away with the Queen; and that divers Papiſts and others, under pretence of Her Majeſties Goods were like to convey great ſums of Money and other treaſure beyond the Seas, which would not only impoveriſh the State, but might be imployed to the fomenting ſome miſchievous attempts to the trouble of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:116687:44"/>
the publike peace:</hi> And they might remember that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the chief reaſons they gave to diſſwade Her Majeſty, was, their profeſſion and Declaration, <hi>(ſince they heard that the chief cauſe of Her Majeſties ſickneſſe proceeded from</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Reaſon.</note> 
               <hi>diſ-content of Her mind) that if any thing which in the power of Parliament might give Her Majeſty contentment, they were ſo tender of Her health, both in due reſpect to His moſt excellent Majeſty and Her ſelf, that they would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to further Her ſatisfaction in all things; and that it would be ſome diſ-honour to this Nation, if Her Majeſty</hi>
               <note place="margin">6. Reaſon.</note> 
               <hi>ſhould at this unſeaſonable time go out of the Kingdome, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any grief or diſcontent received here; and therefore they would labour by all good means to take away and prevent all juſt occaſions of Her Majeſties trouble in ſuch manner as might further Her content, and therein Her health, which would be a very great comfort and joy to themſelves, and the reſt of His Majeſties loving Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe obligations they ſhould have remembred, and left the world to remember how punctuall they were in the performance: The diſcourſe at <hi>Burrough Bridge,</hi> that <hi>the King would pawne His Iewels for the Army,</hi> is as mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, as any other part of the diſcourſe there, being ſaid only by Captain <hi>Chudleigh,</hi> who it ſeems believed it not, by His engaging Himſelf to the Parliament from that<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 220.</note> time, (as the better Pay-maſters) and was highly valued by them.</p>
            <p>20. It ſeems they take it as granted, that their frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and malitious allegations will ſerve turne in ſtead<note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> of proofs, and therefore they take the boldneſſe to tax His Majeſty <hi>with breach of honour and faith,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Him <hi>for calling God to witneſſe,</hi> and making ſo <hi>many ſolemn proteſtations againſt any thought of bringing up the Northern Army, or of leavying Forces to wage war
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:116687:45"/>
with His Parliament, or of bringing in forain Forces or aids from beyond the Sea, which</hi> (they ſay) <hi>Himſelf ſaid would not only bury the Kingdom in ſudden destruction and ruine; but His own name and Poſterity in perpetuall ſcorne and infamy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe Gentlemen would deale faithfully with the world, and confeſſe what troubles them moſt, they would acknowledge, that their grief is, that the King is ſo punctuall and ſevere in keeping His word, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations; not that He is apt to fall from them. If He would have practiſed their arts of diſſembling, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to their vile licence of promiſing and proteſting, what He never meant to think of after, He might have prevented them in many of their ſucceſſes; but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of His mind alwaies diſdained even to proſper or be ſecure by any deviations from truth and honour; and what He hath promiſed, He hath been religious in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, though to His own damage and inconvenience; He hath made no proteſtation about bringing up the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Army, or of leavying Forces againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for the Rights of the Subject, which was not exactly true, and agreeable to the Princely thoughts and reſolutions of His heart.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of His Majeſties uſing that expreſſion concerning <hi>forain Force,</hi> (which is here remembred by them) was this: In the Declaration delivered to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty from the two Houſes at <hi>Newmarket</hi> on the 9 of <hi>March,</hi> 1641. they told Him, <hi>that by the manifold adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, which they had from</hi> Rome, Venice, Paris, <hi>and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 100.</note> 
               <hi>other parts, they expected that His Majeſty had ſtill ſome great deſigne in hand, and that the Popes</hi> Nuntio <hi>had ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spaine <hi>to lend His Majeſty four thouſand men apiece to help to maintain His Royalty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:116687:45"/>
the Parliament, were ſome of the grounds of their fears and jealouſies;</hi> To which His Majeſty made anſwer in theſe words, <hi>What your advertiſements are from</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">Pag. 108.</note> Venice, Paris, <hi>and other parts, or what the Pope's</hi> Nuntio <hi>ſolicited the Kings of</hi> France <hi>or</hi> Spaine <hi>to do, or from what perſons ſuch informations come to you, or how the credit and reputation of ſuch perſons have been ſifted and examined, We know not, but are confident no ſober honeſt man in Our Kingdomes can believe, that We are ſo deſperate, or ſo ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, to entertain ſuch deſignes, as would not only bury this Our Kingdome in ſudden deſtruction and ruine, but Our name and poſterity in perpetuall ſcorn and infamy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Anſwer was moſt prudently and juſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that extravagant and ſenſleſſe ſuggeſtion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted; but becauſe the King at that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War, or a declared purpoſe in them to raiſe a War againſt Him, held it an odious and infamous thing to thinke of bringing in foraine Forces upon His owne Kingdome, that He might not therefore think it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards neceſſary, and find it juſt, to call in forain Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to defend Him from a Rebellion, that beſides mixtures of all Nations, was aſſiſted by an intire forain Army to oppreſſe Him, and His poſterity, no reaſonable man can ſuggeſt or ſuppoſe; and yet how far He hath been from entertaining any ſuch aide, the event declares, which it may be, many wiſe men reckon amongſt His greateſt errours and overſights; and which no queſtion, (if He had not been full of as much tenderneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards His people, as theſe men want) He would have found no difficulty to have practiſed.</p>
            <p>They proceed to improve this moſt groundleſſe and unreaſonable ſcandall by another inſtance, <hi>that when His Majeſty Himſelf, and the Lords made a Proteſtation at</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:116687:46"/>
Yorke <hi>againſt leavying Forces, He commanded His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by Proclamation to reſiſt the Orders of the Parliament, and did many other Facts, contrary to that Proteſtation,</hi> the particulars whereof are mentioned, and ſhall be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and anſwered.</p>
            <p>The Act which they call a Proteſtation by the King &amp; the Lords at <hi>Yorke</hi> paſſed on the 15 day of <hi>June,</hi> 1642. being ſix and twenty daies after both Houſes had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>that the King intended to leavy war againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and thereupon publiſhed their Propoſitions for bringing in Money or Plate for the raiſing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an Army: The King conceiving ſo poſitive and monſtrous an averment might make ſome impreſſion upon, and gain credit with his people, called the Peers together who attended Him, and taking notice of that wicked Declaration, declared to them, <hi>That He alwaies had, and then did abhor all ſuch deſignes, and deſired them to declare, whether being upon the place, they ſaw any colour of preparations or counſels, that might reaſonably beget a belief of any ſuch deſigne, and whether they were not fully perſwaded, that His Majeſty had no ſuch intention:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon<note place="margin">Ex.

the Kingdome;</hi> notwithſtanding which clear evidence, they made what haſte they could to raiſe an Army, and to engage the people againſt their Soveraigne Lord the King.</p>
            <p>That His Majeſty intended not by that profeſſion on His part, nor the Lords thought themſelves obliged on their parts, to give any countenance to, or not to reſiſt the Orders, which then iſſued out every day, from thoſe at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> who called themſelves <hi>the two Houſes,</hi> needs no other evidence, then His Majeſties Declaration publiſhed two daies before (13 of <hi>June</hi>) in which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other particulars, He declared to the Peers, <hi>That</hi>

               <hi>He would not (as was falſly pretended) engage them, or any of them in any War againſt the Parliament, except it were for His owne neceſſary defence and ſafety againſt ſuch as ſhould inſolently invade or attempt againſt His Majeſty, or ſuch as ſhould adhere to Him:</hi> And that very day, the very ſame Peers (whereof the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was one) engaged themſelves to the King under their hands, <hi>That they would defend His Majeſties Perſon, Crowne and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, together with His Majesties juſt and legall Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, againſt all perſons and power whatſoever, and that they would not obey any rule, Order, or Ordinance whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concerning any Militia, that had not the Royall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>

Alarums to awaken Him to a more neceſſary care of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Himſelf and His people, and ſhould themſelves in ſo unheard-of a manner provide (and ſeduce others to do ſo too) to offend His Majeſty, having given Him ſo lively te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their affections, what they were willing to do, when they ſhould once make themſelves able; all His good Subjects would think it neceſſary for His Majeſty to look to Himſelf; and He did then excite all His wel-affected people, according to their Oaths of Allegiance &amp; Supremacy, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſolemn Vow and Proteſtation (whereby they were obliged to defend His Perſon, Honour, and Eſtate) to contribute their best aſsiſtance to the preparations neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the oppoſing and ſuppreſsing of the trayterous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, &amp;c.) And then He would take it as an acceptable Service, if any perſon upon ſo urgent and viſible a neceſsity of His Majeſty, and ſuch an apparent diſtraction of the Kingdome, would bring in to Him, or to His uſe, Mony or Plate, or would furniſh Horſe or Armes, &amp;c.</hi> This was the time, and the manner of His Majeſties requiring ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, for Plate, Horſe, and Armes, which theſe men impute to Him.</p>
            <p>They ſay the King raiſed a Guard of Horſe, and Foot about Him; and by them did not only <hi>abuſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees ſent to Him, beat their publique Officers and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, protect notorious Papiſts, Traytors or Felons, ſuch as</hi> Beckwith <hi>and others, from the</hi> Poſſe Comitatus, but alſo with thoſe <hi>guards, Cannon &amp; Arms from beyond Sea,</hi> did attempt <hi>to force Hull,</hi> in an hoſtile manner, and that within few daies after <hi>that ſolemn Proteſtation at</hi> Yorke: All which ſuggeſtions muſt be particularly examined: The raiſing the King's Guard was on this occaſion, and in this manner:</p>
            <p>The King reſiding with His Court at the City of <hi>Yorke,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:116687:48"/>
and being preſſed by both Houſes of Parliament to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that His Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> might be removed from thence (for the better ſupplies of the neceſſities for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) to the <hi>Tower of London,</hi> which for many reaſons He thought not convenient, His Majeſty reſolved to go Himſelf in Perſon to His <hi>Town of Hull,</hi> to view His Arms<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 152.</note> and Munition there, that thereupon He might give dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions what part thereof might be neceſſary to remaine there, for the ſecurity and ſatisfaction of the Northerne parts (the principall perſons thereof having petitioned Him, that it might not be all removed) and what part might be ſpared for <hi>Ireland,</hi> what for the arming the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were to go thither, and what to repleniſh His chiefeſt Magazine the <hi>Tower of London;</hi> and going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the 23 day of <hi>April,</hi> 1642. He found all the Gates ſhut againſt Him, and the Bridges drawn up, by the command of Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> who flatly denied His Majeſties entrance from the Walls, which were ſtrongly manned, and the Cannon mounted thereon and planted againſt the King; His Majeſty having in vaine endeavoured to perſwade Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> and offered to go in with twenty Horſe, becauſe he alleaged His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue was too great, was at laſt compelled to returne to <hi>Yorke,</hi> after He had proclaimed <hi>Hotham</hi> Traytor, which by all the knowne Lawes, he was declared in that caſe to be.</p>
            <p>The next day the King ſent a Meſſage to the Houſes to require juſtice upon Sir <hi>John Hotham:</hi> to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned no Anſwer, till above a fortnight after; in the mean time they ſent down ſome of the choice Members to <hi>Hull</hi> to give Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> thanks for what he had done; and to aſſure him <hi>that they would juſtifie him in it;</hi> and others into <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> with directions to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116687:48"/>
Lieutenants and all other Officers, to aſſiſt him if he were in any diſtreſſe; and then they ſent ſome other Members as their Committee to <hi>Yorke,</hi> with their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the King, in which they told Him, <hi>That Sir</hi> John<note place="margin">Ex Col. p. 179.</note> Hotham <hi>could not diſcharge the truſt upon which, nor make good the end for which he was placed in the Guard of that Towne and Magazine, if he had let in His Majeſty with ſuch Counſellours and company, as were then about Him; and therefore upon full reſolution of both Houſes they had declared Sir</hi> John Hotham <hi>to be clear from that odious crime of Treaſon; and had avowed, that he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein, but in obedience to the commands of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> whereas in truth, though they had preſumed againſt law and right to ſend him thither, and conſtitute him Governour for a time, of that place, there was no word in his Commiſſion, or inſtructions implying the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, not to ſuffer His Majeſty to come thither; but on the contrary, the pretence was for His Majeſties eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſervice.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty made a quick reply to this ſtrange An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and delivering it to their Committee wiſhed them to return with it to the Houſes, which they refuſed, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Him, That they were appointed by the Parliament <hi>to reſide at Yorke,</hi> but they would ſend His Anſwer to <hi>Westminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be too long in this place, and might be thought impertinent to conſider, whether this cuſtome of ſending Committees to be Lieger in the Counties, which began at this time, be agreeable to law, and the juſt regular power of the Houſes; for as the like will not be found in the Preſidents of former Parliaments, ſo it may be reaſonably believed, that, that Councell, which is called by the Kings Writ to aſſemble at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:116687:49"/>
can no more appoint ſome of their Members to reſide at <hi>Yorke,</hi> or in any other place, then they can adjourn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thither; and it ſeems againſt right, that thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties which are ſent by the Counties or Cities to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on their behalfs in the Houſe of Commons at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> may be ſent to another place, by which they whom they repreſent are without any Members there.</p>
            <p>Upon this Anſwer of the Committee, as unexpected, as the other from the Houſes; and the other acts done in this conjuncture, as the ſending another Committee to <hi>Hull,</hi> another into <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> all to perſwade the people to approve of what Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> had done, and to aſſiſt him if there were any occaſion; the King began very juſtly to apprehend a deſigne upon His owne Perſon, and then and not till then, reſolved, and declared His reſolution to have a Guard to ſecure His Perſon, that Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham might not</hi> (as His Majeſty<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 261.</note> ſaid) <hi>by the ſame forces, or more, raiſed by pretence of the ſame authority</hi> (for he raiſed ſome daily) <hi>continue the War, that he had leavied againſt Him, and as well impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon His Perſon as detain His goods, and as well ſhut His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty up in</hi> Yorke, <hi>as ſhut Him out of</hi> Hull.</p>
            <p>This Guard was hereupon raiſed, with the advice of the principall Gentlemen of that County, and conſiſted of one Regiment of their Traine bands, commanded by the proper Colonel, who was one of the prime Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of fortune and reputation there; and one Troup of Horſe, which had the honour of being called <hi>the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>his Troup,</hi> commanded by the Earle of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and conſiſting of near one hundred, moſt if not all of them, of the Gentry of that Shire; and that the rumour, ſcandall, and imputation of entertaining <hi>Papiſts,</hi> might be clearly anſwered; there was neither Officer or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:116687:49"/>
Souldier of the Regiment or Troup, who did not take the <hi>Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy,</hi> and they were punctually payed by the King, that there might be no complaint on any ſide.</p>
            <p>This was the Guard, the occaſion, and manner of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying it, full five Months after the two Houſes againſt Law or Preſident, and without the leaſt probable colour of danger had raiſed a greater Guard for themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of their new Officer <hi>Skippon,</hi> after they had beſieged the Tower, and compelled the King to commit the government of it to a man of their own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and election; after they had put a Governour and Garriſon into <hi>Hull,</hi> and that Governour and Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon kept His Majeſty out of the Towne; after they had in defiance of His Majeſty and againſt His expreſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſignified to them, put His Royall Navy into the hands, and under the command of the Earle of <hi>Warwick;</hi> after they had in many Counties executed the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the <hi>Militia;</hi> and after they had brought the danger to His Chamber dore, by their Orders to the very Sheriffe of <hi>Yorke-ſhire</hi> to aſſiſt Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> and imploying their Committee there to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>For abuſing the Committees ſent to His Majeſty, they ſhould (and no doubt if it had been in their power they would) have mentioned one particular abuſe offered to them; it is very well known that they had all freedome and reſpect, albeit His Majeſty well knew the ill and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious offices they did there; and though they appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red publickly at all meetings, and when His Majeſty propoſed any thing to the County, they produced their inſtructions, and diſſwaded the County from comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with His juſt deſires; the ſuffering and induring
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116687:50"/>
whereof might more reaſonably be imputed to the King, then any ill uſage they received; of which their owne Letters printed by Order, will be ſufficient teſtimony; and when the King went from <hi>Yorke,</hi> towards <hi>Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 185.</note> after He had declared by His Proclamation, that He would erect His Royall Standard; the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> (being one of that Committee) by ſome accident of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe continuing ſtill at his houſe in that County; albeit the King well knew the diſ-ſervice he had done Him, and that the keeping him in priſon might prevent much more, that he was like to do Him, yet ſince He had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him there as a Member imployed from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that his returne thither was hindred by an indiſpoſition of health, he would not ſuffer him to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, but left him un-diſquieted, or diſturbed, to recollect himſelf, and to revolve His Majeſties good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: So far was that Committee, or any Member of it from being abuſed, whatſoever they deſerved.</p>
            <p>The next inſtance of the King's breach of His Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, or doing ſomewhat againſt it, is, <hi>the beating their publique Officers and Meſſengers, and protecting notorious Papiſts, Traytors, Felons, ſuch as</hi> Beckwith <hi>and others from the Poſſe Comitatus:</hi> ſince there is no other named, it may be ſuppoſed, that this is the only, or moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious example of that protection, and therefore it will be fit to examine, what the Caſe of this man was:</p>
            <p>This Gentleman Mr. <hi>Beckwith</hi> (whether a Papiſt or no is not materiall) lived in <hi>Beverly,</hi> whither His Majeſty came that night, after Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> had refuſed to ſuffer Him to come into <hi>Hull,</hi> and was utterly unknown to His Majeſty, but had the juſt ſenſe an honeſt Subject ſhould have of the indignity offered to his Soveraigne, and the miſchiefe that might befall that County and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:116687:50"/>
Kingdome by this rebellious act, and was forward to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe (as moſt of the Gentlemen of that County were) a deſire to repaire His Majeſty, and to prevent the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which were otherwiſe like to follow.</p>
            <p>He had in the Towne of <hi>Hull</hi> a Son-in-law, one <hi>Fookes,</hi> who was a Lieutenant of a Foot Company in that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, whom he ſuppoſed (being only drawn in with the Traine bands) not malitiouſly engaged in the purpoſe of Treaſon, and therefore as well to preſerve a man, who was ſo near to him, innocent, as for other reſpects to his King and Country, he ſent for him to come to him to his houſe, which the other (there being then no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hindred on either ſide) did, and upon diſcourſe fully ſenſible of the unlawfulneſſe of the act, which had been done, and willing to doe any thing for the King's ſervice; declared, That the Thurſday night following he ſhould have the Guard at the North Gate, and that if an Alarum were given at another Gate, called <hi>Heſſell-Gate,</hi> he would let thoſe in who came from the King; Mr. <hi>Beckwith</hi> promiſed if he would perform this, he ſhould have a very good reward, and that if he could convert his Captain one <hi>Lowanger</hi> (a Dutch-man) to joyn with him, he ſhould likewiſe be very liberally rewarded. This is all that was alleaged againſt Mr. <hi>Beckwith,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by Sir <hi>John Hothams</hi> Letter of the whole informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Mr. <hi>Pim,</hi> entred in the Journall booke of the Houſe of Commons, and printed by their Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fookes</hi> (as ſoon as he returned to <hi>Hull</hi>) diſcovered all to Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> and he derived it to the Houſe of Commons, as is ſaid, and they upon this evidence ſent their Sergeant at Armes, or his Meſſenger to apprehend <hi>Beckwith</hi> as a Delinquent, who upon notice of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:116687:51"/>
of his Son-in-law, durſt not ſtay at his houſe, but removed to <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Meſſenger, with the confidence of his Maſters, boldly came thither, and finding the Gentleman in the Court, and in the Garden where the King himſelf was walking, had the preſumption to ſerve the Warrant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and to claim him as his Priſoner; it was indeed a great wonder that the Meſſenger was not very ſeverely handled, but the reverence to the King's Perſon preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, who bore no reverence to it; and His Majeſty being informed what had hapned, called for the Fellow, and having ſeen his Warrant, bid him return to thoſe that ſent him, and forbear committing the like inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, leſt he fared worſe; this was the beating their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and this the protection Mr. <hi>Beckwith</hi> had; nor was there ever any <hi>Poſſe Comitatus</hi> raiſed, the High She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe daily waiting on His Majeſty, and obſerving the Orders he received from Him, according to the duty of his office.</p>
            <p>Whatever this offence had been, it was never knowne (before this Parliament) that the Meſſenger of either Houſe ever preſumed to ſerve a <hi>warrant</hi> within the King's Court, much leſſe in his Preſence; which whilſt loyalty and duty were in reputation, was held too ſacred for ſuch preſumptions; the Law confeſſing ſuch priviledges and exemptions to be due to thoſe places, <hi>That the Lord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>

               <hi>ſeize his Villaine in the King's preſence, becauſe the preſence of the King is a ſanctuary unto him,</hi> ſaies my Lord <hi>Dyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the matter it ſelf, ſure there is no man yet that will avow himſelf to be ſo much out of his wits, as to ſay, that the King ſhould have ſuffered Mr. <hi>Beckwith</hi> to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116687:51"/>
carried to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as a Delinquent for doing the part of a good Subject; and to be tried by thoſe, who owned the Treaſon that was committed, nor can there be one perſon named, whom they ſent for as a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and the King protected; except thoſe who had been a yeare together attending upon them and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding juſtice; or thoſe againſt whom nothing was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but that they waited on and attended his Majeſty: For the Traytors and Felons, they were only to be found within their owne verge; and protected by their owne priviledges.</p>
            <p>Very few lines will ſerve here, to take notice of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the King's uſage of their Meſſengers, and their uſage of the King's; their Meſſenger ſent by them on an unlawfull imployment, to apprehend a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they had no power to ſend for, and for a crime of which (if he had been guilty) they had no cogniſance, and executing their commands in an unlawfull manner, and in a place, where he ought not to have done it, though the command had been juſt, was by the King fairly diſmiſſed without ſo much as impriſonment or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: The Kings Meſſenger ſent by his Majeſty with a<note place="margin">Daniel Knive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> legall Writ to <hi>London,</hi> for the adjournment of the Tearme, which is abſolutely in the King's power to do, and can be regularly done no other way, for performing his duty in this Service, according to his Oath, and for not doing whereof he had been puniſhable, and juſtly forfeited his place without any other crime objected to him, was <hi>taken, impriſoned, tried at a Court of War, by them condemned to be hanged, and was executed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> That bloud will cry aloud.</p>
            <p>But they ſay, <hi>with thoſe Guards, Cannon, and Armes, from beyond Sea, the King attempted to force Hull in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116687:52"/>
manner, and that within few daies after that ſolemne Proteſtation at</hi> Yorke.</p>
            <p>What the Proteſtation was, is before ſet downe, and his Majeſties publiſhed reſolution in this point, before that Proteſtation; nor did his Majeſty ever conceal his <hi>purpoſe</hi> in this or other caſes of that nature, or diſguiſed his purpoſe with any ſpecious promiſes or pretences, but plainly told them, and the world, what they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at his hands.</p>
            <p>To their expoſtulatory and menacing Petition delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Majeſty at his firſt comming to <hi>Yorke,</hi> on the 26 of <hi>March,</hi> the King in his Anſwer uſed theſe words, <hi>As we have not, nor ſhall refuſe any way agreeable to juſtice</hi>

            <p>In this ſecond Meſſage concerning <hi>Hull,</hi> the ſecond day after the Gates were ſhut againſt him, his Majeſty uſes theſe words, <hi>If We are brought into a condition ſo much</hi>

               <hi>worſe then any of Our Subjects, that whilſt you all enjoy your priviledges, and may not have your poſſeſsions diſturbed, or your titles queſtioned, We only may be ſpoiled, thrown out of Our Townes, and Our goods taken from Us, 'tis time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how We have loſt thoſe priviledges, and to trie all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible waies, by the help of God, the Law of the Land, and the affection of our good Subjects to recover them, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Our ſelf from thoſe injuries.</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, in his Anſwer to a Declaration of the 21 of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1642. (about a fortnight before his going towards <hi>Hull</hi> with his Guards) his Majeſty told them plainly,<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 380.</note> 
               <hi>That the keeping Him out of</hi> Hull <hi>by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> John Hotham, <hi>was an act of High Treaſon againſt him, and the taking away his Magazine and Munition from him, was an act of violence upon him (by what hands, or by whoſe directions ſoever it was done) and in both caſes by the help of God and the Law he would have juſtice, or loſe his life in the requiring it;</hi> ſo that certainly the King never concealed or diſſembled his purpoſes, and accordingly he did indeed toward the middle of <hi>Iuly,</hi> go with his Guards to <hi>Beverly,</hi> having ſome reaſon to believe, that Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf of the crime he had committed, and would have repaired it as far as he had been able, of which fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (to his own miſerable deſtruction) without attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting to force it his Majeſty again returned to <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made it now plainly appear how falſly and groundleſly his Majeſty is reproached with the leaſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giverſation or ſwarving from his promiſes or profeſſions (which no Prince ever more preciſely and religiouſly obſerved) it will be but a little expence of time, again to examine how punctuall theſe conſcientious reprehenders of their Soveraigne, have been in the obſervation of what they have ſworn or ſaid.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Remonſtrance of the Houſe of Commons, of the State of the Kingdome they declare, <hi>that it is far<note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 19.</note>

from their purpoſe or deſire to let looſe the golden reines of diſcipline and government in the Church, to have private perſons, or particular Congregations to take up what forme of divine Service they pleaſe; for</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>they held it requiſite that there ſhould be throughout the whole Realme, a conformity to that Order which the Laws enjoyne.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116687:57"/>
Act of Parliament, is in the next place objected againſt his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>There was neither reall nor mock Parliament ſet up at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but when the King found that moſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of either Houſe were driven from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by force as his Majeſty had been, and yet that the authority and reputation of Parliament was applied for the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all the rebellious Acts which were done, even to the invitation of Forain power to invade the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; as well for the ſatisfaction of His people that they might know how many of the true Members of Parliament abhorred the acts done by that pretended authority; as for His owne information, his Majeſty by his Proclamation of the 22 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> in the year, 1643. invited all the Members of both Houſes, who had been driven, or (being conſcious of their want of freedome) had withdrawn from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to aſſemble at <hi>Oxford</hi> upon the 22 of <hi>January</hi> following, when (He ſaid) <hi>all His good Subjects ſhould ſee how willing He was to receive advice for the Religion, Laws, and ſafety of the Kingdome, from thoſe whom they had truſted, though He could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in the place where He had appointed;</hi> Upon which Summons and Invitation by his Majeſty, eight and forty Peers attended his Majeſty, there being at leaſt twenty others imployed in his Armies, and in the ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whoſe attendance was diſpenced with, and nine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the parts beyond the Seas, with his Majeſties leave; and of the Houſe of Commons above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty, there being likewiſe abſent in the Armies neer thirty more, who could not be conveniently preſent at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When his Majeſty found the appearance ſo great, and ſo much ſuperiour in number, as well as quality, to thoſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116687:58"/>
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> He hoped it would prove a good expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to compoſe the minds of the other to a due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the miſery, into which they had brought their Country; and referred it to them to propoſe any advice, which might produce ſo good an effect; what addreſſes and overtures were then made by them, and afterwards by His Majeſty to perſwade them to enter upon any Treaty of Peace, and with what contempt and ſcorne the ſame was rejected, will be too long to inſert here, and is ſufficiently known to the world; thereupon this body of Lords and Commons publiſhed a Declaration to the Kingdome, at large ſetting forth the particular acts of violence, by which they had been driven from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and by which the freedome of Parliament was taken away, and then declared how much they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the undutifull and rebellious acts, which were countenanced by thoſe who ſtaid there, and declared their own ſubmiſſion and allegiance to his Majeſty; and in the end concluded, <hi>That as at no time either or both Houſes of Parliament can by any Orders or Ordinances im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the people without the King's conſent, ſo by reaſon of the want of Freedome and Security for all the Members of the Parliament to meet at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and there to ſit, ſpeak, and vote with freedome and ſafety, all the Actions, Votes, Orders, Declarations and pretended Ordinances made by thoſe Members who remaine ſtill at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>were void and of none effect; yet they ſaid they were far from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the diſſolution of the Parliament, or the violation of any Act made and confirmed by his Majeſty, but that it was their grief in the behalf of the whole Kingdome, that ſince the Parliament was not diſſolved, the power thereof ſhould by the treaſon and violence of thoſe men, be ſo far ſuſpended, that the Kingdome ſhould be without the fruit
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116687:58"/>
and benefit of a Parliament, which could not be reduced to any action, or authority, till the liberty and freedome due to the Members ſhould be reſtored and admitted;</hi> which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration hath not onely ever received any Anſwer, but with great care hath not been ſuffered to be printed in the laſt Collection of Orders and Declarations, where the other proceedings at <hi>Oxford</hi> of that time are ſet forth, that the people may loſe that evidence againſt them, which can never be anſwered or evaded.</p>
            <p>This was that Aſſembly, which theſe Declarers call the <hi>mock Parliament at Oxford,</hi> and theſe the proceedings of it; of the juſtice and regularity whereof, if there could have been heretofore any doubt made, the ſame is lately vindicated ſufficiently by both Houſes: for if thoſe Lords and Commons at <hi>Oxford</hi> might not juſtifiably abſent themſelves from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where their ſafety and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was taken from them; by what right or authority could a ſmaller number withdraw themſelves in <hi>July</hi> laſt upon the ſame pretence? and if that body of Lords and Commons regularly convened by his Majeſties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <hi>Oxford,</hi> who had firſt called them together at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> might not declare the Acts made by thoſe who remained at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> void and of none effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might not attend there and Vote with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſafety; by what imaginable authority could the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons (who hath no more freedome or power to make any ſuch Declaration, then every ſingle Member of the Houſe) declare, <hi>that ſuch and ſuch Votes paſſed in the Houſe were void and null? and that the omiſsion of a circumſtance or ſome formality in the adjournment of the Houſes could not be any prejudice to the future meetings and proceedings of Parliament, when it might meet and ſit again as a free Parliament,</hi> as he did by

               <hi>That all ſuch Members of either Houſe of Parliament, as were already with the Army for the ſecurity of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and were forced to abſent themſelves from</hi> Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>that they ſhould hold and eſteem them, as perſons in whom the publique trust of the Kingdome was ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though they could not for the preſent ſit as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with freedome and ſafety at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and by whoſe advice and counſels they deſired to governe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the managing thoſe weighty affairs; and to that end invited them to make their repair to the Army,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>they held themſelves bound to own that honourable act of the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, who had actually withdrawn himſelf, and they engaged to uſe their utmoſt and ſpeedy endevour, that he and thoſe Members of either Houſe, that were then inforced any way from</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>might with freedome and ſecurity ſit there, and againe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their truſt, as a free and legall Parliament; and in the meane time, they did declare againſt that late choice of a new Speaker by ſome Gentlemen at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all right, reaſon, law, and cuſtome, and profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be moſt cleerly ſatisfied in all their judgments, and were confident the Kingdome would therein concur with them; that as things then ſtood, there was no free nor le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Parliament ſitting, being through the foreſaid violence at preſent ſuſpended; and that the Orders, Votes, or reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions forced from the Houſes on Munday the 26 of</hi> July <hi>laſt, as alſo all ſuch, as ſhould paſſe in that Aſſembly of ſome few Lords and Gentlemen at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>under what pretence and colour ſoever, were void and null, and ought not to be ſubmitted to by the free-borne Subjects of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>It is not denied, that the preſentation of thoſe humble

deſires of the young men and Apprentices of the City of <hi>London</hi> to both Houſes on the 26 of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt, by which they compelled them to reverſe and repeale two ſeverall Acts of both Houſes paſſed but three daies before, was moſt deſtructive to the priviledge and freedome of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and no queſtion the Speakers and Members of both Houſes had good reaſon to withdraw and abſent themſelves upon that violation; but it is affirmed, that the freedome of Parliament, was as much obſtructed by ſeverall other acts preceding, as it was on the 26 of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt; and that the Members of both Houſes, who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Majeſty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> had as great reaſon to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves, and at leaſt, as much authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their want of freedome, as the Speaker and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had then, or the Army to declare on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfs.</p>
            <p>When the Tumults brought down by <hi>Manwaring</hi> and <hi>Ven, compelled the Houſe of Peers to paſſe the Act of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder againſt the Earle of</hi> Strafford, to which the <hi>fifth part</hi> of the Peers never conſented, (the reſt being driven from thence) and afterwards <hi>ſo abſolutely forced his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> to ſigne it, that it cannot be called His Act, His hand being held and guided by thoſe who kept Daggers at His Breaſt, and ſo His royall name affixed by them; and it being told Him at His Counſell board, by thoſe who were ſworn to defend Him from ſuch violence, that <hi>if it were not done in that inſtant, there would be no ſafety for Himſelf, His royall Conſort, or His Progeny,</hi> the Rabble having at that time beſieged His Court: The freedome of Parliament was no leſſe invaded, then it was on the 26 of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt.</p>

            <p>When in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1642. (after the firſt Propoſition concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> was brought to the Houſe of Peers, and by them rejected) a Petition was brought in a tumultuous manner to the Houſe of Lords, in the name of the Inhabitants of <hi>Hertford-ſhire, deſiring liberty to proteſt againſt all thoſe as enemies to the Publique, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:116687:60"/>
to joyne with the Honourable Lords, whoſe endevours were for the publique good, and with the Houſe of Commons for the putting the Kingdome into a poſture of ſafety under the command of ſuch perſons, as the Parliament ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point;</hi> when other Petitions of that nature, and in the ſame manner delivered, were preſented to that Houſe, concluding that <hi>they ſhould be in duty obliged to maintain their Lordſhips, ſo far as they ſhould be united with the Houſe of Commons in their juſt and pious proceedings;</hi> when at the ſame time a Citizen accompanied with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others ſaid at the Bar of the Houſe of Commons, without reprehenſion, That they heard there were Lords, who refuſed to conſent and concur with them, and that they would gladly know their Names.</p>
            <p>When that ſignall Petition of many thouſand poor people was delivered to the Houſe of Commons, <hi>which took notice of a Malignant faction, that made abortive all their good motions, and profeſſed that unleſſe ſome ſpeedy remedy were taken for the removing all ſuch obſtructions, as hindred the happy progreſſe of their great endevours, the Petitioners would not reſt in quietneſſe, but ſhould be forced to lay hold on the next remedy, that was at hand to remove the diſturbers of the peace;</hi> and when that monſtrous Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition<note place="margin">Ib. p. 12.</note> was carried up to the Houſe of Peers, by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Member of the Commons, as an Argument to them to concur with the Commons in the matter of the <hi>Militia;</hi> and that Member deſired, That if the Houſe of Commons was not aſſented to in that point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe Lords who were willing to concur, <hi>would find ſome means to make themſelves known, that it might be known, who were againſt them, and they might make it known to thoſe who ſent them:</hi> Upon which Petition ſo ſtrangely framed, countenanced, and ſeconded, many Lords thereupon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:116687:61"/>
withdrawing themſelves, in pure fear of their lives, the Vote in Order to the <hi>Militia</hi> twice before rejected, was then paſſed: The freedome of Parliament was as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely invaded, as it was on the 26 of <hi>July</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1643. the Houſe of Commons agreed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and ſolemn debate to joyne with the Lords in ſending Propoſitions of Peace to the King; the next day printed Papers were ſcattered in the Streets, and fixed upon the publique places both in the City, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, <hi>requiring all perſons wel-affected, to riſe as one man, and to come to the Houſe of Commons next morning, for that 20000 Iriſh Rebels were landed;</hi> which direction and information was that day likewiſe given in Pulpits by their ſeditious Preachers; and in ſome of thoſe Papers it was ſubſcribed, <hi>that the malignant Party had over-voted the good, and if not prevented, there would be Peace;</hi> a Common Councell was called late at night, though Sunday, and a Petition there framed againſt Peace, which was the next morning brought to the Houſe, countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Alderman <hi>Penington,</hi> who (being then Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of <hi>London</hi>) that day came to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, attended with a great multitude of mean perſons, who uſed threats, menaces, and reproaches to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Houſes; their Petition took notice of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions paſſed by the Lords for Peace, which (if allowed) would be deſtructive to Religion, Laws, and Liberties, and therefore deſired an Ordinance according to the tenour of an Act of their Common Councell the night before;</hi> Thanks were given by the Commons, whilſt the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the Tumults, and deſired a concurrence to ſuppreſſe them, and to prevent the like, many of the people telling the Members of both Houſes, <hi>that if they had not a good Anſwer, they would be there the next day,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:116687:61"/>
with double the number:</hi> by theſe threats, and this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the Propoſitions formerly received were rejected, and all thoughts of Peace laid aſide: and then ſurely the freedome of Parliament was as much taken away, as on the 26 of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>In a word, when the Members of both Houſes were compelled to take that Proteſtation, <hi>to live and die with the Earle of Eſſex,</hi> and ſome impriſoned and expelled for refuſing to take it; when they were forced to take that ſacred Vow and Covenant of the 6 of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1643. by which they ſwore, <hi>that they would to their power aſsiſt the Forces raiſed and continued by both Houſes of Parliament againſt the Forces raiſed by the</hi> KING; when they were compelled to take the laſt ſolemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that <hi>Oath Corban,</hi> by which they conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abſolved from all obligations divine and humane, as their Predeceſſours (the Jewes) thought they were diſcharged by that (though they had bound themſelves) not to help or relieve their Parents; and laſtly, when the Army marched to <hi>London</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, in favour of the Speakers and thoſe Members, who had reſorted to them, and brought them back to the Houſes, and drove away ſome, and cauſed others of the Members of a contrary Faction to be impriſoned, and expelled the Houſes, the liberty and freedome of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was no leſſe violated and invaded, then it was on the 26 of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe reaſons, and for want of the freedome ſo many ſeverall waies taken from them, thoſe Lords and Commons, who attended his Majeſty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> had withdrawne themſelves from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and might then, as truly and more regularly have ſaid, what the Army ſince with approbation and thanks have ſaid, on
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:116687:62"/>
the 22 of <hi>Iune</hi> laſt, <hi>That the freedome of this Parliament</hi>

               <hi>is no better, then that thoſe Members, who ſhall according to their conſciences endeavour to prevent a War, and act contrary to their waies; who (for their owne preſervation) intend it, they muſt do it with the hazard of their lives:</hi> which being a good reaſon for thoſe lately to go to St. <hi>Albons</hi> or <hi>Hounſlow heath,</hi> cannot be thought leſſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable for the other to go to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since this objection of calling the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Oxford</hi> is not of waight enough to give any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt his Majeſty to His Enemies, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make their entertainment and uſage there very reproachfull with His friends, and would perſwade them to believe themſelves derided in that expreſſion of the Kings in a Letter to the Queen, where He calls them a <hi>Mungrell Parliament,</hi> by which they infer, what reward His own Party muſt expect, when they have done their utmoſt to ſhipwrack their faith and conſcience to his will and tyranny.</p>
            <p>Indeed they, who <hi>ſhipwrack their faith and conſcience</hi> have no reaſon to expect reward from the King, but thoſe Lords and Gentlemen who attended his Majeſty in that convention well know, that never King received advice from His Parliament with more grace and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, then his Majeſty did from them; and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are too good to think themſelves concerned in that expreſſion, if his Majeſty had not Himſelf taken the pains to declare to what party it related; beſides, it is well known, that ſome who appeared there with great profeſſions of loyalty, were but Spies, and ſhortly after betrayed his Majeſties ſervice, as Sir <hi>John Price</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſome ſince have alleaged in the Houſe of Commons, or before the Committee for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:116687:62"/>
to the Charge of being at <hi>Oxford</hi> at that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>That they did the Parliament more ſervice there, then they could have done at</hi> Weſtminſter; So that the KING had great reaſon to think He had many Mungrels there.</p>
            <p>23. The laſt Charge is the making a <hi>Pacification in</hi>

            <p>That loud clamour againſt the Ceſſation in <hi>Ireland</hi> was ſo fully &amp; clearly anſwered by the King's Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners at the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> that there can no ſcruple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with any, who have taken the pains to read the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in that Treaty; it plainly appears, that the King could not be induced to conſent to that Ceſſation, till it was evident that His Proteſtant Subjects in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome could not be any other way preſerved; The Lords Juſtices and Councell of that Kingdome ſignified to the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons by their Letter of the 4 of <hi>April,</hi> (which was above ſix Months before the Ceſſation) <hi>That his Majeſties Army and good Subjects</hi>
               <note place="margin">Relat. of the Treaty, p. 141.</note> 
               <hi>there, were in danger to be devoured for want of needfull ſupplies out of</hi> England, <hi>and that His Majeſties Forces were of neceſsity ſent abroad, to try what might be done for ſuſtaining them in the Country, to keep them alive till ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ſhould get to them, but that deſigne failing them, thoſe their hopes were converted into aſtoniſhment, to behold the miſeries of the Officers and Souldiers for want of all things, and all thoſe wants made inſupportable in the want of food, and divers Commanders and Officers declaring they had little hope to be ſupplied by the Parliament, preſſed with ſo great importunity to be permitted to depart the Kingdome, as that it would be extreame difficult to keep them there,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:116687:63"/>
and in another part of that Letter, they expreſſed, that they were expelling thence all Strangers, and muſt inſtantly ſend away for</hi> England <hi>thouſands of poor diſpoyled Engliſh, whoſe very eating was then inſupportable to that place, that their confuſions would not admit the writing of many more Letters, if any, (for they had written divers others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing their great neceſsities:) And to the end His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the Engliſh Nation, might not irrecoverably and unavoidably ſuffer, they did deſire, that then (though it were almoſt at the point to be too late) Supplies of Victuall and Ammunition in preſent might be haſtened thither to keep life, untill the reſt might follow, there being no Victuall in the Store, nor a hundred Barrels of Powder (a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to defend a Kingdome) left in the Store, when the out-Garriſons were ſupplied, and that remainder according to the uſuall neceſſary expence beſides extraordinary acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents would not laſt above a Month;</hi> and in that Letter they ſent a Paper ſigned by ſundry Officers of the Army delivered to them, as they were ready to ſigne that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch, and by them apprehended to threaten imminent danger; which mentioned that <hi>they were brought to that great exigent, that they were ready to rob and ſpoile one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that their wants began to make them deſperate; That if the Lords Juſtices and Councell there did not find a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way for their preſervation, they did deſire, that they might have leave to go away; that if that were not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they muſt have recourſe to the law of nature, which teacheth all men to preſerve themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Houſes, who had undertaken to carry on that War, and received all the Mony raiſed for that Service, neglecting ſtill to ſend ſupplies thither; the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, and Councell by their Letters about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> advertiſed the King, <hi>That they had no Victuall,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:116687:63"/>
Cloths, or other proviſions, no Mony to provide them of any thing they want; no Armes, not above forty Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; no ſtrength of ſerviceable Horſe; no viſible means by Sea or Land of being able to preſerve that Kingdome.</hi> And by others of the 4 of <hi>Iuly, that his Armies would be forced</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coll. Ord. 2. vol. p. 344.</note> 
               <hi>through wants to disband or depart the Kingdome, and that there would be nothing to be expected there, but the inſtant loſſe of the Kingdome, and the deſtruction of the remnant of his good Subjects yet left there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the ſad condition of that miſerable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to whoſe aſſiſtance his Majeſty was in no degree (of Himſelf) able to contribute; and His recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interpoſition to the two Houſes, whom He had truſted, was ſo much contemned, that when upon their Order to iſſue out, at one time, <hi>one hundred thouſand pounds</hi> of the Monies paid for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the ſupply of the Forces under the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (albeit it was enacted by the Law upon which thoſe Monies were raiſed, <hi>that no part of it ſhould be imployed to any other purpoſe then the reducing the Rebels of Ireland</hi>) His Majeſty by a ſpeciall Meſſage adviſed and required them to retract that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to diſpoſe the Monies the right way, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of <hi>Ireland</hi> being then paſſionately repreſented by thoſe upon the place, they returned no other ſatisfaction or Anſwer to his Majeſty, but a Declaration, <hi>That thoſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ex. Col. p. 57<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>directions given His Majeſty for the retracting of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was a high breach of priviledge of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When His Majeſty perceived that no aſſiſtance was, or was like to be applied to them, and that the Enemy ſtill increaſed in ſtrength &amp; power, He referred the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and proviſion for themſelves, to thoſe, whoſe ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and livelyhoods were moſt immediately concerned, and who were the neareſt witneſſes of the diſtreſſes, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:116687:64"/>
the beſt Judges, how they could be borne, or how they were like to be relieved; and ſo with the full advice and approbation of the Lords Juſtices and Councell there, and concurrent opinion of all the chief Officers of the Army, that Ceſſation was made, by which onely the Proteſtants in that Kingdome, and His Majeſties intereſt there could at that time have been preſerved.</p>
            <p>Of this Ceſſation, neither His Majeſties good Subjects in that or this Kingdom, have reaſon to complain. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine now the peace, which they ſay was afterwards made, on ſuch odious, ſhamefull, and unworthy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that His Majeſty Himſelf bluſhed to owne, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to His owne Lieutenant the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> but a private Commiſſion was made to the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> to manage it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the King had any hope of a tolerable peace in this, or a probable way of carrying on the War in that Kingdome, He never gave a Commiſſion to conclude a peace there, and it plainly appears by the relation of the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> (to the truth of which there hath not been the leaſt objection) the Acts of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of both ſides being extant, that there was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient propoſed (though deſired often on the King's party) for the proceeding in that War, but that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would quit abſolutely all His Regall power in that Kingdome, and ſo put all His Subjects there (Engliſh and Iriſh) out of His protection, into that of the two Houſes of Parliament here, who at the ſame time were fighting for the ſame Supremacy in this, and who had at the ſame time diſpoſed a greater power thereof to the Scots, then they reſerved to themſelves; it concerned the King then in piety and policy, in His duty to God and man, to endevour to preſerve that Kingdom by a peace,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:116687:64"/>
which He could not reduce by a war, and to draw from thence ſuch a body and number of His own Subjects, as might render Him more conſiderable to thoſe, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put off all naturall allegiance, and reverence to his Majeſty, looked only what power and ſtrength, and not what right He had left.</p>
            <p>The peace that was concluded, was upon ſuch tearms and conditions, as were in that conjuncture of time juſt and honourable; and when it could not be continued without yeilding to more ſhamefull and leſſe worthy conditions, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> his Majeſties Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of that Kingdome, (who had the ſole and intire authority from his Majeſty to conclude a peace, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom all their envy, and all their malice, hath not been able to make the leaſt objection) beſt knowing his Maſters mind, choſe rather to make no peace, and to truſt providence with his Majeſties Rights, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch Propoſitions; nor had the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> ever any Commiſſion to make a peace there, but being a perſon, whoſe loyalty and affection to his ſervice, the King had no reaſon to ſuſpect, and being of the ſame Religion with the Enemy, might have ſome influence upon them, was qualified with ſuch a teſtimony, as might give him the more credit amongſt them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to reaſon: His reſtraint and commitment was very reall by the whole Councell board there, though when it appeared that his errors had proceeded from unskilfulneſſe and unadviſedneſſe, and not from malice, he was afterwards inlarged by the ſame power.</p>
            <p>The unnaturall concluſions and inferences theſe men make from what the King hath ſaid or done, applying actions done lately, to words ſpoken ſeven years before, cannot caſt any blemiſh upon the Kings Religion, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:116687:65"/>
ſhines with the ſame luſtre in Him, as it did in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Martyrs; and even thoſe Letters taken at <hi>Nazeby,</hi> (which no wiſe Rebel, or gallant Enemy would have publiſhed) will to poſterity appear as great Monuments of His zeale to the true Proteſtant Religion, in thoſe ſtraits in which He was driven by thoſe who profeſſed that Religion, as any Prince hath left, or have been left by any Prince ſince Chriſtianity was imbraced: And if that Religion ſhould proſper with leſſe vigour, then it hath done, and the Chriſtian and Pagan world have leſſe reverence towards it, then they have had, theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers may juſtly challenge to themſelves the honour and glory of that declenſion, and triumph in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches they have brought upon the moſt Orthodox Church, that hath flouriſhed in any age ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time.</p>
            <p>Theſe Charges and reproaches upon the King, which have been now particularly examined and anſwered, and of which the world may judge, are aggravated by the King's ſo often refuſing their addreſſes for peace; the truth of which ſuggeſtions (though for method ſake the Order of their Declaration hath been inverted) muſt be now conſidered, and all of that kind, which is ſcattered and diſ-jointed in the Declaration, ſhal for the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſake be gathered together and reſolved; and in this Argument they ſeem to think, they are ſo much upon the advantage ground, that they are rather to make an<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> Apology to the world, for having ſo often made Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to their King, then for reſolving to doe ſo no more; that is, for enduring ſo long to be Subjects, then for reſolving hereafter to be ſo no more.</p>
            <p>The truth is, they never yet made any one addreſſe for peace; onely ſomtime offered to receive his Crown, if
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116687:65"/>
his Majeſty would give it up to them, without putting them to fight more for it, for other ſenſe or interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no Propoſitions yet ever ſent to Him can bear; and whereas they ſay, <hi>they muſt not be ſo unthankfull to God, as to forget they were never forced to any Treaty,</hi> it is affirmed, that there are not ſix Members, who concur in this <hi>Declaration,</hi> who ever gave their conſent to any Treaty, that hath yet been, but when they were forced by the major part to conſent to it, they were ſo unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for the opportunity of reſtoring a bleſſed peace to their Country, that they framed ſuch Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and clogged their Commiſſioners with ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as made any Agreement impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Though no Arithmetique, but their own, can reckon thoſe <hi>Seven times,</hi> in which they have made ſuch appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the King, and tendred ſuch Propoſitions, <hi>that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> 
               <hi>might occaſion the world to judge, they had not only yeilded up to their wills and affections, but their reaſon alſo, and judgment, for obtaining a true peace and accommodation;</hi> yet it will be no hard matter ſhortly to recollect the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures, which have bin made on both ſides, and thence it may beſt appear whether <hi>the King, never yet offred any thing fit for them to receive, or would accept of any tender fit for them to make.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Propoſitions were made by them to prevent the War, need not be remembred, who ever reads the <hi>nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> ſent to Him to <hi>Yorke,</hi> will ſcarce be able to name one Soveraigne power, that was not there demanded from him; nor can they now make Him leſſe a King, then He ſhould have been, if He had conſented to thoſe.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:116687:67"/>
Enemy; whereupon He took a ſudden reſolution to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to <hi>Brainceford;</hi> thereby to compell them to draw their Body together, &amp; ſo making His way through that Towne with the defeat of a Regiment or two which made reſiſtance there, and thereby cauſing thoſe at <hi>Kingſton</hi> to remove, the King went to His own Houſe at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and having there in vaine expected the Commiſſioners from the Houſes to Treat, retired to <hi>Reading,</hi> where He ſtaid, till He found they had given over all thought of Treaty, and they ſent Him a new ſcornfull Petition, <hi>to returne to His Parliament with His Royall, not His Martiall attendance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>January</hi> following, the importunity of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and generall clamour of the people forced them to pretend an inclination to peace; and ſo they ſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to his Majeſty, which though but 14 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, contained the whole matter of the former 19. with an addition of ſome Bils ready paſſed the two Houſes, to which His royall aſſent was demanded, one of which was for the extirpation and eradication of the whole frame of Church-government; and another for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming an Aſſembly of ſuch Divines as they had choſen, to deviſe a new Government, which they were ſo much the fitter to be truſted with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe in the whole number, (which conſiſted of above one hundred, and might be increaſed as they thought fit) there were not above a dozen, who were not already declared Enemies to the old, to the which notwithſtanding there were few of them who had not ſubſcribed, and a promiſe required from his Majeſty, <hi>that He would give His aſſent to all ſuch Bils which the two Houſes ſhould hereafter preſent to Him, upon conſultation with that Aſſembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How extravagant ſoever theſe Propoſitions were, the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:116687:68"/>
King ſo much ſubdued and ſuppreſſed His Princely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, that He drew them to a Treaty even upon thoſe Propoſitions, expecting (as He expreſſed in His Anſwer, when He propoſed the Treaty) <hi>that ſuch of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coll. Ord. 2 vol. p. 52.</note> 
               <hi>them as appeared derogatory from, and deſtructive to His juſt Power and Prerogative, ſhould be waved, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that were darke and doubtfull in them, might be cleared and explained upon debate;</hi> and concluding that if they would conſent to a Treaty, <hi>they would likewiſe give ſuch authority and power of reaſoning to thoſe, whom they ſhould truſt, that they might either give or take ſatisfaction upon thoſe principles of piety, honour, and juſtice, as both ſides avowed, their being governed by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How that Treaty was managed, how their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were limited and bound up by their Inſtructions, that they had no power to recede from the leaſt materiall tittle of the Propoſitions upon which they treated; how they were not ſuffered to ſtay one houre beyond the time firſt aſſigned to them, albeit his Majeſty earneſtly deſired the Treaty might be continued, till He had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an Anſwer to Propoſitions of His owne, which He had ſent to the Houſes, becauſe the Committee had no power to anſwer them; and how the ſame day their Commiſſioners left <hi>Oxford;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> marched with his whole Army to beſiege <hi>Reading,</hi> is known to all men, who may conclude thereupon, that they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that Treaty ſhould produce a peace.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the King propoſed only, <hi>That His Ships might be reſtored to Him, and His Caſtles, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, which by the confeſsion of all had been violently taken from Him; and that His Majeſty and the Members of both Houſes, who had been driven from</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther return thither, upon ſuch a proviſion as might ſecure

them againſt Tumults for the future; or that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be adjourned to ſome ſafe place, and ſo all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies preſently to be disbanded:</hi> To which Propoſition from his Majeſty, they never vouchſafed to return An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and the King after He had above a Month in vain expected it from them; and in that time received a good ſupply of Ammunition, which He was before thought to want, ſent another Meſſage by Mr. <hi>Alexander Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> on the 19 of <hi>May,</hi> 1643. in which He told them,<note place="margin">Coll. Ord. 2 vol. p. 181.</note> 
               <hi>That when He conſidered that the ſcene of all the calamity was in the bowels of His own Kingdome, that all the bloud which was ſpilt was of His owne Subjects; and that what victory it ſhould pleaſe God to give Him, muſt be over thoſe who ought not to have lifted up their hands againſt Him; when He conſidered that thoſe deſperate civill diſſentions, might encourage and invite a forain Enemy to make a prey of the whole Nation; That</hi> Ireland <hi>was in preſent danger to be loſt; That the heavy judgments of God, Plague, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Famine, would be the inevitable attendants of this unnaturall contention; and that in a ſhort time there would be ſo generall a habit of uncharitableneſſe and cruelty contracted throughout the Kingdome, that even peace it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf would not reſtore His people to their old temper and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; His Majeſty could not ſuffer Himſelf to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged though He had received no Anſwer to His former Meſſage, but by this did again with much earneſtneſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to conſider what He had before offred, which gave ſo fair a riſe to end thoſe unnaturall diſtractions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This moſt gracious Meſſage from the King, met with ſo much worſe entertainment and ſucceſſe then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as it was not only ever Anſwer'd, but the Meſſenger likewiſe (being a Gentleman of quality and ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity) though he was civilly received by the Houſe of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:116687:69"/>
Lords, to whom he was directed, was by the Houſe of Commons apprehended and impriſoned, and never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter freed from his reſtraint, till he ended his life, after a long and conſuming ſickneſſe.</p>
            <p>This is the Meſſenger they mean, who (to excuſe their<note place="margin">Pag 10.</note> inhumanity and cruelty towards him) they ſay, <hi>at the ſame time he brought a ſpecious Meſſage of renewing a Treaty, was inſtructed how to manage that bloudy Maſſacre in</hi> London, <hi>which was then deſigned by vertue of the Kings Commiſsion, ſince publiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before any thing be ſaid of that Plot, it is known, that Gentleman was impriſoned many daies before there was any mention of a Plot; and the Houſe of Peers ſolemnly expoſtulated the injury done to them in it, and in vaine required his inlargement, which they would not have done, if there had been any other objection againſt him, then the comming without a Paſſe from their Generall, which was never underſtood to be requiſite, till the Houſe of Commons very few daies before declared it to be ſo, albeit themſelves ſent Meſſengers to the King without ever demanding a Paſſe.</p>
            <p>Now to the Plot it ſelf; They have indeed publiſhed<note place="margin">Coll. Ord. 2. vol. p. 199.</note> a Narration of that Plot, which ſerved their turn barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to put two very honeſt men to death, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe very many more; and it is very probable they made that relation as full and clear, as their evidence enabled them to do, and yet who ever reads it, cannot conclude reaſonably, that there was ever more in it, then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between honeſt men, of good reputation and fortunes, and deſirous of peace, how they might be able to diſcountenance that diſorderly rabble, which upon all occaſions proteſted againſt peace, by appearing as ſtrong and conſiderable in numbers as they, and which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:116687:69"/>
ought to have found as great countenance and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the Parliament, as the other; theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes produced a diſquiſition of the generall affections of the City, and that a more particular computation and eſtimate of the inclinations of particular men, and ſo mention of ſeverall things which in ſuch and ſuch caſes would be neceſſary to be done; and theſe diſcourſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the treachery of a Servant diſcovered to thoſe, who could compound Plots and Conſpiracies out of any Ingredients, they joyned thoſe and a Commiſſion they had likewiſe met with, together, and ſo ſhaped a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, that they uſed as a Scar-crow to drive away any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and publique inclinations for peace, the preſſing whereof at that time was like to prove inconvenient to them; but thoſe diſcourſes, and that Commiſſion, had not the leaſt relation to each other, nor was there one man, who was accuſed of or privy to thoſe diſcourſes, whoſe name was in that Commiſſion, or indeed privy to it, which had iſſued out a good time before, and was to have been made uſe of (being no other then a fair legall Commiſſion of Array in Engliſh) if the Kings motion with His Army towards thoſe parts gave the people ſo much courage to appear for Him; nor can there be a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber objection againſt the Kings granting ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when they had their Ordinances ready upon all occaſions, to be executed in the Kings Quarters, and had named Commiſſioners for that purpoſe in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, in the Overtures for peace, from the end of the Treaty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which was in <hi>April,</hi> 1643. they never made one Overture or Addreſſe to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty towards peace, till the end of <hi>November,</hi> 1644. in the mean time what approaches the King made towards
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116687:70"/>
it muſt be remembred: After the taking of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> when his Majeſties ſtrength and power was viſible and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Weſt, and in the North, and the Enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition apparently low, and in many of their opinions even deſperate; the King albeit His laſt Meſſenger was ſtill in Priſon, and no Anſwer to his Meſſages, by His Declaration of the 30 of <hi>June,</hi> again renewed all the profeſſions and offers He had before made, and told them, <hi>that revenge and bloud thirſtineſſe had never been imputed to His Majeſty by thoſe, who had neither left His government or nature un-examined with the greateſt bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and malice, and therefore beſought them to return to their Allegiance:</hi> what paſſed from his Majeſty himſelf, and from the Lords and Commons at <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>March</hi> following, and with what importunity, they deſired there might be a Treaty, by which ſome waies &amp; means might be found, how a peace might be procured, and how peremptorily and diſdainfully they rejected that deſire in their Anſwer to his Majeſty of the 9 of <hi>March,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coll. Ord. 2 vol. p. 451.</note> becauſe the greateſt, and the greateſt number of the Peers of the Kingdome, and the greateſt part of the Houſe of Commons, then with his Majeſty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſeemed by Him to be put in an equall condition with them at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> though they had been content ſince to put the Officers of the Army into at leaſt an equall condition with them, by treating with them, is to be ſeen and read, and needs no repetition.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> following, which was in the year 1644. after He had routed the beſt part of Sir <hi>William Waller's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and taken his Cannon, his Majeſty ſent from <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> another Meſſage to the two Houſes, to deſire them, <hi>that there might yet be a Ceſſation, and that ſome perſons might be ſent to Him with any Propoſitions that might be

for the good of His people, and He would condeſcend to them:</hi> to which they never returned Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Two Months after, on the 8 of <hi>September,</hi> when He had totally defeated the Army of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> taken all their Cannon, Armes, and Baggage; the King again ſent to them, <hi>that the extraordinary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe with which God had bleſſed Him in ſo eminent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, brought Him no joy for any other conſideration, then for the hopes He had, that it might be a means to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lay to heart, as He did, the miſeries brought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued upon this Kingdome by this unnaturall war, and that it might open their ears, and diſpoſe their minds to imbrace thoſe offers of peace and reconciliation, which had been ſo often and ſo earneſtly made unto them by Him, and from the conſtant and fervent endeavours of which He reſolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to deſiſt:</hi> and ſo <hi>conjured them to conſider His laſt Meſſage and to ſend Him an Anſwer:</hi> To this Meſſage likewiſe, they never ſent Anſwer: and theſe were <hi>the tenders</hi> made by his Majeſty, which they ſay <hi>were never fit for them to receive;</hi> we ſhall now proceed to thoſe they thought fit to offer, and accuſe his Majeſty for not accepting.</p>
            <p>On the 23 of <hi>November,</hi> 1644. the Committee from the two Houſes brought the Propoſitions to the King, which, they ſay, were agreed on by the Parliaments of both Kingdoms not only as juſt, but neceſſary alſo for the very being of theſe Kingdoms in a ſetled peace and ſafety: And which required his Majeſty to reſigne up all His Regall power in His three Kingdomes, to thoſe who ſent thoſe Propoſitions; to take their Covenant, and injoyne all others to take it; and to ſacrifice all His owne Party (who had ſerved Him honeſtly and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to the fury and appetite of thoſe, who had caſt off
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:116687:71"/>
their Allegiance to Him, and to leave Himſelf the meer empty name of a King.</p>
            <p>How the twenty daies were afterwards ſpent at <hi>Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> is publiſhed to the world, in which the laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation made by the King's Commiſſioners muſt not be forgotten, <hi>That after a War of neer foure years, for</hi>
               <note place="margin">Relat. Treat. p. 175.</note> 
               <hi>which the defence of the Proteſtant Religion, the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the Priviledges of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, were made the cauſe and grounds, in a Treaty of Twenty daies, nor indeed in the whole Propoſitions upon which the Treaty ſhould be, there hath been nothing offered to be treated concerning the breach of any Law, or of the Liberty, or Property of the Subject, or Priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but onely Propoſitions for the altering a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed by Law, and for the making new Laws, by which almoſt all the old are or may be cancelled; and there hath been nothing inſiſted on of the Kings part, which is not Law, or denied by the Kings Commiſsioners that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required, as due by Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> which they ſay, <hi>was entred</hi> (about<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> the time of this Treaty) <hi>in the Councell-Book,</hi> and of which his Majeſty gave the <hi>Queen</hi> account, it is known to be no other then a Declaration, that by calling them <hi>a Parliament,</hi> there could be no acknowledgment infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he eſteemed them a free Parliament, which few at that time did believe them to be; and they have ſince upon as ſmall reaſons confeſſed themſelves not to be.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:116687:71"/>
at</hi> Hampton-Court, <hi>ſtill the ſame Propoſitions in effect, which had been preſented before in the midſt of all His ſtrength and Forces:</hi> which is rather an Argument that they had at firſt made them as bad as poſſibly they could, then that they were good ſince; and (conſidering the natures of theſe Declarers) there cannot be a more pregnant evidence of the ilneſſe and vileneſſe of thoſe Propoſitions, then that they have not made them worſe; nor is the condition in which they have now impiouſly put His Majeſty for His refuſall, worſe, then it had been, or would be (His Perſonall liberty only excepted) if He conſented to them; and in one conſideration it is much better, becauſe it is now a confeſſed act of violence and treaſon upon Him, which if He once conſent to their Propoſitions, they will (when ever they find occaſion) appear legally qualified to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>They have once again out of their deſire of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties concurrence deſcended to one other addreſſe to Him, and they ſaid, they did <hi>ſo qualifie the ſaid Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>What the former Propoſitions and Addreſſes to His Majeſty have been, and how impoſſible it hath been for Him to conſent to them with His Conſcience, Honour, or Safety, appears before; and how inconvenient it

would have been to the Kingdome if He had done it, they themſelves have declared, by making ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant alterations in reſpect of the Engliſh intereſt in thoſe preſented at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> from the other treated on at <hi>Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi> it will be fit therefore to examine theſe foure Bils which were to be the condition of the Treaty.</p>

            <p>There need no other Anſwer, why it is not fit or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the King to conſent to this, then what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from <hi>Scotland</hi> gave to the Houſes, when they declared their diſſent; <hi>If the Crownes have no power of</hi>

            <p>If Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> had never denied his Majeſty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into, and ſhut the Gates of <hi>Hull</hi> againſt Him, from which naturall Allegiance, and civill prudence might have reſtrained him, the judgment and Verdict of God had been leſſe evident then it was, when after he had wiſhed, <hi>that God would deſtroy him and his poſterity if he proved not faithfull to the King,</hi> at the ſame time that he had planted his Cannon againſt him; he and his Son were miſerably executed by the judgment of thoſe, who but by his Treaſon could never have been enabled to have exerciſed that juriſdiction; and that having it in his power he ſhould perfidiouſly decline to ſerve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and afterwards looſe his head for deſiring to do it, when he had no power to perform it.</p>
            <p>They who remember the affected virulency of Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Carew</hi> againſt the King, and all thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to him; and how paſſionately he extolled and

            <p>To omit infinite other inſtances, which the obſervation of all men can ſupply them with, the Verdict of God had not been ſo remarkable and notorious, if the King had prevailed with his Army, and reduced his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects to their duty, which might naturally have been expected from the cauſe, and the fate that Rebels uſually meet with; as that after a totall defeat of the King's Forces, and their gaining all the power into their hands, they could poſſibly propoſe to themſelves, they ſhould not only be in more perplexity and trouble, then when they had a powerfull Army to contend with, but in more inſecurity and danger, then if they had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by that Army.</p>

            <p>It cannot be denied, that unjuſt, cruell and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princes are great afflictions and judgments upon a people; yet the calamities under ſuch are much more ſupportable, then the confuſion without any; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God frequently exerciſed his peculiar and choſen people, with profane, wicked, and tyrannicall Kings, and refreſhed them again, with pious, and devout, and juſt Princes, but it was a ſignall mark of their deſolation, when he declared, <hi>that the Children of Iſrael ſhould abide</hi>

            <p>The reverence and ſuperſtition which the people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally paid to the name and authority of Parliament, and by which they have been cozened into the miſerable condition they now are in, is ſo worn out, that without captivating their reaſons any longer to it as a Councell, they plainly diſcern, the ambition, weakneſſe, vanity, malice, and ſtupidity of the particular Members, of whom it is, and of whom it ought not to be conſtituted, and eaſily conclude, that as they have robbed them of the moſt happy and plentifull condition any free-man of the world ever enjoyed, ſo they can never be inſtruments of any kind of peace and ſecurity to them; and that as they have upon the matter diſſolved the nobleſt ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and frame of government, in Church and State, that hath been at any time in the Chriſtian world, ſo that they are too much tranſported with paſſion and guilt, and of too little intereſt, experience and underſtanding, to deviſe and ſettle a new form, or to mend any defects in the old: Beſides that, they plainly diſcern that they are not the Miniſters of their Country for whom they were choſen and deputed, but for the Army, whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates

            <p>If the people could be ſo mad; if their fear, or their folly prevailed over them to ſubmit to ſuch a ſetlement, as theſe Declarers would deviſe for them, there are not ten of them, whoſe names are known to the Kingdome, who do know and are agreed what kind of Government they would eſtabliſh in Church or State; Their feares and jealouſies with which they delighted themſelves, are now grown reall diſeaſes, and take away their ſleep from them; ſo that ſetting aſide the peace of Conſcience, which they contend not for, there is not a man amongſt them injoyes that aſſurance of outward Security, as the poor <hi>Cavalier</hi> does, whom they have robbed and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all that he hath, upon whom all their pride and plenty looks even with an envy and reverence; <hi>Is not the</hi>

            <p>It will be neceſſary to adde, that in all their tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at home, to which they have applied the Publique Faith, they have not only not performed the contracts they have made, but reſolved at the time when they made them, not to obſerve them, as appears by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the 2 <hi>June,</hi> 1646. by which the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons reſolved, <hi>That all perſons that have or ſhall come</hi>

            <p>As upon theſe, and infinite other reaſons, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and hearts of the people, are quite aliened from the Parliament, ſo they are with an equall vigour recovered and converted to the King, and a full reverence to His ſacred Perſon (the want of which may be held juſtly the primary cauſe of all our evils, and the advancement of all our diſtractions) and an ample acknowledgment of His Princely wiſdome, and unparalleld conſtancy is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be due to Him; And by His truly magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous carriage during the time of His Reſtraint, when all perſons have been removed from Him, who are either inclined to His Perſon, or Rights, out of their duty and Allegiance, or to His opinions out of judgment and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; by His unſhaken conſtancy, in not being moved from His great principles, with all their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and all their threats ſucceſſively adminiſtred to Him; by the ſharpneſſe and ſteddineſſe of His underſtanding, with which upon all occaſions, and in all diſcourſes with the Commiſſioners, who attended Him, He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the impiety in point of Religion; the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in point of Law; the unreaſonableneſſe in point of Policy, even in relation to themſelves, of all that they have propoſed to Him in order to Peace, with ſuch a clearneſſe of judgment, and ſuch a candidneſſe of nature, that ſome of their own Miniſters, not of the ſofteſt and gentleſt conſtitutions, have been forced to their diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to publiſh His wonderfull abilities: All men acknowledge that whatſoever hath been wiſely ſaid, or proſperouſly done throughout the managery of his great Affairs, hath proceeded from His own virtue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;

and that all the ill Succeſſes, and overſights, which have preceded and cauſed thoſe ill ſucceſſes, were the effects of the unadviſedneſſe, unskilfulneſſe, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of His Counſellours and Miniſters.</p>
            <p>And that the Kings great virtue had, and would have this great influence upon the people, the Army well knew, when (to indear and ingratiate themſelves after the taking His Majeſty from <hi>Holmby</hi>) they declared in their Remonſtrance of the 23 of <hi>Iune</hi> from St. <hi>Albons,</hi> That <hi>whereas there had been ſcandalous informations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented</hi>

               <note place="margin">Ib. p. 74.</note> 
               <hi>made many Addreſſes to the King, to deſire His Majeſties free concurrence with the Parliament, for eſtabliſhing and ſecuring the common Rights and Liberties, and ſetling the peace of the Kingdome; And to aſſure Him, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique being ſo provided for, with ſuch His Majeſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, it was fully agreeable to all their principles, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:116687:88"/>
ſhould be their deſires and endeavour, That (with and in ſuch ſetling of the Publique) the Rights of His Majeſties Royall Family ſhould be alſo provided for, ſo as a laſting peace and agreement might be ſetled in this Kingdome; And that as they have formerly declared for the ſame in generall termes, ſo</hi> (if things came to a way of ſetlement) <hi>they ſhould not be wanting</hi> (in their ſphears) <hi>to own that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſire in any particulars of naturall or civill right to His Majeſties Perſon or Family, which might not prejudice, or again indanger the Publique:</hi> By which gawdy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, together with the admiſſion of ſuch Servants and Chaplains to attend His Majeſty whom He deſired, and which had been barbarouſly denied by the Houſes (who were by this time ſo ſenſible of their error, as they deſired His Majeſties preſence amongſt them upon His own Conditions) they raiſed themſelves to that credit with the Kings party, with the City of <hi>London,</hi> and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally with the people, that by this Stratagem onely they grew able and powerfull enough to confine Him to <hi>Carisbrooke-Caſtle,</hi> and to proceed ſince as they have done; And ſurely when the Army hath throughly weighed and conſidered the huge advantages they have gotten by thoſe profeſſions and proteſtations, and how far they have been from making the ſame good to the King, they will not ſuffer themſelves to be made a ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Horſe to the vile ends of particular perſons, nor let their <hi>Morall Righteouſneſſe,</hi> in which they ſo much tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, to grow into a Proverb, for the higheſt and moſt unworthy Craft, <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and <hi>Treachery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains now, ſince by any endeavours of theſe men, ſever'd from the return to their duty and Allegiance, it is not poſſible for them to eſtabliſh any peace or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Kingdome, or ſecurity to themſelves, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:116687:89"/>
them that by doing at laſt the duty of Chriſtians, they may not only preſerve their Country, which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can doubt, but they may be ſuperiour to any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and hazard, their guilt ſuggeſts they ſhall be liable to.</p>
            <p>It is yet in their power ſo abſolutely to make the Kings reſtoration their own work, that His Majeſty may be obliged even in point of gratitude to acknowledge it, and to remember only by whoſe fidelity He hath recovered what He had loſt, and not by whoſe fault He loſt it; and His party, (who for Conſcience ſake have loſt all) know that charity is ſo fundamentall a duty of a Chriſtian, that there is no excuſe for the leaſt degree of animoſity and revenge, let the injuries they have received be never ſo great; and the Kings owne experience of men hath ſufficiently informed Him, that as many of good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations have by inadvertency &amp; credulity, been cozened into a combination againſt Him, and it may be, the worſt of them grown by degrees worſe then they intended to be; ſo all who have ſeemed to follow a good cauſe, are not good men, but had ends as ill as they, whom they oppoſed; and therefore all mention and memory of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Errors being blotted out, it may be preſumed He will truſt and imploy all His good Subjects, according to their ſeverall faculties and abilities, without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring how they have been at any time diſpoſed againſt Him; and they have reaſon to believe that whatſoever His Majeſty ſhall freely conſent to, He will moſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerve, and cauſe all others to obſerve it; Let them therefore ſeaſonably enter into a Treaty with His Majeſty, attended with ſuch of His Counſell as He ſhall chuſe; and let the fulleſt Articles be agreed upon, which may give a mutuall aſſurance of ſecurity to all perſons
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116687:89"/>
and intereſts, to which His Majeſty having given His Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſuch manner as ſhall be deſired, all His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and all Miniſters of Juſtice throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may be ſolemnly ſworn to thoſe Articles; the which being done, and the ſame confirmed by ſuch an Act; and in that manner paſſed as they ſhall conclude may be valid; Let this unhappy Parliament be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, an intermiſſion of Parliament being at this time more neceſſary for the vindication of the juſtice, and Lawes of the Kingdome, and reſtoring a happy peace, then ever a convention of Parliament was for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and removing of grievances.</p>
            <p>To conclude, unreaſonable and unjuſt Propoſitions may continue the War, and the diſtractions; never make a peace, which is nothing, but the liberty to injoy what in juſtice and right is our due; and as long as the world laſts, that Anſwer of the Ambaſſadour from <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernum</hi> to the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> will be found to be reaſon, who when he was asked what peace the Romans might depend upon with them, (becauſe they had been guilty of ſome defection) anſwered, <hi>Si bonam dederitis, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
