            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT being the manner of thoſe who
Write, to acquaint the Reader
with the Deſign of the Book;
if I had any in Publiſhing this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
your Divertiſement, it was
chiefly to make the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and
<hi>Religiouſneſs</hi> of a People eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Barbarous, Rude,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,</hi>
to reflect upon their Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
who would be reckon'd
for the only <hi>Illuminati</hi> of both.
And to ſhew that this <hi>Unlick'd,
<pb facs="tcp:53922:6"/>
Uncultivated People</hi> agree with
the <hi>wiſeſt Nati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> in making the
care of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> to
ſuppreſs <hi>Vice</hi> and encourage <hi>Virtue,</hi>
as the only method to make a State
happy.</p>
            <p>It was one of the <hi>Pedantick</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of the <hi>Grecians</hi> to repute all
<hi>Barbarous</hi> but themſelves; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
there are ſome who have the
ſame Opinion of every thing that is
diverſe from the Manners and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of their own Country, yet thoſe
who acknowledge <hi>Humanity</hi> in all
its Habits, may in peruſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
made upon theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
meet with ſomething that may <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi>
the <hi>Title,</hi> and induce them to
think, that what is commonly call'd
<pb facs="tcp:53922:6"/>
               <hi>Barbarous,</hi> is but a different Mode
of <hi>Civility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Truth of what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
I have us'd an Induſtry as
probable to enſure me thereof, as the
nature of the Subject would give me
leave. Having firſt travel'd the
Country, and remark'd as much as
ſuch an occaſion would afford, and
then retain'd a <hi>Converſation</hi> with
ſuch Perſons, both <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi>
as I found beſt able to encreaſe and
amend my firſt Remarks. So that
they are not barely the Occaſionals of
a <hi>Journey,</hi> nor ſcrap'd up from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Diſcourſes,</hi> but the reſult of
ſome Years <hi>Inſpection</hi> into the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of whom I write; and that I
might not diſ-ingeniouſly impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:53922:7"/>
your Belief, I have not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf with a ſingle Teſt, but
have rejected ſeveral Paſſages which
have not had a ſufficient <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
It being not my intent to be
known for Writing things ſtrange
and <hi>Romantick,</hi> but to be very
<hi>civil</hi> to the World, in putting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon them but what is Firm
and Solid.</p>
            <p>As for the Dreſs wherein they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
(though perhaps ſuitable enough
for the matter) I have been therein
ſo negligent as not greatly to regard
it, except in the Narrative to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<hi>coherence.</hi> For I conceived,
I was not to preſent you with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of a Nation as <hi>I made them,</hi>
but as they were in <hi>themſelves,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53922:7"/>
which could ſcarcely be done, but by
expoſing them (thus) <hi>naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Narrative of the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that for which to
ſome I may ſeem the leſs accountable,
becauſe I inſinuate a want of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Records among the Moors, out
of which it was to have been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
But there was no ſuch great
need of thoſe Aſſiſtances in Penning
the Annals of our Age; and the
Narrative aſcends no higher then
the Period of the <hi>Xeriffian</hi> Family,
and the Diviſion of <hi>Kiram</hi>'s <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the Crown of <hi>Morocco,</hi>
which are very freſh in the minds of
the <hi>Moors.</hi> And yet for the clearer
Certainty herein, I have had the
aſſiſtance of ſome Ancient obſerving
<pb facs="tcp:53922:8"/>
               <hi>Moors,</hi> who were Actors in the
late Revolves. But my best help
I had, was from an Aged, Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
noting Perſon, an <hi>Hebrew
Sabio,</hi> one <hi>Joſeph Meſſias,</hi> who
for many Years had been Secretary
of <hi>Tituan,</hi> and with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
had obſerved <hi>Memoirs</hi> of
what a long time had happened in
that part of <hi>Barbary.</hi> In what
concerns the War between <hi>Gaylan</hi>
and <hi>Taffilet,</hi> I confeſs I am not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular, becauſe much thereof
related to <hi>Tanger;</hi> but what is
here wanting, may be ſupplyed in
the modern Story of that Ancient
City.</p>
            <p>How far I have been from Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
<hi>Leo Afer,</hi> which ſome may
<pb facs="tcp:53922:8"/>
ſuſpect, will eaſily appear by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what is contain'd in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
of <hi>Weſt Barbary,</hi> with his
Deſcription of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I have not ſpoken more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their Colleges, needs no other
excuſe, than that they now uſe none;
and the like may be anſwer'd for
my ſilence of their Libraries. And
how famous ſoever <hi>Mauritania Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitana</hi>
hath been in former Ages
for a Race of <hi>Literati,</hi> yet now there
is little hope to ſee a Reſtauration of
their Studies, if it be conſidered
what ſmall regard the preſent <hi>Moors</hi>
bear to Learning: Which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
from <hi>Cidi Abdella, Gaylan's</hi>

the <hi>Moors</hi> were not very fond of
Bookiſh Inclinations, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
addicted either to Military or
Mechanick Employments: and when
I read to him out of <hi>Don Diego
Savedra Taxardo</hi> (in the 66th of
his <hi>Empreſſas Politicas)</hi> how that
a Learned Age might have as little
Valour as Devotion: That all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
was ſuperfluous which taught
the People more than to <hi>Obey, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
Travel,</hi> and <hi>Conquer:</hi> That
great Diſcurſiſts were apt to intrigue
Affairs, diſpute the Princes Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

it was the best Obedience, which was
rather Credulous then Inquiſitive:

That the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, ſo much
enrich'd with the Spoils, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated

of <hi>Barbary,</hi> ſhall not be
derived beyond the <hi>Annals</hi> of
our own <hi>Memory.</hi> For whoſe
clearer introduction, the contexture of
affaires invites us to ſtep back to the
notorious <hi>change,</hi> which hapned about
the year 1508. Near which time the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
Familie</hi> approaching to its deſign'd
period and determination, it fortun'd
that a certain <hi>Alfachi,</hi> or <hi>Moriſh Priest,</hi>
in the Province of <hi>Dara,</hi> began to grow
into great reputation with the people,
by reaſon of his <hi>high pretentions</hi> to <hi>piety</hi>

by a ſtubborn rigidity of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53922:14"/>
and <hi>outward ſanctity</hi> of life. <hi>His</hi> firſt
name was <hi>Mahumet Ben Amet;</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be deſcended from their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
he cauſed himſelf to be called
<hi>Zeriffe:</hi> A <hi>Title</hi> which the Kindred of
that <hi>Impostor</hi> have appropriated to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and made the <hi>character</hi> of that
whole <hi>Family.</hi> The credit of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Pedegree,</hi> was another <hi>Engine</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

               </p>
               <p>The great applauſe and approbation

kindled in him no leſs an Ambition then

a very <hi>Hypocondriacal deſigne,</hi> had it not

deſirous of <hi>Novelties,</hi> and ſenſible of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,

as high contemplative looks, deep ſighes,
tragical geſtures, and other paſſionate
<hi>Interjections</hi> of <hi>Holineſs</hi> could expreſs;
<hi>Alà, Alà</hi> was their doleful note, their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance
the peoples <hi>Almes.</hi> Their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
received them with content and joy,
and perceiving the favour and opinion of
the people toward him, to continue the
ſame as at the firſt, he reſolved to make
uſe thereof, and thereupon ſent <hi>Abnet</hi>
and <hi>Mahumet</hi> to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Fez,</hi> where
they were kindly received by the too <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
King,</hi> who made the elder, <hi>Preſident</hi>
of the famous <hi>Colledge Amadorac,</hi> and the

thus in favour at <hi>Court,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi>
with the people, by the Councel of their
Father, they deſired leave of the <hi>King</hi> to
diſplay a <hi>Banner</hi> againſt the <hi>Christians;</hi>
induceing him to believe, that they would
eaſily draw the <hi>Portugal Moors</hi> to their
party; and by that means ſecure the

Kings brother, reſiſted the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>tion,
warning the <hi>King</hi> not to arme this name
of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> which being once <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi>
might grow <hi>inſolent,</hi> and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of <hi>Duty</hi> in minding a Kingdome.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53922:15"/>
He told him likewiſe that War makes men
awleſs, and that through <hi>popularity,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
became ambitious and ſtudious of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.</hi>
But the King intoxicated with
the Opinion of theſe <hi>Pilgrims Sanctity,</hi>
rejected his Brothers neceſſary cautions,
and gave them a <hi>Banner</hi> and <hi>Drum,</hi> with
<hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Credence</hi> to the <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Barbary,</hi> with twenty horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to attend them. Many Wonderful
ſucceſſes awaited upon their <hi>actions,</hi> and
all things thrived ſo well under their
conduct, that at laſt the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> who
all along applauded his own Victories in
theirs, began to diſtaſt them. And ſeeing
they had poyſoned the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi>
and made <hi>Amet Zeriff</hi> to be proclaimed
King in his ſtead, he miſtruſted his own
ſafety, and began but too late to repent
his approveing of an <hi>armed hypocriſie.
Puft up</hi> with their <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> they forgot
their <hi>obedience,</hi> and theſe <hi>Saints</hi> deny
the King the fifth part of their ſpoyles,
and only ſent him ſix Horſes and ſix Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
and thoſe lean and ill ſhapen. The
<hi>King</hi> demands his dues, but they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That ſeeing they were lawful ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
to <hi>Mahumet,</hi> they ought to pay no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53922:16"/>
man <hi>Tribute,</hi> and that they had more right
in <hi>Affrica</hi> then himſelf; but if he would
reſpect them as his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Allies,</hi>
they were not froward to embrace him
under that quality; but if he expected
any more at their hands, they doubted
not, but as they had had power to <hi>offend</hi>
the <hi>Christians,</hi> they ſhould not be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
in defending of themſelves; By
which it appeared, that they took up
<hi>Armes,</hi> not out of <hi>Love</hi> to their <hi>Country</hi>
and zeale for their Religion, but out of
a deſire of Rule.</p>
               <p>The ſword by both ſides was choſen
to umpire the conteſt, which awarded
for the <hi>Zeriffs.</hi> For upon the encounter
of both the Armies, the <hi>Feſſan</hi> Forces af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long and doubtful Battle were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated;
and the <hi>Zeriffs</hi> ſo well impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the victory, that in few moons they
became the uncontrouled <hi>Lords</hi> of the
Kingdoms of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> in whoſe
<hi>Government</hi> their <hi>Family</hi> continued a
conſiderable ſumme of years. But not
with out deſtructive <hi>Hostilities</hi> among
themſelves; the Deſcendents pulling
down each other by the like treacheries,
that advanced their Anceſtors: <hi>The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53922:16"/>
thief stil leading the leſs to the Gallows.</hi>
Their Rebellions appeared under the
ſpecious pretences of mending ſome
faults in Government, and one <hi>Cozin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
another, under the pleaſing diſguiſe
of ſetting up a gentler and more orderly
<hi>Dominion;</hi> forgetting that it is ſafer to
permit ſome inconveniences in the outer
buildings, then to pull the whole ſtructure
down; There being corruptions which
may ſafelier be <hi>continued</hi> then <hi>removed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding theſe <hi>Civil Wars,</hi>
the power ſtill remained in the ſame <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,</hi>
and the diſſention of the branches
proceeded not ſo farr as to cut down the
tree. And yet about the year 1607. the
<hi>Zeriffian Houſe</hi> ſeem'd neer an extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by reaſon of <hi>Boféres</hi> and <hi>Sidans</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<hi>Muley Sheck</hi> their elder Brother
in his ſucceſſion. But <hi>Muley Sheck</hi> and
<hi>Boféres</hi> dying in the warrs, <hi>Morocco</hi> was
left to <hi>Abdalla</hi> ſon of <hi>Muley Sheck,</hi> who
ſcarce warm'd the throne, till he was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
pull'd thence by his Uncle <hi>Sidan,</hi>
and by an unintended kindneſs freed
from the troubles of a <hi>Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Muley Sidan</hi> once more joyned
<hi>Fez</hi> with <hi>Morocco,</hi> and in himſelf made
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53922:17"/>
the <hi>Zeriffian Family</hi> to reigne over both.
But he was much infeſted both by Land
and Sea. For <hi>Abdela</hi> a Religious <hi>Hermit,</hi>
and <hi>Hean,</hi> one of like hypocriſie and zeal,
two oppoſite <hi>factions</hi> diſtreſſed him at
Land, and the <hi>Pyrates</hi> of <hi>Salla</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier</hi>
by Sea. But his great valour main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
him againſt both. For by his own
Arms he pacifyed the tumults at Land,
and by the aſſiſtance of the Engliſh
Shipping, he deſtroyed the Pyrats of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
which ſo much diſquieted the <hi>Ocean.</hi>
And this being done he ſent to have the

obſerving the duties we owe to God,

Pardon me Sir, this is not to
inſtruct, for I know I ſpeake to one

God hath pleaſed to grant me a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

moleſted the peaceful trade of Europe;
and hath preſented further occaſion

Herein whileſt we interrupt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption

period of twenty Months in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And it is remarkable that <hi>Muley
Shek</hi> pretended to no vengeance of his
eldeſt Brothers death in that of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
but that he acted it only cut of an
itch to obtain the Government, ſeconded
with a ſuſpition of his own ſafety; which
could not be great, while his Brother
might juſtly fear him as a Rival for the
Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53922:21"/>
                  <hi>Muley Sheck</hi> being the laſt of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and thereby without any to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
him, he ſtudied to make both
his Government and Perſon gratious to
the people. In which artifice he was ſo
proſperous, that no Sultan in <hi>Barbary</hi>
had equal'd him in a confluence of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
The Skie of his Reigne was for
nineteen years ſerene: and there were
no prognoſticks of alteration in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
till <hi>Laella,</hi> one of his Wives,
began to be exorbitant in her appetites,
and to meditate diſloyalty to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
Bed. She is reported to have been
a woman of a refined ſubtilty, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the moſt artful methods of ſteale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her pleaſures. But at length ſhe fell
exceſſively enamour'd of her own kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
one <hi>Cidi Kirum,</hi> whom the King
had adopted into his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi>
This <hi>Kirum</hi> was of a popular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
and skilful in feeding the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the people. He had been at
<hi>Mecha</hi> in Devotion, and of courſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for that <hi>viſitation</hi> the title of <hi>Hadge,</hi>
granted to all that have performed the
<hi>Hage,</hi> or Pilgrimage to their Prophets
Tomb. By this, and a great ſhew of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53922:22"/>
Religion, he had with men of all
capacities purchaſed a ſignificant repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And albeit he was a wel-wiſher
to an Innovation, the common deſigne
of their pretended Piety, yet the preſent
face of affaires look'd very diſagreeable
upon ſuch an enterpriſe. For the King
ſo rul'd, that all had cauſe to love, and
none to feare him, and the courteouſneſs
of his perſonal behaviour, had ſecured
him a large ſhare in the worſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
boſoms; His cuſtom being to puniſh
and ſpare none, who were convict offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
againſt their Law, the known Rule
both of their Religion and Politie. And
for the greater diſcouragement of
all commotions, the <hi>Zeriffian</hi> name
was grown ſacred with the Moors,
through its long continuance: and they
concluded its proſperity a Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of its Right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kirum</hi> no doubt was ſtill as coveteous
to enjoy the Crown, as <hi>Laella</hi> his Bed;
whoſe amours at laſt grew to that height
of impatience, that nothing could quiet
them, but the embraces of her Paramour
in a Regal State; which ſhe plotted
with a feminine invention. The death of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53922:22"/>
the King her Husband was the only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<hi>Recipe</hi> for her diſtemper, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of an unſafe accompliſhment, if
enterpriſed by open violence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe is reported to have eſſayed his
Death by Sorcery's; in which wickedneſs
(Story tels us) that the Mahumetan Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have alwaies been dexterous. But
not preciſely to determine, by what way
<hi>Muley Hamet Sheck</hi> came to his Grave,
it is certain that his end was ſuddain
and unexpected, and that he ſhut up his
life before he had ſeen the twentieth
yeare of his Reign. His deceaſe was
much lamented, and the more becauſe it
came unſuſpected. The Government
lineally deſcended upon his Son <hi>Muley
Labèſh,</hi> a child of three years old, whom
his dying Father bequeath'd to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of <hi>Kirum El Hadge,</hi> and other
Grandees of the Kingdome, appointing
them to adminiſter the affaires of State
in <hi>Labèſh</hi>'s name, till he was come to
the age of eleven years. In which time
<hi>Kirum</hi> was ſo balanc'd with his fellow
Regents, that he durſt not attempt the
leaſt alteration. But ſuch was the crafty
conduct of his demeanor, that he had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53922:23"/>
made many of the <hi>Almocadens</hi> among the
<hi>Alàrbs</hi> to be his <hi>creatures</hi> and ready at
his Devotion, and of whoſe aſſiſtance
he might rely, when he ſaw it convenient
to time a Revolution: which he deferr'd
to the entrance of the ſecond yeare of
<hi>Labèſh's</hi> reigne, being the thirteenth of
his age. At which time <hi>Kirum</hi> ſecretly
retired from Court, and was not heard
of, till he appear'd in the head of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Army of <hi>Alàrbs,</hi> whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
into Rebellion with the promiſes
of large Incoms, the baite diſloyalty ſtill
leaps at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Labèſh</hi> quickly took the Alarm, and
with conſiderable Forces marcht toward
<hi>Kirum,</hi> if poſſible to end the Warr in the
place where it was begun. The Moors
highly extol the valour and conduct of
this young King, who forgetting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and toys of that age, devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the ſeverities of Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
conſtantly watching in the Camp,
or courageouſly fighting in the Battel.
For four years His fortunes and <hi>Kirum</hi>'s
had their viciſſitudes, for ſo long they
fought with dubious preſages of the
event; till Treachery at laſt is ſaid to have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53922:23"/>
given <hi>Kirum</hi> that conqueſt which cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
could not; for <hi>Labèſh</hi> being invited
by <hi>Kirum</hi> to receive his Recantation,
met with a Barbarous death, where he
hoped to receive a Loyal ſubjection.
Others report that <hi>Kirum</hi> ſlew him with
his own hands in that fatal Battel, which
proved the finiſhing overthrow.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Labèſh, Kirum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
too powerful for the reſiſtance of
his ſcattered Forces, haveing none left
under whoſe conduct they might venture
their laſt Efforts; ſo that now all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
being removed with the King,
<hi>Kirum</hi> made a quiet march to <hi>Morocco,</hi>
where the Citizens received him with
all the ſignifications of ſubjection, in
whoſe imitation the adjoyning <hi>Cavílas</hi>
brought in the pledges of their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to <hi>Kirum:</hi> which they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit,
till by a natural death he reſign'd
the Kingdom to his Son <hi>Muley Boucar,</hi>
who after the ſhort reigne of three
months was dethron'd by <hi>Taffalete,</hi> of
which Revolution more will be ſaid in
the ſtory of that prevailing <hi>Zeriff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Moors having for a long ſeaſon
been torn and diſtracted with the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53922:24"/>
Murders of <hi>Sidans</hi> Sons, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out with following thoſe Wars,
which had no juſter cauſes then private
intereſts and envious Annimoſities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
at laſt to provide for their own peace
and ſafety. The adored <hi>Zeriffian</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was extinct in <hi>Labèſh,</hi> whereby they
were quitted from obedience to that
Race. <hi>Kirum</hi> by ſeveral of the <hi>great ones</hi>
living diſtant from the Court, was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as one, both by unjuſtneſs of
title, and meanneſs of Pedegree, unfit to
receive their Allegiance. In this ſhaken
and doubtful State of affairs, ſome ſtood
neuter in their judgements, but outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complyed with the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
others reſolved to ſtand upon
their Guard, chooſeing rather to run the
hazards of War, then to enjoy the ſafety
of a diſhonourable Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cidi Hamet-Ali-Haiáſhi, Cidi Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Ben-el Hadge-Ben-Boucar,</hi> and the
<hi>Zeriff</hi> of <hi>Benzaruel</hi> were the <hi>Chiefs</hi> in
theſe new commotions, but all oppoſite
factions, and all <hi>Alarbs,</hi> and all great
Saints: The laſt of the three contented
himſelf with the protection of <hi>Ben Zaru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
a large Cavíla almoſt impregnable
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53922:24"/>
by nature, in whoſe Government his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
for many years had lived in
peace. But after two months of ſtout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
was ſubdued by <hi>Tafilete;</hi> who
took with him the Aged <hi>Zeriff,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
his Family, of which there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
will be an opportunity of ſpeaking
more in another paragraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haiáſhi</hi> and <hi>Ben-Boucar,</hi> gifted with
greater ambitions, laboured to enlarge
the Curtains of their Territories, and
each ſeem'd to aime at no leſs then
the Empire of Mauritania Tingitana.
Their outward Sanctimony equald them
in the peoples affection and eſteem, and if
they could have reconciled their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts,
and joyned in the ſame deſigne, they
had ſhared that ſtate, which both loſt,
while each would have all or none: of
whoſe riſe and fall theſe ſucceeding pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
will give you information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cidi Hamet Ali Haiáſhi</hi> was an <hi>Alarb,</hi>
(or one of that ſort of <hi>Moors,</hi> who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Tents and in Mountains, without any
fixed habitations, as I ſhall ſhew in my
notices upon this Country,) who had the
learning of a <hi>Talib,</hi> and ſanctity of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabout;</hi>
by which he was eſteemed as an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53922:25"/>
Oracle among his Countrymen, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Emergent occaſions repaired unto
him for advice and Inſtruction; which
they received as Infallible, and obey'd
as a Law. His Parentage according to
the <hi>Moreſco Heraldry</hi> was not obſcure;
for the Government of <hi>Abenimálec</hi> was
Hereditary to his Family, and legally
deſcended to his poſſeſſion. Which <hi>Abeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>málec</hi>
being a very large Cavíla, upon the
river of <hi>Mamora,</hi> was by <hi>Haiaſhi</hi> gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with that politick carriage, which
made him reverenced of his own people,
and fear'd of his neighbours, as appear'd
in their ready abetting his enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>The late ſuſpected death of <hi>Muley
Sheck,</hi> together with the violent murther,
and dethroning of his Son, both <hi>Haiaſhi's</hi>
beloved Soveraigns, made <hi>Kirum,</hi> whom
he ſuppoſed to have been as well the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
contriver of the firſt, as he ſaw him
the open acter of the ſecond villany, to
be odious to his thoughts, and unfit for
his obedience. Revenge, whoſe lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is an Article in the Moors Creed,
put <hi>Haiaſhi</hi> into Arms, with intent, if
not to depoſe <hi>Kirum</hi> from being King,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53922:25"/>
yet at leaſt keep himſelf from becoming
his Subject. His firſt Muſters conſiſted
ownly of the Levies of his own <hi>Cavíla,</hi>
to which were daily acceſsions of the
Neighboring <hi>Almócadens,</hi> which helpt
to adjuſt his Inſurrection. His Forces
being ſoon increaſed above his hopes,
he order'd his March toward <hi>Fez,</hi> the
Metropolis of the Kingdom of that name.
This ancient City was now govern'd by
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bahà, Kirums</hi> Creature; who upon
the advance of <hi>Haiáſhi</hi>'s Forces, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtole away to <hi>Morocco,</hi> as not daring
to truſt himſelf to his own valour, or
the fidelity of the Citizens. By the
flight of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bahà, Fez</hi> being left Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norleſs,
it became the eaſie Atchievement
of <hi>Haiáſhi;</hi> under whoſe Command it
continued ſeven Years, and was a fair
addition to his Greatneſs and Safety,
being (as was ſaid) the Metropolis of the
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haiáſhi</hi> by his Succeſſes began to be
the envy of <hi>Ben-Boucar,</hi> who for ſome
Years after his Revolt from <hi>Morocco,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
himſelf with the ſolitary Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Záwia,</hi> where he lived in a
Houſe of that name, which for its Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53922:26"/>
Foundation, was become a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
or Refuge for Offenders. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Záwia</hi> are reported to be
very numerous and Warlike, yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of remoteneſs, they created <hi>Haiáſhi</hi>
very ſmall Diſturbances; beſides, <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi>
was unwilling to refer himſelf
to the uncertain Deciſion of the Sword,
which, in all probability, muſt have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Victory to <hi>Haiáſhi,</hi> by whoſe
Forces he was far exceeded. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
betook himſelf to Stratagem, and
conſults with <hi>Ali Ben Hamet, Almocaden</hi> of
<hi>Saphían,</hi> one whom <hi>Haiáſhi</hi> had not yet
entirely ſubdued, by what method their
common Enemy might be removed. Now
the <hi>Moors,</hi> in removal of thoſe they hate,
ſeem to know no other Policies, beſides
an armed Violence, and ſecret Maſſacre.
The two Conſpirators ſaw their inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to undertake the former, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſolved to put the latter in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ali Ben Hamet</hi> greedy of that ſweet
bit Revenge, and to expreſs it upon <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>áſhi,</hi>
who had diſpoiled him of his Right,
uudertook to be his Aſſaſinate: which
he thus effected. <hi>Haiáſhi</hi> being lodged
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53922:26"/>
in his Tent near <hi>Azount,</hi> a Fountain he
greatly eſteemed in the <hi>Cavíla</hi> of <hi>Atcleik,</hi>
about ſix Leagues North of <hi>Alcazàr,</hi> was
in the Night viſited by <hi>Ali,</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with about 70 Horſe, who came not
with any ſhew of Hoſtility, but with a
pretence of Friendſhip, declaring, That
his Errand was deſign'd to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<hi>Haiáſhies</hi> Subject, and to receive the
continuance of his <hi>Cavíla</hi> from his hand.
Under this Cloak <hi>Haiáſhi</hi> received him
into his Tent, and thereby gave him the
opportunity of Murthering him, which
he effected with one Stab. The Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
had his Accomplices ready to
make his Eſcape, which was the leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
becauſe <hi>Haiáſhi</hi> had no Guards,
which he had declined either to ſave
Charges, or diſſemble his confidence
in <hi>the Moors, who are best made faithful
by being trusted; but very vindictive,
when they find themſelves ſuſpected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi> being aſcertain'd by <hi>Ali</hi>
of <hi>Haiáſhies</hi> treacherous Slaughter, in
the Twelfth Year of his Revolt, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cèſſantly
marcht to take Poſſeſſion of his
Country, which he found ready at his
Devotion; either becauſe the People
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53922:27"/>
were unprovided for Oppoſition; or,
that they thought <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi>'s Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
was leſs obnoxious to exception,
then any other they could elect. The
<hi>Almócadens,</hi> mindful of their accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
method to preſerve their Commands,
ſecretly one after another ſubſcribed to
<hi>Ben-Boucar</hi>'s Regiment; onely <hi>Fez</hi> and
<hi>Alcazàr</hi> coſt him ſome time and Blood in
their Reduction. But at laſt they yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Articles, <hi>Arzila</hi> having firſt
ſhown them the way. <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi>'s next
March was to <hi>Tituan,</hi> govern'd by the
Ancient and Worthy Family of the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
out of which he had received a Wife,
and by that Relation was welcome to the
Supremacie of that City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi> having brought this part
of <hi>Barbary</hi> to his ſubjection, reſolved
to return to <hi>Záwia:</hi> But before he left
the Country, he took from the Grandees
thereof, the beſt Aſſurances he was able
for their Obedience and Fidelity. Next,
he diſpoſed the Towns of greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
to the Government of his Sons
and Favorites. To his eldeſt Son <hi>Abdal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
he entruſted the Rule of <hi>Salla,</hi> which
he had obſerved proner to Sedition then
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53922:27"/>
the reſt, and yet much addicted to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
famed for Piety, for which <hi>Abdalla</hi>
was arrived at a Saintſhip. To his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Son <hi>Mahumed,</hi> he committed the
care of <hi>Fez,</hi> to whom he ſaw the People
thereof have a peculiar Inclination. To
his third Son <hi>Hamet Zéer,</hi> or <hi>Hamet the
leſs,</hi> he gave the command of <hi>Shehàll,</hi> a
Mountain of rude Inhabitants, yet much
addicted to obey a fierce nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Hamet Zéer</hi> was furniſhed. <hi>Arzila</hi>
he left to <hi>Benzèir, a Thing of his own
framing:</hi> And <hi>Alcazar</hi> to <hi>Cidi Benzían.</hi>
After this Partition, he returned to his
Religious <hi>Záwia,</hi> where in great Peace
he enjoyed the fruits of his War, making
the eaſineſs of his Yoak an argument
with the People to bear it.</p>
               <p>But the memory of <hi>Haiáſhi</hi>'s trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
Death (compaſſed by <hi>Ben-Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car)</hi>
was ſtill freſh in the Breſts of thoſe
Sons, whoſe Fathers had their Fortunes
thereby depreſs'd; which <hi>Ben-Boucar,</hi>
as he could not but know, ſo he could
not but conclude, <hi>That the vindictive
Spirit of a</hi> Moor <hi>would take the first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of avenging.</hi> In prevention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he took with him to <hi>Záwia</hi> ſuch Sons
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53922:28"/>
as he ſaw were likelieſt to inherit their
Fathers hatred againſt him; not as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages
of Peace, but as Pledges of his
Care, whom being as yet in their non-age,
he loved to Print with the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of a peaceable acquieſcence in his
Authority. Among theſe Youths, young
<hi>Gaylan</hi> was moſt conſiderable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the only Perſon that he detained:
whoſe Story now ſucceeds, in which will
be ſupplyed what is here wanting of <hi>Ben-Boucar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Beniworfut,</hi> near to <hi>Arzila,</hi> lived
the Family of the <hi>Gaylans,</hi> which was
of that ſort of <hi>Moors</hi> ſtiled <hi>Barabàrs,</hi> and
to which through flux of time, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of that <hi>Cavíla</hi> was become He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary.
This Houſe (though never low
or obſcure) began to be ſignally advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in <hi>Ali Gaylan</hi> the Father, which
proved but a Propheſie of its downfall
in <hi>El Hader</hi> the Son; whoſe Ambitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

loſt what the others Humility had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<hi>Ali</hi> was in great favor with <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>áſhi,</hi>
and a chief Engine of his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which he was obſerved not
much to endeavor his own. But his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Renown ſprang from his Zeal for the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53922:28"/>
                  <hi>Mahumetan Law,</hi> an Artifice which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
failes, &amp; a knack with which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is gifted, cannot want Reverence
among the <hi>Moors. Arzila</hi> being much
moved with his Sanctity, invited him to
a reſidence among them, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with conſiderable Rents, and
great Teſtimonies of reſpect.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ali Gaylan</hi> ſpent the laſt Scene
of his Life with great ſatisfaction to
<hi>Haiáſhi</hi>'s proſperity, whom at his Death
he left without any threatning Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
of an alteration in his State: But
when he grew ſenſible of the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of his end, he called for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<hi>El Hader,</hi> to whom he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the care of his Family, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his <hi>Cavlla,</hi> imitation of his
Converſation and Faith to <hi>Haiáſhi. El
Hader</hi> was too young for the undertaking
all this when his Father dyed, which
cauſed the provident Parent to leave him
to the careful Tuition of <hi>Hamet Benzían,
Almocadèn</hi> of <hi>Beni-Haròs,</hi> with whom he
remained, till removed thence by <hi>Ben-Boucar,</hi>
after the reducement of <hi>Haiáſhi.</hi>
About the xxiii of his Age, this <hi>El Hader
Ben Ali Gaylan,</hi> was married to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53922:29"/>
Daughter of one <hi>Akadim,</hi> a principal
Man in <hi>Beniworfut,</hi> upon which Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
he had licenſe to return home; a
Conceſsion that proved very fatal to
<hi>Ben-Boucar.</hi> For <hi>El Hader</hi> being got
to his own Territories, where he received
an affectionate wellcome; there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a Commotion in the populous <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>víla</hi>'s
of <hi>Saphean, Sháwia,</hi> and <hi>Homàr,</hi>
(all <hi>Alarbes)</hi> which denyed to pay <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi>
the accuſtomed Rights, &amp; were ſo
far from an obedient tender thereof, that
they inhumanely murthered his two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Abdelhálac</hi> and <hi>Miſsínievi,</hi> whom
he ſent to demand them.</p>
               <p>The news of this Inſurrection quickly
arrived <hi>El Hader,</hi> who thereupon, with
ſome of the beſt Horſe of his <hi>Cavíla,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
poſted to <hi>Alcazar,</hi> where accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Intelligence he met with <hi>Ali Ben
Hamet, Haiáſhi</hi>'s Murtherer, whom with
his own hand he killed, in revenge of the
Murther he had committed upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Friend: In whoſe death, he pull'd
down one of <hi>Ben-Boucars</hi> beſt Support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in this Canton of his Dominion. Next
he ſpeeded to <hi>Arzíla,</hi> forſaken by <hi>Ben-Boucars</hi>
Alcáyde, who upon the tydings
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53922:29"/>
of <hi>Hamets</hi> death, and the <hi>Alárbes</hi> revolt,
durſt not truſt himſelf among a People
whom he ſaw zealouſly to favor his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Enemy.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Gaylan</hi> appeared at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zíla,</hi>
which was very acceptable to his
Fathers old Admirers, who readily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him their utmoſt Aſsiſtances, and
were ſeconded with ſeveral of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Cavíla</hi>'s. <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi> coming to
chaſtize the ſeditious <hi>Alárbes,</hi> and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
his Brothers blood, which he ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
diſpatc'd; his next care was to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Gaylan</hi> ſenſible of his Deportment,
who, upon his advance, took ſanctuary
in <hi>Arzíla,</hi> where he lay immured, till ſuch
time as neceſsity forced <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi> to
withdraw his Levies. Upon every ſuch
retreat, <hi>Gaylan</hi> was ſtill at his wonted
diſturbances, and yet upon every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the Enemy, he betook himſelf
to the protection of <hi>Arzila;</hi> Out of
which nothing could fetch him, but a
cloſe, tedious, and expenſive Siege, a
thing ill agreeing with the <hi>Moors</hi> Cuſtom
and Proviſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ben-Boucar,</hi> weary of that Fatigue, in
which for ſome Years he had been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53922:30"/>
and whereof he ſaw no end, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<hi>Gaylan</hi> this Accommodation: That
if he would pay him the accuſtomary
Tributes, and an acknowledgement of
ſuperiority, he ſhould peaceably poſſeſs
the Government of <hi>Arzila,</hi> and his own
<hi>Cavíla. Gaylan</hi> was not backward to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
an Accommodation ſo favorable to
his preſent Condition and future De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
being at that time ſhut up in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zila,</hi>
and yet entertaining an ambition
of making himſelf Lord of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
This accommodation being rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,
<hi>Ben-Boucar</hi> returned home, and
<hi>Gaylan</hi> was ſet at liberty to take his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
in the Countrey, where his
plauſible Fortune and Perſonage, Zeal
for their Law, and reſervation of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
made the Grandees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
greatly affected with his Society.
<hi>Gaylan</hi> finding himſelf under ſo favorable
an Aſpect, thought of Strengthning his
Intentions by contracting Alliances with
the beſt <hi>Casts:</hi> whereupon he took him
a ſecond Wife, a Daughter of <hi>Caſſian
Shot Almocadèm</hi> of the <hi>Cavila</hi> called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gera,</hi>
a Warlike Family, and deſcended
of the <hi>Andaluſian</hi> Moors baniſhed <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53922:30"/>
His third Wife was the Daughter of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gèr
Alcáyde</hi> of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> and a leading
Perſon in that part of the Countrey.
His fourth was a Virgin Daughter of
<hi>Múfadal,</hi> Governor of <hi>Tituan,</hi> which
made up the <hi>legal number</hi> of <hi>four,</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
being allowed by their Prophet: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the death of his ſecond Wife, to keep
up the account, he marryed the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of one <hi>Meſſimd,</hi> a popular Perſon in
<hi>Tituàn,</hi> and deſcended of a Saint.</p>
               <p>By theſe Alliances he got an Intereſt
both in the Perſons and Places of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
moment in this part of the Countrey,
by which he was animated to break with
<hi>Ben-Boucar:</hi> a deſign of ſuch nature,
that <hi>Gaylan</hi> durſt not venture thereon
in any open Declaration, but adviſedly
diſguiſed it under a pretended Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
againſt the Chriſtians, Garriſon'd
in ſeveral Towns on the <hi>Barbary</hi> Coaſt,
maintained by the Crowns of <hi>Portugal</hi>
and <hi>Spain.</hi> Which to effect the better,
he firſt ſhewed the <hi>Moors</hi> how their
Prophet, both by his <hi>Example</hi> and
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> had taught them to exerciſe
their Revenge againſt all Oppoſers of his
<hi>Law;</hi> and that whoever ſhould dye in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53922:31"/>
its Defenſe or Propagation, were aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of Paradiſe; and then concluded,
how much it would redound to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of that Generation, if they ſhould
drive the Chriſtians out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
to <hi>which</hi> and their Religion they
were the <hi>common Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Propoſal was ſtrangely moving
with People of all capacities, and the
report of <hi>Gaylans</hi> Intentions againſt the
Chriſtians, induced many to be his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
who otherwiſe would have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed
his Company: But having drawn
in ſome by his Affinity, others with fair
Promiſes, and the generality with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Pretences, he began a little to
pull aſide the Vail, and ſhew the naked
Face of his Deſign. Having given ſome
Teſtimonies of his Zeal and Valour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Chriſtians, and enraged them
to an activity above what they had of late
expreſſed: He likewiſe laid before them
their neceſsity of Union, and that they
ſhould combine under one Leader, the
better to carry on what they had begun.
He alſo ſet before them their unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to be governed by one whom <hi>age</hi>
and <hi>distance</hi> render'd ſo unfit to relieve
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53922:31"/>
them, in caſe of ſudden neceſsity; and
withall magnifyed his Title to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Country, equal to <hi>Ben-Boucars.</hi>
The People found no reaſon
to diſpute any part of <hi>Gaylans</hi> Harangue,
in which they could perceive he aimed at
nothing but their ſafety. Whereupon
the <hi>Alcáyde</hi> of <hi>Alcaſar, El Hàders</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,
was the firſt that declared
for his Government, who was ſeconded
with ſeveral other Grandees of the
Countrey, ſo that in ſhort time all the
<hi>Cavíla</hi>'s which <hi>Ben-Boucar</hi> had taken
from <hi>Haiáſhi,</hi> left him as they had done
their former Maſter, and adhered to
<hi>Gaylan.</hi> But <hi>Sálla</hi> and <hi>Tituàn</hi> utterly
diſſented from the reſt, and inſtead of
yielding a tame ſubmiſsion to <hi>Gaylans</hi>
Empire, they altogether reſiſted him.
This moved <hi>El Hader</hi> to advance his
Forces firſt againſt <hi>Tituàn,</hi> which he
found very ſtubborn: for <hi>Abdel Crim
Nacſis</hi> (the chief Governor thereof)
would be inclined to no thoughts of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification</hi>
or <hi>Surrender,</hi> while he could
cheriſh any hopes of being relieved by
his near Relative <hi>Ben-Boucar.</hi> But at
length, deſpairing of any Succors, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53922:32"/>
ſeeing the great ſpoils <hi>Gaylan</hi> was like to
make of their Vineyards, Gardens, and
Houſes of Pleaſure about the Town,
which the Inhabitants highly valued for
their profit and delight, he ſought to
prevent him in that deſolation, by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and timely Addreſs for Peace:
which was welcome News to <hi>Gaylan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very covetous to be Maſter of a place
ſo conſiderable for Strength, Riches,
and Traffick. The Articles were ſoon
concluded, <hi>Gaylan</hi> demanding no more
then their ſubjection, a conſtant Levy of
Soldiers to ſerve him on occaſions of
greater moment; and that one of his
own Election ſhould be equal in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
with <hi>Nacſis.</hi> Upon this Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
with <hi>Tituan, Gaylan</hi> march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Sálla,</hi> which was under the Rule
of that great Saint, <hi>Abdala Ben-Boucar,</hi>
who upon weak Temptations retired to
the Caſtle, leaving <hi>Gaylan</hi> the Signory of
the Town, wherein he placed ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his own, to ſecure the Inhabitants
from Apoſtacy. But not long after, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dala</hi>
being ſore preſſed for want of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
and hopeleſs of being ſuccored
by his Father, privily quitted the Caſtle,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53922:32"/>
having firſt of all ſent away in an Engliſh
Frigat, his Wives to <hi>Phedálla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The gaining of this Caſtle made <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
ſole Maſter of this North Weſt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
of <hi>Barbary,</hi> beyond which he was
never able to enlarge his Territories; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he was ſtrugling for more room, as
foreſeeing that endeavors after more,
was the means to be ſecure of what he
had got already. He often tryed his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
upon the <hi>Xerif, Hamet Bocálla,</hi> chief
of <hi>Benzaruel,</hi> and <hi>Beni-Hálet,</hi> but his
Attempts ſtill proved ſucceſsleſs, for

never receiv'd any attempt of <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>'s

neither courage nor ambition to have
made himſelf Sultan of <hi>Barbary,</hi> yet his
Stars denyed him that Grandeur, and he
was never able to ſtretch his Arm beyond

living in Neighborhood and a ſetled

               <p>The above mentioned <hi>Cavíla</hi>'s were
the total of <hi>Gaylans</hi> Dominions, beyond

He was for the ſpace of twelve
Years proſperous in his Government, and
the general ſucceſs of his Enterpriſes,
raiſed him highly in the eſtimate of his
Followers: <hi>It being the Genius of this
People, to make the Proſperity of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>
                  <hi>Gaylan</hi> from his Youth was trained up

in Arms: And for the Adventures he had

But not to mention any thing of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
againſt the Chriſtian (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no deſign of this Paper) we find him
conſtantly in War with the <hi>Moor. Ben-Boucar</hi>
was ſtill Maſter of <hi>Fez,</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
upon every frail Temptation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Gaylans</hi> Frontiers, which kept them
both in continual Hoſtility. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at length wearied out with the inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Troubles occaſioned by theſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
for the Supremacy, were ready to
adhere to ſome third Party, able to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the Government in ſuch a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as both by Title and Strength ſhould
be above an ordinary Competitor:
Which unexpectedly came to paſs in the
Sixteen hundred and ſixty fifth of the
Crucifixion; for about the entrance of
that Year, <hi>Muley Reſhid</hi> firſt appeared
with the Prognoſticks of a Revolution,
of whom I here ſet down this ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>In the Province of <hi>Dara,</hi> in <hi>Numedia,</hi>
the Countrey of <hi>Mahumed Ben Amet,</hi>
Founder of the <hi>Xeriffian</hi> Empire, there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53922:35"/>
aroſe a <hi>Mulátto</hi> (one whoſe Father was
white, and Mother black) one <hi>Reſhid
Ben Mahumed,</hi> a Native of the Town of
<hi>Taffilete,</hi> the place whether <hi>Mahumed</hi>
(the ſecond Son of <hi>Mahumed Ben Amet)</hi>
the ſecond of that Family (who was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of <hi>Morocco)</hi> had confined his eldeſt
Brother <hi>Amet,</hi> whom he had taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.
This <hi>Reſhid</hi> ripening in Years
and diſcretion, began to make himſelf
known to the World by the name of the
<hi>Xeriff</hi> of <hi>Tafilete:</hi> By which Title he
made himſelf deſcended of the <hi>Xeriffian</hi>
Houſe, which ſo long had enjoyed the
Empire of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Mahumet. [Xeriff]</hi> (as was ſaid)
being a Name peculiar to that Deceiver.
And becauſe a reſearch into <hi>Moreſco</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neologies
ſhall have labour for the pains,
I ſhall enquire no further after <hi>Reſhids</hi>
Pedigree, then to obſerve that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was one <hi>Muley Mahumed,</hi> a Prince
of great Authority in <hi>Numedia,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his four legal Wives, had ſeveral
Concubines; of one of which, being
a <hi>Negra,</hi> he begot this <hi>Reſhid.</hi> His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dying while he was a minor, he was
committed to the Tuition of his Elder
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53922:36"/>
Brother <hi>Muley Hamet Ben-Mahumed.</hi>
This <hi>Reſhid</hi> having accompliſht his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillage,
began to look into his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to enquire what was left him by
his deceaſed Father: For by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſco</hi>
Inſtitutes, the Sons of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
are equal Sharers in the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with thoſe of the lawful Wives. While
<hi>Reſhid</hi> made himſelf the comparative of
his Brother, he was loſt into an Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
that ſpurr'd him into the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of promoting his Fortunes. He
ſaw his own Condition, and that of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs, qualified for no other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
to effect his deſired Advancement,
but what was to be obtained by the
Sword: Whereupon he conſulted with
his own <hi>Genius,</hi> by what Artifice he might
ſooneſt imbroil <hi>Barbary</hi> in a new War,
and communicated the Deſign with ſome
few <hi>Moors</hi> of his own Complexion. At
the firſt opening of his Adventure, his
Retinue exceeded not the number of
thirty, and thoſe of an inferior Quality,
who yet, by reaſon of the contracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Lots, were diſpoſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
any Propoſition that was probable
to enlarge them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:53922:36"/>
With this paucity of Adherents, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhid</hi>
ſecretly withdrew from <hi>Tafilete</hi> to
<hi>Teſſa,</hi> a place abounding with Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
but as poor as numerous. Here
<hi>Reſhid</hi> received the Royal Title of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
and was Proclaimed King of <hi>Tafilete.</hi>
And in acknowledgement and token of
his Royal Power, the People brought
him Preſents, as the known Pledges of
their Loyal ſubjection. This new <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
manifeſted a great diſdain of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varitious
humour, which had poſſeſſed
the minds of the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Princes,
much inveighing againſt the ſordid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of Sacrificing the Wealth of their
Subjects to themſelves. He therefore by
a ſubtil contrariety refuſed to ſhrine up
more Money in his Coffers, then might
decently defray Expences, leaving at the
firſt that pleaſing bait to be devoured by
his Proſelytes, whereby he purchaſed a
great reinforcement of his Retinue. <hi>Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
which he elected for his firſt <hi>place</hi> of
<hi>Arms,</hi> ſwarm'd (as was ſaid) with poor
Inhabitants, whoſe Labors were too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
for their Suſtenance, which might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them the readier to take the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of any Counſil that was likely to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53922:37"/>
better their Condition. And <hi>Muley Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhid</hi>
is conceived to have repaired to this
beggerly Colony, to meet with an eaſier
advance of Followers.</p>
               <p>By rowling up and down, he had in
ſhort time gathered ſo great a Bulk, as
threatned an Inundation whereſoever it
ſhould ſpread it ſelf. Attended with this
numerous Rabble, he addreſſed himſelf
to his Elder Brother <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi>
in a poſture compounded of Hoſtility
and Friendſhip, of whom he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Eſtate left him by his Father,
that he might be the better enabled to
perform ſomething worthy of <hi>Their
Houſe.</hi> The two Brothers began to wax
hot in the Conference; and it is ſaid,
that the Language on both ſides was ſo
exaſperating, that they had like to have
forgot the diſtance of their Condition,
and to have cloſed up their Diſcourſe
with an unmannerly Combate. Both
were ſo far tranſported with Anger, that
without the leaſt overture of Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they fell into declared Hoſtility,
and left their private Quarrel to the
publick determination of a War.</p>
               <p>In which <hi>Muley Reſhid</hi> was ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53922:37"/>
as to ſlay his Brother, and thereby
was left without any to juſtle him in the
Government of <hi>Dara.</hi> This ſucceſs did
ſo ſwell <hi>Reſhid</hi>'s boſome, that leſs room
could not circumſcribe him then a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
The preſent Affairs of <hi>Barbary</hi>
were auſpicious to his Enterpriſes: the
Countries being rent into petty Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,
every <hi>Almocaden</hi> that was able,
having put himſelf into a defenſive Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
aiming to live independent in his
Government. This diviſion much faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated
<hi>Muley Reſhid</hi>'s Deſigns: yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was more conducing to his ſucceſs,
then his careful execution of Juſtice, the
want whereof had been a general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
grievance; every detected Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
had condign puniſhment accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to demerit, whereby he became both
beloved and feared.</p>
               <p>Together with his care for publick
Juſtice, he continued his ſeeming neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of Riches; ſtil dividing among his
<hi>Partizans</hi> the eſtates of thoſe whom their
own obſtinacy made his ſpoils. But thoſe,
who gently yeilded to his mercy, he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
protected both in their Goods
and Perſons. This obliging carryage
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53922:38"/>
gave wings to his <hi>Fame,</hi> and made him
where ever he came to be received with
acclamations; The common voice was
<hi>Illah Enzur Muley Reſhid, i.e.</hi> God bleſs
Prince <hi>Reſhid</hi> &amp; the vulgar eſteem'd him
ſent on purpoſe to chaſtize <hi>oppreſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having made himſelf maſter of his
Brothers Territories, he advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Erìf</hi> govern'd by the <hi>Alcayd
Arras,</hi> who was his Brothers confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and his Father-in-law, and who
in confidence of this relation (if we may
credit report) granted <hi>Muley Reſhid</hi> a
peaceable admiſſion into his Dominions;
wherein for ſome Moons he deported
himſelf as a Son. But being aſcertained
of the <hi>Alcayds</hi> intention to contract a
Friendſhip with <hi>Tanger,</hi> and that he had
diſpatch'd an envoy to the ſame purpoſe
he concluded that he now wanted no
reaſon to declare himſelf an enemy to
the <hi>Alcayd's</hi> proceedings, and under this
pretext arm'd againſt him. The <hi>Alcayd</hi>
ſeeing the <hi>Xériff</hi> attempting to diſpoil
him of his Territories; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality;</hi>
he began to uſurp the Country
of his Entertainer, he thought it high
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53922:38"/>
time to provide for his defence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with ſome <hi>Extemporary Forces</hi> he
repaired to the <hi>Maritim Boſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mma</hi> where
he reinforc'd a ſmall Fort; not out of
any hopes to maintain it againſt the
<hi>Xériff,</hi> but thereby to have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of ſurrendring it and himſelf upon
gentler Articles. <hi>Muley Reſhid</hi> adviſed
of the <hi>Alcaids</hi> flight, addreſſed himſelf
to the purſuit, and overtook him at the
mentioned Fortreſs. Which in few daies
the <hi>Alcayd</hi> delivered up to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
by the <hi>Xeriff,</hi> and himſelf his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
               <p>This Victory, or rather ſurpriſal of
the <hi>Alcayd</hi> was a fair acceſſion to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhids</hi>
power, having now ſubjected the
only Potentate, whom the reſt of the
neighbouring Grandees had ſo often
Courted for a Confederate.</p>
               <p>Having thus obtained the command of
<hi>Erìf</hi> and the reſt of his <hi>Fatherinlaws</hi>
Country, it raiſed in him no leſs aſpire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hopes then to become <hi>Sultan</hi> of
<hi>Mauritania Tingitana,</hi> at that time rent
into parties. To the accompliſhing of
which deſign he ſaw the gaining of <hi>Fez</hi>
would contribute much to his eſteem,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53922:39"/>
and give him admiſſion into the heart of
the Kingdome. Upon this conſideration
he reſolutely march'd to trye his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
with that ancient and famous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis.
This City was lately in the
Government and Poſſeſſion of <hi>Cidi Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed,</hi>
ſecond Son to <hi>Ben Boucar,</hi> who
was deſpoiled thereof, together with his
Life, by the cruelty of <hi>Benſállah, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heìr,</hi>
and <hi>Doríedi,</hi> ſaid all to be <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzian</hi>
Moors, and who had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof divided among them, when
<hi>Reſhid</hi> came againſt it. The news of
whoſe approach no ſooner reach'd <hi>Fez.</hi>
but the Governors, whom guilt had made
cowardly, betook themſelves to the
ſtrongeſt holds of the City, depoſiting
the Keys into ſuch Hands, as they thought
fitteſt to be entruſted with the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Gates. <hi>Reſhid</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Fez</hi>
was likely to coſt him dear, if he ſtayed
to take it by a formal Siege, thought of
having recourſe to Stratagem; knowing
that he who aſpires after nothing but
Conqueſt, ought not to binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Laws of a fair Gameſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſhid</hi> had ſo long preſſed the City by
impeding their Markets, that he might
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53922:39"/>
reaſonably imagine there was a want of
proviſion of Cattel; whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to lodge ſome of his Forces near
the City Walls, and that himſelf, with
about ſixteen more, would drive ſome
Cattel to the Gates of <hi>Fez,</hi> under the
diſguiſe of Friends come to bring them
Proviſion. This he put in execution in
the Night, and coming with the Cattel
to the Gates, with a Voice counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
haſte and fear, they called to the
Guards for entrance, and deſired that
they would take into their Protection
them and the booty brought for their
ſuccour. Two were admitted to enter,
whereof the <hi>Xeriff</hi> is ſaid to have been
one, who inſtantly ſlew the Centinel, and
thereby made way for the reſt; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeiſed the Keys, ſtraight aſcended a
ſmall Turret over the Gate, and thence
gave the Signal to his Forces, lodged near
for the purpoſe to advance: And the
ſmall Gun that was placed in the Gate,
he cauſed to be turned upon the City.
The Citizens being miſerably confuſed
and affrighted at the ſuddenneſs of the
action, were not recovered of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
till <hi>Reſhid</hi> poured in his Army
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53922:40"/>
amongſt them; againſt whom being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to make any conſiderable oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
their laſt and only ſuccour was a
timely ſubmiſſion, which they perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſuch humility, that <hi>Reſhid</hi> had
no temptation to reject it. After they
were received into protection, the <hi>Fez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were not penurious in complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Governors, imputing it to
their wilfull Pride, that the <hi>Xerif</hi> was
not received with ſuch evidences of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
as they had always born to that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
But not ſtaying at ſuch uſeleſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements,
<hi>Reſhid</hi> in the firſt place took
into his poſſeſſion the ancient Treaſures
of the Kings of <hi>Fez.</hi> Next, he cauſed
the three Governors to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and having told them of their
great Oppreſſions of the People, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
one of them to be burnt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
another to be dragg'd about the
Streets till he was dead; but the third he
committed to cuſtody, and afterward is
ſaid to have kill'd him with his own
hand: And then declared, <hi>That this was
the just recompence of all thoſe who deal
unjustly with the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having thus ſubjected the famous
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53922:40"/>
                  <hi>Fez,</hi> his next Trophies he deſign'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Ben-Boucar,</hi> whom without much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
he took Priſoner, and brought
to <hi>Fez,</hi> and there granted him a liberal
Confinement, in token of that reſpect
which he bore his Piety and Age. After
this, he went againſt the <hi>Xerif</hi> of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaruèl,</hi>
who proved a very reſolute E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
for with the ſtrength of his own
<hi>Cavíla</hi> he found a Months work for all
<hi>Reſhids</hi> Army, but at length was forced
to render himſelf Priſoner, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in that Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſhid</hi> had now ſo far advanced his
Dominion in the Kingdom of <hi>Fez,</hi> that
he had none therein to oppoſe him but
<hi>El Hader Ben Ali Gaylan;</hi> who for his
<hi>military Skill, perſonal Valour,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years of <hi>Succeſs</hi> and <hi>Settlement</hi> in his
Government, rendred <hi>Tafilete</hi> dubious
in his Councils how to proceed againſt
him. <hi>Tafraught,</hi> a prodigious ridge of
Mountains, ſo ſecured <hi>Gaylans</hi> Fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that no part was left paſſable, but
what might eaſily be guarded. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to enter <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s Dominions by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
violence, <hi>Tafilete</hi> foreſaw would coſt
him the expenſe of more time then his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53922:41"/>
Affairs could ſpare: upon which refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he fell to his ſucceſsful Art of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a falſe Party in his Enemies Camp,
that he might obtain by <hi>intestine Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,</hi>
what in this caſe he could not by
his own <hi>Force.</hi> To this end he ſecretly
enter'd into correſpondence with <hi>Cidi
Laſin El Phut,</hi> Governor of <hi>Benittaròs,
(Gaylans</hi> chief Frontier <hi>Cavíla)</hi> who was
entruſted with the Avenue that let into
<hi>Gaylans</hi> Country. <hi>Laſin</hi> was not much
indiſpoſed to a Revolt from <hi>Gaylan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of thoſe whom he had highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
in not calling them to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jouſting
of the laſt Peace with <hi>Tanger,</hi>
nor to partake of its Benefits (which
was very fatal to that juncture of <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>'s
Affairs) and becauſe he ſaw the
growing power of <hi>Tafilete,</hi> and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
for a while they might reſiſt him, yet
in time he would eat through their <hi>Alps.</hi>
Upon theſe Temptations, or what other,
we may imagine operative upon the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
covetous, aſpiring</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a <hi>Moor, Laſin</hi> contracted with
<hi>Tafilete, Reſhid,</hi> or the <hi>Xeriff</hi> (which in
this Narrative do all expreſs the ſame
Perſon) to adviſe him, when he ſhould
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53922:41"/>
attach the Paſſage, who to that end had
always a ſelect Band in readineſs. And
when by his own Example <hi>Laſin</hi> had
taught the Guards to be remiſs, and had
got the advantage of <hi>Gaylans</hi> abſence, he
gave <hi>Tafilete</hi> the Signal, who gain'd the
Paſſage, and with ſuch ſuddenneſs ſet
upon the Reſerves, that they were not
able to make any conſiderable reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The news of this Diſaſter ſoon reacht
<hi>Alcazar,</hi> where <hi>Gaylan</hi> was entertaining
himſelf with his Relation <hi>Cogez,</hi> who
with ſome of his beſt Troops march'd to
the ſuccour of his other Forces, which
otherwiſe had been totally deſtroyed.
<hi>Gaylan</hi> in this Encounter gave great te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of his Valour, and had, no
doubt, given the Enemy a brave repulſe,
if his Infantry had not been wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited
ere he could come to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
At laſt, finding himſelf oppreſſed
with number, he was forced to order the
Party that ſtuck to him to ſeek for their
ſafety, and himſelf, with about ſix more,
retreated to <hi>Arzila;</hi> from whence, as

               <p>Aſſoon as the Lieutenant Governor
had peruſed the Letter, he reſolved to
gratifie <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s deſires, as being glad of
an opportunity to vindicate the <hi>honour</hi>
of the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> from ſome impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
which <hi>Gaylan</hi> objected to the
Lieutenant Governor (when he was with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53922:43"/>
him at <hi>Arzila)</hi> and which was chiefly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
through ſome miſtake between
the Great <hi>Tiveot</hi> and <hi>Gaylan,</hi> concerning
the time when the War ſhould commence
in the Year 1663. For albeit the Earl
of <hi>Tiveot</hi> had ſufficiently cleared the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Juſtice of that Action, yet <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
ſeeming not ſo to apprehend it, the
Lieutenant Governor was glad of an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to let him know, That it was the
mind of his Maſter, the King of <hi>Great
Brittain,</hi> that all his Miniſters ſhould be
punctual in the obſervation of what they
ſtipulated in his Name. To which end,
in a generous and well-compoſed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Lieuteuant Governor condoled
<hi>Gaylan</hi>'s miſ-fortune, aſſuring him of his
Friendſhip, and that he would exactly
comply with every Article of the Peace
concluded betwixt <hi>Tanger</hi> and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;
and that if any of his Vaſſals,
Allies, or Domeſtiques, ſhould in any
Exigence make <hi>Tanger</hi> their Sanctuary,
they ſhould find it no otherwiſe, and that
they ſhould be treated according to their
Quality and Condition. This Letter
was ſent by a Kinſman of the Lieutenant
Governors, who according to directions,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53922:43"/>
confirm'd <hi>Gaylan</hi> in the belief of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with all the ſuccors that he could
reaſonably expect from the lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>This Meſſage, whoſe kindneſs was
doubled by its ſeaſonableneſs and ſpeed,
put new Spirits into <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s drooping
Concerns, and gave him Courage to
ſound the temper of his revolted <hi>Caví<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s,
which he found well diſpoſed to
his Service, albeit they were forced to
diſſemble their Intentions till their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
was ſecured, leaſt otherwiſe they
ſhould ſecond the War with a Dearth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for ſo little is the Proviſion of the
<hi>Moors,</hi> that the loſs or miſcarriage of
one Crop, brings a Famine.</p>
               <p>But while <hi>Gaylan</hi> was laboring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,
<hi>Tafilete</hi> was improving his laſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
and having poſſeſs'd himſelf of
the Paſſage into his Enemies Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
he quickly became Maſter of <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zàr,</hi>
the chiefeſt of <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s Inland
Towns, which was deſerted by <hi>Cidi Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Cogèz,</hi> who for many Years had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
there by the Title of <hi>Alcayde.</hi>
The tydings of the <hi>Xerifs</hi> Succeſſes no
ſooner reach'd <hi>Tituan,</hi> but that Town
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53922:44"/>
declared for him, and with their beſt
Solemnity Proclaimed him King. At the
ſame time the <hi>Shat</hi> of <hi>Angera,</hi> a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Perſon in thoſe parts, nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to <hi>Gaylan</hi> by Blood and Marriage,
retired to the Woods in the Bay of that
<hi>Alcazàr,</hi> which ſtands upon the Midland
Sea; where he reſolved to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
whil'ſt he ſent his Domeſtiques to
<hi>Ceuta,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon, and <hi>Tanger,</hi>
to procure <hi>Seguròs</hi> for himſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
in caſe the <hi>Xerif</hi> ſhould prove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable,
and refuſe to receive him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fair Quarters.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Shat</hi> of <hi>Angera</hi> tired with his

to the Lieutenant Governor of <hi>Tanger</hi>
in <hi>Moreſco,</hi> in which he ſeemed to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
that he intended no ſubmiſſion
to the <hi>Xerif,</hi> which was Tranſlated thus.</p>
               <p>The Letter of <hi>Almócadem Caſum Shat,</hi>
and his Sons <hi>Almócadem, Abdelcrìm,</hi> and
<hi>Almócadem Ali,</hi> to the Captain of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>

he would do them the favour to ſend them
four Kintals of Powder, four hundred
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53922:44"/>
Balls, and a Kintal of Lead, with fifty or
more Muskets: and that if the Captain
have any need of Wood or Barley, they will
repay him in that Commodity: This they
ſollicit as <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s faithful Friends.</p>
               <p>I have inſerted this Letter for the ſake
of its ſtile, being the firſt and only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
made in this manner to any of the
Engliſh Governors in <hi>Tanger.</hi> But how
hopeful ſoever the <hi>Shats</hi> Affairs might
appear at the date of this Letter, yet
very ſhortly after they ſeem'd to be in
a very languiſhing ſtate, as was eaſily
to be collected by a large account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

then in <hi>Tanger,</hi> and which is here tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
out of <hi>Arabique</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>The Letter of <hi>Taliffo Hamet El Shat,</hi>

<hi>Angera,</hi> he came into the Fields of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>

love of God to leave them, whereupon they
alſo fled to <hi>Ceuta:</hi> He that did this was
<hi>Ben-Halóo.</hi> I thereupon writ a Letter
to the King, to deſire to have pity upon us.
I writ alſo to <hi>Almocadem Hamet Ben-Léefi,</hi>
and now write again for the Kings

both them and thee. Have thou patience,
and within two or three days the Anſwer
will be come. Moreover, I let thee know,
that we are guarding our Houſes from fire
and miſchief, having every Night twenty

my Peoples courage. Know moreover, that
the King hath given to <hi>Abdelháder Alfif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toah,</hi>
the Government of <hi>Angera,</hi> but the
People will not receive him, but have writ
to the King about it, though as yet they
have no anſwer. Lastly, I give thee to

So various was <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s Fortunes,
that while at one place he ſeem'd deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
in another he was victorious, and
notwithſtanding that at <hi>Angera Taffilete</hi>
was a Conquerour, as his letter inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
at <hi>Arzila</hi> he was ſubdued; for
from thence <hi>Gaylan</hi> aſſured his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
that all his <hi>Cavílas</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to their Obedience, that they had
maſſacred thoſe <hi>Tafilete</hi> had left to keep
them in awe, and ſhut him in between
two rocky mountains; and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was haſtening thither to ſee his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
and act his Cataſtrophe, and to
put a period to the war. At the ſame
time he gave out that <hi>Tituàn</hi> was peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for their Revolt, and weary of the
<hi>Xerifs</hi> exactions, and were ready to joyn
with him to effect the utter overthrow
of that Imperious Invader.</p>
               <p>Yet what face ſoever <hi>Gaylan</hi> put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his condition, it was certain that
<hi>Taffilete</hi> dayly advanced his conqueſt,
and at the ſame time when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
thus confidently reported his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs;
he was in a flouriſhing condition,
for the <hi>Xerif</hi> had then routed all <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>'s
freſh recruits, and in deteſtation
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53922:46"/>
of him had taken up the bones of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and burn'd them, ſaying, <hi>That he
deſerved no better, who was the root
of that bramble, which had ſo long ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically
rent and torn the poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had alſo taken Priſoners ſome of
<hi>Gaylan's</hi> neareſt relations, and ſent them
to <hi>Fez,</hi> and committed great ſpoiles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their goods, whom he found abſent
from their habitations, and had brought
a conſiderable wing within a league of
<hi>Arzila,</hi> where if he had ſtay'd to ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it, want of bread within a few moons
would have conſtrain'd them to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Tituàn</hi> was at this time
likewiſe ſo far from reſuming <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s

of <hi>Taffilete</hi> The notice of wich truth was
the ſubject of a letter ſent to Colonel

whoſe Honorable proceedings
had render'd him ſo eſteemed among

a fit Perſon to be complemented; and
to that end order'd his <hi>Alcáyd</hi> of <hi>Tituàn</hi>

hoping to raiſe himſelf with the <hi>Xerif,</hi>
renounced his Chriſtian Religion and

<hi>Hadracháman,</hi> and to encourage his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>
the King made him <hi>Alcayd de la

               <p>The Lieutenant Governour delai'd

importing Trade, the chief thing
which moſt concern'd the welfare of

Lieutenant Governour alwayes decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a ſingular propenſity. About the
ſame time <hi>Hamèt Ben-Iſa Nacſis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hamèt
Ben-Abdelcrìm,</hi> Governours of <hi>Tituàn,</hi>
with other Grandees of the Country
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53922:47"/>
and chief Miniſters of the King ſought
unto him in matters of Moment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
whom and <hi>Gaylan</hi> he guided him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo ſteddily, that the continuance of
his Friendſhip could not be ſuſpected
by the one, nor want of diſpoſition to
contract a new one by the other. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filete</hi>
could not ſo much eſteem him
his enemy as <hi>Gaylan's Freind;</hi> and his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to a <hi>distreſſed Confederate</hi> removed
all ſuſpicion of being otherwiſe to a
<hi>proſperous.</hi> And by this wiſe manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he clear'd up thoſe ſcruples, which
through ſome miſhapprehenſions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

ſo long contemned the condition of his

an ambiguous intimation of his Enemies
<hi>diſgrace</hi> was taken for a clear aſſertion
of his own. And however he labour'd
to beget or preſerve his freinds hopes
of his Reſtauration, yet it could not
take with thoſe who ſaw <hi>Taffilete</hi>
maſter of the whole Country, and all
places of importance repleniſht with <hi>his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53922:48"/>
Creatures;</hi> and <hi>Gaylan</hi> ſhut up in <hi>Arzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
from whence he could create no
more diſturbances than amounted to a
few <hi>plundering Sallies,</hi> which ſerved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to exaſperate the adjoyning <hi>Cavilsas,</hi>
and totally to aliene and eſtrange them
from his Relief. And yet was this a
miſchief which ſurpaſſed the <hi>Xerifs</hi> skill
and Power to Remedie, for <hi>Gaylan</hi> might
ſtill have kept <hi>Arzila</hi> from him, as he
had done from <hi>Ben-Bowcar,</hi> if his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complicies
had bin now as Truſty as
they were then; But he found the Scene
ſo far changed, that he had reaſon to
<hi>ſuſpect</hi> thoſe in whom he once <hi>confided.</hi>
He ſaw that the people of <hi>Arzila</hi> were
weary of their confinement, and the
more, becauſe they could not foreſee
any hope to be enlarged. And that
they could not but conclude, <hi>That</hi> their
ſturdy reſiſtance of <hi>Tafilete,</hi> contrary to
the example of all their Neighbours,
would, if protracted, render him impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.
All this <hi>Gaylan</hi> was able to read
in their <hi>carriage,</hi> wherein there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo great an alteration, that he clearly
perceived ſome miſchief intended againſt
him, and fearing that they might appeaſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53922:48"/>
                  <hi>Tafilete</hi> with the Sacrifice of <hi>Gaylan:</hi> he

               <p>VVE finde a Common-wealth

Weſtern part of Barbary hath
fulfilled the Allegory, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

has bin ſo long toſs'd; nor yet in regard
that the government thereof hath bin conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually

But in this eſpecially, that there remaines
no track, or impreſſion, no Regiſters to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us with what hath paſs'd, except ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
and devaſtations, the Genuine memories
of a Deſolating war. For to demand of a
<hi>Talib</hi> (one of the moſt learned ſort among
the Moors) the Annals of remote viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
or an account of the Traverſes that
bear a freſher date, were to baffle his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and thereby affront his adored lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature.</p>
               <p>Now the likelieſt reaſon, that can be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
of this ignorance, is the neglect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
Records of their Tranſactions, for

                     <hi>LEo Afer</hi> delivers two Etymologies,
which are ſo agreable both to the
nature of the <hi>Language,</hi> and Glebe of the
Country, that they may ſeem to have
bin impoſed by <hi>Adam,</hi> the Primitive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menclator.
For if we liſten to the Moors
language, <hi>Barbary</hi> ſeems to be deſcended
from <hi>Barbar,</hi> which ſignifies an inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
murmur and grumbling noiſe
without accent or harmony, for their
ſpeech is harſh, being very guttural:
which is eſteemed an argument of its
Antiquity. And indeed it hath gain'd
the vogue of no leſs antient a pedigree,
than to be bred of the old <hi>Punic</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reaſon why this Country bears
the name of <hi>Barbary,</hi> may be taken from
the frame and diſpoſition of the Earth,
which being full of wild and unkindly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53922:51"/>
Tumours, well challengeth the name of
<hi>Bar</hi> (a Word not known to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Inhabitants) ſignifying a Deſart,
and the duplicate of the Monoſyllable
<hi>Bar-Bar</hi> implyeth that of old, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi>
was nothing but a great Solitude.
And for this derivation, <hi>Leo Afer</hi> tells
this Story: King <hi>Iphycus</hi> being driven
out of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> fled into <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
where finding himſelf much preſſed by
his Enemies, and dubious what courſe
to run for his ſafety, he asked his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
what they thought was the moſt
probable way to ſecure themſelves;
whereupon they all, with an unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conſent anſwered <hi>Barbar,</hi> meaning
thereby that the hopefulleſt method of
Protection was to paſs over <hi>Nilus</hi> into
the Deſarts of <hi>Africa.</hi> And finding
this Etymologie to bear ſo fair a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the Complexion and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Land, I ſhall not ſcruple the
occaſion of its Impoſition.</p>
                  <p>But when we look from the outward
ſhape, to the Productions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
we ſee the uncomelineſs thereof
recompenſed in the Fertility, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
us to judge of Internal Dowries by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53922:51"/>
the outward Model: Providence uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſupplying the defects of the Body
with the abilities of the Mind, it being
the fate of many excellent Parts, like
<hi>Galba</hi>'s, to be ill lodged. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
accounted Wood and Grain, the
more natural and uſeful Iſſues of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as having a more immediate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to ſupply Mankind with the
greater Neceſſities of Lodging and Diet.
But in this Canton of <hi>Barbary,</hi> the
Woods are ſcarce and mean, and fitter
to warm the Houſe then build it. For
ranging their Groves, I found them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
chiefly of Cork-Trees, which ſeem'd
to differ but little from the Scarlet-Oak,
excepting the indenture of their Leaves.
Their Fruit is a ſmaller kind of Acorn,
woody within: At the Root of theſe
Trees is uſually found the <hi>Lentiſco,</hi>
which is generally but a ſhrub, and of
little other ſervice to the <hi>Moors</hi> then to
feed their Goats. The Juice whereof,
mingled with other Ingredients, is uſed
by the Potters to give a faint colour to
their Earthen-ware, which they find to
enhaunſe the price, and advance the
ſale.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:53922:52"/>
The next remarkable ſort of Wood is
the <hi>Alcaróbe,</hi> a Tree of great Curioſity,
and meriting a larger Note. The <hi>Alcaróbe</hi>
bears a Cod, in quantity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and likeneſs
much reſembling the Engliſh Bean; the
inner ſubſtance thereof is ſweet, and
lodgeth hard ſmall Kernels. This Fruit
is eat by the <hi>Moors</hi> of inferior Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by all at the Feaſt <hi>Aſhoràh:</hi>
but it is chiefly preſerved for their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to whom it is both Phyſick and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.
For as a <hi>Moor,</hi> well skill'd in that
Animal, told me, the Fruit of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caróbe</hi>
hath two excellent Properties, to
Drench, and make their Horſes Fat.</p>
                  <p>Some have called the Fruit <hi>Locusta,</hi>
and ſuppoſed that it was the <hi>Baptists</hi>
Food in the Wilderneſs: But others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
that St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, were
only the tops and extremities of Herbs
and Plants. And there are alſo ſome
judicious Criticks, who interpret the
<hi>Baptist</hi>'s Locuſts to be a kind of Fly or
Graſhopper, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in warmer Climates are
very large and many, and were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dryed and eaten by the Inhabitants.
But they were obſerved to yield but
ſmall Nutriment, and ever thought fitter
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53922:52"/>
for Medicine than Alimony. I was told
(but by a Travailer) that in <hi>Aegypt</hi>
theſe flyes come in ſuch clouds, that
they darken the sky where they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and that in a ſhort ſpace they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the fruits of the Earth where they
are permitted to fall. To prevent which
miſchief (he told me that) the people
obſerving the ſeaſon of their coming,
prepare againſt them, and keeping them
from ſetling by diſcharging Gunns into
the aire where they are diſcover'd. That
theſe locuſts and Graſhoppers were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the Barbarous Nations, may be
concluded from the Law that made them
forbidden meat to the Jews, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.
22.</p>
                  <p>But to leave the Moor to this ſort of

ſet down by that great intelligence of

                  <p>In ſome parts of this Countrey there
is great plenty of white Mulberry trees,
nouriſhed on purpoſe to feed the ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53922:53"/>
a creature that doth afford the
curious many delightful ſpeculations;
but the Moor regards it only for its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument.
The ſeaſon of the worm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſed, they feed their Cattel with
the reſidue of the Mulberry leaves.</p>
                  <p>The Towns of Commerce, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
have pleaſant Orchards of
Orange, Lemons and Limes, with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
yielding plenty and variety of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad.
And that which maketh their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
both profitable and delightful is,
that they are always fruitful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a refreſhing verdure. And this they
effect by keeping the ſoyle conſtantly in
a temperate moiſture: for the water-courſes
are ſo providently contriv'd
that every Garden receiv's it in due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
and at a certain hour; which
running among the little trenches, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
a very equal and fertile irriga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Sallad ordinary in other
Countreys, they have one ſort rarely to
be met with in Europe, which they call
by a word, ſounding ſpaniſh <hi>Tomátos.</hi>
This growes in the common fields, and
when ripe is pluckt and eaten with oyle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:53922:53"/>
it is pleaſant but apt to cloy. <hi>Barengé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi>
as in <hi>Spain,</hi> grow creeping like Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumers
upon the Ground; Theſe are
boyled with Beef and Mutton, and of no
vulgar eſtimation among the Moors.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Cavílas</hi> (a diviſion in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
that much reſembles that of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in <hi>England)</hi> have large and fruitful
Vineyards, and the bloud of the Grape,
though it be utterly prohibited them by
<hi>Mahumed</hi> their Prophet, yet of late
through the licentiouſneſs of the times,
it is liberally quaff'd by many of the
Moors. But that they might not herein
give offence to the weaker <hi>Muſul-men,</hi>
nor betray any contempt of the law, they
are generally cautious in this liberty,
and uſe it, as we ſay, <hi>

immortality, and immature death had
not depriv'd the world of that profitable

                  <p>The Grain in this, differs not from
that in other Countreys, excepting that
here are two ſorts of Grain, ſcarce well
known in other parts of the world, The
one they call <hi>Pharoùk,</hi> which is of a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
ſize, hungry and courſe, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling,
if not altogether the ſame,
with the Spaniſh <hi>Panizo,</hi> and it is only
the more beggarly Moors that uſe this
for bread. The other is known among
them by the name of <hi>Tourkiá,</hi> which is
a larger body than the former, and yields
good flower, whereof bread is made
for the Nobles of the Land. And as the
Barley and Beans are reapt in April,
the wheat in May and June, ſo is Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember
the uſual ſeaſon for gathering
the other kinds of bread-corn.</p>
                  <p>The rains are to the Moors, what the
Nileſcope is ſaid to be to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
for according to their plenty or ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they are able to foretell the dearth
and plenty of the year. But there is a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53922:54"/>
ſort of Religioniſts among them, who
meaſure the products of the earth by the

of the <hi>Trade-rains,</hi> (for ſo they may
not improperly be termed, as never fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

is call'd by a word importing Bleſſing,

                  <p>There appeares but little induſtry in
the Moors husbandry, for their tillage
is ſo mean, that he that ſees it may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wonder, that the Land under ſuch
ſmall improvement ſhould be ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
In moſt parts they plough but with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53922:55"/>
two Oxen, careleſly tyed by the horns,
and in ſome <hi>Cavílas</hi> with a like number
of Aſſes, Mules, Camels, and a baſer
breed of Horſes. The plough turns up
no more mold, than ſufficeth to bury
the ſeed: for (ſay they) if the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
ſhould be deep, and the drought
begin, er'e that the corn hath broken the
Earth, it would not be able to force a
paſſage through the ſtifned clods. They
uſe no labour to aſſiſt the <hi>Arbale</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring
it, except that the Ordure of
their Towns is caſt out, not ſo much to
enrich the Glebe, as to keep themſelves
cleanly. But this painful part of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
is ſupplyed by the Anniverſary
burning of the withered graſs and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which ſervs to help the ſoyle, and
deſtroy the Vermin, which otherwiſe,
eſpecially the Scorpion, would render
the Countrey very dangerous for habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>When the Moors have reapt their corn,
they tread it out with Oxen, Camels, &amp;c,
&amp; winnow it upon the place where it
grows, and then ſet the chaff on fire; In
which particulars they are an excellent
Comment upon the like, reflected upon
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53922:55"/>
in <hi>Sacred Writ.</hi> Inſtead of Granaries,
they have Caves brick'd or wrought with
ſtone, call'd <hi>Matamóras,</hi> in which they
repoſite their Corn, where it is preſerv'd
from the Worm, and other Enemies.
The Straw they chop and keep for their

                     </gap>rſes, for although there be abundance
of Herbage, yet no part thereof is cured
and preſerved for a Winter ſtore of Hay,
which I impute to the <hi>Moors</hi> ſloth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>After I had taken this Survey of what
appeared upon the Earth by Nature, or
its Improver, Husbandry, I found ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Inſtigations, both by Curioſity
and Reaſon, to dive into its Entrals,
which I have been told are in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as rich as the beſt Oars can make
them. And of this Truth there have
appeared large Specimens, about <hi>Tituan,
Alcazàr, Ghebèr, &amp;c.</hi> And the reaſon
why the <hi>Moors</hi> purſue not ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Temptation, may be charg'd upon
their Ignorance, Idleneſs, or Fear; as
in another place I may have occaſion to
demonſtrate. The Commodities of this

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:53922:56"/>

higher, from Vegetable to Senſible
Creatures, whereof <hi>Barbary</hi> has no leſs
plenty, than of Graſs to maintain them,
but looking into their Flocks and Herds,
I found the latter more numerous, yet
not to that quantity as report inform'd
me. And enquiring why the <hi>Moors</hi> were
more for the Stall, than the Fold; they
replyed, That Cows yielded them more
conſtant relief than Sheep, and were
more ready to furniſh out both their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53922:56"/>
and Purſes. Their Horſes are both
few and mean, and for the moſt part
much inferiour to thoſe of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which at firſt created my wonder,
becauſe of the great repute the <hi>Barbary</hi>
Horſes had obtain'd in moſt <hi>European</hi>
Countries. But they have a peculiar
Caſt of Barbs able to maintain this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
which the <hi>Moors</hi> carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
never imploying them in low and
baſe Offices, but keep them only for the
Saddle and Military Service. And to the
great eaſe of their Horſes, the <hi>Moors</hi>
have ſtore of Camels for their ſoreſt
Drudgeries. Now the Camel is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſtrange Bulk and humour, whoſe
Diet is mean and incredibly little, for
they will Travel great Journeys under
heavy Loads, without further allowance
than the tops of Thiſtles, or any mean
Herbage. Nor are they leſs abſtemious
in their Bevarage, than Meat; being ſo
patient of Thirſt, that they will Travel
four days without touching Water, and
then at one Drinking take in as much as
will ſerve them as many Days more. The
<hi>Moor</hi> from Obſervation hath this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rule concerning Camels; <hi>viz. That
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53922:57"/>
thoſe which when young drink much and
often, are of a degenerate Linage, and
will never prove ſerviceable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Preſumption, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels
engender backward, but <hi>Ali Mulùd,</hi>
an Ancient and Inquiſitive <hi>Moor,</hi> would
often ſwear by the Hairs of his Chin (an
Oath that he had learn'd in the time of
his being a Slave in <hi>Spain)</hi> that he had
much enquired after the manner of the
Camels Copulation, but could meet
with no certain Information therein;
for (ſaid he) theſe Creatures are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
baſhful in their Embraces, which
makes them very ſecret in the time of
their Amours; and to retire, if poſſible,
even from their Keepers Eye. At the
ſeaſon of their Coition, both Sexes are
very furious, and like their <hi>Moreſco</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
they never forget to revenge the
Injuries done them at that time. I was
told by an <hi>Alarb,</hi> who had no Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to abuſe my Credulity in ſuch an
unconcerning Story, that the <hi>Mácho,</hi> or
Male Camel, generated with the Female
when ſhe is aſleep, and that the Female
brings forth in a kind of negligent ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
But I leave the curious Inquiſitors
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53922:57"/>
of Nature to diſcover the frailties of this
Story, and paſs on to remark the docile
gentleneſs of the Camel, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in their ſubmiſſion, kneeling to be
loaden and unloaden at their Drivers
pleaſure. And we find it reported in the
Hiſtory of Beaſts, <hi>Jonſon. Hist. Quadrup.</hi>
That Camels have been taught to dance
exact Meaſures, which is no more ſtrange,
than the <hi>Ballétto di Caválli,</hi> that not long

                  <p>But intending no <hi>Zoography,</hi> I paſs
from this and other Tame Quadrupeds,
to obſerve that <hi>Barbary</hi> hath all ſorts
of Beaſts that are called Wild: Lions,
Leopards, Wolves, Foxes, <hi>&amp;c</hi> with
great plenty of Jackals, ſo much famed
for Catoring for the Lyon: They uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
hunt in Packs, opening with a ſhril
yelping noiſe, and are deſcribed to be
Mungrel Creatures, of an equivocal
Generation, deriving rapaciouſneſs from
the Wolf their Sire, and cunning from
the Fox their Dam; they are very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous,
eating Carrion, digging up dead
Bodies, and will feed upon that which a
genuine Fox will not daign to taſt.</p>

Wild Boars are no rarity in this <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi>

jealous of a ſecond Deluge, durſt not

might be a Deſign to ſcatter them that

for which reaſon they long time kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

of which ſtory nothing is needful here

and the People that Inhabited them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53922:59"/>
valued for their Antiquity above the reſt

yields a pregnant inſtance in the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of her Inhabitants, of which there
are two ſorts known among them, by the

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Alárbes</hi> are uſually by the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi>
ſtil'd Mountaineers, from the place
of their greateſt reſidence. And theſe
think themſelves the Elder Natives, and
therefore of the better Houſe. They
are not altogether ſo Civiliz'd as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but live more rudely and rovingly,
ſhifting from Mountain to Mountain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Exigences, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
their rambling humors to any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Manſion. They live in Haimas or
Tents, made of a courſe browniſh Cloth,
which the Women work and weave of the
Bark of Palmito's mingled with Goats
hair; and theſe Itinerary Habitations
they remove from one place to another,
in obedience to their fickle Humors and
cogent Neceſſities. Robbery is their
Maſter-piece and beſt Livelyhood; and
in this Eſtate they much glory, as coming
ſo near the condition of <hi>Muley Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>méds</hi>
firſt Votaries. About an Age paſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53922:59"/>
they were very numerous, but the late

                  <p>The other ſort of <hi>Moors</hi> are vulgarly

                  <p>Over theſe <hi>Barabàrs</hi> are Subordinate
Governors or <hi>Almocadens,</hi> to whom
they pay a dutiful Obſervance. Their

live much after the condition of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baradóres</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Paiſants in

than the <hi>Alárbes,</hi> and for ſeveral
Years have inhabited both the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

yet they have left them the reproach of

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:53922:60"/>
But notwithſtanding their different
Mode of living, they unite in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Character of Body and Humour: For
they are all of a large Stature, ſtrong
Conſtitution, ſtately Carriage, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in Complexion according to their
converſing with the Sun and Air. Thoſe
whom for diſtinction I muſt call the
Gentry, are according to their Rules of
Chivalry well skill'd in managing of the
Horſe, and dextrous at the Lance, for
they ſcorn all toyl that is not Military,
and account no Employment ſo noble as
that of a Souldier. They agree like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in Humour, for both are Jealous
and Revengeful. Their Jealouſie is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
in their Carriage towards their
Wives, whom they keep in great Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Retirement, which makes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
a Stranger to their Beds: Nor
can it reaſonably be otherwiſe, ſeeing
that the Wife is fully aſſur'd that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
attempt to pilfer a Pleaſure, if diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
will coſt her her Life. They
are likewiſe implacable in their hatred,
and impatient till they have avenged an
Injury; for they are taught by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>That Revenge is a Virtue.</hi> But
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53922:60"/>
leaving theſe Paſſions to the juſtification
of the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Law and Cuſtoms, the

towards Strangers, which hath no

and chanceing to ſmile at the <hi>Moors</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,

were very circumſpect in obſerving eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tittle of the <hi>Don</hi>'s Deportment, were
ſo ſagacious as to find in this caſual Smile
a deriſion of their Courtſhip, which they
left not unrevenged in intrigueing his
Errand. Now it is obſervable, that the
<hi>Moors</hi> are very moroſe and abſtemious
in point of Laughter, eſteeming thoſe
who are much thereunto addicted, to be
ſcornful and fooliſh.</p>
                  <p>And now having promiſed to give an

having from <hi>Ceuta</hi> (a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
on the <hi>Barbary</hi>-coaſt) adviſed <hi>Cidi el
Hader Ben Ali Gaylan,</hi> that he was come
from the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> on a Meſſage
to his Excellency (that was <hi>Gaylans</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle)
and deſired to know when and
where he ſhould have permiſſion and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to deliver it: <hi>Gaylan</hi> returned
him anſwer, concerning the ſet Day and
Place for the <hi>Don</hi>'s Reception, which
was according to our ſtile, the tenth of
<hi>September,</hi> in the One thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſixty third Year of Grace, and at a
place equally diſtant from <hi>Ceuta</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan:</hi>
where, to grace the <hi>Entrata, Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
appointed a Parade of the beſt Horſe
of his own <hi>Cavíla,</hi> and committed them
to the Conduct of his Brother <hi>Cidi Tobib
Ebn Ali,</hi> who march'd with them from
<hi>Arzíla</hi> to <hi>Tituàn,</hi> whither according to
appointment, <hi>Gaylans</hi> Father-in-law,
<hi>Almocadèm</hi> of the <hi>Cavíla</hi> of <hi>Angerà,</hi> had
ſent his Sons with about ſixty of their
Couſens, to joyn with <hi>Tobib,</hi> who with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53922:61"/>
many more went to receive the Envoy at
the prefixed time and place: Where the
<hi>Moors,</hi> having paid him their Greetings,
they all March'd in this order.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Troop came the two Sons
of the <hi>Almocadèm</hi> of <hi>Angerà,</hi> with about
ſixty of their Kindred, all bravely mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and according to their Gallantry,
richly accoutred: Theſe in ſeveral Rings
exercis'd the Lance with laudable Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
the Muſick of <hi>Tituàn</hi> ſtill playing
before them.</p>
                  <p>In the next rank came <hi>Cidi Tobit,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with about fifty Horſe, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a very ſlow march, as if they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to revie or deride the Spaniſh Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Next to them rode the Envoy, <hi>Don
Diego Felippe de Palma del Habito de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jago,</hi>
with a ſingle Trumpet ſounding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: Next came led ſix ſtately Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
trapt in blew Cloth: after them four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Mules loaden with Trunks; and in
the laſt place rode the Governor of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuàn,</hi>
with the <hi>Alárbes</hi> Muſick tinkling
before him, and attended with a large &amp;
well ordered Train. Vaſt multitudes
were flockt thither, having no other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
but to gaze, being Strangers to ſuch
a Proceſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:53922:62"/>
In this order was <hi>Don Diego</hi> conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his Lodgings in <hi>Tituàn,</hi> where he
courteouſly received the Chriſtians that
came to give him the Parabien to <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and declar'd a great readineſs to
ſerve my Camrade and my ſelf, whom he
knew had no other concern in thoſe
Parts, but ſecurely to travel and view
the Countrey. After two days refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the <hi>Moors</hi> charge, the <hi>Don</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
his march toward <hi>Arzíla,</hi> but firſt
cauſed the Horſes to be richly trapt, and
led in State through the Streets of <hi>Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>àn;</hi>
which being done, they came into
a Plain a little out of the Town, where
the People made a ſpacious Circle, in
which the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Cavalleres ſhewed
their active Horſemanſhip, and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
darting of the Lance; after which,
about fifty <hi>Negros</hi> and <hi>Alárbes</hi> began a
Dance, which they performed with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
variety of Geſture, and ſtrange A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Deſports being finiſhed, the
Envoy advanceth his Journey, and found
the ways crowded with Spectators, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thither by <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s Politick Friends,
who deſigned that the People might take
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53922:62"/>
notice of the Honor done to <hi>Cidi El Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and that his Friendſhip was ſought
by one of the greateſt of Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.
But there were many that came
not ſo much to be Spectators, as to reap
the fruit of a common Report, that the
<hi>Don</hi> would caſt great ſtore of Realito's
among the poorer <hi>Moors.</hi> But their hopes
were deceived in the rumour of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
Bounty, who did not herein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
from the Nature of his Nation,
which has ever been noted for a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs
to ſuch inſignificant Profuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The Envoy being ſafely arrived at
<hi>Arzíla,</hi> he was lodged in an Apartment
of <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s Place (pardon the Word)
where I leave him to lodge, and eat, if
poſſible, worſe then he did at home.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs and deſign of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy,
met with diverſity of Conjectures:
by ſome it was ſuppoſed that <hi>Don Diego</hi>
was ſent to ſollicit larger Priviledges for
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons on the <hi>Barbarian</hi>
Coaſt. Others concluded that the Duke
of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> envious at the Earl of
<hi>Tiveot</hi>'s ſucceſſes againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> and
his Truce concluded with <hi>Gaylan,</hi> cauſed
this Meſſenger (a Creature of his own)
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53922:63"/>
to be ſent with Inſtructions, to interrupt
and diſturb the new Correſpondence
and Amity betwixt <hi>Tanger</hi> and <hi>El Hader.</hi>
But to find out the Riddle, I ploughed
with one of their own Heifers, having
employed a <hi>Moor</hi> verſed in publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
(and recommended to me by that
great Lover of the Engliſh, <hi>Cidi Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erim
Nacſis,</hi> then chief Governor of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan)</hi>
who from the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs
after the ſtate and condition of
<hi>Tanger,</hi> the number of the Souldiers,
the quantity of the conſtant Guards, the
heighth and ſtrength of the Walls, the
ſituation and number of the Guns ready
mounted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with his Deſign in a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſco</hi>
habit to take a narrow view of the
whole place (which in <hi>Gaylan</hi>'s company
within few days after he performed) fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
us with Jealouſies that ſome miſchief
was purpoſed againſt <hi>Tanger.</hi> And it is
very certain, That the fore-mentioned
Duke had an evil Eye upon the Immortal
<hi>Tiveot,</hi> for the Renowned Victories
which under the moſt Chriſtian King he
atchieved againſt his Nations Intereſt in
the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> which aged Choler
he found highly inflam'd by the Victories
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53922:63"/>
gain'd by that <hi>indefatigable Captain</hi> over
his <hi>Moreſco</hi> Neighbors, which inſtigated
the Dukes ſpleen not ſo much againſt
<hi>Tanger,</hi> as its Reſtorer <hi>Tiveot,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this time in <hi>England,</hi> took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his abſence to diſgrace him
(if any ſuch thing had been poſſible) with
his new Confederate <hi>Gaylan.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcing
in this account of the Embaſſy,
I purſue my Province in ſetting down the
exact account of the preſent Cuſtoms
of the <hi>Moors.</hi>

and Converſation of the
Women, pious manner of ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Stile.</head>
                  <p>I Have not found any Nation ſo rude
and Barbarous, as to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of all <hi>Rites</hi> of Civility and Reſpect:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53922:64"/>
for ſome tokens of honor &amp; kindneſs, ſome
terms of diſtance &amp; familiarity are uſed
by the moſt uncultivated. And the Moors
though they are very ſparing in Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet they uſe both words &amp; geſtures
of Reſpect. Towards all ſuperiours they
indifferently uſe the Compellative <hi>Cidi,</hi>
which is as extenſive as [Sir;] To wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of better quality they uſe <hi>Lala,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
as largely as <hi>Madam</hi> doth now
in <hi>England.</hi> And as to their outward
demonſtrations of Reſpect, there is little
variation; for a grave inclination of the
body, with a putting the right hand firſt
to the heart, next to the forehead, and
then kiſſing the two foremoſt fingers laid
a croſs the lips, is the exacteſt manner
of ſaluteing the Grandees; whoſe hand,
knee, or bottome of the Veſt is kiſſed
by the Vulgar. Thoſe that are familiar,
and of equal rank, at their firſt meeting
ſtrike hands, but ſhake not, &amp; then lift
them up &amp; lay them to their breaſts. And
their greetings are in the ſecond perſon
ſingular, uſeing [Thou] to all from the
ſlave to the King: wherein they obſerve
the Eaſtern Cuſtom. But in their addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to their Prince no people can teſtify
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53922:64"/>
more ſignal tokens of Humbleneſs &amp; Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
for at the entrance into the Royal
preſence, they bow their bodies to the
ground, ſaying, <hi>Sálam Allíg Allá En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorúck
Mulèy,</hi> Peace be to thee, God
preſerve King <hi>Fuláno;</hi> &amp; theſe words &amp;
geſtures are devoutly repeated at every
pace they advance toward the <hi>King.</hi> And
if any come with petitions they kiſſe, the
earth when they preſent them to his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
peruſal. The like Reverences are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
when they depart the <hi>Preſence.</hi>
But I paſs on to view the female Moors,
who if preſerv'd from the injuries of the
Sun &amp; weather, are generally well comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion'd
full bodied, &amp; of good ſymmetry.
Thoſe that live in great Towns, together
with the wealthier ſort in the Country,
are enclin'd to paleneſs, which may be
imputed to their ſedentarineſs, or <hi>want
of motion;</hi> for they ſeldom ſtir abroad, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be to viſit the Sepulchers of
their deceaſed friends in devotion, to
pray for their felicity, and in the night
time to the Baths for health and cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
As to their Friday-meetings I ſhall
ſpeak of it in another Chapter. They
never ſtep without the threſhold but ſo
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53922:65"/>
cloſely vail'd, that no part is viſible but
an eye. In the ſtate of Matrimony their
principal ſtudie is to pleaſe their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
to whom they are taught by their
<hi>Alcoran</hi> to bear a dutiful obſervancy, and
to omit no art that may render them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to their converſation. Thoſe hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
that are able, allow their wives <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra</hi>'s
or <hi>black-women,</hi> to doe all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
offices in the Family; but yet there is
no quality that ſits idle; for the cheif of
the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Dames imploy their time in
ſome thrifty huſwifry. And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
that cuſtom of <hi>expenſive goſſippings,</hi>
with which in ſome <hi>Nations</hi> ſo many
wives are debauched, and husbands <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar'd.</hi>
And yet the married women want
not their <hi>friendly converſations,</hi> for they
viſit one anothers houſes in token of
good <hi>neighbourhood,</hi> but without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of their husbands; no male though
he be never ſo much a relative, can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into their ſociety. And to prevent
it, ſhe that makes the viſit firſt, ſends to
know whether the husband be at home
if the anſwer be negative, then without
further ceremony ſhe goes ſtraight to her
Goſſips apartment, where ſhe is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53922:65"/>
with a liberality that never injures
her husband; who if returning home in
the interim of the viſit, is careful to give
no interruption, but upon notice quickly
departs the houſe; yet they give ſuch
ſignals that he has bin there, as are eaſily
perceived by the <hi>Viſitant,</hi> who thereupon
ſhortens the Viſit, otherwiſe it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laſts a whole day. But theſe being
offices that are ſeldome in their returns,
may juſtly be pardon'd in their length.</p>
                  <p>But foreſeeing that I ſhall in another
place have occaſion to ſpeak again of the
<hi>Moreſco</hi> women, I ſurceaſe to enlarge
the paragraph that here concerns them,
aud therefore proceed to view the <hi>pious
forms</hi> uſed by the Moors in their ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Letters.</p>
                  <p>And indeed there is none that has had
any intimacy with the Moors in this
particular, but he might obſerve a great
appearance of Piety in all their cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
expreſſions. And this I learn'd
both from the diſcourſe and practiſe of
thoſe with whom I journy'd, who at
their ſetting out in the morning, would
with zeal and humility look up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and in a low voice ſay, <hi>Biſmillah,</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:53922:66"/>
that is, in the name of God; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
done at the beginning of any labour
or travail. By which they intend that
nothing ought to be enterpriſed, but in
the power and hope of the divine favour
and help. And when the work or jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is finiſhed they ſay, <hi>Ham der illah,</hi>
Thanks be unto God; in which words
they deny all aſcriptions of ſucceſs to
themſelves. When they meet one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the road, &amp;c. their greetings
at large is this thankſgiving, <hi>El ham dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah
al ſalam tiqſi.</hi> i. e. God be praiſed
that I ſee thee well: but in paſſing by one
another the Salutation is uſually this
prayer, if there be no more but one,
<hi>Salam alleq,</hi> if more than one, <hi>Salam al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leq
cum,</hi> Peace be with thee, or you.
At the hearing of one another ſneez,
they ſay, <hi>Era hanig allah, Dios tenga
V. M. en ſumano.</hi> God be your keeper.
When one Moor goes to ſee another at
his houſe, the firſt that receives him ſaith,
<hi>Mar bába,</hi> or welcom, which if repeated
thrice, is an undoubted marke that they
are glad to ſee him; which kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
he requites with ſaying,
<hi>Allah ellah miq</hi> i. e. God pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53922:66"/>
And the like air and genius of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Piety is obſervable in thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that the Moors write in their own
language; a taſt whereof you have in
theſe two enſuing, tranſlated out of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſco.</hi>

                  <p>IN the Year of Salvation, 1663. <hi>Sept.</hi>
the ſixth, at the going down of the
Sun, we came to an <hi>Aldéa</hi> called <hi>Angerà,</hi>
at the utmoſt Bounds of a Mountain of
that name; where we repair'd to the
Houſe of <hi>Cidi Caſſian Shat,</hi> whom we
found ſitting at his Door, environ'd with
about twenty aged <hi>Moors</hi> of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood.
Alighting from our Horſes,
we deliver'd our <hi>Segúra</hi> or Letters of
ſafe Conduct, to the Old Man; who
when he had peruſed, return'd them
with a grave Nod, the teſtimony of his
Approbation, and the ſignal of our Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
This done, we were called to a
little upper Room, which we could not
enter till we had put off our Shoos at
the Threſhold; not for Religion, but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53922:70"/>
Cleanlineſs, and not to prevent our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowing
of the Floor, but defiling the
Carpets wherewith it was curiouſly
ſpread. At the upper end of the Room
was laid a Velvit Cuſhion, as large as
thoſe we uſe in our Pulpits, and it deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the moſt Honourable part of the
Room. After we had repoſed about an
hour, there was brought in a little oval
Table, about twenty Inches high, which
was covered with a long piece of narrow
Linnen; and this ſerved for Diaper. For
the <hi>Moors,</hi> by their Law, are forbidden
ſuch ſuperfluous Utenſils as Napkins,
Knives, Spoons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Religion lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down this general Maxim, <hi>That meer
Neceſſaries are to be provided for:</hi> which
cauſed a preciſe <hi>Moor</hi> to refuſe to drink
out of my Diſh, when he could ſup Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough out of the hollow of his
Hand. But this ſtraitneſs has of late
Years begun to be enlarged, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
is interpreted to reach no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then their Church-men, and chief
Miniſters of Juſtice; ſo that thoſe who
are able to provide handſome Furniture
for their Tables, have a Diſpenſation,
which they ſeem not prone to make uſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53922:70"/>
of, if the humour of the reſt may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vined
by that of this Grandee: At whoſe
Houſe the Table was adorned as before,
and for Supper there was placed upon
it an Earthen Pot full of Mutton, Beef,
Cabage, Raiſins, Potato's, Berengénas,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> all boyled together, and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hot with Dimicuto and Garlick, which
is their immutable Sawce. This hodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podge
was in imitation of the <hi>Spaniſh
Olla Podrida,</hi> excepting that it wanted
Bacon, an Ingredient ſo indiſpenſible
to the <hi>Spaniſh Olla,</hi> that there can be
none without it, which occaſion'd this
Proverb, <hi>No Sermon without St.</hi> Auſtin,
<hi>nor</hi> Olla <hi>without Bacon: Ny Sermòn ſin</hi>
Agoſtino, <hi>ny</hi> Olla <hi>ſin locino.</hi> But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in our Bill of Fare: our next Courſe
was a ſingle Pullet cloven down the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with the four Quarters ſpread out at
large, by a way of Cookery peculiar to
the <hi>Moors.</hi> And theſe two Diſhes, with
ſtore of good Bread, made up the Feaſt.
Our Drink was ſtrong Wine newly
brought from the Preſs, which ſtood by
us in a great ſtone Jar, with a ſort of
wooden Ladle in it, out of which we
drunk. Our poſture was laying round
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53922:71"/>
about the Table, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of the Countrey. Our company was
the ſecond Son of this Family, a debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair
Gentile Perſon. Having ſupp'd,
and ſolaced our ſelves with muddy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verage
and <hi>Moreſco</hi> Muſic, we all compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
our ſelves to ſleep: About twenty
were allotted to Lodge in this ſmall
Chamber, whereof two were Chriſtians,
three Jews, and the reſt <hi>Moors:</hi> every
one made his Bed of what he wore, which
made our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitutions to wiſh
for the Morning, which no ſooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
but we quitted our Lodging, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Entertainer <hi>ſans adieu,</hi> not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
to return thanks for his Hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
which could incur no diſpleaſure, as
conforming to the ſtile of the Countrey.
And this Breviate of <hi>Cidi Caſſian</hi>'s hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Houſe-keeping, is an Eſſay of the
reſt, for the <hi>Moors</hi> have all one faſhion of
living, and their Houſes, Diet, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
vary not, but in the matter.</p>
                  <p>Now that which makes Journying in
<hi>Barbary</hi> ſo full of Fatigue, is the want
of Houſes of Publick Entertainment
(like the <hi>Venta</hi>'s and <hi>Posáda</hi>'s in <hi>Spain;</hi>
the <hi>Caborets</hi> and <hi>Hostelries</hi> in <hi>France;</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53922:71"/>
and Inns in <hi>England)</hi> whereby the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
are conſtrain'd to carry their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
with them. The <hi>Moors</hi> uſual Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aticum
are Raiſins, parch'd Beans, Ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Garlick, and ſtore of Bread. They
rely upon the Fountains for their Drink,
which are kept in great decency and
cleanlyneſs: at every Fountain there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Diſh made of Cork, faſtned with a
ſtring, out of which Man and Beaſt drink
for refreſhment. Many of theſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are provided with a large ſmooth
Stone, whereon the <hi>Moor,</hi> after he has
perform'd his preparative Waſhing, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates
his <hi>Salla,</hi> or Oriſons. And the
<hi>Bigots</hi> that live near theſe Fountains, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day repair thither to pay their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotage,</hi>
or Superſtitious Devotions.</p>
                  <p>They uſually ſhut up their Journey at
the going down of the Sun; and if there
be an <hi>Aldéa</hi> or Village at hand, they turn
thither for Houſe-room, and lodge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in a Cotage, as mean as that
wherein <hi>Ovid</hi>'s aged Couple entertain'd
the Pilgrim Gods. But if it be Summer,

watch by turns, and do the like
in places that are troubled with wild
Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaid that the <hi>Moors</hi> have no
Houſes of Accommodation, it was with
exception of the <hi>Almamóra</hi>'s, or Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
maintain'd by the Revenues of the
Church, built on purpoſe to receive
Strangers of any Perſwaſion. Theſe
Houſes afford nothing but room to Lodge
in; but if it happen that Travellers are
in want of meat, the Villagers are ready
to ſupply them. The <hi>Alfaqúi,</hi> or Prieſt
of the place, hath Inſpection and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency
of theſe Hoſpitals. The
<hi>Moors</hi> have likewiſe peculiar Places, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the Infirmatories or <hi>Lazaret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
in other Nations, for thoſe that fall
ſick in their Journeys, whom they treat
with a laudable Care, till they either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
or dye: And if the infirm dye, not
leaving wherewith to bury him, there is
care taken for his Funeral, and a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>láto,</hi>
or ſome baſer <hi>Moor,</hi> is appointed
to beg the Alms of the place to defray
the Expence of the Strangers Interment.
In theſe <hi>Almamóra</hi>'s, the Stranger is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53922:73"/>
to ſtay till the Weather and his
Health diſpoſe him for his Journey: but
they repine at his abode, when it is not
urged by neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>In later Years, every Town of Traſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
hath erected a ſort of Inns, called
<hi>Alfandách,</hi> which affords nothing but
Houſe-room for Man and Beaſt, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
yielding Proviſion for both. Thoſe
that farm theſe <hi>Fandáchs,</hi> cannot exact
above a Blankil a Night both for Man and
Beaſt, which is in ſterling Money about
two pence. The Horſes Lodging coſting
equally with his Riders.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Fandáchs</hi> were at firſt built by
the wealthier ſort of <hi>Moors,</hi> who dying
in a pious humour, gave them to the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ámma</hi>
or Church, to hallow, ſay the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſco</hi>
Rabbies, the filthy lucre raiſed by
their employment. However, the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ámma</hi>
has its Revenues greatly augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſuch Donations. And whatever
was the Deſign of their Inſtitution, we
find them of late under a great Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
being little better then Tipling
Shops, where the <hi>Moors</hi> Quaff the Fruit
of the Vine. But that which herein moſt
raiſed my Admiration, was to ſee the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53922:74"/>
of theſe <hi>Fandáchs,</hi> appropriated
to the maintenance of the <hi>Alfaqúi</hi>'s or
Prieſts, and that that Holy Order, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the diſpoſal of ſuch Houſes, ſhould
not ſee them under a more regular admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.</p>
                  <p>But to go from theſe Publick Houſes
to view the <hi>Moors</hi> in their private Roofs,
I find them in their Careſſes frugal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Parſimoniouſneſs, and placing no
Character of good Houſe-keeping in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Viands. They have two
diſhes in ſingular eſteem, the chief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nſcuſsòn,</hi> which is made of Water
and Flower, or grated Bread, boyled
into a Conſiſtence, into which they put
Butter, or any Kitchin-ſtuff: And this
they eat without Spoons; for when it is
ready, every one that is admitted to taſte
it, dives into it with his hand, and dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in his Fiſt, till it be ſhap'd into a
Ball and cool'd, then caſts it into his
Mouth. The other diſh is known by the
name of <hi>Pillów,</hi> vulgarly pronounced
<hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w,</hi> and it is the ſame with that which
I ſaid has ſo near a reſemblance with the
Spaniſh <hi>Olla Podrida.</hi> Beſides theſe two
Diſhes, the <hi>Moors</hi> of a better allay make
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53922:74"/>
their Breakfaſts of <hi>Bonuélo</hi>'s, or ſmall
Loaves boyled in Oyl, which they eat
with Sugar, or Honey.</p>
                  <p>The Countrey <hi>Moors</hi> feed much on
Milk, which they are by their Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to taſte, if it has been touch'd
by a Dog. They have ſtore of Cheeſe,
but very courſe and homely. And as for
their Butter, we may ſuſpect their clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
in making it; for they Churn it
in a Sheep or Goat skin, dreſſed or fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for that office, which they ſhake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their Hands.</p>
                  <p>But not much delighted with their
Dary-houſe, I leave it to obſerve their
Reverence to Bread and Corn, which is
both great and general, for from the
Throne to the Plough, if any ſee a crum
of the one, or a grain of the other caſt
out, or ſcatter'd, he ſtoops to take it
up, kiſſeth it, puts it to his Fore-head,
and looking up, ſaith, <hi>Dill an, It is from
God;</hi> and then gives it to the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that will eat it.</p>

                  <p>ALL Religions in their firſt model
and Conſtitution have had ſome
leſs intelligible Articles and things of
a remoter ſignification, mingled with
their eaſier Doctrin's, and more obvious
Inſtitutions. And there has ever bin
found a Catholique agreement, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the main Article of the Deity, but
alſo in ſome ſolemne manner of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Upon which conſideration there
were ritual circumſtances eſtabliſhed,
for the more decent celebration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Miniſters. In the number of
which <hi>ritual Circumstances,</hi> I eſteem <hi>a
dedicate place, Separate Time, ſolemne
Actions, Preſcript Forms,</hi> and above all a
<hi>distinct Order</hi> of <hi>Perſons,</hi> by whom the
Exteriot Religion is to be officiated, and
to whom for the Power &amp; Sacredneſs of
their Function there have ever bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53922:75"/>
convenient Obſervances and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.
How determinate the <hi>Alchoran</hi>
is in theſe particulars, falls not within
the compaſs of theſe remarkes, but it is
evident to thoſe that attentively read it,
that the Author thereof ſeems not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to be definitive. But what ever
the mind was of that Impoſtor concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mentioned Rites, we find his
Sectaries have in all their Dominions
made Proviſion for Solemnity in their
Worſhip. Being guided thereunto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the more laſting and regular
Principles of Reaſon, or in imitation
of ſome people of an other Perſwaſion,
which they eſteem'd Wiſe and Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
Nor can <hi>Mahumed</hi> be blamed for
not leaving Decretals in the Rights of
worſhip, becauſe their nature is of ſo
great an indifferency, that no Religion
doth acknowledge them to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in every particular by any Law,
meriting, or uſurping, the title Divine:
neither is there any thing in themſelves
to make them originally neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And therefore without enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Motives by which the Moors or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have been induced to the uſage of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53922:76"/>
the Acceſſories of Religion, I only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that the Moors are not therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;
having Churches, Prieſts, Times,
Revenues, &amp;c. appropriate to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Adoration.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with their Giámma's,
Moſchs or Churches in which this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
abounds, and to which the Moors
perform a great Reverence and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
never ſuffering them to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan'd,
nor to want a competent ſtock
to keep them in repaires. The manner
obſerv'd in the erection of a new Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ámma
is orderly and laudable, which
is thus: When a conſiderable Number
of People have agreed and reſolved to
ſettle together in neighborhood, they
ſeek out a piece of ground convenient
for their purpoſe, which by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is divided, every family being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
ſufficient Room, whereof to
rear an habitation. This done their
next care is to ſet apart a ſpot of Earth
for the foundation of their Giámma,
with great regard that it have no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
inequality of diſtance from their
ſeveral habitations. After they have
thus fram'd their Deſigne, the Giámma
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53922:76"/>
is firſt built, to which Holy work all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
ſexes, and qualities of perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
their labours Gratis, every one
valuing it for a peculiar felicity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to have his hands and ſhoulders
wearied in ſuch a ſacred imployment.
The fabrick or Giámma being finiſh'd,
they dedicate it to no Patronage but the
Publique Worſhip, nor uſe any other
ceremony of conſecration, but only
chooſe one that is able to read the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
whom they accompany to the new
Giámma, where ſome parcel of their
Law is read, and their Sallà's, or offices
perform'd, and from that time it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Holy place. And the Giámma
being thus raiſed to its full Stature, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
family begins a Cotage for it ſelf,
and when they are built, they ſeek for
an Alfaqui, or Prieſt, to Officiate in
their new Church, with whom they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
for a yearly Penſion.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt reſtrain this cuſtome of
building Churches to the <hi>Barabárs</hi> who
have fixed Manſions; for the <hi>Alárbs</hi> who
retain no place of conſtant habitation,
have for their Giámma a large Tent
ſtanding exactly in the middle of their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53922:77"/>
dwelling-Tents, whither they reſort at
Canonical hours to their Oriſons, in
which they are comformable to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Moors.</p>
                  <p>The Giámma's doe all agree in the
faſhion of ſtructure; being all long and
generally narrow, not running into
Iles, nor branching into Chappels and
Quires. Their ſituation is Eaſt and
Weſt, without any windows at all, nor
have their Giámma's doores but on the
North-ſide. <hi>[They are without the too
eaſie accommodations of ſeats, Pews, or ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:]</hi>
the floor of the Giámma is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
matted, and ſo are the walls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two foot high. If the roof be large
and weighty it is ſupported with pillars,
among which hang the lamps, which are
kept burning all the night.</p>
                  <p>Every Giámma has a turret, on whoſe
top is placed a Creſcent, or half Moon
(a <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Cognizance) from this
Turret the <hi>Almudén,</hi> or Sexton, with a
loud voice invites the People to Prayers,
which ſupplies the forbidden uſe of
Bells. The Moors keep their Giámma's
in a very Reverend decency, never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
any dilapidations. None are
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53922:77"/>
vouchſafed to enter them but the Males
of their own Religion, which makes it
dangerous for Chriſtians or Jews to
look within them; yet if this happens
they think not the Holy place to be
thereby any way deſecrated. But this
ſignal reſpect to their Churches, renders
not their Devotions elſewhere perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd,
to be invalid; yet if poſſible they
never faile to be at their Giámm's, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
much to the Statary prayers made
in the Church.</p>
                  <p>In greater Towns there are many
Giámma's: in <hi>Tituàn</hi> fifteen, in <hi>Alcázar</hi>
more, in <hi>Arzíla,</hi> five, and in <hi>Fez</hi> ſeven
hundred. Among which there is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
for the <hi>Giámma Gheber,</hi> or
<hi>Great Giámma,</hi> being the <hi>Cathedral,</hi> or
Mother-Church, commands the reſt, and
is the Cure of the <hi>Alcalib,</hi> or Chief-Prieſt.
To the <hi>Giamma Gheber</hi> all the
other Giámma's conforme in the houre

                  <p>THe Moors have at this day no
Schools of Science, like the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean
Univerſities and Colledges;
which may be a main reaſon of their
Growing ſtupidity and Barbariſm; for
the want either of leiſure, or lack of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ſtudy Arts and Sciences,
becauſe their whole time is ſpent in
gaining whereon to live, through a
deficiency whereof the politeſt Nations
will ſoon degenerate into ignorance
and ruſticity. As for the Colledge call'd
<hi>Amarodóch</hi> in <hi>Fez</hi> (whoſe ſtructure
coſt King <hi>Aba Henen</hi> 480000 Crowns,
and which has been ſo amply celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Concinnity of its building,
delightfulneſs of ſcituation, carved roof,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53922:78"/>
Moſaic Arches and brazen gates) it is
now wholly deſtitute of Students. And
if the Moors were not carefull to keep
up great ſtore of Petty Schooles, they
would ſoon decay and fall into a total
illiterature. In theſe Petty Scholes the
<hi>Alfáqui,</hi> or Prieſt, takes in the firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Learning, without any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of climbing higher than to write
and read; and if a Youth be found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and capacious, and bearing a
good affection to the Prieſthood, when
he has arriv'd to the firſt forme in the
School, he is removed thence, and placed
with one of the beſt learned <hi>Alfàqui's</hi> in
the Town, or <hi>Cavíla</hi> where the School is
kept. And this new Tutor inſtructs his
Pupil to read the <hi>Alcoran</hi> with perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
and to underſtand the principal
points it containes: The Tutor likewiſe
informes him of all the Rites of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ámma,
which being both few and eaſy,
are quickly obtain'd; and when the
Schollar is deem'd competent both for
age and Learning to be a Prieſt, then
his Inſtitutor call's two or three <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fáquis</hi>
more to examine the Candidate,
who being found deſerving, they grant
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53922:79"/>
him Teſtimonials of his willingneſs and
abilities to be an <hi>Alfáqui:</hi> And this is
all the education and Orders, which I
could obſerve to be beſtowed upon their
Prieſts. But it is very remarkable, that
among the Moors none are admitted to
this Holy Dignity, but ſuch as are of a
competent age, and marryed; for the
former they render this reaſon, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
ought not to be admitted to the
Prieſthood; but I conceive that their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
with which they are notoriouſly
gifted, is the fitteſt account can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the later.</p>
                  <p>The Moors ſuffer no Giámma to be
vacant, becauſe they eſteem an <hi>Alfáqui</hi>
to be altogether neceſſary to exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Religion; and that Common Perſons,
or the Laity, performing the ſolemn
offices of Religion, doth make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
For Holy Rites are no more to
be diſpenſed by all, than the ſecular
Laws; and though all men have common
Intereſt both in Religion &amp; the Laws,
yet all cannot be Adminiſters of either.
And upon this conſideration, that in the
Combinations and Communions of men
Religion cannot ſubſiſt, without ſome
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53922:79"/>
to guide, officiate, and preſcribe the
miniſteries thereof, the Moors are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to provide an <hi>Alfáqui</hi> for every Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ámma,
that there may be no vacancy,
nor omiſſion in the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Alfáqui</hi> the Lay-Moors pay a
ſignal Reverence, giving him the more
honourable hand, and place. They
plough his ground, dreſs his vineyard,
reap his Corn, &amp;c. to the end that by no
ſecular cares he may be interrupted in
his Function; And by this I am guided
to look into the office of the <hi>Alfáqui,</hi>
which is firſt, to preſerve the Giámma in
decency, and to provide that the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
be not dilapſed, &amp; that the Lamps
and matts be duely ſupplyed. But the
Prieſt never puts his hand to any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
work, having thoſe under him upon
whom all the drudgery is diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the <hi>Alfáqui</hi>'s of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is, to inſpect the Inſtitution of the
children; to which purpoſe he hath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
under him, one that is fit for the
toyle, and reſerves to himſelf no more
but the examination of the Childrens
proficiency, which he doth once a week;
and thoſe whom he finds remiſs, receive
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53922:80"/>
his Correction, but the diligent, the
marks of his approbation. They have
no free Schools, but pay a weekly ſalary
to thoſe whom the <hi>Alfáqui</hi> doth appoint
to teach, for none can be a School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
without his Licence and approof.</p>
                  <p>His next care is to take notice who
abſent themſelves from the Giámma,
having power at his own diſcretion to
puniſh whomſoever he obſerves to be
therein delinquent. He is very vigilant
to aſſiſt the ſick, whom dying he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
to the Grave. If there happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diſagreement among the Neighbours,
the <hi>Alfáqui</hi> mediates a reconcilement,
but if the Quarrel exceeds ill language,
and be concerning <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> he
is not permitted to intermeddle.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Alfáqui</hi> diſlike his Cure, he hath
liberty of removall, being not confin'd
to any <hi>Parochial</hi> Giámma above a year,
and he ſeldome contracts for a longer
ſpace. And for that time he is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent
of the <hi>Moſch,</hi> out of whoſe
Rents he defraies all the Charges for
Reparations, &amp;c. takeing the ſurplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
for himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And now the remarke paſſeth to the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53922:80"/>
Revenues of the Giámma, which chiefly
ariſe from the Donatives of the dead. In
ſome places the Incoms are very large,
in all comfortable; for the Moors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
a great benevolence to places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to Religion: whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
many ſtiled Chriſtians, who caſt
aſide the leaſt ſheaf for the Tenth, and
who are ſo far from enlarging the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
Patrimony, that they are ready to
devour the pitiful Remainder that ſhe
ſtill enjoyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Muley Mahumed,</hi> in his third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
enjoynes his <hi>Muſalmim</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality,
and Almſ-deeds, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from goods honeſtly gotten are
according to the <hi>Alcoran</hi> meritorious of
Paradiſe. He likwiſe prefers private
Almes before the publick, and declares
the Devil to be an inplacable enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this expreſſion of mercy. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there are many ſuch pious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but they are but
as ſo many good eares of corn in a good
field of Tares, or as ſo many ſingle grains
loſt in a heap of chaff: it having been
the ſubtilty of the old Serpent in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to guild over his poyſonous Pills,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53922:81"/>
and to blend Truth with falſhood, that
the latter might be embrac'd for the ſake
of the former. Beſides it is an ancient
miſtake to think, that Truth and falſhood
are of too great a contrariety and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to mingle and concorporate;
which makes many when they have found
ſome truth in Doctrine, to conclude no
falſhood to be joyned with it. And thoſe
truths which are diſperſed up and down
in <hi>Mahumed</hi>'s Law, being evident to its
Profeſſors, make them credulous of the
whole ſyſtem. And though they are
zealous for all the precepts, yet for
none more than that which concernes
Almſ-deeds; for they have their <hi>Aſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ràh</hi>
which is an Anniverſary Feſtival,
whereat they beſtow a certain quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Subſtance upon the Poore.
But the greateſt Bounties are towards
the Giámma, to which every one at his
death leaves a Portion of his eſtate, by
which method the Giámma has conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
endowments, which are under a
continual improvement, and made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of no manner of Alienation.</p>
                  <p>To every Giámma there belongs an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudèn,</hi>
or a kind of Sexton, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53922:81"/>
is to call the people to Church at the
houres of prayer; which he doth from
the top of the Turret (mention'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove)
crying with a voice articulate
and loud, <hi>Illáh Ghebèr, God is the great;</hi>
and ſometimes, <hi>Lailláh La Mahumèd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſúl
allá.</hi> There is but one God, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humed</hi>
the Meſſenger of God. And theſe
words the <hi>Almudèn</hi> pronounceth at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
corner of the Turret, beginning
at the Eaſt, and ending at the point that
looks toward <hi>Mecha;</hi> by which they ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify,
that all the corners of the world
ſhould look towards <hi>Mecha</hi> in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Deity, that is be <hi>Mahumedans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next office of the <hi>Almudèn</hi> is, to
open the doores of the Giámma, to trim
the Lamps, and keep the matts in repair
and cleanlineſs. He alſo informes the
<hi>Alfáqui,</hi> who hath an inherent power
to puniſh thoſe who can ſhow no good
reaſon of their abſence.</p>
                  <p>But the penalty is very tolerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more than five or ſix pounds of
<hi>Cuſcuſsòw,</hi> which the offender brings to
the Giámma, where it is eaten by the
Prieſt and the Aſſembly. None are found
to offend therein through contempt, or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53922:82"/>
wilfulneſs, nor yet through the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their pleaſures; for there is ſo
ſtrict an obſervance of the Church-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that the husband will leave the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his wife to be there, if he hears the
<hi>Almudèn</hi> ſpeaking the <hi>Invitatory.</hi> The laſt
branch of the <hi>Almuden</hi>'s office is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
the people, which he doth at the
end of the Salla, or Oriſons, in the ſame
words that he called them together. And
now before I cloſe up this chapter, I
cannot, ſpeaking of their Eccleſiaſtique
penance, but obſerve that the Moors have
no ſuch thing as excommunication, ſo
that they are for no crime debarr'd the
Giámma; but on the contrary the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
mulct inflicted by the Prieſt is for
their abſence, above three times in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four hours, from that Holy Place.</p>

                  <p>THe Moor's ſeaſon of Prayers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
five times in twenty four
hours, or a Natural day; The firſt is,
<hi>Alowilíc Sbah,</hi> and comes about Noone;
The ſecond they call <hi>Allahiric Luli,</hi>
which is about three a clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon;
The third <hi>Ateltháh Aſèr,</hi> at the

laſt, <hi>Alhamſáh Magnib,</hi> which is in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little before day. At every aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Prayers are the ſame, except
that at the <hi>Allahiríc Luli</hi> they repeat the
<hi>La illa Ghehèr</hi> but thrice. The Moors
eſteem the prayers made in the Giámma
to be of the greateſt efficacy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all endeavour to performe them
there, but thoſe who cannot repair thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doe diſcharge this duty, where
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53922:83"/>
the ſolemn houres find them</p>
                  <p>In their addreſſes to theſe Holy cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations
the Moors uſe great tokens of
reverence, being very punctual in fitting
themſelves for the Giámma. Their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
preparative conſiſts in waſhing;
which is ſuch a neceſſary right, that
without its obſervation it is impoſſible
to be of their Religion. And it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
to all acquainted with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humedan</hi>
Inſtitutes, that Waſhing is a
great part of that Law; nor need this
create any man's wonder, ſeeing that
all the <hi>Muſalmim</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> uſe
waſhing in a myſtic ſignification of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
purity, and that the ſoul receives
the benefit of their corporeal Lavors.
None among them returne from natural
evacuations, but they waſh the parts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to defilement, nor will any who is
a Virtuoſo in the Ceremomies, eat with
unwaſht handes: which at firſt I Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
a mere Civil Cleanlineſs, becauſe
they uſe no knives, &amp;c. but tear their
viands in pieces with their fingers,
but upon farther ſcrutiny I perceiv'd it
to be reckon'd by the ſuperſtitioſi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Actions of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:53922:83"/>
In places where they have hot Bathes
(which are in few places wanting) they
uſe them after concubinate, and all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident
pollutions; but their greateſt
exactneſs in waſhing, is at their going to
prayer. Then every part where nature
disburdens her excretions, is warily
cleanſed, and the other parts alſo which
are more egregiouſly obnoxious to pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If any Moor after he has waſht
at home, in his way to the Giámma
chance but to belch, he dares not enter
the Holy r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>of of untill he has us'd the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore in the foundation
of a Giámma, great care is taken that it
may ſtand near ſome ſpring, or recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of water, that thoſe who come to
the Church, may be provided with that
element in caſe of any contingent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement,
without the trouble of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home to waſh.</p>
                  <p>When they come to the door of the
Giámma, every one puts off his ſhooes at
the threſhold, and then enters with a
ſlow pace, erect body, and eyes baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
looking towards Heaven: in this
poſture they advance directly to the
ſouthſide of the Giámma, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53922:84"/>
make their prayers toward that
point, becauſe in all their devotions they
are commanded to make them toward
<hi>Mecha.</hi> While they are in the Giámma
none dare openly to yawne, Cough, walk,
diſcourſe, ſpit, ſcratch his head or face,
but if any has need but to wipe his lipps,
he doth it unſeen, covering his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
with his <hi>Alheìc,</hi> which is a looſe
garment generally worn by the Moors.</p>
                  <p>And by theſe Reverences in their
Carriage toward Holy places and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
they are taught to upbraid
the Chriſtians, whoſe behaviours at ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
ſolemnities ſome of the Moors have
obſerv'd to be of a far different character.
And this I learned from a Moor who had
unluckily been in England to make the
animadverſion, with whome when I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
about this point, he told me
with anger and indignation in his looks,
that it was a ſhame to ſee women, Dogs,
and dirty ſhooes, brought into a place
ſacred to God's worſhip, and that men
ſhould walk and diſcourſe in a <hi>Moſch,</hi>
as in a publick <hi>Borſa</hi> or <hi>Exchange,</hi> and
that they ſhould have Chaires there to
ſit in with as much laſcivious eaſe, as at
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53922:84"/>
home: which with other actions of the
like irreverence he zealouſly repeated to
reproach the Chriſtian. And indeed I
was not furniſht with arguments to
(nor could in conſcience) excuſe any
conſiderable part of his Animadverſion:
only I told him; That as for the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Women from the publick offices
of the <hi>Moſch,</hi> it was a doctrine of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
grounded upou conceits of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
peculiar to that ſex, which are
not ſo far to be own'd, as for them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the females from the meanes of
their chiefeſt felicity. Beſides this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion
of women, was an Article of
Intereſt and Policy, and which <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
adopted into his Religion on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to compleaſe the Jew, who at this
day begins his publick Prayer with a
thankſgiving to God, <hi>que no le hizo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
that he did not make him a woman,
a creature not allowed to ſerve him in
the Synagogue, &amp; that ſeeing we wanted
reaſons which moved the Moors to this
practice, we could incurr no ſcandal by
its rejection. As for his objecting our
bringing Dogs into the Church, I told him
it was an uncomely and irreverend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53922:85"/>
&amp; wholly abhorr'd by knowing.
Chriſtians; that there was a Proviſion
made againſt it, and that it had been his
ill hap to look into a Church, where the
Sanction in that particular met with a
remiſs execution. Next, as to our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeates in the <hi>Moſch</hi> (for I was to
ſpeak in his own dialect) and to ſit at
ſome parts of Divine ſervice, Cuſtom
and innocent convenience were all
that any one could pretend to hollow
it. But as for walking in the Church
in time of Divine Service, or therein
at any time to diſcourſe of ſecular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
that it was only the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of profane and ill diſciplin'd
minds, the miſcarriage of the rude,
contrary to the Rule, and a certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of a relaxed Diſcipline and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Superintendent.
<q>Pudet haec opprobria—.</q>
But I return to the <hi>Giámma,</hi> whither the
<hi>Alfáqui</hi> comes not till a conſiderable
number of the People are aſſembled;
who in the Prieſts abſence ſpend their
time in a devout repetition of the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:53922:85"/>
a Word that ſignifies the whole
Form of their Prayers. And when the
<hi>Alfáqui</hi> is come, he advanceth ſtraight to
the South-ſide of the <hi>Moſch,</hi> and the
People fall orderly into ranks behind
him. Upon this the Prieſt begins the
Prayer in a Voice moderately elevated,
which the People humbly repeat after
him. At the pronouncing of <hi>Illah El
Gheber,</hi> that is, <hi>God is the great,</hi> they
all uſe an Elevation both of Hands and
Eyes to Heaven: at the name of <hi>Mecha,</hi>
they all kiſs the Ground; but when they
mention <hi>Muley Mahumed,</hi> and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
he procures them, they fall proſtrate,
and upon the ſudden, in a kind of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
reaſſume an erect. When the
Prieſt hath repeated <hi>la illah Mahumed
Reſul Allah</hi> four times, the <hi>Almuden</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſeth
the People. And when they
leave the <hi>Giamma,</hi> the <hi>Alfáqui</hi> goes firſt,
as a token of his Prelacy above the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Their <hi>Salláh</hi> or Service is very
ſhort, for if it took up any conſiderable
time, the frequency of its return would
take up moſt of their leiſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be a ſenſible impediment to their
Temporal Vocations.</p>

In the cloſure of this Chapter, I
thought to have ſpoken ſomething of the
<hi>Moreſco</hi> Muſick in the <hi>Moſch,</hi> but this I
found to be a delightful piece of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein they ſeem to be very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
I have been told, that in former

reſerv'd the Church-Government to
himſelf and his Succeſſors: Which is ſtill
viſible in the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi> and the
<hi>Sophi;</hi> for albeit the one hath a <hi>Mufti,</hi>
and the other a <hi>Mustard-Dini</hi> to inſpect
the Eccleſiaſtick Affairs, and to be as
the Oracular Interpreters of the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan</hi>
Law, yet their Election is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municably
in themſelves. And albeit
that theſe Principal Church-men are had
in ſo great eſteem with their Princes,
that their Deciſions are ſcarce ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53922:87"/>
by them, yet when their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
are not conſiſtent with the
Intereſt of the Publick, theſe great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
are diſmiſt, and others introduc'd,
who are not ſo ſcrupulous in their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
By which it is evident, that the
<hi>Mahumedan</hi> Princes are in effect the
Heads of the Church, and chief Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
of Religion. But not much of
this can be obſerved in the <hi>Moors</hi> Church-Government,
who have in every <hi>Cavíla</hi>
(or County) an <hi>Alcalib,</hi> or High-Prieſt,
in whoſe nomination the ſecular Power
doth not at all interpoſe, for he is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of, and by the <hi>Alfaqùis,</hi> over
whom he is inveſted with a Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is enabled to Depoſe, or otherwiſe
Chaſtiſe the Offending Clergy. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon this Arch-Prieſts Election,
he is poſſeſs'd of the <hi>Giámma Gheber,</hi> or
Great Church: Wherein upon every
Friday he Expounds ſome Text of the
<hi>Alchoran,</hi> unto which Exerciſe he always
goes accompanyed with the chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages
of the Neighborhood. And being
enter'd the Church, he immediatly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
the <hi>Albambár</hi> (which is a Bench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
five ſteps from the Ground) with a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53922:87"/>
tall Staff in his Hand, wherewith he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
beats upon the Bench to expreſs his
Zeal, and to awaken the People to a
more ſignal attention to what he then
delivers. This Diſcourſe, Homily, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
or Sermon, exceeds not an hour
and a quarter in length, and is deliver'd
exactly by heart. And when it is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the <hi>Almuden</hi> diſſolves the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the <hi>Alcalib</hi> returns to his Houſe
accompanyed with the chief of the place,
and in his paſſage he receives the cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Tokens of reſpect from the People.
And whatever ſome Curſory Review of
this Countrey tell us of the other Prieſts
making Sermons to the People, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with ſome diligence made enquiry
into this particular, I found that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Preaching was peculiar to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calib,</hi>
or Chief-Prieſt, and that no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were celebrated at any other
Church, but at the <hi>Giámma Gheber</hi> (that
which I may Engliſh the Cathedral.)
This eminent Church-man is ſeldom ſeen
in Publick, but at this Exerciſe; for to
make himſelf the more Reverenced he
affects retirement, ſpending his hours in
the ſtudy of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and in reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53922:88"/>
ſuch Caſes as the Layity preſent
him, who eſteem his Reſolutions infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And this, with a careful Inſpection
into the deportment of the Inferior
Clergy, doth conſtitute the Office and
Government of the <hi>Alcalib.</hi> As for his
Revenues, they are ſuitable to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
and as to his Life, it is auſtere
and reſerv'd, he affecting a peculiar Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
in all his carriage. Every <hi>Alcalib</hi>
has his diſtinct Dioceſs, out of which
he has no power, ſo that the <hi>Alcalib</hi> of
<hi>Beni-Arós</hi> hath nothing to do in <hi>Minkél,</hi>
for every one is abſolute in his own <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>víla.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the publick Inſtructions of the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ámma,</hi>
none are preſent but the Males,
for the Women, as I ſaid, are denyed
admiſſion into the Aſſembly, yet are not
wholy deſtitute of the means of being
taught Religion: for upon every Friday
they repair to the Houſe of the <hi>Alfaquí,</hi>
where his Wife is bound to Inſtruct
them: But her Lectures uſually concern
good Houſwifry, and how they ſhould
demean themſelves to their Husbands, in
Obedience and Submiſſion, and to live
in Peace with their Fellow-wives. All
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53922:88"/>
the while the Women are at the Prieſts
Houſe, he is not to return home, nor
ſtir out of the <hi>Giámma,</hi> but hath his
Meat brought him thither. But for what
reaſon the Prieſt ſhould be under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
I leave any one to imagine, who
has heard of the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Jealouſie. But
now in caſe the Prieſt has no Wife, who
ſeldom wants four; or that by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
ſhe is not able to perform this
Office, then it is diſcharged by ſome
aged Matron of the place: and for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſupplement of the Womens being
debarr'd of the <hi>Giámma,</hi> their Husbands
repeat unto them ſuch Leſſons as they
have heard there. And this is all that
on this account I could obſerve of the
<hi>Moors</hi> Women.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Muley Mahumed</hi> ſtyled Prayer the Key
of Paradiſe, and the Pillar of Religion,
that he might the better recommend its
practice to his Converts, who generally
maintain ſo careful a performance of this
Duty, that no ſecular buſineſs can detain
them from, nor any thing divert them at
their Devotion. I once endeavor'd to
collect their Prayers into an Order, the
better to take a diſtinct view of this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53922:89"/>
of their Religion, but I found them
reduced to no certain Form extracted
out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but were a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome incoherent Sentences mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
the Power and Mercy of God.
Their firſt Prayer, or rather their Creed,
is that which the <hi>Almuden</hi> Proclaims with
a loud voice, when he calls the People to
the <hi>Moſch;</hi> as there is but one God, and
<hi>Mahumed</hi> his Meſſenger: and this admits
of no variation. The ſecond Prayer is
the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is ſome difference according to
Tranſlations (in which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> hath
been very unhappy) but thoſe which I
have ſeen in <hi>Latin, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi>
agree in this Traduction of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Name of God, Gracious and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
King of the Day of Judgment: thou
art He whom we adore: it is from Thee
that we require help: guide us in the right
way, in the way of thoſe with whom Thou
art pleaſed, against whom Thou art not
angry, and we ſhall not go astray.</hi> This
Prayer is repeated with the former, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame manner as the Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
their <hi>Pater noster</hi> with the <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:53922:89"/>
For the <hi>Moors</hi> have their <hi>Teſſerae
Precariae,</hi> or their Beads, wherewith
they number their Prayers. And the
whole <hi>Corona</hi> or <hi>Roſary</hi> conſiſts of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
eight, which the <hi>Devoti,</hi> or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
affected, carry always about them.
They have a Cuſtom to repeat often to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the firſt Words of the Prayer,
which they conclude to be a great act of
Charity, as ſupplying by this Repetition
the defaults of ſuch as are remiſs in this
duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Name of God, Merciful and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi>
is the Proeme of every Chapter in
the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and were the firſt Words
that <hi>Mahumed</hi> is ſaid to have ſpoken
when he came out of his <hi>Epileptick</hi> Fits,
which he made the People believe were
Trances. And with the ſame Words
the <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Doctors begin all their
Diſcourſes, and the Letters written in
<hi>Moreſco</hi> Language, if the Pen-men are
preciſe, are likewiſe introduced in the
ſame Form. There is a Learned Man,
that tells of a Prayer among the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medans,</hi>
which is called, <hi>The Prayer of
Jeſus the Son of Mary,</hi> ending thus, <hi>And
let not ſuch an one bear rule over me, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53922:90"/>
will have no pity upon me, for thy mercy
ſake, O thou most merciful.</hi> But having
diligently enquired, I could not find
that the preſent <hi>Moors</hi> have any ſuch Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
in their Uſes. There are few who
are able to read, that want Manuals of
Private Devotions, which are compoſed
by the <hi>Morabito</hi>'s or <hi>Morabouts,</hi> and are
indeed rather to be termed Charms, then
Prayers. Now theſe <hi>Morabito</hi>'s or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabouts,</hi>
are a ſort of <hi>Alárbes</hi> which are
skilled, or ſo pretend to be, in the Law
of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> ſevere in their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
bearing a great oſtentation of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
pretending to Propheſie, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.
They compoſe all ſorts of
Charms, to which the <hi>Moor</hi> is ſo addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he has one for every occaſion:
I have ſeen a whole Book thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ſome for the Child-bearing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to facilitate their Travel; ſome
for the Paſſenger, to guide him in the
way; ſome for the Soldier; and one
for the Horſe, which is much in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Saddle: This they hang un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Beaſts Neck, and believe that it
keeps him from being blind, or dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted.
They have likewiſe Spells to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53922:90"/>
keep their Cattel healthy, and make
them fruitfnl, all compos'd by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabouts</hi>
and Prieſts; the latter, of late,
being much given to this ſort of Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                  <p>And now from theſe ſhort Notices of
the <hi>Giámma</hi> and its Appendages, I paſs
to ſpeak of the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Sabbaoth. That
the fifth day of the Week, is the Weekly
Feſtival of the <hi>Mahumedans,</hi> to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
them from the <hi>Jew,</hi> who keeps the
ſixth according to our account, and from
the Chriſtian who obſerves the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
is known unto every one that
knows any thing of this ſubject. About
the Inſtitution of this Sabbaoth, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Opinions may be met with: For
ſome derive its Original from the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<hi>Mahumed</hi> bore to the New Moon,
which is ſaid to have appeared on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
the ſame day he began his Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
and in memory of ſo happy an
abodement, he ſet apart this for Solemn
Worſhip. There is another Conjecture
which fetcheth its Inſtitution from ſome
Heathen Rites paid on this day to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
whoſe name Friday bears. But
there is little ground of this Opinion,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53922:91"/>
further then it may well ſuit with the
Genius of <hi>Mahumediſm,</hi> to have a day
Sacred to the Goddeſs of Carnality. But
that Opinion herein ſeems beſt to agree
with the Chronicles of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> which
makes his eſcape from the Conſpiracy
of the Nobles of <hi>Mecha,</hi> to have been
the occaſion of this Sabbaoth, from
which deliverance the <hi>Mahumedan Hegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
had its Original and Name. And in
this <hi>Mahumed</hi> undoubtedly imitated the
Ancient Chriſtians, who took their <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s
from ſome notable Perſecutions.
But whatever was the Original of this
Sabbaoth, I obſerv'd that it has no great
marks of Reverence above other days:
for on it the <hi>Moors</hi> go to Plough, hold
their Markets, open Shops, and omit
little of their Ordinaries, ſo that I muſt
retract my calling of it a Sabbaoth.</p>
                  <p>They indeed on this day have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
at the <hi>Giámma Gheber,</hi> and on
it they put on their whiteſt <hi>Alheics,</hi> dreſs
their Locks, and are ſeen in their beſt
Accoutrements. The Women likewiſe
on this day viſit the Sepulchres, and
and ſtrew the Graves of their deceaſed
Friends with green Boughes and Herbs.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53922:91"/>
And this is all that I have been able to
remark upon this ſubject.</p>

Every one of theſe Local <hi>Alcaddées</hi>
has two Aſſeſſors, who in abſtruſer
Pleas aſſiſt him with their Counſels: But
the chief Employment of theſe Sides<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
is to Copy out the Sentences of
the <hi>Alcaddée,</hi> and to draw up all the
Contracts that come to be confirm'd by
him; for there is no bargain eſteem'd
Legal and Authentick, till it be certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the Hand and Seal of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
<hi>Alcaddée.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors,</hi> as all other <hi>Mahumedans,</hi>
acknowledge the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
Rule both of Civil Juſtice and
Religion, and therefore according to
the Letter and Interpretation thereof,
the <hi>Alcaddée</hi> frames all his Definitions
and Judgements. Here's no Intreaguing
the Plea with Reſolutions, Caſes, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents,
Reports, Moth-eaten Statutes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But every thing is determin'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the freſh Circumſtances of
the Fact, and the Proof of what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd.
The Teſtimony of two Men,
if they are of known ſobriety, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make good the Allegation; but
there muſt be twelve to ratifie it, if their
Converſation be ſuſpected: for the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53922:93"/>
                     <hi>Moors</hi> believe, that amongſt twelve Men
as much honeſty may be met with, as will
equal what can be found in any two. If
any <hi>Alfaquí</hi> or Prieſt be introduced to
give evidence to the depending Conteſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
his bare Affirmative or Negative depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is of validity to put a period to the
Diſpute, and the <hi>Alcaddée</hi> ſuperſedes all
Enquiry, when the Prieſt hath declared
the ſtate of the Cauſe. And in this, as
in all other Inſtances, they give a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Eſtimation to their Prieſts, whoſe
Preſence ſecures the Civil Diſquiſitions
a great Veneration with the Many.</p>
                  <p>In taking the Teſtimony of a Moore
upon Oath, the Servant of the <hi>Alcaddée</hi>
carries the Deponent to the <hi>Giámma</hi> or
<hi>Moſch,</hi> where in the preſence of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caddée</hi>
he ſwears by that holy place, that
he will declare all what he knowes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the matter, to which he is to
give Evidence. But oaths are never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
to any in another man<hi>'s</hi> Caſe,
but ſuch as are ſuſpected Perſons, and
they are uſually numbred among the
Rogues, and faithleſs, who have no
Credit without them; Beſides it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
permitted for a man to ſwear in his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53922:93"/>
own Caſe, but for want of Witneſſes,
or when the Accuſation is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the Impeached cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Receive Purgation. As for the
Chriſtian, and Jew, they are ſuffer'd to
give Teſtimony according to the Rites
and Cuſtoms of their own Religions, but
the Moors, are not forward to put them
upon this Tryal, as doubting that fear
of Puniſhment, ſhould tempt them
to perjury, and thoſe who are thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
acceſſory (according to the <hi>Moreſco</hi>
Principle) are involv'd in the Guilt.</p>
                  <p>In Pleas of Debt, it is required that
the Reality of the Debt be firſt manifeſt,
which being done before the <hi>Alcaddée,</hi> he
ſignifies it to the <hi>Almocadèm</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>víla</hi>
where the Debtor lives, who upon
his Signification, commandes a preſent
payment to be made; but if the Debtor
refuſe or be unable, to give the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
Satisfaction, the <hi>Almocadém</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
him to the <hi>Alháb's,</hi> or Priſon (which
is alwaies near the <hi>Almocadéms</hi> houſe)
where he ſtayes till bayled thence by
ſufficient Sureties, or Perſonally payes
the debt.</p>
                  <p>And to ſecure their Courts of Juſtice
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53922:94"/>
from interfering, or claſhing oue with
another, the <hi>Alcaddée</hi> of one <hi>Cavíla</hi>
may not intermeddle with any thing
that is tranſacted in an other, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one moves orderly in his own Sphere,
and confines his proceedings within
the Punctual Limits of his Aſſigned Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.
And that herein there might
be no Colluſion, Covin, or Impoſture,
every <hi>Alcaddée</hi> has his Privy Seal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he firmes the contract, or other
things that paſs under his hand. And the
Seal is uſually engraven with the name of
the <hi>Alcaddée,</hi> and Place of his Office. And
yet notwithſtanding this care to prevent,
they have the Villany of forging deeds,
which is done by ſome skill'd in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caddé</hi>'s
office. But upon detection he that
produces the forged Paper is immediatly
impriſon'd, and remaines without hope
of enlargement, till he declares the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and after that the <hi>Alcaddée</hi> puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him a pecuniary Mulct; but he deall's
much more ſeverly with the Principal in
his Forgery, who for the firſt Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
receives a ſharp repremend from
the <hi>Alcaddée,</hi> and after that the <hi>Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadém</hi>
is order'd to burn his houſe; but
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53922:94"/>
if he be found to repeat his offence, the
Forger dyes without mercy; which juſt
rigor ſecures them from the miſchiefs of
counterfit writings to the prejudice of
anothers Right. So that this is a Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
through the whole world condignly
puniſhed; and by our own Laws, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
forgery of Deeds concerning ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

the Adulterous be Perſons of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
their Friends have Licence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
them privily, to prevent the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
reproach to their family.</p>
                  <p>In the puniſhing Fornication they
are leſs Rigorous, as finding the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
thereof not to be of ſo large a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation,
as that of Adultery. And if
the Perſons convict of this Unchaſtity
are in the ſtate of <hi>Coelibate,</hi> they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Chaſtis'd with Scourges: but if either
be married, or under matrimonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
Death is the certain penance. But
the Moors are no leſs ſolemn in whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Fornicator, than in Stoning
the Adulterer. For on Friday, after
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53922:95"/>
the Arch-Prieſt has ended his Lecture,
the Offender, if a man, is placed at the
great door of the Giàmma <hi>Guebèr,</hi> or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Church, naked down to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and in the preſence of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
receives an hundred ſtripes on his
back from an Officer appointed for that
Purpoſe, who has a certain number of
<hi>Blankéles</hi> (or <hi>Moreſco</hi> twopences,) for his
Service; the Moors as they paſſe by the
chaſtiſed, uſe theſe deprecatory words,
<hi>Allah Iffecni min had El ham.</hi> i. e. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from this wicked fellow. The
woman who hath been partner in the
filthineſs, ſuffers her puniſhment in the
night, when ſhe is whipt through the
ſtreets, but with more ſeverity than the
man, becauſe the Moors ſuppoſe the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
to be of a predominant allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in ſuch unclean commixtures.</p>
                  <p>The Moors who live in a Roaving
condition are much addicted to Thieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
againſt which the <hi>Alcaddée</hi> proceeds
by theſe ſteps of puniſhment; for the
firſt Theft the Convict is publickly
whipt in the <hi>Alſóuck</hi> or Market; for the
ſecond, he looſeth his hand; for the
third theft he may truly be ſaid to dye
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53922:96"/>
                     <hi>without mercy.</hi> For the Moors obſerve
<hi>Caligula</hi>'s Severity in making the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
exquiſitely ſenſible of his death,
which they inflict. Againſt the day of
the Theif<hi>'s</hi> Execution, the Youth of the
Place are advertis'd to prepare their
Inſtruments of blood, which are little
dry Canes, made in the faſhion of darts,
accurately ſharp pointed, theſe they
hurle at the naked body of the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
till his whole skin be ſtruck ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
full of holes, and when they find
him ſinking under the torture, they
dragg and hang him up by the heels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a gate, or the like, where he breaths
out his laſt in torments, and being dead
he is loathſomly expoſed to the birds of
prey.</p>
                  <p>In bodily injuries they obſerve the
law of Retaliation, as an Eye for an Eye,
a tooth for a tooth, &amp;c. but it is in the
power of the maimed party to Receive
a pecuniary reparation, or without any
ſatisfaction to remit the wrong; but this
is not permitted til the matter hath been
tryed before the <hi>Alcaddée,</hi> and the hurt
party publickly declared, that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
either freely to forgive the injury,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53922:96"/>
or to accept ſo much money in full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire.</p>
                  <p>And however the Municipal Laws of
ſome Countreys put a vaſt difference
between murder and man-ſlaughter,
as appeares in their defin'd puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet in <hi>Barbary</hi> all homicide, or
killing of a man by a man, is Capitall.</p>
                  <p>And the Moors have herein two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions.
The one is to Licence the next
kindred of the ſlain, to take money for
his blood of him that ſpilt it. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to permit the Relations of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to kill the murderer, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
judicial proceedure, if he be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in ſafe cuſtody; which is no more
then a purſuance of that Poſition, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
is no ſinne. Of this there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a famous Inſtance, not many months
before I left <hi>Barbary,</hi> an account where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as it was given me by my old freind
<hi>Cidi Alli Mulud Ben Ali,</hi> take as follows.</p>
                  <p>A Moor of <hi>Targa</hi> not far from <hi>Tituàn</hi>
having his Brother treacherouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
by one of the Voiſinage, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to purſue the fugitive murderer,
with deſigne to avenge his Relations
blood, and coming to <hi>Alcazer Gheber,</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:53922:97"/>
he was inform'd that the Perſon he ſought
for had ſome days before been there,
and that he had put on a Pilgrims habit,
with full reſolution to pay a holy jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to <hi>Mechà;</hi> upon which the Purſuer
put on the like habit, and in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his deſign purpoſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the ſame pilgrimage; bnt being
come to <hi>Morocco,</hi> he overtook &amp; lodg'd
with the murderer in the Pilgrims hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
where early the next morning he
ſlew him; whereupon being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and examin'd upon the freſh cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the fact, he produced a
Certificate under the hand of the <hi>Alcad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dée</hi>
of the place where he liv'd, that his
Brother was ſlain, and that he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to avenge his death, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
being fled, and likewiſe anſwered
them, that that was the Homicide whom
he had killed, whereupon he was ſet at
liberty, and the Corps left to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
to which giving a decent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he returned home to receive the
praiſes of his Gallantry.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the <hi>Alcaddée,</hi> whom I
ſhall here only obſerve in his Revenue,
and office; as to the former it is very
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53922:97"/>
conſiderable, for he ſigns not a paper
without a Fee; and as to the latter, it is
very honourable, and careful, for all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
affaires paſs through his hands, and
he dayly ſitts attending on all qualities
of perſons without varying his reſpect
to any. If he be corrupt in his Charge,
the <hi>Alcaddée Gueber,</hi> upon mature convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
turns him out of Office, which is
his extremeſt penalty.</p>
                  <p>But indeed the Miniſters of Juſtice
have no opportunity to be Colluſive, as
being free from the great allurement of
dealing falſly, for Bribery is not known
amongſt them. Uſury which (I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to intimate in this Chapter) is tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbidden by their Law, for <hi>Mahumed</hi>
hath made it an irremiſſable ſinne, and
the Uſerer in as bad a condition as the
Divell, leaving him neither will, nor
hope to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding the ſeverity of
the Law, and the ſuppoſition of this
Crime, the Moors have a Cuſtom
which much favours it; for he that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
mony of another wherewith to
trafique and gain, gives the lender an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
ſhare of the Profits, and in caſe the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53922:98"/>
borrower loſe the whole Principal, he
is obliged to make it good to him that
lends it, but if only part be loſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
is employ'd to regain it. And
it is uſual with the lender to forbear the
Borrower, till he perceives him fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
Careleſs, or Unfortunate.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the ſinne of Uſury is ſo
notorious among the Jews, the Moors
believe that for it they are oppreſſed of
God, and live Exiles from their own <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
But it is eaſy to obſerve a ſort
of Antipathie between theſe people, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that they are conjoyned
in neighbourhood, commerce, &amp; in very
many rites both civil and Religious. But
the contempt is reciprocal, for if the
Moor by way of Proverb ſay, <hi>As deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as a Jew,</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> repayes, as <hi>uvbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
as a Moor.</hi> And this enmity I
remarked in a <hi>Barabár</hi> of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who obſerving the Jews very much
frequent my lodging, he very roundly
reprov'd that Converſation, and angri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told me, That the Jews were born
to cheat both the Moor and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
that he was aſſured that they were
not deſcended of <hi>Adam,</hi> but that they
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53922:98"/>
were breed of the bone of a dead beaſt,
and when he conjectured my incredulity
of his ridiculous Story, by my ſmiling
thereat, he told me in angry zeal, that
he would pledge his head for the truth
of his Aſſertion; whereupon I demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he conceived of thoſe Jews who
turned Moors, he anſwer'd, that there
was ſuch efficacy in their religion, that it
made all thoſe good who embraced it.</p>

                  <p>THat marriage is honorable among
all men, if it were not a truth dropt
from an inſpired Pen, might be proved
by Induction, and the oecumenical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of all Nations, which pretend to
any ſetled Rites in Religion or Policy.
As for <hi>Mahumed,</hi> he had matrimony in ſo
peculiar an eſtimation, that he made it
the ſecond of his eight Precepts, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53922:99"/>
enjoyn'd every Subject of his Law to
marry in the Vigor of his Age, making
the predominant end thereof, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
and maintenance of his Sect.
He likewiſe told them that chaſt celibate
was impoſſible, and that thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to live therin, were juſtly to be
ſuſpected for unclean converſation. And
hence perhaps it comes to paſs, that
the Moors (who are the Puritans in
Mahumetiſm,) are ſo generally obſervant
of this commandment; for few among
them are found to live out of the ſtate of
Wedlock, if they are able to purchaſe
a wife. But many are not very prone
to take all the liberty in marrying indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them by their Prophet; for albeit
he permits them plurality of wives, yet
there are ſeveral families that for many
ages have confin'd themſelves to one: &amp;
I have met with thoſe who abhor that
filthy poſition father'd upon <hi>Muhumed,
That the more they are ſpiritual, the more
liberty and abilities they have to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto the perſons that are to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
there is no converſation permitted
till the Knot be tyed, ſo that both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53922:99"/>
take one the other upon truſt, and
the man perchance never ſees the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
till they be brought to the bride-chamber;
A cuſtom that would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hardly diſgeſted by the Utopians,
who think it very unreaſonable that a
man ſhould take a wife with leſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
than he doth his horſe, and that he
ſhould bring one to be the perpetual
partner of his life, with leſs informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than he doth a horſe to his ſtable,
which he may part with the next day.</p>
                  <p>But the Contriver of the New <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
findes all theſe inconveniences avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
by the cuſtom of <hi>Benſalem:</hi> where
(ſaith he) neare every Town there
is a couple of Pooles (which they call
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> Pooles;) in theſe it is
permitted to one of the Friends of the
man, another of the woman, to ſee them
ſeverally both naked. And the Moors
have a cuſtom not much differing from
this of <hi>Benſalem,</hi> for upon the deſign of
marriage two of the man's Female
friends, who have lived long enough in
wedlock to underſtand its <hi>Perquiſites,</hi>
are appointed to view the intended
Bride, and to give the Suitor an account
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53922:100"/>
of her bodily accompliſhments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
which is exactly entered in the
Contract, and if any infirmity be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
for which the husband afterward
diſliks her, he may put her away; and
this makes them very cautious to omit
nothing in the ſearch or report; But
there is no ſuch examination paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the man, becauſe he is dayly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to a free Cenſure.</p>
                  <p>If this Inquiſition be paſs'd with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
then they proceed to frame
the Articles of Marriage, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
done by the neareſt Freinds or
Relations of the Parties to be contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And when they have finiſhed them,
they are brought to the <hi>Alcaddée</hi> to be
confirm'd under his hand and Seal; for
unleſs the bargain be thus ratified, the
woman in caſe of her husband's death,
or her own divorce, cannot recover the
Portion that was promiſed her, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the price that was to be pay'd for
her by the man; For I ſuppoſe that
few are ignorant of the <hi>Moreſco</hi> Cuſtom
of buying their wives; When the Paper
containing the Bargain has paſſed the
<hi>Alcaddée,</hi> it is carried to the <hi>Alfaquì,</hi> who
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53922:100"/>
having peruſed and declared his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of its Contents, he bids
the Man take home the Woman when he
pleaſeth to be his Wife; and this is all
that is done by the Prieſt in this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Eſtimate.</p>
                  <p>And after this ſhort diſpatch of Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Contract, and Marriage, the Bride-Grooms
next conſultation is with his
own convenience in order to fetch
home his Bride: in which the warm
Clime ſuffers him not to be tedious. But
herein he is obliged to obſerve the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Times; for neither all Weeks
in the Year, nor all Days in the Week,
nor all hours in the Day, are free for
this Solemnity. For the taking home
the Bride is altogether prohibited du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their <hi>Ramadàn,</hi> or Lent: The like,
Prohibition reacheth unto the Tueſdays,
Wedneſdays, and Fridays of every Week,
and on the Canonical or Regular Days,
the Afternoon and Evening are the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomary
Hours. At the time when
Marriage is Celebrated, they uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſignifications of Joy and Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and it is the Cuſtom for the Friends
of the Marryed to contribute ſomething
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53922:101"/>
to grace their Nuptials. Therefore if
the Marryed Pair live both in the ſame
Town, then at their ſet time the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
goes attended with his neareſt
Kindred, who coming to the Lodgings
of the Bride are not ſuffer'd to go in,
but wait at the Door till the <hi>Negra</hi>'s,
which the Husband hath bought or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
for that day, bring the Bride
from her Chamber under a Canopy of
<hi>Alhéicks,</hi> and place her in an <hi>Almaria,</hi>
or cloſe Chair (much reſembling a Tub)
which they cover with Scarfs and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons.
And in this manner ſhe is born
through the Streets by Chriſtians that
are Captives, and for want of theſe by
<hi>Negra</hi>'s, or by a meaner ſort of <hi>Whites.</hi>
When they begin their March from the
Brides Houſe to the Bridegrooms, the
Muſick, Colours, and Drums paſs in the
firſt rank; next to them go ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Women, who have been a long ſpace
Marryed, all cloſely veil'd: immediate
next after the <hi>Almaria,</hi> or Bride-Chair,
march thoſe who carry the Clothes and
Preſents of the Bride, which have been
made her by her Friends, who follow
immediatly after in a regular diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53922:101"/>
When they are come to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms,
the Chair being lighted, the
<hi>Negra</hi>'s take out the Bride, and under
a Canopy of <hi>Alheicks</hi> conduct her to
her Apartment, where ſhe is received
by ſome aged Matrons, who inſtruct her
in the important Offices of a good Wife,
and the rules of that Relation, but they
are wary of betraying any diſcouraging
Severity, and therefore intermit their
Documents by taſting the good Cheer
provided for their Entertainment. While
the Bride is thus careſſing the Matrons,
and receiving their Maternal Councels,
the Bridegroom entertains his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,
Feaſting them with the beſt <hi>Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſone,</hi>
and brisk Wines, if their over
ſcrupulouſneſs debar them not the
chearfulneſs of that Beverage. But the
Bridegroom is not licenſed for that time
to drink freely of any ſtrong Liquor,
for Reaſons not worth the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>In the interim of this Entertainment,
the Batchellors make a kinde of Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Wedded Companion; in
which they obſerve this Method: The
Bridegroom placeth himſelf upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53922:102"/>
low Seat, behind him ſtand two <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro</hi>'s
bending his Head moderatly back;
then come the Batchelors, who cover the
Bridegrooms Fore-head and Brow with
<hi>Metacales</hi> (or ſingle Coins of Gold)
and <hi>Blankéles,</hi> according to their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Ability: and as they lay
them on, the <hi>Negro</hi>'s ſtroke them off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Baſin ſet for that purpoſe in the
Bridegrooms Lap, who all the while
ſhuts his Eyes. The <hi>Negro</hi>'s likewiſe
call every one by name who Offer, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Fulano</hi> (or ſuch an one) lays on ſo
much, God enlarge his Life and Riches.
And this continues till all the Batchelors
have been at the <hi>Corban.</hi> About eight
of the Clock the Company breaks up,
with reſolution to reaſſemble the next
Morn; and when they are gone, the
Bridegroom viſits the Bride, whom he
undreſſes with his own Hands, firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off her Ornaments, then untying
her Drawers, and in every point pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
her for his Bed; none being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to aſſiſt, or to be preſent at this
Office. And this they ſay he doth, in
ſignification that ſhe is wholly and only
at his diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:53922:102"/>
Some <hi>Conocido</hi>'s or intimate Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
of the Bridegroom, ſtay behind
the reſt of the Company to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the firſt Pleaſures of his Marriage.
For about Mid-night he leaves his Bride
to manifeſt unto his ſelect Companions
the evidences of her Virginity, by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Arguments authentick with the
<hi>Moors.</hi> This good News they all cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
with increaſe of Jollity; and now
they venture to warm the Bridegroom
with his own Fires, and endeavour to
return him to his Bride crown'd with
his own Vine. But if ſhe yield not
theſe Teſtimonies of Virginity, it is in
his power to put her to death, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to diſpoſe of her as he pleaſeth.
For they eſteem that the moſt unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſort of Cozenage, which takes a
Mans ſelf and his Money for that which
is impoſſible to be made good. And
thoſe Women are accounted egregiouſly
impudent, who conſcious of their own
Failures dare put themſelves upon this
adventure.</p>
                  <p>But if for this Injury he returns her
to her Friends, ſhe meets with that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
at their hands, which ſhe might
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53922:103"/>
eaſilier have undergone from her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
for all her Cozens think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
diſhonored in the Debauchery of
their Kinſ-woman, which they imagine
cannot be expiated but either by death,
or ſome more durable Purgatory. And
by reaſon of this juſt Severity, the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſco</hi>
Damſels are very cautious of their
Behaviour, and ſcarce in half an Age
hath any one been convict of this Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency;
however, the Man is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
not to omit the Ordeal.</p>
                  <p>When the Bridegroom and Bride have
refreſhed themſelves apart with their
choice Companions, all are diſmiſt till
the next day; when the Feſtival is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed,
and laſts a conſiderable time;
the Wedding Feaſt of the pooreſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
a Week. And for this time the

that profeſs not <hi>Mahumatiſm)</hi>
to be an unexorable uncleanneſs. As
for Polygamy it is looked upon as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſtitute, and when any object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, the Moors vindicate it by the
frequent examples and univerſal cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
thereof, in the Patriarchs and
worthies of the Hebrew world. And
I could meet with none who aſſerted Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of wives upon politick conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as that it was coveinent for the
propagation of the Empire, encreaſe of
people, and enlargement of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
but that it proceeded from God,
was uſed by the Holieſt of his Servants,
and the oeconomy of the Old Law.</p>
                  <p>When the inconvenience of theſe Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
is objected, and that their Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicks
cannot but be much diſorder'd
by reaſon of the inquietudes, and ſtrifes
that will inevitably ariſe among ſo many
female corrivals for one man's affection;
they tell you that this is a diſeaſe whoſe
remedy is of a very eaſy procurement,
by reaſon of that abſolute Dominion,
which the husband hath over his wives,
whom, if they prove diſagreeing, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
to their ſeveral apartments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53922:104"/>
allowing them any further converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among themſelves, then that their
ſociety at meales affords them. And if
this will not cure the unpeaceable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
then Divorce proves an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Receit; of which give me leave to
give this briefe account.</p>
                  <p>When the woman findes herſelf aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by her husband, or any of her fellow-wives,
her only reparation and ſuccour
is to ſeek a divorce. And in this caſe ſhe
has liberty to addreſs her ſelf to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caddee,</hi>
who has the ſole power of diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as well as of tying, the knot of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.
And when the woman has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clard
her condition, and ſpread before
the <hi>Alcaddee</hi> the reaſons upon which ſhe
grounds her deſire of Divorce, the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caddee</hi>
preſently ſends for the husband, &amp;
examines him concerning the verity of
the complaint brought againſt him by his
wife, if he deny it, then the matter is
decided by the voice of the Neighbours,
but if the husband have a willingneſs to
be quit of his wife, then he needs but
confeſs that whereof he is accuſed, and
the <hi>Alcaddee</hi> teares in pieces the Bill of
their marriage which he had Confirm'd,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53922:105"/>
declares the Marriage void, and certifies
the Divorce under his Seal; and from
hence forward they are both at liberty
for new nuptials. From which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is bound to abſtain till it be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that ſhe is not impregnate by her laſt
husband, who is ſtill obliged, to provide
for the iſſue that ſhe ſhall bring into the
world five months after the Divorce.
But if ſhe cannot tarry ſo long, then the
<hi>Alcabla,</hi> or Midwife, has her in Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
who is bound to return a juſt
&amp; true report upon pain of being ſtoned
to death. The Moors call the Divorce
and widdows by the ſame word, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
them the ſame Laws of ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                  <p>The chief cauſes of Divorce on the
womans part or either diſquiet and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
carriage to the Family, eſpecially
when ſhe will not live in amicable ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the Sharers of the ſame Bed: or
when ſhe is unpleaſing to her conjugal
embraces, or when ſhe will not indure
his familiarity with his women ſlaves.
But if ſhe be found guilty of adultery,
the injurie is too great for Divorce to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
and in this Caſe ſhe is ſolely left to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53922:105"/>
the pleaſure of her husband, who has
Abſolute power both to be her Judge
and Executioner. And albeit the Moors
are not ſparing in the revenge of their
kinreds death, yet they applaud the
husband who kils their kinſwomen,
whom he has certainly found treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to his Bed.</p>
                  <p>The occaſions of Divorce on the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
ſide are his refuſal of paying his
wife marital Due; or, ſome other ſort
of unkind deportment. But after all
the wives complaints, the husband is at
liberty to retain or put her away; and
he may at any time divorce his wife in
caſe he will make good the marriage
Contract.</p>
                  <p>It is uſually ſaid, that the wives ſeek
for Divorce when their husbands deal
unnaturally with them; and albeit this
is ſaid to be done with a great deale of
modeſty, the crime being ſignified by
the turning up of a Shooe, yet in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
examples of this kind are very unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,
for the Moors abhorre the villany,
believing that it is not in man's Nature
to be ſo prepoſterous; and that it
was at firſt the malitious invention of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53922:106"/>
ſome vile and impudent Strumpet.</p>
                  <p>The Children which are begot before
Divorce, follow not the woman, but are
left to the husbands charge. And it is
obſervable that the <hi>Moreſco</hi> women ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
prove unfruitful, for in a town of
above twelve hundred married women,
it was reckon'd for a great rarity that
there was one dyed barren. But the
wife, different from the Jewiſh cuſtom,
ſuffers no diſhonour for her Sterility,
and if the husband takes a ſecond wife
who proves alſo childleſs, the husband
beares the imputation. <hi>Mahumed</hi> in the
fourth Chap. of his <hi>Alcoran</hi> adviſeth the
husband whoſe wife is barren, to ſwear
by her belly, and aſſerts it a means to
make her Conceive. A devotion which
as I have been told is ſtill in uſe among
the <hi>Alárbes,</hi> but quite worne out of
faſhion with the other Moors.</p>
                  <p>In the nurſing of Children the mother
abhors that unnatural pride of ſuckling
them with other breſts, while her own
are ſufficient for that affectionate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And to ſhew that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than common kindneſs in
this particular, the Empreſs her ſelf is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53922:106"/>
obliged for the firſt ſeven days to give
her child ſuck.</p>
                  <p>And now before I diſmiſs this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
I cannot but acquaint you with
all the material ceremonies, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
third, and fourth marriages. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
former wife upon the introduction
of another, lives ſeven days deprived of
all manner of ſociety with her husband,
who for that time devotes himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to his laſt Bride; whom on the
ſeventh day after marriage he ſolemnly
brings into the acquaintance and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of his other wives, whoſe brows the
laſt married is bound to kiſs, and tells
them that they are not to be angry that
their Holy Law hath entitled her to a
ſhare in his affection as large as any of
theirs. The husband likwiſe exhorts
them all to reciprocal kindneſſes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
them that without fraud, or any
partiality, he intends to divide himſelf
among them.</p>
                  <p>Now that which ſeemes moſt nearly
to concern the wives, and proves the
greateſt and moſt incentive of their
wrath is their husbands liberty of taking
as many Concubines as he liſts; which for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53922:107"/>
the moſt part are Blacks, the Moors
doting much on that Spaniſh ſaying <hi>la
Negra tiene, turmentina en ella.</hi> But
thoſe that keep Concubine ſlaves, are
not permitted to aſſociate with them in
the night, and if any of them bear, their
Patrons Children, ſhe thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
her liberty, and the Child is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir
with thoſe begot in Wedlock.</p>

Circumciſion, Impoſition
of Names, Sur-names.</head>
                  <p>EVery Religion have had ſtill ſome
Rites appropriated to the admiſſion
of ſuch as undertook its profeſſion; and
by which they were characterized and
diſtinguiſhed. Concerning this the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Mahumatiſm</hi> was much diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not knowing what inaugurating ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
to Ordain. His two aſſeſſors
<hi>Sergius</hi> the Monk, and <hi>Abdalla</hi> the Jew,
divided him with their opinions, while
each pleaded for the character of his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53922:107"/>
forſaken Faith. But the wary Impoſtor
(labouring to keep up the credit of his
pretenſions, in being ſent, to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler
of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to compoſe a Law compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
both) to comply with <hi>Sergius,</hi>
who ſtood ſtifly for Baptiſm, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
daily waſhings to all thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Mahumetans,</hi> &amp; aſcribed thereunto
no leſs efficacy than the cleanſing of the
Soule. And that he might not diſguſt
<hi>Abdalla</hi> the Jew, he made Circumciſion
admiſſive of Proſelytes into his Law. But
did not inſtitute it under any notion of
abſolute Neceſſity, and indiſpenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of all who undertook the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his Religion, but made the want
of it no impediment of future happineſs.
And therefore in the admittance of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado,
or the denyer of his firſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
circumciſion is not exacted of the
Moors, for feare that the undergoing
of ſuch a painful Sacrament ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Proſelyte. But when any deſires
to be of their perſwaſion, they carry the
new <hi>Muſulman</hi> on horſeback, in a kinde of
triumph through the ſtreets, &amp; proclaims
that ſuch an one being turn'd Moor,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53922:108"/>
deſires the aſſiſtance of their Prayers
that he may not Apoſtatiſe.</p>
                  <p>But their male children are initiated by
circumciſion, and becauſe the child may
die before it can be circumciſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the lack of this Write in ſuch a caſe
is concluded to be no hindrance of its
enjoyment of Paradiſe. When the child
is ſeven days old, the Moors give it a
name, and the Father of it makes a feaſt.
But the impoſition of the Name is done
in the publick aſſembly; for the Father
at the evening-Sallah carries to the
Church ſeveral diſhes of Cuſcuſſow, of
which he ſets one apart for the Prieſt,
and the reſt to be eaten up by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And when the Prayers are ended,
the congregation demand of the Father
what he will call his Child, and if the
Name he gives it be not ſatisfactory to
the People, they decide it by lots what
he ſhall be called, for every man here
has a Vote in the Nameing of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
Child. And when they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
the point, all pray that the child
may Live, prove Rich and Valiant, and
underſtand the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> then they eate
up the Cuſcuſſow and depart. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53922:108"/>
that the Prieſt neither at the
Nameing, nor circumciſion of the child
has any apppropriate office, of which I
could finde no other reaſon, unleſs the
Moors eſtimate of theſe Ceremonies,
which they never reckon among the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials
of Religion.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome who have aſſerted,
that there is an inevitable time of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
among all the Mahumetans; But
if they had lived in <hi>Barbary,</hi> they might
have leſſen'd the propoſition, for the
Moors circumciſe their children when
they pleaſe, being by Law not bound up
to any particular day or hour. But
it is generally grown into faſhion, to
circumciſe at the Animadverſary Feaſt
called <hi>Mulud,</hi> kept in December in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Muley Mahumed.</hi> And few or
none defer the circumciſion of their
Males at the firſt <hi>Mulud</hi> after their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
Now there is no perſon ſet apart
for this office, but the child is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
by any that has a gentle and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hand, to whom the parent gives a
bountiful reward.</p>
                  <p>When the Sonnes arrive to a due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
they are diſpoſed of to Vocations,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53922:109"/>
among which the Sword is reckon'd the
moſt honourable, as a Priviledge of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture
belongs to the firſt born.
The reſt betake themſelves to ſuch Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
as beſt agree with their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Fathers fortunes. Many of
the wealthier ſort put their Sonnes to
to be <hi>Talbyes,</hi> that in caſe they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to want, they be in capacity to
be received unto the Prieſthood and be
maintain'd by the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Moors have no ſurnames, which
want they ſupply by adding to the
Child's name, either the name of ſome
remarkable time when it chanced to be
born, as the <hi>Ramadan, Mulud, Aſhora,</hi>
and the like; or the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by prefixing <hi>Ben,</hi> as <hi>Hader Ben Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla:</hi>
being the ſame with <hi>Thomas Fits
Williams, &amp;c.</hi> and the higher they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
the pedegree by reckoning up their
Anceſtors, it is accounted the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.
And in this they follow the
ancient cuſtom, for to add to a man's
proper name, the proper name of
his Father by putting [Son] before
it, was of old in ſtead of that, which we
now call ſurnames: and in ſome parts
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53922:109"/>
this is not yet worn quite out of uſe.
Whether the names now given by the
Moors, are ſignificative of any Virtues
deſired or foretold by thoſe that impoſe
them, to be in the Children, hath not
yet fal'n under my comprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>Curioſity tempting me in purſuance
of this Note, to enquire into their child-births;
I found that therein they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a decency conformable to the beſt
civilized People. For the pregnant
Wife perceiving the approach of her
pangs, call's for the <hi>Alcabla,</hi> or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the ſame with our Midwife, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
her travailes, who never leaves her
till the ſeventh day after her delivery,
for ſo long ſhe keeps her bed, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
forty dayes before ſhe aſſociates
with her husband. Who if he be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
will not embrace his Wife from
the time ſhe appeares impregnate, till
the laſt minute of the forty days after
her delivery be accompliſhed.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Moors</hi> are very careful that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be wanting or diſorderly in
the Rites of Burial, wherein the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Relations ſignifie great Sentiments
of humanity and affection toward the
deceaſed: whom when they underſtand
that they are ſick, they delay not to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,
on purpoſe to admoniſh them of their
Faults, and to exhort them to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the great Pleaſures of Paradiſe.
The Prieſt never omits this good Office
of aſſiſting the ſick; and I have been
told, that there are certain <hi>Azaora</hi>'s or
parcels of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> appointed to be
read on this occaſion to the Infirm, who
if he die not while thoſe <hi>Azaora</hi>'s are
thrice read over, it is an <hi>Omen</hi> of his
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53922:110"/>
Recovery; but if the Agony be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to increaſe in the time of Reading,
they conclude that the Patient will not
eſcape: which when the ſick Man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
and ſees that in all probability
his Diſtemper will terminate in Death,
he begins an exact diſpoſal of his Eſtate,
whereof in the firſt place ſome part is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd
to the Parochial Church where
he lives, and ſome ſmall Legacies to the
<hi>Alfachí</hi> and <hi>Almudén,</hi> and the reſt he
leaves to be divided by the <hi>Alcaddée</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Wives and Children: in which
Diſtribution, a Son hath twice as much
as a Daughter, and the Wives can claim
no more then is ſet down in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of Marriage.</p>
                  <p>In ſignification of their love to the
Dead, the near Kinred of both Sexes
uſe Tokens very expreſſive of Sorrow:
the Men teſtifie their Griefs by putting
on their courſer <hi>Alheícks,</hi> and not wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing that is very white about
them, which at other times is a chief part
of their bravery: for they account white
to be no leſs a token of chearfulneſs
then Innocency, and therefore account
the wearing thereof very improper
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53922:111"/>
for ſuch ſorrowful occaſions. The Men
likewiſe (that are of near Alliance to the
Dead) cut not their Beards, but declare
their penſiveneſs; they ſuffer a great
neglect in all thoſe Accoutrements, in
which at other times they are very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
and by a peculiar Fanſie they
have ſome Hairs hanging over their Eyes
in token of a careleſs Sorrow. But this
is done chiefly for ſuch as come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
ends.</p>
                  <p>The Women are very loud and dolor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in their Lamentations of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and they intermit not to howl
over the Corps while it is in the Houſe,
which is not long, for as foon as the
Breath is expired, the dead Body is
waſht with Sope and warm Water, by
thoſe of the ſame Sex with the departed.
Then the Body is wrapt in white Linnen
and laid in a Coffin (though a Coffin is
but the lot of a few) on the right ſide,
with the Face toward <hi>Mecha,</hi> in which
poſture it is alſo buryed. When the
Corps is carryed out to Burial, the
Prieſt goes next unto it, who coming to
the Grave or Sepulchre, prays that the
Sins of the Defunct may be remitted, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53922:111"/>
that he may have a Portion in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Delights. Returning home from
the Buryal, they have a Feaſt to comfort
thoſe of the Family who are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to dreſs any thing while the Corps
are in the Houſe: and this conſolatory
Feaſt is great or ſmall, according to the
condition of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>They account it a great unhappineſs
for one of their Faith to want a decent
Interment; and therefore if any dye
without an Eſtate ſufficient to diſcharge
his Funeral Expences, they ſupply it by
a Neighborly Contribution. Thoſe that
are more Wealthy and Honorable have
Sepulchres, which vary both in Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
and Faſhion: For ſome are built of
rough Stone, others of courſe Marble,
but the moſt of Brick: Some in form of
a half Moon, others open upon Pillars;
and ſome round and cloſe, and to be
enter'd by a Door. But the Vulgar lye
in common Graves, cover'd with green
Turf and Boughs. At the Feet and
Head of thoſe that are thus Buryed, they
fix large Stones, in which are writ the
Name of the Interr'd, with the Year of
his Age and <hi>Hegira.</hi> As for Epitaphs,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53922:112"/>
they are quite worn out of requeſt, yet
they were in great eſtimation of old, as
may be gather'd from that Collection
which <hi>John Leo</hi> made thereof, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it to a Brother of a King of
<hi>Fez.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon every Friday the Women repair
to the Graves of their deceaſed Friends,
whoſe deaths they bewail with a very
loud and bitter Lamentation, recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great Satisfaction and Pleaſure
which they once enjoy'd in their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And becauſe they believe that on
every Friday the Soul returns to the
Body, they ſpread the Graves with ſweet
Flowers and green Boughs on purpoſe to
refreſh it, and to adorn the Grave. But
there are ſome <hi>Moors</hi> which hold this
Rite for a Myſtery in their Religion,
and therefore pretend not to give any
account of its uſage. They have one
thing in Buryal, obſerved no where elſe,
which is not to bury another in the ſame
Grave where one has been Interr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and therefore they uſe certain
Marks to ſecure them from miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>It has been often told me, That the
<hi>Moreſco</hi> Women in their Weekly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53922:112"/>
of the dead, uſe to ask them
what reaſon they had to dye, ſeeing that
they enjoyed loving Friends, wanting
none of the Comforts of this Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But I found this was an idle Story, and a
<hi>Moor</hi> aſſured me that they had no ſuch
Cuſtom, and that it could be the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of none but a deceitful Jew.</p>
                  <p>Neither is that other Story of more
credit, which makes the <hi>Moors</hi> reſerve a
vacant Place in the Grave, to give the
dead Carcaſs room to riſe up and kneel
before two pretty Angels, who come to
confeſs the <hi>Departed</hi> concerning the
great Points of the Law; namely, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Tythes, giving of Alms, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of <hi>Rámadon:</hi> for upon mature
Enquiry, I was aſſur'd that the <hi>Moors</hi>
had no ſuch Article in their Creed.</p>
                  <p>The places of Burial that belong to
great Towns, are in the Fields: but in
the Country they are generally by the
High-ways, which may be to put Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
in mind of their Mortality. The
Ground which is ſet apart for this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
is uſually the Donative of
ſome devout Perſon, or purchaſed with
Legacies bequeath'd for that purpoſe.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53922:113"/>
And that there might be no fraud pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in this Particular, both <hi>Alfachí</hi>
and <hi>Alcáddee</hi> keep Regiſters of all ſuch
Donations, which are tranſmitted to
Poſterity. When the Ground is once
devoted to this ſervice, the <hi>Moors</hi> call
it <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi> and accounted its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienation
an unpardonable Wickedneſs.
Neither the Chriſtians, nor any of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Religion, are permitted to tread
within theſe Burial Places, unleſs they

                  <p>SOme have imagin'd that for twelve
Years after the promulgation of the
<hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law, the Sectaries thereof
kept the ſame Faſts with the Jews: but
<hi>Mahuméd</hi> being diſpleas'd with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
People, and ſcorning to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
any of their Inſtitutions, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Proſelytes to abandon their Faſts,
and appointed in their room the Moon
<hi>Ramadan,</hi> to be kept in an <hi>Anniverſary
Abstinence.</hi> But others date this Lent
from the ſecond Year of <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
and that it fell out in the Month
<hi>September,</hi> at which time the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is
ſaid to have been ſent from Heaven. But
it is not likely that the Faſt was in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
thereof, becauſe ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
(in the <hi>Mahumedans</hi> Eſtimation) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be kept in mind by a far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Memorial, great Mercies having
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53922:114"/>
never been Celebrated with Penances
and Corporeal Humiliations, but rather
with Feſtival Expreſſions of Joy, and
Actions ſignificative of Exaltation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ramadàn</hi> is moveable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the appearance of the New
Moon, which, if through the Cloudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Weather they cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
they tarry till it may be preſumed
by the courſe of Nature that it is Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
And thoſe who are leſs Learned
in the <hi>Lunar</hi> Mutations, continue the
Faſt for thirty days, being aſſured that
in that Period the Moon muſt fulfil her
courſe.</p>
                  <p>A Winter <hi>Ramadàn</hi> is very welcome
to the <hi>Moors,</hi> becauſe their Labors are
not then ſo preſſive, and better then to
be endured, by reaſon of the coldneſs of
the Seaſon: and the Faſt is not ſo affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
becauſe the Days are ſhort, and
the Nights long to Revel in.</p>
                  <p>Though this be the ſevereſt Precept
in the <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Law, yet it is not
without all capacities of Indulgence, for
therein is had ſpecial Regard to the

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53922:114"/>
That at the end of their Journey, and
upon their recovery from Sickneſs, they

As for the reſt, they are enjoyned no

the Night at liberty for all Fruitions
they can procure, Wine onely excepted,
which by thoſe who at other times libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

                  <p>They place a great Sanctity in this Faſt,
which yet to a Scrupuliſt ſcarce would

                  <p>AT the end of their Lent, <hi>Mahumed</hi>
inſtituted a Feſtival Solemnity, as
hath been imagined in imitation of the
Chriſtians <hi>Ester.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> call it
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53922:115"/>
                     <hi>Bairam;</hi> the <hi>Moors, El Ed Geer,</hi> or the
Little Feaſt: Little, not in reſpect of
its duration, but Expence; for it laſts
three days, which equals it in length
with any of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt day thereof they ſpread
the Floor of their <hi>Giámma</hi>'s with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Leather, and then entertain each
other with Honey, ſweet Butter, and
Wafers. And according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this Feſtival, they Divine,
as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by their <hi>Nileſcope,</hi> the
Bleſſings and Plenty of the deſcending
Year.</p>
                  <p>About two Moneths after, the <hi>Moors</hi>
have another Feſtival, by them called,
<hi>El Ed Gueber,</hi> or the Great Feaſt, in
reſpect of the Expences and Charges
thereof. This Feſtival ſtill commenceth
with a Sermon, which the <hi>Alcalib</hi> or chief
Prieſt makes concerning its Inſtitution,
with amplification of its Praiſes. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home from the Sermon, the
<hi>Moors</hi> fall to killing ſuch Sheep as they
have made choice of for their Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at this Solemnity, and there is not
the meaneſt Fortune, but now has his
Sheep which is killed, by cutting the

Throat thereof, with their Faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Mecha,</hi> and Swearing by <hi>Alquiblá.</hi>
This done, every Family takes the Heart
and Appurtenances, and immediatly
dreſs it with Saffron, red and black Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
then, with ſtore of Bread, they
bring it to their Pariſh Church (where
every Quality knows his ſtation) and eat
it in Communion. Returning from this
Eccleſiaſtick Ordinary, they paſs the
ſecond and third Day in Eating and
Drinking. This is alſo called the Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>The next to this is their <hi>Aſhorah,</hi>
which laſts but one Day, and call'd a
Feaſt of Fruits, nothing being then eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
but Dates, Figs, purched Corn, and
all ſuch natural Cates as their Subſtances
can procure. This Feſtival is not held
in <hi>Giámma</hi>'s, but every Father of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
treats his Houſhold under his own
Roof. And the rich on this day give a
Portion of their Eſtates to the Poor,
who on the Morning of the Feſtival go
from one <hi>Giámma</hi> to another, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Yearly Alms, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably

caſt into this Treaſury who have not a

(which ſomething exceeds our Five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

                  </p>
                  <p>At the receipt of theſe Alms, the Poor
pray that God would increaſe the Givers
ſtore, and enable them to beſtow more
the next <hi>Aſhoráh,</hi> telling them, That
this fulfilling of the Law, is the beſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of rendring their Petitions ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſeràh</hi> is another <hi>Moreſco</hi> Feſtival,

Moors</hi> bears the Name of Saint
<hi>John Baptist</hi>'s, or the Feaſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
On this Feſtival, thoſe who live
within ten Leagues of the Sea come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

cannot, by reaſon of diſtance, repair to
that great Monopoly of Waters, take
Salt and throw it into the Fountains at

they invite one another, ſaying,
<hi>Come, let us go to the</hi> Allamdillah, <hi>or to

this homely Diſh in the Church, they
leave ſtore thereof to be devoured by the
Poor, and ſpend the two following days

Collations. This is their chiefeſt Feaſt,
becauſe at it their Males are Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

to the old <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
But I forbear to ſwell theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
with ſuch Conjectural References,
which if I ſhould enterpriſe, I might
make all <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Inſtitutions yield
ſome probable Reſemblances of thoſe
ancient Cuſtoms &amp; Ordinances in uſage
among Jews and Chriſtians; and ſhew,
that this great Deceiver has confuſed
both the Teſtaments into his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
thereby to have his firſt Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53922:117"/>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Moreſco</hi> Feſtivals ſeem not ſo
much Commemorative of received Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
as relaxatives of Corporeal Labors,
from which they are obſerved to have
no other Divertiſements. For Cards
and Dice are utterly abhorr'd by the
better Families, not only as forbidden
by the Law, under the Infamous terms
of Diabolical Inventions, but as obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be occaſions of many nocive Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
engendring Debates, and Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to Avarice: Beſides, they are look'd

                  <p>But they are naturally uninclin'd to

They uſe Vocal and Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
but in both are very ſerious and
plain, devoid of Levity or Flouriſh.
Their uſual Inſtruments are the <hi>Rabèb</hi>
and <hi>Ahlùd;</hi> the former reſembles our

Cord of Hair; the other a Getar. In

of a Kettle, on which they Tinckle

They act the Tune with their Hands and

Jigs, or high Dancing. Every Town and

Miſcellaneous Notes, occaſionally col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from Diſcourſe and Obſervation,
of whoſe Credit I have not many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to render me dubious. The firſt
Notice concerns the Temperature of the
Air in this Part of <hi>Barbary,</hi> wherein
there is ſome Variation according to the
Site of the Places. At <hi>Fez,</hi> the Air in
Summer is more temperate then at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco.</hi>
The Inhabitants of the latter for
ſeveral Hours cannot endure the Heat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and therefore for that time keep
cloſe within: But the People of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
are by no ſuch Exceſs conſtrain'd
to intermit their Labours. Albeit, as I
have obſerved in other Countrys, much
herein is to be imputed to Humor and
Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>The Inland Country is hotter in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and colder in Winter then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine,
which may eaſily be conceived,
by conſidering what Neighborhood the
one hath with the Sea, the other with
the Mountains, which from <hi>December</hi>
to the latter end of <hi>February</hi> are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Snow; at the Reſolution of
which, ſuch Rivers are cauſed, that
in ſome places the Channels will yield
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53922:120"/>
Water the whole Summer enſuing.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants live long, and are
generally Healthy; the Diſeaſes, when
they happen, are Fluxes, after the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Fruits; and Calentures, when
they immoderately Travel in the Sun.
And what ſeems herein remarkable, the
Winter (which Seaſon conſiſt of great
Rains) is moſt mortal amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> or Foul Diſeaſe
(which the <hi>Moors</hi> call <hi>Bubès)</hi> is incident
to thoſe who accompany with variety of
Women: and though this may ſeem to
confine that Diſtemper to thoſe <hi>Moors,</hi>
who live after a more rude and roving
manner, yet it is no ſtranger to thoſe of
a more refin'd and ſetled Life, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
of late having herein exceeded the
Paiſants.</p>
                  <p>As to the Plague, they obſerve no ſet
time of its return, the tenth and fifteenth
Year of its coming being worn out of
Remarks; and in this laſt Century it
has hapned very ſeldom, but in no parts
it doth rage more furi uſly then in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary:</hi>
and when they are viſited, the
Inhabitants take little or no care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
it, holding it to be inevitable.</p>

                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:53922:120"/>
In cure of Sickneſſes, they uſe very
plain Medicines, and whatever be the
Diſeaſe, Cauterizing is firſt practiſed,
which they do with no more Art or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
then with a Knife red hot to gaſh
and cut the place where the Pain lies. To
cure the Head-ach, they take the Root
<hi>Tauz Argent</hi> and Roſemary, burning
them in an Earthen Pot, over which the
Diſeaſed holds his Head for the Fume;
then binding the ſame in a Cloth about
the Head, preſent eaſe is given. This
<hi>Tauz Argent</hi> is a Root, much Celebrated
for an excellent and laſting Perfume:
there is great ſtore thereof about <hi>Sally,</hi>
which is white within, without duskiſh
and ſtreaked. The <hi>Moors</hi> uſe it in Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Perfuming their Rooms, but the
ſcent is much leſs durable then has been
reported.</p>
                  <p>The People, when ſick, cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Herbs, in whoſe Virtues the
common People have a traditional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
By this they ſupply the want of
Apothecaries and Phyſitians, of which
Profeſſion none are found, except a few
Mountebank ignorant Jews.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> have an Herb called <hi>la Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:53922:121"/>
which mingled with Honey, they
make up into Balls as big as Piſtol Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and of theſe they ſwallow five or ſix
at a time, which they find to procure
Appetite, further Digeſtion, and to
make Frolick, Amorous and Witty. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi>
is much uſed by all ſorts, rather for
Dyet then Phyſick; and a <hi>Moor</hi> will
ſooner buy a Pill of <hi>Opium,</hi> then a Cake
of Bread, if his ſtock be too little to buy
both. And in many places they are ſo
accuſtomed to this Stupefactive, that the
want thereof proves fatal.</p>
                  <p>In former Times the People were ſo
exquiſite in mingling Poyſons, that they
had ſome would kill by ſmell: Of late
they are acquainted only with two
kinds, which they call <hi>Raháſh</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.</hi>
The former is either white or pale,
and more quick in diſpatching the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who takes it. But <hi>Zehim</hi> (ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing that is coutrary to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat

to be very excellent at the Pen, but now
in this, as in all other Learning, they are
much deficient of what they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
for there are not many that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to a higher Proficieney in Letters,
then barely to Write and Read: To
which end they have little Schools,
where the Children are taught after this
manner. The <hi>Moors</hi> having (as I ſaid)
no Printed Books, when their Children
are ſent to School, they take with them
pieces of Boards, or Slats, on which the
School-Maſter writes ſo many Letters of
the Alphabet; and when the Child has
learn'd their Names and Figures, the
Maſter writes them a certain number
more, and ſo proceeds till the Alphabet
be ended: and then goes on to write
ſome Periods of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> (for they
teach no other Book) and continue this
Method till the whole <hi>Alcoran</hi> be wrote
over, which uſually laſts four Years.
When the Child has thus ſpelt it over, he
begins to get it by heart, which coſts

eight Years at the leaſt; then the Child,
if his Father be able, is taught a little
Orthography. When the Child is come
to certain Periods of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> the
Father is obliged to make him a Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory
Preſent: and when he has
learn'd the whole <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he is brought
home to his Fathers Houſe in Proceſſion
on Horſe-back. As he Rides along, he
holds a Table written with <hi>Mahumeds</hi>
Law, whereon he continually fixeth his
Eye, thereby ſignifying, That the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
conferr'd upon him was for the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reading of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and when
the Youth, accompanyed with the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faqùi,</hi>
School-maſter, and School-fellows,

and the Maſter rewarded for
the care ſhewn in the Proficiency of his
Scholar.</p>
