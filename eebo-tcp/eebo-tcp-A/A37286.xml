            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Having had ſad experience, for theſe ſeven yeers and more, of the tyranny which thoſe that bear rule do execute upon their poor brethren in Congregations of profeſſed Saints as not onely <hi>tything of mint, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe, and cummin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neglecting the weighty matters</hi> of <hi>mercy and judgement,</hi> and non-reſpect of perſons: contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they have laid heavie burthens upon others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would not willingly bear; taking all advantage againſt thoſe they affect not, to take them by the throat, and will be paid the uttermoſt farthing though they owe them nothing but love: which on the ſufferers part, hath paſſed by many of their infirmities: yet ſtill they make them offenders for a word, or hearing any they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not, and ſuch-like trifles; ſtraining at gnats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beholding of motes in others, and are ſo far from beholding the beam in their own, that they ſwallow a Camel of the Scribes and Phariſees hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; outwardly appearing to men to be righteous, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are full of all iniquity and filthineſs. And finding Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality to be the root of all other branches in Congregations, I have laboured with my beſt ſtrength to fight againſt it: And in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a people in <hi>Rumney</hi> and <hi>Lidd,</hi> and thereabouts, finding it predominate in many of them in ſeveral particulars, I informed them of it: but they ſlighted and envied me yet the more.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, a poor woman of the Congregation being ſick, deſired me that interceſſion might be made to God for her. Which being done, and publikely known in the Church, I lodging in the houſe, beholding the ſick not viſited by them, and ſometimes in want of both ſpiritual and temporal relief. I diſcharged my duty in encouraging her in the faith of Jeſus, and ſuch-like, as I had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57513:4"/>
and ſhe being deſirous, I prayed with and for her: but they came not at her: had not two or three of the National Church (Samaritane-like) relieved her, ſhe would have had little comfort or company; for none of the brethren came to viſit her: which was the firſt cauſe of my charging them with Partiality, in ſlighting the poor, and honouring and viſiting the rich often, as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, deſpiſing the poor. After reproving them, a worthy Deacon, which can neither read nor preach, ſent her a little por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but came not at her himſelf, becauſe he had ſo many ſheep of his own, that did hinder him from viſiting Chriſt's. And not onely he, but generally they all neglected viſiting of Chriſt in his poor member. But if a rich man's head doth but ake; O what haſte they make to viſit him. And this is the firſt particular I charged them with.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they making me an offender for a word ſpeaking, in calling one fool, and another knave, for belying of me; which charge of theirs I proved falſe: but they queſtioned them not for belying me, but publikely admoniſhed me, and I gave all ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in confeſſing my fault. Although I reproved their evil, yet they partially paſſed by others belying of me. Several weeks after, I informed them again of their neglect, and told them they were partial, becauſe they did not as well reprove them for wronging of me, as openly reprove me for miſ-placing a word in reproving their untruth. Judge me, O my friend, impartially. At which time being not able to clear themſelves from partiality, they were ſilent. Then Satan appeared in an old man, like one of <hi>Suſanna</hi>'s accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Elders, with a lye of inveterate envie, as followeth; which was this, That he ſhould ask the fore-mentioned woman if I were not a comfort to her; and ſhe anſwered, No, but in calling her devil when ſhe was ſick. He affirming this, I abſolutely denyed it to be true, that I called her ſo when ſhe was ſick; but I denyed not but I had called her devil before, in reproving Satan in her often: and ſhe hath and will again bear me record, that it was in love, and not in hatred. He thus accuſing me, I deſired ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſpeedily to enquire of the woman the truth concerning it: and two Members going that way by chance, met with an Elder there, and deſired him to ask the truth of it in their hearing: and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57513:4"/>
they heard her tell him that ſhe never ſaid ſo to him. For all this, the Elder bearing a prejudice againſt me, willingly ſmothering his lye, brought it not to the Congregation. I being acquainted with it by one of thoſe that heard her tell the buſineſs, yet remained ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent many weeks: and knowing it to be their duty to endeavour to finde out the truth of the matter, or his to declare it, and not to let his brother lie under ſin; but he partially willingly neglected the matter, as did the reſt of them: at laſt, being weary of their partial Babyloniſh carriage, I plainly told them they were partial concerning me, in not clearing me, and admoniſhing my accuſers, when eſpecially one of the chief Elders knew of it many weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And when the matter was declared by me, after my charging them, and proving him a lyer, they reproved him for wronging me; but they would not confeſs themſelves in a fault being partial, and ſo far from acknowledging their own, that they took his part that was chiefeſt guilty, he being a rich man outwardly in worldly goods or an Elder &amp; Maior Governor of <hi>Rumney</hi> the yeer before, could not forget to bear rule in the Church the yeer after; nor by any means would they hinder him, but bear him out in excuſing him in his evils: as firſt, when I proved them partially negligent, in not bringing my guilty accuſer to acknowledgement of the wrong he did me, he anſwered, he had not been with the Congregation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weeks before: which I proved falſe to his face, before them all; yet they did not blame him for that neglect, but they, to pleaſe him and their proud fleſh, would deal with me contrary to the Law of God and man; and onely they that I accuſed were my Judges, and many of them would not proceed to caſt me out for charging them with partiality: but the Biſhop whom I charged replied he would lay down his office, and act no more in it with them, and further, that they ſhould caſt me or him out. So, to ſatisfie his minde, ſome have took upon them the whole power into their hands, and would not be ſatisfied, unleſs I would acknowledge my ſelf to be faulty in charging them with Partiality. To whom I replied, I would never be ſorry for ſpeaking the truth, ſeeing I had evidently made it appear to many of the ſaid Congregation: and thoſe whom I chiefly accuſed being judges in their own cauſe, I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech them in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57513:5"/>
admit my trial of charging them to the judgement of ſome other Congregation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that I might not be judged and condemned by thoſe perſons onely which I juſtly accuſed; but beſeeched them that they would be pleaſed to grant me the favour that I might chuſe two or three of ſome other Congregation, and they to chuſe whom they pleaſed, although it were the heads of thoſe I accuſed. But this reaſonable requeſt of mine would not be granted, but they replied they would make uſe of their power themſelves, and deal with me, and not give way to the judgement of others: which power, whence they had it, from heaven or hell, I know not well; but I leave it to the judgement of others. I beſeech you, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an friends, conſider whether ever there were ſuch a thing heard of, that a man muſt be judged and condemned by thoſe whom he juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed. Was it ever heard in the Church of the Saints in the Primitive times? And if this be Canonical Scripture Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, root out the Covenant of Separation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and expound me old Jeſus the ſon of <hi>Sirach</hi>'s Apocrypha, in his 13 Chap. as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>If a rich man fall into an errour, he hath many helpers; he ſpeaketh proud words, and yet men juſtifie him: but if a poor man go wrong, he is puniſhed; yoa, though he ſpeak wiſely, yet'can it have no place. When the rich man ſpeaketh, every man holdeth his tongue: and look what he ſaith, they praiſe it unto the clouds: but if the poor man ſpeak, they ſays what fellow is this? and if he do amiſs, they ſhall deſtroy him. Riches are good unto him that hath no ſin in his conſcience, and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a wicked thing in the mouth of the ungodly.</hi> Seeing by ſad experience toward my ſelf and others, I can diſcover their partial dealings, to parallel or really fulfil theſe Scriptures to be a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie concerning themſelves and many others in theſe times, as well as formerly, therefore I deſire to be excuſed for quoting them, for becauſe when the ſaid Biſhop or Elder whom I chiefly accuſed, declared he would lay down his office in caſe they caſt me not out; they telling him he ſpake raſhly, and that he muſt be humbled for it, but after I informed them of it, and charged them with wilful partiality in the act; they not before reproved him: and there, in the audience of the people, he ſaid he would never be ſorry for his wilful raſh ſpeeches; which thing was ſmothered by them, and he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57513:5"/>
juſtified. Which when I ſaw they walked not uprightly, and they hated reproof from me, and became perſecuting enemies to me for telling of them the truth; ſo perceiveing their intent to root me out, though they could bring nothing for matter of fact againſt my perſon; but their wills their laws to proceed againſt me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void of hopes, after a long time forbearing this unjuſt carriage, and knowing their ſpeedy intentions, I took an occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my conſcience, to ſhew them in an Excerciſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how the poor Saints of Chriſt were crucified as well as others by falſe brethren: But the foreſaid Biſhop, with his Lordly words, would have ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced me, to whom I replyed, My meſſage was the minde and will of God, and I would declare it. Which when he ſaw, he ſtrived to cauſe the people to withdraw, but they ſtood not in ſo much in awe of him: but when he ſaw they followed him not, he ſtood to hear what fell to his lot; but patience from murmuring he had not: But when I had ended, ſome objections he had got; which before the people I anſwered: But when he could ſay no more, he complained of me before them all, for not doffing my hat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told him the reaſon was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my hands were both full, with a Lock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Key, and Pot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore deſired to be excuſed for than Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction being given, the Lord opened the mouth of a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telman, though one of the world, to reprove the folly or madneſs of the Elder or Prophet. The next firſt day following, the Paſtor of the ſaid Congregation was exceeding earneſt, beyond the truth, in rendering me odious unto the people there preſent; and could prove nothing for matter of fact againſt me: but I did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge unto them that I was ſubject to many infirmities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for what they could deſire in matter of ſatisfaction according to the Scripture, I would lay my ſelfe down at their feet: and I did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand often, beſeeching them to name any thing they had againſt me for matter of fact, and I would acknowledge my ſelfe before them all; but they proved nothing but that only which I freely acknowledged, and gave them all ſatisfaction in namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>jeſting,</hi> which is my natural infirmity: but this would not ſatisfie; but the Paſtor would proceed to deal with me for charging them with partiality; but an Elder whoſe tender conſcience being more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeared, would not conſent unto it, nor very few of thoſe that I had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57513:6"/>
charged: but he being reſolved to proceed, as I perceived, I took my leave of him, ſaying, I would obey God in my conſcience, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then man; and ſo I came away. So the week following they appointed to meet privately at the Paſtors houſe, pretending a full Church-meeting, when moſt of the people were gone that day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they appointed; onely ſome halfe a ſcore, or not ſo many, were at this conſultation: and having ſome private advantage, as they ſuppoſed, againſt me, ſent to me to meet them there, but made me not acquainted with it, untill I came to the place where they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to deale with me: which was as followeth; <hi>That I ſhould tell a member in caſe the ſaid Elder ſhould not bring the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned buſineſs to light, concerning my accuſer which he knew had falſely accuſed me, I would kindle a fire among them:</hi> Which words, as they judged carnally, made a mountain, and they would know whether I would be humbled for them: I anſwered, I ſhould never, my intention being real for the glory of God. But they were ſo far from demanding a reaſon of me, that the Paſtor replyed to the reſt of the Soliciters, <hi>We have heard, what need we any further witneſs?</hi> So they put their names to fignifie their mindes one to another; and ſome few of that ſmall company would not conſent unto it, but withdrew: ſo eleven or twelve at the moſt paſſed vote upon me, whereas there was above threeſcore perſons at that time members of that Congregation; yet theſe few took all the power in their own hands; and the Paſtor, to pleaſe them, as ſhall be proved, gave them the next firſt day ſuch an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons drinking, as pleaſed their <hi>Herodias</hi> daughter-like hearts: But I ſhall leave this, and haſten to reply an anſwer to their Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous letters throughout.</p>
            <p>And firſt, they judged me a <hi>ſuperfluous branch, and rotten member;</hi> but wherefore, I know not, except it be for diſcovering their rotten Principles, and corrupt dealing and carriage to their poor brethren that believe not implicitely with them: yet they ſay, Not onely for my evil carriage, and charging them with partiality; yet proveth nothing as to the particular caſe of my charging them; which I ſhall leave to impartial judgments, and not only call hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth to witneſs, and my own conſcience and theirs, but ſeveral witneſſes which are yet members of the Congregation, to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57513:6"/>
juſtifie the truth of my writing, and their partiallity towards me, before the ſentence of non-communion with me: I ſhall paſs by their cenſure of rendering me odious in pride and ambition, though they ought to have bin ſilent, ſeeing I did ſatisfie them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and replyed to their mentioned particulars: as firſt, that I have falſely accuſed the Church; ſecondly, that I apprehended a Brother in a fault through forgetfulneſs, not only through neglect, but through an evil intent: They ſay, I did not minde that Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his forgetfulneſs, but ſay I ſtraitly charged another that he ſhould not minde him of it, and did declare to the ſame Brother that I would ſet a fire among them; the which they ſay hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, by cauſing a diviſion. Thirdly, They ſay, I have often diſturbed the Church on the firſt day, and many dayes, and thereby cauſed much diviſion; ſo that when I begun to diſpute, they could enjoy no more teaching among them that day, and many days, and thereby cauſed much diviſion among them, to the making a rent in the Church; and but a few in the Church, ſave thoſe perſons that ſide with me, are worthy of any better terms from me then Devils, or Calves, or Alexanders. Fourthly, They ſay I juſtifie my ſelfe in a lye: and when two Elders came to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh me, I ſhould ſay they came to intrap me; and by that time they ſhould ſpeak twenty words, I ſhould tell them that they had told a hundred lyes: and alſo they ſay I am both in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and in common diſcourſe, and in reaſoning about the things of God, exceedingly given to jeering and mocking: And this is the whole ſum of their charging me: which things I briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unto.</p>
            <p>As firſt, for my falſe accuſing of the Church, they ſhould have done well to have mentioned wherefore or in what I accuſed the Church, and not to require me to be humbled for I know not what.</p>
            <p>And as for the Second particular, you here diſcover your ſelves plainly, that you are partial, becauſe you judge me before the time, and excuſe him with forgetfulneſs; which is more then you know, and I through an evil intent: alas poor hearts, you are fitter to be Lawyers then impartial Judges in Churches: but I would have you know, that my conſcience is clear in that matter, for not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57513:7"/>
minding him of that you ſay he forgot: it is ſtrange he ſhould forget the weightieſt matters of the Church, and remember very trifles: but being an Elder, he ought to have more care of his charge then fo. A bad excuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome ſay is better then none. And for my tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you knew what you wrote, it lay on their parts that heard him made acquainted with it; on yours to enquire after it, you being not ignorant of the buſineſs, and not for me to be troubled to bring my own cauſe before you: not ſhould I now, if the truth ſuffered not as well as my perſon by you. For my ſtraitly charging another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſpeak falſe; but I told him the Elder did know my accuſer had belyed me: and in caſe he did not bring it to light, I ſhould kindle fire among them: but their carnal hearts diſcerned not what fire I meant: but had there been evil in it, and I had charged him; was not he more to blame to keep it ſo many months, and the laſt day that I was at the meeting not to ſpeak of it, when I demanded ſeveral times before his face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and above for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more, which will juſtifie that I demanded often of them all, he being preſent what they had againſt me? yet not mentioned by him, but privately conſulted together that evening: but had they done juſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhould have dealt with him for hiding it from them, and not to ſend Libells up and down the Country of me. If it be as you ſay it hath appeared; if it be the fire that Chriſt came to ſend, it is that I did indeavour to ſet, to the burning the hay and ſtubble partial works among them.</p>
            <p>And as for the Third particular, my diſturbing of them on the firſt day, it is falſe, except you mean in objecting, when things appear to me to be falſe that you teach: and that you injoyed no more teaching that day and many dayes, it is a very lye; except you were free to diſpute as well as I. But indeed you would faine have people believe as you ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no more, and none to queſtion what you preach, as your Canons you ordered maintain; and this is one; That no Brother ſhould object till your whole days-work were ended, or moſt people gone. If I made a diviſion, or did cauſe a rent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it were better for people to be broken to pieces, then eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon your carnal legal Principles: But how or for what I cauſed a rent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you write not. It is well you grant that ſome of thoſe which ſide not with me are worthy of better terms from me:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57513:7"/>
but there are two lyes in your three terms; for Calves I called Alexander not, nor Alexanders in the plural number; but onely the Smith, one of the inditers or writers of that letter, I called <hi>Alexander</hi> becauſe <hi>he did me much evil:</hi> nor called I any Devils ſo often as my moſt intimate friends; and that never but in love, when they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned fleſhly or carnally from the ſpirit of Satan.</p>
            <p>For the Fourth particular, for my juſtifying my ſelf in a lye and for the Elders admoniſhing me privately for charging them with partiality, which I publickly proved: for their diſorderly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing me in private; I told them it was diſorderly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they came to intrap me: which thing appeared by that odious untruth, that they ſpake but twenty words; they ſpake above halfe an hour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were not ſilent: and ſpake above five hundred words, and at leaſt twenty falſe; and that was all I charged them with: But they hear with their harveſt-ears too ſoon: but when the great harveſt is come, I fear they will be ſound ſome of them to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in ſhew, but proved lyers: in the mean time I leave them to God.</p>
            <p>And for this Laſt, I ſhall acknowledge that ſome times and in ſome caſes, I cannot but with the Saints of old cloſely check them for their carnal reaſon: but for Exerciſing and reaſoning about the things of God, they do me wrong, and are more exceedingly given to judge me and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dote more upon our motes, then behold the beams in their own eyes: although I muſt confeſs I am too guilty of it, yet I ſhall intreat them to bear with me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for this time; and further, I ſhall intreat them to leave ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their names that appoint them not; neither give conſent as they have done in their Letter: as for inſtance the laſt Elder mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never ſubſcribed to it; but on the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> told ſeveral friends they did it contrary to hi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will; and alſo if he could ſee his name in the Letter he would blot it out. Theſe things an I prove by ſeveral witneſſes of the Church to their faces. Now judg, I beſeech you, all that fear God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether this be juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſubſcribe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mens names againſt me throughout the Country that conſent not unto it. Alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the ſecond place they ſubſcribed the Elders name which I proved chiefly guilty: and I ſuppoſe he would not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his folly ſo much, as to ſubſcribe his own name; ſeeing it was to pleaſe his wilful and unjuſt minde, they caſt me out.</p>
