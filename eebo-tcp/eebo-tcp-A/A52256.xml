            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to their livelyhood; and yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to so little perfection in them, that the very rudiments of them, are in a very little time wholly forgotten also; and therefore, methinks, another way of instructing youth, than the Latine Grammar should be thought on, at least for such whose present fortunes and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture imployments, will not in any likelyhood require the knowledge of exotick Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: To this purpose, it hath been my endeavour to effect two things for this Town of <hi>Ross,</hi> namely to procure a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent maintenance for Gods

            <p>The first of these, by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and the assistance of your (no less truly religious than) Honourable Grandfather is now effected to the Glory of God in all future ages; and had

            <head>TO THE READER,</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have but lately under the Title of School pastime presented thee with the Rudiments of Grammar for our own tongue, as the first part of an English Academy; and loe here according to what was promised in that little book thou hast the second also, which is a short treatise of Arithmetick; and for my thus doing two things may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be demanded of me, or objected against me: first, what need there was of any new Treatise of this kind, there being such great
<pb facs="tcp:61622:7"/>
variety thereof already: and secondly, why I place it next to Grammar, since the Liberal Sciences are usually reckoned up in another order?</p>
            <p>To which I answer, that among all those English Treatises of Arithmetick, there is but one that I know of, or do at present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wingates,</hi> in which the Rules of Arithmetick are propounded in any Logical Method; and methinks, it is very convenient, if not necessary, that the Rules in every Science should be Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally handled; and this I confess is so exactly well performed in that I but now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, especially in the second Edition thereof, in the year 1650, that though by reason of the several Phantasies of several men, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be altered, there is but little that can be amended; but the bulk and price is such, that I fear but few parents will be willing to be at the charge of it, especially for such striplings, as I would have instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this science; for I know no reason, why a young Lad, that can but read his Psalter, should not be instructed in the Rudiments of Grammar, and the Art of Arithmetick; and whether this were not a likelier way, to
<pb facs="tcp:61622:7"/>
teach them to spell the words they hear, as well as those they see, and so by consequence, enable them to write truly as well as read di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, than by learning a Latine Grammar, I leave to thy judgment to determine. Were Children in their Infancy acquainted with the Art of numbering, there is nothing in that nature would be difficult to them in their riper years; and that they may be so, I have in this Treatise, at least as I hope, very plainly as well as briefly and orderly set down the most useful rules of this necessary and most excellent Science; and would but our English Schoolmasters put it to the tryal, I doubt not, but that the success would answer all reasonable expectations; for sure there can be no reason given, why children in these should not be as capable of this and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical learning, as in the days of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when all the Schools in <hi>Greece</hi> did teach Cihldren these things in the first place.</p>
            <p>And thus you have at once not only the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for which I have added this to those many Treatises of this kind already published, <hi>viz.</hi> that the memories of Children may not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver burthened with long directions and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:61622:8"/>
discourses, nor the purses of Parents so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver charged, as that the price of the thing should be any bar to their childrens instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but also the reason for which I place this Science next to Grammar, even this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is more suitable to Childrens capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than the other Sciences are, nay will be sooner understood by them, than all the parts of Grammar can: nor should the Art of Geometry be severed from Arithmetick, they are of so near a kin, that they should indeed go hand in hand, and both of them together will make an excellent introduction to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sciences.</p>
            <p>And because that the writing of a good hand is as necessary as the other, and that it is almost as hard a matter to find a Master that is able to teach Youth the Art of fair writing (I mean in the Countrey) as of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick and Geometry, for the profit of Children, and the ease of Schoolmasters, there is another little Book of Arithmetick, called, <hi>The Country Schoolmaster,</hi> which will be speedily published also; in which the Titles of such Rules of Arithmetick as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are first to learn, together with brief directions and examples, are engraved in a
<pb facs="tcp:61622:8"/>
fair useful writing hand, as will with the Masters diligence be sufficient for the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of children as well to write fairly, as to number readily; and because a Child must first learn to write his letters well, before he be put to joyning, there is annexed thereto, a Copy of letters both great and small, sutea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the other copies, of which thou mayest have as many as thou wilt alone; and upon very reasonable terms: And if the Master have but so much Geometry, as to teach his children, to erect a perpendicular, and draw a parallel line, he shall never need to rule a book, or set a Copy, which will be a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ease to him, and no less profit, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his Schollar; for which I pray is best, for the Schollar to rule his own book, or his Master to do it for him? which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the Master to spend his time in writing of copies, or directing the child to write according to the Copy he hath? these two books then I would have Children fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with as soon as they can but read their Psalter, and hold a pen in their hands; the one to inform their judgements in the knowledge of the Rules in Arithmetick, and the other to teach them to write, and to put their
<pb facs="tcp:61622:9"/>
knowledge of Arithmetick in practice; and as they shall profit in these things, so to be set forward in Geometry, and the other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, for which, god willing, it shall not be long before I furnish thee with suitable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuals to that purpose.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61622:12"/>This Table doth consist of two columns, in the first are the two simple numbers to be added, and in the second, the summe or total of those num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as if 5 and 7 were to be added, right against 5 and 7 in the first columne, I find 12 in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond column for the summe of them.</p>
               <p>4. The Addition of composite numbers is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more difficult, and yet it doth depend upon the addition of simple numbers. But that this may be the more commodiously done, the numbers to be added must be so set down, that the unites may stand under the unites, the tens under the tens, and the hundreds under the hundreds, &amp;c. as if the numbers 52364 + 36512 were given to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, you are to place them as in the Margin. <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>5. Having thus placed the numbers draw a line under them, and then adde them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beginning with the unites first, saying 2 + 4 = 6 which I subscribe in the place of unites under the line, and 1 + 6 = 7 which I subscribe in the place of tens, 5 + 3 = 8 which I subscribe in the place of hundreds, and so 6 + 2 = 8 and 3 + 5 = 8 which being subscribed in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective places, the total summe is 88. 876.</p>
               <p>6. But it frequently happens that the several summes of the particular ranks are too great to be expressed with one figure, when this happens write down the first figure of the summe in it's own proper place, and the other figure in the next place above it, and so in the next rank as oft as need shall require, as in the example following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61622:13"/>In which the summe of the figures in the unites place is 25, <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> therefore writing down 5 in the place of unites, and the figure two which may be said to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie 20 or two decades, I set in the next place above it, that is in the place of tens.</p>
               <p>In like manner the summe of the decades is 20, and therefore writing 0 in the rank of tens, the 2 which signifies 20 decades or 200 I set in the place of hundreds, and so the rest in their order; and adding the two last ranks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the total summe is 2. 278. 825.</p>
               <p>7. But this work which for plainness sake is thus set down, may be more briefly performed, if beginning with unites, the last figure of the summe be only set down, and the other kept in mind, and numbered in the next rank, in this manner, because in the rank of unites 8 + 9 = 17, 17 + 6 = 23. <note place="margin">

               <p>The proof of Addition is thus, draw a line un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the first rank of numbers, then adde toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the remaining ranks, as hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Lastly, to that total adde the first rank of numbers: if that be the same with the first total found, the Addition is true, otherwise not.</p>
               <p>As in the last example, the first rank of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is, 472638, and the total of the other four ranks, is, 2794526, to which the first rank being added, the total will be 3267164, as may be before found, therefore the first rank was true.

               <p n="1">1. SUBTRACTION is that, by which one number is taken out of another which is greater or at least equal to the former, that the residue or remainer may be known.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Subtraction of simple numbers is so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, that every one is supposed to know that, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally or by daily practise; but if this also shall in any case be thought necessary, it may be readily performed by the former table, as if 2 were to be Subtracted out of 9, looking in the former table for 2 in the first column, and 9 in the second, the number between them is 7 which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainer sought.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But where one composite number is to be Subtracted from another or a simple number from a composite, the two numbers given must be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one under another, the lesser under the greater, as was directed in Addition, that is, the unites un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the unites, and the tens under the tens, &amp;c.

the whole operation, the remainer of 678945 − 543214 is 135731. As in the Example.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When any of the figures of the number given to be subtracted is greater than the figure, out of which it is to be subtracted, you must borrow one of the next rank towards the left hand, and then the figure of which they are so borrowed must af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be esteemed an unite less, or, which is all one, the figure to be subtracted from it, must be supposed an unite greater, and the one which is borrowed may if you please for memory sake be set between two little lines. <note place="margin">

And then, saying, 1 + 6 = 7 and 8 − 7 = 1 which I set down in the place of tens; and then 5 − 3 = 2 which I set in the place of hundreds, and then 1 out of 0 I cannot but borrowing one from the next rank 10 − 1 = 9 which I set in the place of thousands, and the 1 which I borrowed under the next rank between the lines, and then, saying, 1 + 5 = 6, but 6 from 3 I cannot, therefore bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing 1 as before, it is 10 + 3 = 13, &amp; 13 − 6 = 7; lastly 7 − 1 (which was borrowed) = 6 and so the remainer is 679214 = 730582 − 51368.</p>

               <p n="1">1. MULTIPLICATION, is that by which we multiply two numbers, by one another, that their product may be discovered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Multiplication hath three parts, the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicand, the Multiplicator and the Product.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Multiplicand is the number given to be multiplied. The Multiplicator is the number by which the Multiplicand is multiplied, and the Product is the number produced by the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: So if 7 be given to be multipled by 4, the third number which is produced is 28, for 4 times 7 is 28; and here 7 is the Multiplicand, 4 the Multiplicator, and 28 the Product.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Multiplication is single or compound.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Single Multiplication, is when the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand and Multiplicator do each consist of single figures, and this is either to be performed by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or to be performed by many additions, till use and practise hath made it familiar; but for a help to memory in this particular, the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of simple numbers may be conceived by this Theoreme.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If one of the two numbers given shall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into as many parts as you please, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of both numbers, shall be equal to all the Products made by one of the numbers and all the parts of the other. As for the small numbers, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61622:15"/>
how much 2 times 4, 4 times 5, or 3 times 6, even nature it self doth teach unto children. But if thou be not so ready in the greater notes, thou mayest by this means make it familiar. As if the Product of 7 times 8 were required, divide one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what parts you please, as 7 into 2. 3. 2. if 8 be multiplied by these parts, the summe of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral products will be 56. And so for 8 times 9 divide 9 into 3. 3. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and multiply 8 by these parts, the summe of the products shall be 72: and so of any other. <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The memory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be also helped in the multiplication of simple numbers in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If two numbers be propounded, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are more than 10, if you multiply both their differences from 10, and also deduct ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difference from the other number, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and remainer set in diverse degrees, shall be the product of the given numbers. As in these Examples.</p>

                  </gap>By either of these ways the product of single figures may be attained, but for the greater ease of young beginers, we have also added this table, in which the product of all the single figures is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest; the numbers to be multiplied are set in the first column, and the product in the second, as 7 and 8 being given, right against those numbers is 56 which is the product of them.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. DIVISION is that, by which we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover how often one Number is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in another, and thereby find the Quotient of the greater Number.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Division hath three parts, the Dividend, the Divisor and the Quotient. The Dividend is the Number given to be divided; The Divisor is the Number by which the Dividend is divided; and the Quotient is the Number which the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion doth produce: So if 18 were given to be divided by 3, the Number produced would be 6, for 3 is found 6 times in 18, and here 18 is the Dividend, 3 the Divisor, and 6 the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Division is either single or compound. When the Divisor is a single figure, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend less than 10 the answer may be given by memory; or if the Dividend be the product of two single figures, the answer may be had from the multiplication table if need be; for finding the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor in the first Column and the Dividend in the second, the other figure in the first Column is the Quotient sought; as if 56 were to be divided by 7, in the same line where I find 7 in the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, and 56 in the second, I find 8 also, which is the Quotient.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the Divisor is a single figure, and the Dividend a Number of many places, make a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61622:19"/>
crooked line at each end of the Dividend, that on the left hand serving for the place of the divisor, &amp; that on the right, for the Quotient; then proceed gradually, &amp; ask how often the divisor is contained in the Dividend, and place that which answers the question in the Quotient, then multiply the Divisor by that figure in the Quotient, &amp; substract the product from the dividend, setting down the remainer. For example, let 2916 be given to be divided by 4. placing the numbers as hath been said; I ask how often 4 is conteined in 29, the answere is 7 times I therefore put 7 in the <note place="margin">

Then drawing a stroke between the remainer and the Dividend I draw down the next figure which is 1 also, and so the new Dividend is 11, then I ask how often 4 is conteined in 11, the answer is twice, therefore I put 2 in the Quotient, and 4 multiplied by 2 makes 8 which being deducted from 11 the remainer is 3 which I write under 11 and draw a stroak between them as before, and draw down the next figure which is 6, and so the new divided is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. Then I ask how often 4 is conteined in 36 the answer is 9 times, therefore I place 9 in the Quotient, and 4 multiplied by 9 the product is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

When the Divisor is also a composite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, though the work be somewhat more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, yet is the manner of working the same with the former; &amp; therefore the former example well considered, will make way for that which follows. Let then 6639642 be a Number given to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by 978, and being set down as is before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, distinguish by a point so many of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most places of the Dividend towards the left hand as are either equal to the Divisor, or being greater do yet come nearest to it, which in this Example <note place="margin">

                  </note> must be under 9 for 6639 is the least number in this Dividend, from whence 978 can be subtracted. Now therefore I demand how often 978 is conteined in 6639<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and since to answer this and the like question some trial must be made, write the Divisor in a place by it self, and the product thereof by all the nine figures in this manner.</p>
               <p>First, write down the Divisor it self 978 and draw a line on the right hand thereof, and on the right hand of the line right against the Divisor write 1. then underneath the divisor write the double thereof which is 1956, and right against the said double on the other side of the line under 1. write 2. Then adde the Divisor 978 to 1956 the double thereof and their summe 2934, is the triple of the Divisor, which must be placed under the double, and 3 right against on the other side of the line; then adde the Divisor 978 to 2934 their summe 3912 must be put under the triple, and so proceed till you have nine ranks of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61622:20"/>
shewing the product of your divisor by all the 9 figures, and to prove your work, adde the ninth and last number to the first, so will their summe be ten times the Divisor, if the work be true, thus 978 + 8802=9780.</p>
               <p>A Table exhibiting the several products of your Divisor by all the 9 digits being thus prepared; an answer to the former question may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily found, for in that table you may see that the nearest less to 6639 is 5868 and the figure right against it on the other side the line is 6, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I place 6 in the quotient and the product of 978 by 6, that is 5868 I write under 6639 and subtract the said product from it, so is the <gap reason="math">

               <p>And in this manner may any number of a greater denomination given, be reduced into the least denomination, into which the greater is supposed to be subdivided.</p>
               <p>Reduction ascending is, when a number of a lesser denomination being given, it is required to find how many of a greater denomination are equal in value to that given number of the lesser; as when it is required to find how many pence are conteined 32640 farthings, or how many shillings in 8160 pence, or how many daies in 8760 hours.</p>
               <p>And this kind of Reduction, called Reduction ascending, is performed by Division; for if the number of integers given be divided by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of integers in the next superiour or greater denomination, the quotient shall be the number of integers sought; so 32640 farthings being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by 4, the number of farthings in a penny,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61622:27"/>
the quotient is 8160 the number of pence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in 32640 farthings: In like manner if 8160 pence be divided by 12 <gap reason="math">

                  </gap> the number of pence in a shilling, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will be 680, the number of shillings in 8160 pence; and lastly, if 680 shillings be divided by 20 the number of shillings in a pound, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will be 34, the number of pounds in 680 shillings; the like may be done by any other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of any known denomination given.</p>

               <p>From this Diagram thus explained, the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of pounds, shillings and pence, by pounds, shillings and pence will be plain and easie, for,</p>
               <p>1. Pounds multiplied by pounds produce pounds.</p>
               <p>2. Pounds multiplied by shillings and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct divided by 20, the quotient will be pounds, and the remainer shillings.</p>
               <p>3. Shillings multiplied by shillings the product will be the numerator of a fraction, whose deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator is 400 the square of shillings in a pound, the value of which fraction may be found by multiplying the numerator first by 20, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the product by 400, the quotient shall be shillings, and the remainer the fraction of a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which being multiplied by 12 and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct divided by 400 the quotient shall be pence, and the remainer the fraction of a penny, which being multiplied by 4 and the product divided by 400 the quotient shall be farthings, &amp; the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er shall be the fraction of a farthing. Example, if 19 shillings were given to be multiplied by 19 shillings the product will be 361 for the numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a fraction whose denominator is 400,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61622:34"/>
which fraction being multiplied and divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former directions the value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be 18 shillings 0 pence 2 farthings 4/10. Set the work thus. <gap reason="math">

               <p>Or thus, shillings multiplied by shillings and the product divided by 20, the quotient will be shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the remainer the fraction of a shilling, as the former product 361 being divided by 20 the quotient is 18 shillings, as before, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainer is 1/20 which being reduced is 0 d. 2 f. &amp; 4/10.</p>
               <p>4. Pounds multiplied by pence the product is the numerator of a fraction, whose denominator is 240 the number of pence in a pound; thus 2 pounds being multiplied by 11 pence the product is 22 for the numerator to 240; now then if you multiply 22 by 20 and divide the product by 240, the quotient will be 1200/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Or thus, pounds multiplied by pence and the product divided by 12 the quotient will be shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61622:34"/>
and the remainer pence. Thus re-divided by 12 give 1 shilling 10 pence as before.</p>
               <p>5. Shillings multiplied by pence the product will be the numerator of a fraction, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator is 240 the number of pence in a pound, and this numerator being multiplyed by 12 and the product divided by 240, the quotient will be pence, and the remainer the fraction of a penny, which being multiplied by 4 and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct divided by 240, the quotient will be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and the remainer the fraction of a farthing. Example, 19 shillings being multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by 11 pence the product is 209, which being multiplied by 12 the product is 2508, and this product being divided by 240 the quotient is 10 pence and the remainer 108, which being multiplied by 4 the product is 432 and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct being also divided by 240 the quotient is one farthing and 19<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>/240 or ⅘</p>
               <p>Or thus, shillings multiplied by pence, and the product divided by 20 the quotient will be pence and the remainer the fraction of a penny, thus 209 being divided by 20 the quotient is 10 pence and one farthing and 16/20 or ⅘ as before.</p>
               <p>6. Pence multiplied by pence the product will be the numerator of a fraction whose denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor must be 57600 the number of square pence in a pound; which numerator being multiplied by 20, by 12 and by 4 continually, and the last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct being divided by 57600, the quotient will be farthings, and the remainer the fraction of a farthing. Example, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t 11 pence be given to be multiplied by 11 pence the product is 121, which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61622:35"/>
being multiplied by 20 the product is 2420, and 2420 being multiplied by 12 the product is 29040, and this also being multiplied by 4 the product is 116160, and this last product being divided by 57600 the quotient is 2 farthings 57<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And hence seconds being multiplied by seconds, produce fourths, seconds by minutes, thirds, and seconds by degrees, minutes; only you remember that if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts shall at any time exceed 60, so many sixties as it doth exceed must be transferred to the product of the next greater denomination, as by the operation it doth appear.</p>

Example, let it be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to divide 102 pounds 15 shillings 8 pence, into 7 equal parts or among seven men, you must place the numbers as hath been shewed before, then ask how often 7 in 10, the answer is once, therefore I write 1 in the quotient, and deducting 7 out of 10 the remainer is 3, to which I draw down 2, the next figure in the dividend, and it maketh 32, then I ask how often 7 is contained in 32, the answer is 4, which I set in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, then I multiply 7 by 4, the figure last placed in the quotient, and the product 28 being subtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from 32, the remainder is 4, which being less than 7, I multiply 4 by 20 the number of parts

being divided by seven, the quotient is 13, and the remainer 4, which being multiplied by 12, the number of parts in a shilling, the product is 48 pence, to which I adde the 8 pence in the question, and then the sum is 56, which being divided by 7, the quotient is 8, and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and so the whole quotient is 14l. 15s. and 8d.</p>

When a number of diverse Denominations is given to be divided by a number of diverse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations also, it will be convenient to reduce both the numbers into numbers of the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination given, before you begin your Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and after Division is finished to reduce the quotient into the several denominations in which the number was given.</p>
               <p>For example, let it be required to divide 6l. 2s. 6d. 3/1, by 2l. 9s. 6d. To reduce this Dividend into square pence, the ordinary way of Reduction will not serve, for this Dividend is the quotient of a certain number of square pence, divided by 57600 the number of square pence in a pound sterling, and therefore to make this summe given fit for Division, it must be multiplied by 57600<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to do this it will be proper to begin with the least denomination first, which in this example is a fraction, and a fraction reduced into its least terms, so that the first work will be to find the greater fraction, to which the fraction given is aequivalent, and this is easily done, for 57600 is the denominator; now then, as 5 to 3, so 57600 to 34560 the numerator sought; and this being divided by 4 the number of farthings in a penny, gives me the last remainer, before this 34560, <hi>viz.</hi> 8640: now pence being the next greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, I multiply 57600 by 6, the number of pence in the Dividend, the product is 345600, to which adding 8640, the number before found, the total is 354240 which being divided by 12, the number o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

First set down the <hi>indices</hi> of the several Denominations given, and the Dividend under those <hi>indices,</hi> and the Divisor under the Dividend, then ask how often the greatest Denomination in the Divisor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined

in the greatest Denomination in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend, and put the answer in the quotient, then multiply all the Denominations in the Divisor, by the figure in the quotient, and the product being deducted from the Dividend, set down the remainer, and so proceed to the next, and work in like manner, so shall you at last have the quotient desired.</p>
               <p>Example, let 6 pound 2 shillings 6 pence ⅗ be given to be divided by 2 pounds 9 shillings 6 pence. The numbers being set as here you see, I ask how often 2 is conteined in 6, and the answer is 3 times, but 2 pound 9 shillings cannot be had but twice in 6 pound 2 shillings, therefore I put 2l. in the quotient, and multiply the Divisor 2l. 9s. 6d. by 2. and the product 4l. 19s. being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from 6l. 2s. the remainer is 1l. 3s. 6d and so have I wrought once; then I ask how often 2. is conteined in 1l. 3s. that is in 23s. the answer is 11,

               <p>Then I ask how often 14 in 63, the answer is 4 times, therefore I put 4 in the quotiont, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply 14 by 4, and the product 56 I set under the Dividend 63, and substracting 56 from 63 the remainer is 7, then I divide 14 by 7 the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is 2, and the remainer 0, therefore 7 the last divisor is the common measure sought.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The common measure of any two numbers which do constitute a fraction, being thus found, the said fraction may be reduced into its least terms, by dividing the numerator and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by the common measure, for the quotients will be the numerator &amp; denominator of the fraction, and in the least terms.

but yet even this may be sometimes shortened, for when the numerator and denominator are eaven numbers they may be measured or divided by 2. As if 16 were the numerator, and 64 the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator, draw a line at length between them to separate the numerator from the denominator, and cross the same with a down right stroke near the fraction as here you see in the margin. Then take the half of 16 which <note place="margin">

The like abbreviation will be found, when the numerator and denominator do both end with 5, or one of them ending with 5, and the other with a cypher, for then the fraction may be reduced into its least terms, by dividing both parts of the fraction given, by 5. Thus if it were required to reduce the fraction 125/345 dividing 125 by 5, the quotient will be 5, and dividing 345 by 5, the quotient will be 19, and so the fraction 135/345 is reduced to the fraction 5/19.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Reduction of fractions to the same deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is performed by multiplying the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merator of each fraction into all the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators continually except its own, for so the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral products which arise by such continual mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, shall be the new numerators; and the product found by multiplying all the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators continually, shall be the common denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator to all those new numerators.

THough the Multiplication of Decimals, doth not at all differ from the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of whole numbers, as to the manner of the work, and so I might be as brief in the explanation thereof, as in Addition and Subtraction, yet that the excellent use of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fractions may appear, I shall illustrate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Rule with more examples, than the former</p>
               <p n="2">2. And to distinguish the Integers, from the Decimal parts, when the Multiplication is finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, consider how many decimal parts there are in both numbers given, and cut off so many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, or places from the product towards the right hand the rest towards the left are, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61622:53"/>
and if the whole product have not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, as there are parts in both the numbers given, you must prefix as many Cyphers before the product towards the left hand as there are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wanting, to make it even with the number of the places in the parts of both the numbers given.</p>
               <p>Example, let 2 pound 9 shillings and 6 pence be given to be multiplyed, by 2 pound 9 shill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 6 pence, the Decimal of 9 shillings &amp; 6 pence, is, .475, and therefore the Multiplicand is 2.475 And the Multiplicator also is 2.475 <gap reason="math">

               <p n="1">1. THis is the last Species of essential nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the most difficult, but not much more difficult in decimal fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than in whole numbers; in the Arithmetick work there is no difference between them at all, that difference that is, between them and all the difficulty too, is in discovering the nature of the quotient, as whether it be only a fraction, or a mixt number, or which be integers and which fractions, or if fractions only whether the first place be tenths or hundreds, or of some other denomination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the resolving of this question in all the cases or varieties that can possibly happen, take this general rule.</p>
               <p>The first figure in your quotient will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61622:55"/>
of the same degree or place with that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or Cypher in your Dividend, which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over the place of unites in your Divisor.</p>
               <p>To illustrate this rule, I will adde an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or two; let it be required to divide a mixt number by a mixt number, let the product of the first example in the last Chapter 6.125625 which is a mixt number, be given to be divided by the Multiplicator there given, which is a mixt number also, to wit, 2.475, division being made according to the rules given for the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of whole numbers, the figures in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will be 2475. Now it remaineth to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the integers in this quotient from the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal parts, to perform which I subscribe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor 2.475 underneath the first dividual 6.125 and I find that the figure 2 which stands in the unites place in the Divisor, doth also stand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place of unites in the Dividend, and therefore I conclude according to the rule given, that the first figure in the quotient must also stand in the first place of Integers, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the next place on the right hand must be the beginning of the fraction, and the note of separation must be put between 2 and 4, as here you see. <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>2. Example, let the mixt number 612.5625 be given to be divided by .2475 the quotient will be 2475 as before, but placing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61622:55"/>
under the Dividend, I find that the place of unites in the Divisor which is now supplied by a Cipher, doth stand <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> under the fourth place of Integers in the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, and therefore the first figure in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, is the fourth place of Integers also, and consequently in this example there are no deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal parts in the quotient.</p>
               <p>3. Example, Suppose the Decimal .3675 were given to be divided by this Decimal .025 the quotient will be, 147, and to discover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof I set the Divisor under the Dividend thus <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from whence it appeareth that the unites place in that Divisor, is supposed to stand under the place of tens in the Dividend, and therefore there are two places of Integers in the quotient. And by these few examples, the use of the rule in any case is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hope, sufficiently declared.</p>
               <p>The benefit of Division by Decimals may partly appear by the following propositions.</p>
               <p>1 Proposition, Let 8118 pounds 11 shillings 3 pence be given to be divided amongst 283 men, 11 shillings 3 pence being turned into a Decimal, the Dividend is 8118.5625 which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </gap> quotient is 28.6882 which being reduced is 28 pound 13 shillings 9 pence for each man,</p>
               <p>2. Proposition, In Astronomical fractions let 13 signs 19 degrees 36 minutes 32 seconds 47 thirds and 20 fourths be given, to be divided, by 17 degrees, 37 minutes, 25 seconds, these num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being converted into Decimals stand thus.

               <p>3. Proposition, If the content of a board be 40 feet 11 inches 1 quarter of an inch and 15 sixteenths of a quarter, and the breadth 2 foot 9 inches 39, and let the length of that board be required.</p>
               <p>The Decimal of 11 inches 1 quarter 15/1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by the second example of the last Chapter is .95703125. So that 40.59703125 is the Dividend, and 2.8125 is the Divisor, and the quotient is (14.5625

               <p n="1">1. HItherto we have spoken of single A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick, Comparative followeth; in which numbers are to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they have relation to one another, in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or in quality.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Relation in quantity is of equal or unequal numbers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hence it is called Relation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual or unequal reason, in both which the numbers propounded are always two, the first of which is called the Antecedent, and the other the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Equal reason, is the Relation that equal numbers have to one another, as 5 to 5, 6 to 6, 12 to 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Unequal reason is the relation, that une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual numbers have to one another, and this is either of the greater to the less, or of the less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the greater.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Unequal reason of the greater to the less, is when the greater number is the Antecedent, and the lesser, the Consequent, that is, when the greater number is first set down, and the lesser after it, or when the greater number is set over the less, with a line between them in manner of a vulgar fraction, as of 6 to 3, 5 to 2, where 6 and 5 are Antecedents, 3 and 2 are Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and may be otherwise written thus 6/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61622:58"/>6. Unequal reason of the lesser to the greater, is when the lesser number is the antecedent, and the greater the consequent; as 5 to 6, 2 to 5.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The relation that these several kinds of numbers have to one another in quantity, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in respect of the difference between the antecedent and the consequent, or in respect of the reason that is between them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The difference between the antecedent and the consequent is found by subtracting the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent from the antecedent; thus the difference between equal numbers as of the relation of 5 to 5, 6 to 6, or 12 to 12, is 0. but the difference of the relation of 6 to 3 is 3, of 5 to 2 is 3, for 3, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from 6, the remainer is 3, and 2 deducted from 5 is 3 also, but the difference of the relation of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 is 3 less than nothing, that is the antecedent is less by 3 than the consequent.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The rate or reason between 2 numbers i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> found by dividing the antecedent by the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The rate or reason between two equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is always an unite, for if it be demanded how often 5 is conteined in 5, the answer is 1.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The rate or reason between 2 unequal numbers is greater than unity, if the antecedent be the greater, and less than unity if the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be the lesser number; thus the rate or reason of 8 to 5 is 1⅕ but the rate, or reason of 5 to 8 is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="12">12. Both these kinds of unequal reason are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther simple or compound.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The simple kinds of unequal reason are

               <p n="14">14. Manifold simple reason, is when the greater number doth contain the less a certain number of times, without leaving any remainer, as 4 to 2, 9 to 3, 16 to 4 are numbers which have manifold reason, as double, triple, and fourfold reason, for the greater numbers being divided by the less, the quotients are 2. 3. 4.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Superparticular, is a simple rate or reason in which the greater number doth contein the lesser once and one part more, as 3 to 2, 6 to 5, 8 to 7, in which the antecedent doth contein the consequent once, and one part more of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, as by dividing the antecedents by the consequents, the quotients clearly shew; to wit, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="16">16.

               <p n="1">1. RElation of numbers in Quality, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called Proportion,) is either A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical or Geometrical.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Arithmetical proportion, is a Relation that numbers have unto the equality of their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as in 8. 7. 6. and in 12. 9. 6. 3 there are two proportions which have equal differences; in that first rank of numbers, the equal or common dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is 1, and in the second 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Arithmetical proportion, is either continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or interrupted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Arithmetical proportion continued, is when the same difference is continued from the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61622:60"/>
first numbers to the last, as in this rank of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. 5. 7. 9. 11. the common difference is 2.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Arithmetical proportion interrupted, is when the difference between the first and second is the same with the third and fourth, but not between the second and third, or when the difference is discontinued in any part of the rank, as in these numbers, 10. 8. 4. 2. the difference between 10 and 8 is 2, and the difference between 2 and 4 is 2, but the difference between 4 and 8 is 4.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In Arithmetical progression, two things may be inquired, either the terms that constitute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, or the sum that the terms in a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression made.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sometimes all the terms in an Arithmetical progression at a certain given rate may be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be expressed in their natural order; or the progression being interrupted, some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar term in that progression may be required.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If it be required to express the terms in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rate propounded, add the rate to any given term continually and you have what is required; as if it were required to make a rank of numbers, in Arithmetical proportion, answerable to the rate or difference that is between 1 and 5, add 4 which is the difference between the numbers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto 5, and so continually to their sum and you shall constitute this rank of numbers 1. 5. 9. 13. 17. 21. which is the rank of numbers in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical proportion required.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If some particular term in any progression be required without the rest, deduct, from the term required, the remainer being multiplied by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61622:60"/>
the common difference in that progression, and the product added to the first shall give the term desired: as in this progression 4. 7. 10, let the 12 term from 4 the first term given be required, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting one from 12 the remainer is 11, which being multiplied by 3 the common difference the product is 33, to which adding 4 the first term, the sum is 37 for the 12 term required: and in like manner the 30 term wil be found to be 91: the like may be done for any other.</p>

the sum of the two extreams, so 5. 9. 13 17 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, the sum of 9 and 13 the two mean numbers, is equal to the sum of 5 and 17 the 2 extreams.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Geometrical proportion is a relation that numbers have to the equality of their rate or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: as in 2. 6. 4. 12, where the rate between 2 and 6 is the same with that which is between 4 and 12; for as 6 is three times as much as 2, so 12 is three times as much as 4.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Geometrical proportion is either conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued or interrupted.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Geometrical proportion continued, is when the same rate or reason is still kept in the whole rank of numbers given, as 2. 4. 8. 16. 32, in which the progression is continued by double rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for as 4 is twice 2, so 8 is twice 4, 16 is twice 8, and 32 is twice 16.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In numbers that increase by Geometrical proportion continued, if you multiply the last term by the rate or reason by which the rank of numbers is created, and from the product sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the first, the remainer being divided, by the rate less one shall give you in the quotient, the total sum of all the terms. Example, let the rank of numbers propounded be 3. 9. 27. 81. 243, the rate or reason by which this rank of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is created is 3, by which the last term 243 being multiplied the product is 729, out of which deducting 3 the first term, the remainer is 726, which being divided by the triple less one that is by 2, the quotient gives me 363, for the sum of the terms propounded.</p>

               <p n="18">18.

               <p n="1">1. From the last rule of the preceeding chapter doth arise this precious Jewel in Arithmetick, which for its excellent use is called the Golden Rule, otherwise and more commonly the Rule of Three; because it teacheth from three numbers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, how to find a fourth that is in Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proportion to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Rule of three is either simple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The single Rule of three is, when three numbers are propounded, and a fourth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to them is required.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Rule of three is either direct or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:61622:62"/>5. The rule of three Direct is when the third term hath such proportion unto the fourth, as the first hath to the second.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Rule of three Inverse is, when the first term hath such proportion to the fourth, as the third hath to the second.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The difficulty of this Rule lieth in two things, first in stating the question or placing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers given, and then secondly in discovering, whether the first or third term must be the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The question may be easily stated by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, by which of the three numbers given the question is moved, for that must be always the third term, and that which is of the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination with the third, must be always set first, and the number remaining is to be set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and must be always of the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination with the fourth that is required.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Question being stated, to discover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the first or third number given must be the divisor, consider again whether the fourth term required, must be more or less than the second term given, for if it must be more, the lesser ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream must be the divisor, but if less, the greater extream must be the divisor.</p>
               <p>Example, If 12 men spend 36 pound, how much shall 18 men spend; here the question is concerning the 18 men, this is therefore the third number, and 12 men is the number of the same denomination, and must therefore possess the first place, and the middle number is 36 pounds: so that the numbers in the question must stand thus.

               <p>2. Example, If 25 shillings in Wine will serve 36 men when Wine is at 12 pounds the Tun, how many men will the same sum serve, when Wine is at 18 pounds the Tun; Here the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is concerning the 18 pounds for a Tun of Wine; this is therefore the third number, &amp; 12 pounds the Tun is of the same denomination, and must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore possess the first place, and the middle num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is the 36 men, and so the numbers in the question must stand thus.</p>

               <p>And now to discover whether the first or third of these numbers must be the Divisor, I consider if the higher the price of Wine is, the fewer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will 25 shillings serve, and therefore 18 the greater extream must be the Divisor, and then by the Rule of three inverse it is as 18. 36. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>These two examples well considered will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to shew the nature of this Rule, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working: but because there is such varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of questions to be resolved thereby, in which sometimes one part of single Arithmetick is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, sometimes another, and of Comparative A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick also, by way of preparation for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stating of the question, and more plain and easy solution, it will not be amiss to add an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in each variety, or in so many of them as are of daily practice.</p>
               <p>3. My first instance shall be in such questions, in which the addition of whole numbers is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in order to the better stating and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them by this Rule.</p>
               <p>A Merchant buyes 120 Tun of Wine for 2400l. and the fraight thereof from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>London</hi> cost him 1200l. for loading and unloading 30l. for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom 50l. and for expences in the voyage 64l. and he designs to get 800l. by the bargain. The question is at what rate this wine must be sold per Tun.</p>
               <p>In such examples, the price of the fraight with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61622:64"/>
all the expences and gain must by additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be brought into one sum, which in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is 4544; then I say if 120 Tun cost 4544 pound, what shall 1 Tun cost, and the answer is 37104/120 or 52/60 or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> or 13/15 of a pound.</p>
               <p>4. Sometimes a question belonging to the Rule of three is prepared for solution by subtraction, as in this following. If 24 Gallons of water do in one hours time run from one pipe into a Cistern conteining 250 Gallons, and run out 16 Gallons by another in the same time, in how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours will that Cistern be filled.</p>
               <p>Here one of the terms propounded, must be explained by subtraction, for it is plain that the enquiry is, by how much the Cistern doth fill more than it empties; if therefore you subtract 16 Gallons from 24 the remainer is 8 Gallons, which the Cistern recieves in an hours time; hence the question must be thus stated.</p>
               <p>If a Cistern recieve 8 Gallons in one hours time, in how many hours will it receive 250 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons: facit, 32 ¼.</p>

How many <hi>Spanish</hi> Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets at 14 shillings sterling the piece, ought to be received for 128 <hi>Escus</hi> d'or, at 7 shillings sterling the piece.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61622:65"/>
is 896 shillings, and then the question must be thus stated.</p>
               <p>If 14 shillings be worth 1 Pistolet, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pistolets are 896 worth. Facit 64 Pistolets.</p>
               <p>7. Sometimes a question belonging to this rule must be prepared for solution by multiplication and addition, sometimes by multiplication and subtraction; as in these examples following, the first of which requireth multiplication and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A Butcher sends his man with 216 pound ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to buy Cattel, Oxen at 11 pound apiece, Cows at 2 pound a piece, Colts at one pound 5 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Hogs at 1 pound 15 shillings a peice, and of each a like number, the question is how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of each he might buy for that mony. To resolve this question I must first reduce the pounds sterling into shillings by multiplication, and 216 pound being multiplied by 20 the product is 4320 shillings, and the several prizes of the Cattel must be reduced into shillings also, and thus 11 pounds for an Ox is 220 shillings, the price of a Cow is 40 shillings, the price of a Colt 25 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and the price of a Hog is 35 shillings, the sum of these several prizes is 320 shillings, this done the question may be thus stated.</p>
               <p>If 320 shillings buy 1 of each sort, how many shall 4160 buy, facit 13.</p>
               <p>2. Example, In the which the question is to be prepared by multiplication and subtraction.</p>
               <p>If 128 Gallons of water run into a Cistern in an hours time from one Cock, and 174 Gallons of water run into another Cistern, in an hours time
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61622:65"/>
also, but not begin to run till 4 hours after the first, in what time will the quantity of water run out of both be equal? To resolve this question, one of the terms given must be prepared by Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and another by Subtraction; first there must be computed how much water was run out of the first Cock before the second began, and that is 4 times 128 Gallons that is 512: secondly it must be considered, how many Gallons more doth run out of the last Cock than doth out of the first in an hours time, which by subtracting 128 from 174 I find to be 46, and hence this question is to be thus stated.</p>
               <p>If I gain 46 Gallons in one hour, in how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours shall I gain 512 Gallons. Facit 11.</p>
               <p>8. Sometimes a question belonging to this rule, must be prepared for solution, by Arithmetical or Geometrical proportion, as in these questions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>A man going a journey spends one shilling the first day, 3 the second, 5 the third, 7 the fourth, still encreasing his expences by this proportion till he hath spent 1500 shillings, I demand in how many days that sum is spent.</p>
               <p>To resolve this question the sum of such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical progression for some certain time must be first computed; as suppose for thirty days, which will be found to be 900 shillings; and hence it may be thus concluded.</p>
               <p>If 900 shillings last me 30 days, how long shall 1500 shillings last me. Facit 50.</p>
               <p>Another question may be this, If a piece of Cloth conteining 40 yards did cost me 30 pounds.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61622:66"/>
at what rate must that Cloth be sold to gain 12 pound in the hundred?</p>
               <p>Before this question can be resolved, I must find the price of one Yard, by a proportion Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometrical by way of preparation thus, If 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. WHen the Rule of Three direct hath 1, or an Integer for the first term, it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called a Rule of practice, not only for the speedy, but the practical resolution of such questions: for whereas other questions belonging to this Rule, do for the most part require Multiplication and Division, these in the ordinary way are resolved by Multiplication; and whereas Multiplication is generally much easier than Division, these questions are in an accustomary or practical way, for the most part performed by Division, and yet done with more ease than they can be by Multiplication: nay where Multiplication and Division are both used, the resolution is yet easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than it is or can be by Multiplication only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The questions to be resolved by these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviations of the Rule of Three, or practical ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, do for the most part come under one or other of these five cases. The price of 1 or an Integer doth consist either</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of a certain number of shillings under twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</item>
                  <item>2. Of a certain number of pounds and shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</item>
                  <item>3. Of a certain number of pence under twelve.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:61622:69"/>4. Of a certain number of shillings and pence.</item>
                  <item>5. Of a certain number of pounds, shillings and pence with the parts of a penny.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="3">3. Now for the resolution of such questions which may or do fall under any of these cases; it is necessary that the Aliquot parts of a pound and shilling be first known, that is, how often the shillings of pence, which are the given price of one Integer are conteined in a pound or shilling, without leaving any remainer; thus 4 shillings is an aliquot part of a pound or 20 shillings, because 4 may be taken 5 times in 20, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either excess or defect; and 3 is an aliquot part of a shilling or 12 pence, for 4 times 3 doth make 12; but 7 is not the aliquot part of 20, for two times 7 is less than 20; and 3 times 7 is more. In like manner 5 is not the aliquot part of 12, for 2 times 5 is but 10, and 3 times 5 is 15, the one wants of 12, and the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it; but yet any number of shillings under 20 may be reduced to the aliquot parts of a pound, and any number of pence under 12 may be reduced to the aliquot parts of a shilling.</p>
               <p>Thus 7 shillings is one fift more, 3 twenties of a pound: and 5 pence, is one third more, one twelveth of a shilling, or one fourth, more one sixth. Such aliquot parts of a pound or shilling as are most useful in the resolution of questions of this nature, are here expressed in two Tables; with which I have joyned a third, shewing the product of 12 by any number not exceeding it

self, which in many questions will be found as useful as either of the other.</p>

is the number of shillings required, and the rest of the figures are so many pounds. Example, 567 yards at 2 shillings the Yard will cost 56 pounds 14 shillings; for the double of 7 is 14 which I write down by it self as shillings, then taking the rest of the figures towards the left hand for pounds, the answer is 56l. 14s.</p>

When the given price of 1 or an Integer is an even number of shillings greater than two, multiply the number of Integers whose price is required, by half the number of shillings given; the double of the first figure towards the right hand in the product being set down for the shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings apart, all the other figures towards the left hand shall be the pounds required.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IN the two last Chapters I have shewed the nature of the single Golden Rule, with the ordinary and the practical manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the same: I come now to speak of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Golden Rule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The compounded Golden Rule or rule of Proportion is, when more than three terms are propounded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Under the compounded Golden Rule, is comprehended the double Golden Rule, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Rules of plural Proportion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The double Golden Rule is, when five terms being propounded, a sixt in proportion to them is demanded: the greatest difficulty whereof is in placing of the terms; for which observe, as in the former Rule of Three,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the first and third numbers must be both of one kind.</item>
                  <item>2. That the two first terms in the question do consist of a supposition, and the third of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Example, if 10<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l. gain 6 pound in 12 months, how much will 65 pounds gain in 8 months?</p>
               <p>Here you see the supposition is, If 100l. gain 6; the demand is, how much will 65 pounds gain: &amp; therefore these terms must stand thus, <note place="margin">

                  </note> and the other two terms must be set un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61622:79"/>
the numbers to which they have relation, the 12 months under 100, and the 8 months under 65.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The terms of the question being thus placed, a resolution may be made, either by two single Rules of Three, or by one Rule of Three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the five numbers given.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you make the resolution by two single Rules of Three, you must consider, whether the terms in both Rules be in a direct proportion or not, by observing whether the Demand be more or less, as hath been taught in the single rule of Three; in this example they are both direct, and the proportions are,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As the uppermost term of the first place, is to the middle term; so is the uppermost term of the last place to a fourth number.</item>
                  <item>2. As the lower term of the first place, is to that fourth number, so is the lower term of the last place to the term required.</item>
               </list>
               <p>See in the example before set down; using the lower term of the first place as a common number in the first proportion say, If 100 pounds gain 6 pounds in 12 months, how much will 65 pounds gain, in the same time: which being a direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the fourth term proceeding from the said 3 given numbers 100. 6. 65 is 3. 90.</p>
               <p>Again, to find the term required, using the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost term of the third p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e, as a common number in this proportion, I say, 2. If in 12 months 65 pounds gain 3. 90, how much would 65 pounds gain in 8 months, which being also a direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the fourth proportional proceeding from the said 3 numbers given 12. 3. 90. 8. is 2. 60. So I
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61622:79"/>
conclude that if 100 pounds gain 6 pounds in 12 months, 65 pounds will gain 2. 60 pounds in 8 months, as you may observe by the work. <gap reason="math">

               <p n="7">7. But to resolve this question by one Rule of Three compounded of the five numbers given, they being placed as hath been already directed, you must take the product of the two numbers in the first place for the first term; and the product of the two numbers in the last place for the third term, then working as in the single Rule of Three the answer will be 2. 60. as before, as by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration doth appear.

               </p>
               <p>And then to resolve this question by two single Rules of Three, according to the directions of the fifth Rule of this Chapter, I say: by the Rule of 3 direct,</p>
               <p>If 154 sheets canbe writ by 8 Clerks in 6 days, How many Clerks will write 462 sheets in that time, and the fourth term proceeding from the said 3 numbers given 154. 8. 462 is 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:61622:80"/>2. I say, if 24 Clerks write 462 sheets in 6 days, how many Clerks will write the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of sheets in 12 days? Now here more time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed a lesser number of Clerks will serve to do the work; and therefore by the Rule of Three inverse, the fourth term proceeding from the said 3 numbers given 6 24 12 is 7 12; so I conclude, if 8 Clerks write 154 sheets in 6 days, that 7 Clerks will write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 462 sheets in 12 days, as by the work appeareth.

               <p n="9">9. But to resolve this question by one rule of Three compounded of the five numbers given, they being placed as before, one of the single Rules being inverse, you must multiply the lower numbers in the first and last terms, by the upper numbers cross wise, that is the upper number of the first term, by the lower number of the last, and the uppermost of the last terms by the lower of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61622:81"/>
the first, and write each product under the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er term by which it is produced; and then if the inverse proportion be found in the uppermost line using those products as single terms, proceed to find the term required by the single Rule of Three direct: but in case you find the inverse proportion in the lower line, perform the work by the single Rule of Three inverse. So in this example the terms standing as before, I multiply 154 by 12 and the product 1848 I set under 12: again I mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply 462 by 6, and the product 2772 I set under 6, then because the inverse proportion is in the lower line, I proceed to find the fourth term re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, by the Rule of Three inverse, and find the fourth proportion all, from the 3 given numbers 2772. 8. 1848 to be 12, as by the following work appears.

               <p>But the terms of this question being so ordered as that the uppermost numbers in the first and last places be set in the place of the lower, and the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61622:81"/>
lower in the place of the first, the inverse propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be found in the upper line, and then working by 2 single rules of three, the fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding by an inverted proportion from the said three numbers given 6. 8. 12 will be 4.</p>
               <p>And the fourth term proceeding from the 3 gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven numbers 154. 4. 462 in a direct proportion, will be 12, as by the work appeareth.

               <p>Again the resolution of this question by one rule of three compounded of the five numbers thus placed will be by a direct proportion, because the inverted proportion is in the first line, as by the work appeareth.

               <p n="1">1. THe Rules of plural proportion are those, by which we resolve questions, that are discoverable by more Golden Rules than one, and yet cannot be performed by the double Golden Rule mentioned in the last Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of these Rules there are divers kinds and varieties according to the nature of the question propounded: for here the terms given are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four, sometimes five, sometimes more, and the terms required sometimes more than one.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61622:82"/>3. The particular Rules of plural proportion which I shall here treat of are these, the Rule of Fellowship, the Rule of Company, the Rule of Barter and Exchange, and the Rule of Alligation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Rule of Fellowship is that by which in accounts amongst diverse men (their several stocks together with the whole gain or loss being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded) the gain or loss of each particular man may be discovered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Rule is either single or double.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The single Rule of Fellowship is, when the stocks propounded do all continue in the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for equal times, that is, the one as long as the other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the single Rule of Fellowship, the total of all the stocks must be the first number in the Rule of Three, the whole gain or loss the second; and each particular mans stock the third; and therefore the proportion is this.</p>
               <p>As the whole stock is to the whole gain or loss, so is every particular mans stock to his particular gain or loss: and by this proportion you must work as often as there are particular stocks in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>Example, Three Farmers hired a Shepherd to keep their sheep, for 8 pound 15 shillings <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A committed to his care 357 sheep, B 465 and C 543, I demand how much each man must pay of the 8 lib. 15s.</p>
               <p>Here 357, 465 and 543 are the several stocks propounded, whose total 1365 is the first term: 8 lib. 15s. the shepherds wages is the second,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61622:83"/>
and 357 the first mans stock, is the third term, in the first proprtion, and therefore I say as 1365 to 8 lib. 15 shillings, or to 175s; so is 357 to</p>

D put in 763 l. but the Mariners meeting with a storm at Sea, were constrained to cast overboard as much goods as did amount to 879 l. The Question is, what each man's loss is?

The double Rule of Fellowship is, when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans stock hath a relation to a particular; that is when every particular stock is multiplied by the time, for which it doth continue in Fellowship, and hath no other difference from the single Rule of Fellowship but only this, that the first number is the sum of these several products, and each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular product is the third, the whole gain or loss
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61622:83"/>
is the second in both Rules, and therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to be observed in the solution of such que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions as fall under this Rule is</p>
               <p>As the sum of the products found by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each stock by its own time, is to the whole gain or loss: so is each particular product, to its particular gain or loss.</p>

THe rate and proportion between Coyns Weights and Measures of different kinds being known, either from some good Author, or rather by experience, it will be easie for such as understand the Rule of Three, to convert one Species into another; when the question concerns no more than two or three sorts: but when the comparison is made between more than three, one single Rule of three without some other help will not resolve the question.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now because there is nothing more usual with Merchants and Tradesmen, than to exchange the Coyn of one Country for the Coyn of the like value in another, and in like manner to Barter for commodities of different weights and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, I will here shew how such exchange or Barter is to be computed, and then especially when more is required to resolve the question, than one single Rule of Three only.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The questions of this kind being all resolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either by one single Rule of Three, or by the Rule of Three often repeated; there needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directions, than what hath been already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Rule of Three, to wit, that care be had to make the first and third numbers of one kind, that is, if the first be sterling mony, the third must

be so too; if the first be Flemish, the third must be Flemish. Example, How much Flemish mony must be received for 340 lib. Sterling; every 20 shillings sterling being valued at 34 shillings 7 pence Flemish; here the proportion is.

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. The Rule of Aligation.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALligation is an Art, by which we resolve questions that concern the mixing of divers simples together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Alligation is twofold Medial, and Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Alligation Medial is, when the several quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities and rates of divers simples being, we find out a mean rate for which a mixture made of these simples may be afforded: to effect this, the sum of the quantities being given with the value of all the simples, the proportion is.</p>
               <p>As the sum of the quantities</p>
               <p>Is to the value of all the simples,</p>
               <p>So is any part of the mixture propounded</p>
               <p>To the mean rate that is required.</p>
               <p>Example: let 12 Gallons of Canary at 4 shil. the Gallon, 36 Gallons of Sherry at 3 shillings the Gallon, and 52 Gallons of White-Wine, at 2 shillings 8 pence the Gallon be mixt together; and let the price of one Gallon of that mixture be required. The sum of 12, 36 and 52 Gallons is 100 Gallons: and the value of 12 Gallons of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary at 4 shillings or 48 pence by the Gallon is 576d. the value of 36 Gallons of Sherry at 3 shil. or 36 pence is 1296d. and the value of 52 Gallons of White-Wine at 2 shillings 8 pence the Gallon, or 32 pence is 1664 pence; and all these values ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61622:92"/>
together do make in the whole, 3536d. Now then by the Rule of Three.</p>
               <p>100. 3536 1 35 36/104 that is 35 pence, and 36 hundreds of a penny.</p>
               <p>For proof of the work, compare the total value of the several simples, with the value of the whole mixture; if their sums agree the work is true as in this example.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Alligation Alternate is, when several rates of divers simples being given, such a mixture is required, as may be sold at a certain mean rate propounded.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Alligation Alternate is either partial or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Alternation partial is, when the several rates of divers simples, with the quantity of one of them is given, and the several quantities of the rest are required, in such sort that a mixture being made

               <p n="8">8.

               <p n="9">9. In both these kinds of alternation, there is some preparation to be made, before the Rules by which such questions may be resolved can be well delivered.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The preparation to be made doth partly consist in placing the given rates of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and taking the differences between those rates, and the mean price you would have them bear.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The given rates of the things propounded must be placed one under another so as that they may orderly increase or decrease, and the mean price that you would have them bear, may stand on the right hand of the rank about the middle: For example, let the given rates be 12. 24. 36. 48. and the mean price 28d. which being placed one under another descending I <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="math">

                     </gap>
                  </note> draw a line of connexion, and on the left hand thereof I set 28 by the mean price by it self, as here you see. The terms being thus ranked in their due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, link them together by certain arches, in such sort, as that one that is greater than the mean price, may be still coupled with another that is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61622:93"/>
less, so in the premised example 12 may be linked with 36 or 48, and 24 may be linked with 48 or 36, and the work will stand thus. <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>The terms being thus ranked and linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, proceed to find the differences, between the given rates and the mean price, and write that difference just against his respective yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: thus the difference between 12 and 28 being 16, I place 16 against 48 its respective yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and the difference between 24 and 28 being 4, I place 4 against 36: the difference between 28 and 36 being 8, I place 8 against 24: lastly 20 being the difference between 28 and 48, I place 20 against 12, and the work will stand according to the first way of linking the rates propounded, as here you see them.</p>
               <p>But the branches being linked after the other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the differences must be otherwise placed; for here 24 hath 48 for his Yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and 12 hath 36 for his. <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:61622:93"/>12. And many times it so falls out, that one of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven rates, may be linked with two or more of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rates given, in which case the differences ought to be as often set down, as it is or may be diversly linked: thus in the premised rates given, if you change the mean price to 16, the rates must be linked and the differences set as here you see them: or being 40 thus. <note place="margin">

               <p n="13">13. The given rates being thus ranked and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and their differences taken, all questions in Alternation partial may be resolved by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
               <p>As the difference against the first rate</p>
               <p>Is to the several differences that are under it,</p>

<pb n="071" facs="tcp:61622:94"/>
is, how much Rye, how much Barly, and how much Oats ought to be added to the 10 bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels of Wheat. It is evident by the differences before taken, that for every 16 bushels of Wheat, I ought to take 4 bushels of Rye, 8 bushels of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and 20 bushels of Oats, and therefore I say</p>

Here you may suppose any sum at pleasure, and fit the proportions to it according to the state of the question: by this sum so stated, a means will be afforded to answer the question propounded, though the supposition doth not do it. Say then that the first man had 3 pound, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man must then have 9 pound, and the third 36 pound, and these three sums in the total are but 48 pound, and yet by this false supposition, we may by the Rule of Three find out the true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the question propounded.</p>

               <p>Secondly I suppose the whole sum to be 64 pound the half whereof is 32, and the half of that is 16 and the fourth 8, and the remainer also 8, and therefore the second error is also in the defect, and
