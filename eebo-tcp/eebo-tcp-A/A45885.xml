            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <head>LUKE 24. 47.
That Repentance and Remission of Sins
should be preached in his Name
among all Nations.</head>
                     <p>WHen man came out of his
Creators hands, he was
happy, and so long as
he kept the state of his Nature he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48223:2"/>
continued such; for he enjoyed
his Makers favour, he walked
with God, had a friendly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with him; and as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
made a thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of his dependance upon
his Goodness, and perform'd due
Obedience to his Will, so he was
always under the care of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and the Influences of his
Grace, which was so great a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
that his condition might
well be signified by the name of
the place in which he dwelt, <hi>The
Paradise of Eden,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Garden
of Delight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But see the frailty of created
Beings when they are a little tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with themselves. Man soon
fell from his happiness. He was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48223:2"/>
not content with his Makers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance;
he would provide bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for himself some other way.
But so disregarding his Creators
Laws, he threw himself out of the
Divine favour, and with himself,
his Posterity, treading in the same
steps of Disobedience, though
they knew how dear it cost their
Forefather, by the miserable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
which he left them: The
unhappiness of the Estate so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
being so heavy, that men
when they considered it, would
rather never have been born, than
thrown under the weight of it:
The merciful Son of God, with
an unspeakable compassion, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
himself between them and
the dreaded Ruin, and interceded
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48223:3"/>
for their pardon. The eternal
Father was highly pleased with his
Mediation; and as for his sake
he did not lock the door of Hope
against the first Runagate, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he afterward shut up his
disobedient Children in the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
misery of their Sin. For
though they have cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of the Mercies of
the ancient Covenant, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Conditions of it, yet the
Son of God was pleased to be the
Angel of a new Covenant, and
brought it from Heaven, and sent
his Celestial Messengers at his
Birth to proclaim the Good-will
which was contained in it, and
seal'd it with his Blood, which
when he was going to die, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48223:3"/>
said he would <hi>shed for the remission
of Sins:</hi> And having performed
that Promise full of unspeakable
kindness, when he was raised
from the dead, he commanded
his Servants, whom he had made
intimate with the design of his
Mercy, that they should publish
it to all the World, and in his
Name preach Repentance, and
upon that promise forgiveness of
sin, and declare that God would
now accept of Return to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
instead of Obedience which had
never fail'd; and that all
such of sinful Mankind as would
run away from their disobedient
Party, acknowledge their Fault,
lament their Rebellion, throw
down their Arms, yield to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48223:4"/>
and return to their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
should come to be as they
were at first by Gods allowance,
be put into the way of Happiness
again: For by the forgiveness of
their sins God restores them to
his Favour, a Grace denied to
a higher sort of Creatures than
we are, Angels, when by sin they
flung themselves out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>I have designed this Discourse
to treat of the way which God
hath been pleased to accept, and
our Saviour to declare, for our
escaping the misery of sin, which
is Repentance. And of this I
shall speak as I find it described
in the New Testament, where
two words are chiefly used to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

the nature of it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>1. A change of mind as to

he said respecting the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48223:5"/>
How can he repent of what
he hath done, who doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it as wicked? This part of
Repentance expresseth it self in
two things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Humble Confession of Sin.</item>
                        <item>2. Earnest Prayer for Pardon.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. Humble confession of sin,
which is both required in many
places of Scripture, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have been the practise of
Penitents. <hi>He which confesseth and
forsaketh finds mercy—If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our sins he is faithful—It is
meet to be said unto God</hi> I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned—
He can never hope for
pardon who will not confess his
sin. As Confession belongs to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48223:5"/>
Repentance, so if it be right, it
must have these two things joyned
with it.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Sorrow,
and</item>
                        <item>2. Shame.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. We must make our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
having in our souls a
great sorrow for having offended
God, a great displeasure against
our selves for our disobedience.
When the Apostle perceived the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> to have fallen into a
great sin, he wrote a sharp Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to them, and the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that, and what they had
done, wrought in them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Repentance,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>a godly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48223:6"/>
sorrow,</hi> or sorrow according to
God, which he doth require, and
will accept if it be sincere, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of the sin
committed. It is fit that he who
hath sinned should be grieved,
when he considers what he hath
done, and say as he did, <hi>Eheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quàm
ego totus displiceo mihi! Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentia
denot at paenam animi de re
perper am gestâ sibi displicentis.</hi> St.
<hi>Peters</hi> Penitents were said to be
pricked in their Hearts;<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> and the
Scripture calls true Repentance <hi>a
broken heart, a contrite spirit.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> And
true Penitents usually expressed
their sorrow in tears, with which
<hi>David</hi> is said <hi>to water his Couch—</hi>
and St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 6. 6.</note> upon consideration
of his grand sin is said to have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48223:6"/>
gone, forth of the Company, and
to have <hi>wept bitterly.</hi> He which
truly considers what it is to have
sinned, would if he could, wash
away the stain with tears of blood.
When the weight of the sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
began to sit close and heavy
upon our Saviours shoulders, it
put him into such an Agony, that
it made clammy drops of thick
sweat, like viscous blood, trickle
from his Body to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Penitents of old, to
express their due grief, used to
gird themselves with Sackcloth,
and fit in Ashes: For anciently
in great mournings it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
to put on Sackcloth, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their heads with Ashes, and
sit in the Dust. As we see in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48223:7"/>
Story of the King of <hi>Niniveh</hi> in
that great affliction of soul which
surprised him upon <hi>Ionas</hi>'s denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of wrath against him and
his people; and in the case of
<hi>Thamar,</hi> in the astonishing grief
which seized her upon the loss of
her Honour: So <hi>Iob</hi> when he
humbled himself for speaking too
boldly of the mystery of Gods
Providence, is said to have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
in Sackcloth and Ashes.</hi> To
this also they joyned Fasting, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that by reason of
their sins they were not worthy to
eat, and so not to live; and when
they did so, were said to <hi>afflict
their souls:</hi> For true Penitents
have, as the Apostle observed in
the <hi>Corinthians, Indignation</hi> against
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48223:7"/>
their sins, and <hi>Revenge</hi> upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for committing them. To
these also in their Penance they
added <hi>Expiatory Offerings,</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
when they kill'd the Sacrifice,
they themselves deserved to die
more than the <hi>Lamb</hi> or <hi>Goat</hi>
did; <hi>Quae me non dignior hostia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ
est?</hi> There is nothing so bad
but it deserves to live rather than
I the sinner who offer it. They
saw the vileness and danger of sin,
and therefore cried out, <hi>Men and
Brethren, what shall we do to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
Or as they in <hi>Micah, O
that I had any <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, any
thing to give in exchange for my soul
to my offended God, thousands of
Rams, or ten thousand Rivers of
Oyl!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48223:8"/>By these Expressions we may
perceive what a deep sense they
had of the baseness of sin, and
how truly they were grieved that
by it they had offended God. To
this I need add no more but the
practise of the Primitive Church,
to show what a mighty sorrow
the Penitents of those days
thought necessary to their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
It is enough to amaze
careless Souls to read it as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tertul. de Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, &amp; de Paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> and St.
<hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Greg. Naz. de Poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> Penitents lay
prostrate at the Church doors in
Sackcloth, and Ashes, and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
intreating the whole Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
begging the prayers of Presbyters and Widows, taking
hold of the Garments and Knees
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48223:8"/>
of such as entred into the Church,
kissing their footsteps, as well as
the Chains of Martyrs in Prisons,
with bare knees and wet eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
their Prayers for their
pardon.</p>
                     <p>And though the bad sinners of
our times possibly think them
foolish in so great expressions of
sorrow, yet I doubt, when things
come to be determined before the
Great Tribunal of Christ, that they
will be judged sottish for their
vain Censure, and that want of
great grief for their sins will not
then be esteemed courage, but
searedness of Conscience. He is
most miserable who sins and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
not; and his sorrow will do
him little good, which doth not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48223:9"/>
wound sin to the heart, which
doth not smite through, and cut
in pieces the roots of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which are deep planted in
a hard heart.</p>
                     <p>2. We are also to joyn shame
with our sorrow: Shame is the
proper attendant of sin, as we
may see in our first Parents, who
were so ashamed of themselves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had sinned, that they
sought, as well as they could, to
hide themselves from the Face of
God; not only for fear of being
punished by him, but being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of themselves, that for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unworthily they had deserved
it. There is great reason we should
entertain this passion of soul. The
penitent sinner will find things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48223:9"/>
to be ashamed of, if he
consider. What are they? Five.</p>
                     <p>1. His Impudence, that he
durst sin against God; therefore
<hi>Ezra</hi> in his penitent Confession of
the great sins which he then lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
says,<note place="margin">Ezr. 9. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>O my God, I am ashamed
to look up, and blush to lift up my
face to thee; for our iniquities are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
and our sins are grown up to
Heaven.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>We are in our trespasses,
and cannot stand before thee, because
of them.</hi> He was so ashamed, that
he says,<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>And now, O our God, what
shall we say, for we have forsaken thy
Commandments?</hi> So the Penitent in
<hi>Ieremiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>When I repented I was
ashamed</hi>—And the Converts whom
St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, were ashamed
to think of their former practise;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48223:10"/>
                        <hi>What fruit had you in those things
whereof you are now ashamed?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 21.</note> There
is great Reason for this. For men
are ashamed when they do any
thing that is unbecoming them.
It is a base thing for a man to do
that which is unworthy of what he
is, or professeth himself to be. Sin
is the most unbecoming thing
in the World, contrary to our
Nature, unworthy of a reasonable
Creature, absurd in regard of our
state in Being; doth debase and
degrade the person that commits
it. Therefore when <hi>Aaron</hi> had
consented to Idolatry with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it is said, <hi>They made him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to his shame.</hi> What a High
Priest and worship a Calf? A
Creature and disobedient to him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48223:10"/>
that made it! It is said of the
Jews, when converted, that they
<hi>should loath themselves for all their
abominations.</hi> Nothing can make
us so vile as sinning against God.
He which consents to sin, disrobes
himself of the dignity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Innocence. And when men
come to that impudence, that they
are not ashamed of sin, it is noted
in Scripture as the height of all
Villany, and is a state near to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Ruin. Men may grow so base
as to <hi>glory in their shame; i. e.</hi> in
such things of which they ought to
be ashamed, as the Apostle tells
us, and make no matter of it. So
the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> of those in
his time,<note place="margin">Ier. 6 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Were they ashamed when
they had committed abomination;</hi> no,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48223:11"/>
                        <hi>they were not ashamed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>neither could
they blush.</hi> No; but as in another
place, they had a <hi>Whores forehead,</hi>
made <hi>their faces harder than a Rock.</hi>
But their ruin followed at their
heels, and overtook them all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
some few, who repenting,
shar'd another temper, and said,
<hi>We lie down in shame,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">—3 25.</note> 
                        <hi>and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
covereth us; for we have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against the Lord our God, and
have disobeyed his voice.</hi> So the
repenting Prodigal, <hi>O Father, I
have sinned against Heaven and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Thee, and am no more worthy
to be called thy Son.</hi> He had done
things unworthy of a Son, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ashamed of himself, would be
glad to creep out of that base self
the Son, so he might be become a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48223:11"/>
good Servant. He was ashamed to
think he had been a Son, because
he had carried himself so vilely
in that state.</p>
                     <p>2. Shame is due to the folly
which those who sin are guilty of.
He which sins reveals his folly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
in this, that either he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
not his Interest, or slights
those things which are of greatest
import to him; and therefore
Fool is the proper name of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in Holy Language. For what
good reason that Title is bestowed
upon him, you may see in these
four particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. He which sins thinks to be
happy in a better way than that
which God hath directed him to,
and is so silly as not to understand
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48223:12"/>
the meanness of these things for
which he forsakes his God, and the
sad Consequences of his Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
How great is the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
which is between the pure
joy which flows into the soul from
the sense of Gods favour, and the
muddy pleasure which in any
Channel whatsoever can be deriv'd
from sin? It is but little, and very
impure, mixed with dreadful Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays.
This is so great a stupidity,
that the Prophet brings in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
as wondring at it.<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 12, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
O ye Heavens at this, and be
ye horribly afraid, saith the Lord, for
my people have committed two evils;
they have forsaken me the Fountain of
Living Waters, and hewed them out
Cisterns, broken Cisterns, which can
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48223:12"/>
hold no water.</hi> 'Tis true it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
principally to their forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the living God, to serve dead
Idols;<note place="margin">v. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Hath a Nation changed their
Gods, which yet are no Gods? but
my people have changed their glory for
that which doth not profit.</hi> It was a
strange Impudence in those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Jews of whom this Prophet
speaks, who when they were in a
bad Condition, made such by their
sins, would mend it by their sins.<note place="margin">Ier. 44.</note>
They were in captivity because of
their wickedness, and in particular
for Idolatry, and were told so by
the Prophet; See what use they made
of it,<note place="margin">v. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>We will burn Incense to the
Queen of Heaven, and pour out drink-offerings
to her, as did our Fathers,
who were then well, and had plenty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48223:13"/>
of all things</hi>—Lyars! They
were now in Famine for that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
and yet said, we will
do what hath come into our
minds; when as all the Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which they enjoyed before, was
from observing Gods Commands;
and they bereav'd themselves of it
now by forsaking God,<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 17, 19.</note> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
told them before, that they
procured this to themselves, in
that they forsook the Lord their
God: And that their own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
should correct them, and
make them know that it was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
thing and bitter that they had
forsaken God, and that the fear of
displeasing him was not in them;
and that it should enter into their
heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> to gnaw it, when
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48223:13"/>
they considered what they had
done. What less folly are they
guilty of, who forsake the peace
of Conscience and hope of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
and pleasures of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Favour, for the embraces of
an Harlot, voluptuous Riots, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Gain, or for all that Good that
any, or all sorts of sin can bring
in exchange? When they come to
themselves, as it was said of the
Prodigal (for a sinner is out of
his wits) they say to themselves
as the Apostle did to the <hi>Romans,
What profit have we of those things
which now only produce shame in our
souls?</hi> Or as that great Souldier
when he saw the folly of his base
Condescension, in the sad Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48223:14"/>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; So the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
I have left the bread, and all
good entertainments of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, to feed upon Husks
with Swine. I have of a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
made my self a slave to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
When <hi>David,</hi> not weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things in the Balance of the
Sanctuary, <hi>i. e.</hi> esteeming them
as God doth, according to the true
worth, did undervalue the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of good men, because they
wanted that prosperity which he
saw some wicked men enjoy; when
he came to consider better, how
did he condemn the folly of his
former thoughts in these words,<note place="margin">Ps. 73. 22.</note>
—<hi>So foolish was I and ignorant, I
was as a Beast before thee. But as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48223:14"/>
I have none in Heaven but thee, so
in Earth there is nothing that I can
desire in comparison of thee.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 63. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is better than life,</hi> or any thing
in it. This was the folly of the
first sinners, they would mend the
estate God had put them in, by
following their own counsels, and
so for the slight and short pleasure
which they had in eating forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruit, lost the joy of Divine
Favour, and the peace of their
own Consciences, and flung them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into shame and fear.</p>
                     <p>Art not thou ashamed whoever
thou art which consents to sin, to
throw thy self out of the joy of thy
soul, a serene tranquillity of mind,
into melancholy and grief, when
thou seest how by sin thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48223:15"/>
thy self, lost thy honour,
and devested thy self of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Pleasure of Vertue for
some mean satisfaction of bodily
Appetite, and indulging some vile
Affection?</p>
                     <p>2. The folly of Sin appears
more; he which disobeys God
will transgress his Laws, and go
beyond the bounds which God
hath set, though they lay no curb
upon Appetite, nor stop the course
of Action be to preserve us from
that mischief, into which we shall
fall if we go farther than they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
A madman will on, though
you stop him only upon the top of
a Precipice. Is not the pleasure of
single Life enough with Chastity
and Divine Love? or if Nature
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48223:15"/>
requires another state; are not the
modest allowances of Marriage
enough, without the unclean plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of forbidden Beds? Is
not the satisfaction of eating and
drinking to a temperate chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
much better than to be
drown'd in excess of Wine, and
choked with Gluttony and Surfets?
Is not a competency of worldly
Means sutable to the necessities of
our Condition, and number of our
Relatives thankfully enjoy'd, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the tormenting content of
a ravenous Temper, which makes
the man haunted with it, always
to endeavour to add House to
House, Land to Land, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his Heap with unjust Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as well as greedy Desires?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48223:16"/>
When the Fool, which makes a
mock of sin, comes to himself, and
is made to see what he hath done,
his countenance will fall, as it was
said of <hi>Cain,</hi> and he will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to have parted with the
sprightly, erect temper of his
Soul, which with Innocence he
had in the favour of God,
when by sin he finds himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
grieved, undone. <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
broke the Law of his God,
which as a Nazarite he had upon
him, and suffered a Harlot to cut
off his Hair, but when he went
out to shake himself, as he said,
and found the Spirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from him, what horrour
with shame, with despondence of
Soul, seiz'd upon him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48223:16"/>3. The folly of a sinner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
also in this, that he is not
sensible of the great danger which
his sin leads him into; no, though
he hath been often told of it. See
this point of Folly in a few Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                     <p>1. He minds not that an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
once done cannot be recalled,
and that therefore sin once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
cannot be undone, <hi>Non est nunquam
omnino fecisse, facere cess asse,</hi>
He which sins makes himself guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>2. He acts as supposing that
he may be happy without the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Favour, or may disobey and
not lose it; as if God could stand
Neuter among men in the World,
and did not impartially weigh the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48223:17"/>
actions of men, and were not <hi>of
purer eyes than to behold Iniquity.</hi>
But the Fool sins on, neither mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the threatnings which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Laws which he breaks,
nor considering that he who made
those threatnings is Almighty, and
so can both put them in execution,
and appoint such punishments as
we can neither imagine nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
                     <p>3. The sottishness of the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
appears more plainly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God hath declared that he
hath <hi>appointed a day wherein he will
judge the World in Righteousness.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 17. 31</note> Is
thy heart set to do evil, <hi>because
sentence against an evil work is not
executed speedily?</hi> Shall a Malefactor
think himself well, because he is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48223:17"/>
not hanged as soon as condemned,
when the Judge hath set a day for
his Execution? Alas! what small
security is in that short respite?
Dost thou not know that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God leads thee to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and yet wilt sin, and so
treasure up wrath to thy self, by
hardness of heart, against the day
of the Revelation of Gods just
Judgment? The Fool puts the
Evil day far from him, which how
near it is, God only knows.</p>
                     <p>4. This is also one addition to
this folly, that he will sin when
he hath been told not only that
there is a set Day of Judgment,
and consequently of Punishment,
though delayed a while; but also
that a sinner, by a course of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48223:18"/>
may be shut up in a
state inevitably obnoxious to the
punishment of that Day, a long
while before the person dies, and
so comes to his particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
One may so much grieve
the Lord, as the Israelites did in
the Wilderness, that he will <hi>swear
they shall never enter into his rest</hi>—
They may sin so long that no place
is left for Repentance, and so no
hope of Mercy. It is a dreadful
curse when God saith, <hi>Let them
fall from one wickedness to another,</hi>
that so often, and the sins so great,
that they <hi>never come into his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
Gray hairs are upon the
foolish sinner, and he perceives
not that he grows old in sin and
guilt. <hi>My Spirit shall not always
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48223:18"/>
strive with men. Pharaoh</hi> having
hardned his heart against several
miraculous Declarations of Gods
Power and Anger, was irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
destinated to Ruin, though
God told him that he preserved
him a while to show his power
and anger upon him,<note place="margin">Exod.</note> before he
utterly destroyed him. The sins
<hi>of the Amorites were not at the full.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 5.</note>
Who knows whether he hath filled
up the measure which God will
stop at? yet fond sinners add to
it daily. When our gracious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
perceived <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to be in
this case, he wept over it, and
said, <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, how
oft would I have gathered thee! O
that thou hadst in this thy day seen
the things which belong to thy peace,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48223:19"/>
but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
We know that men by sin may
grow so stupid, as to their minds,
that they will pray for life to that
which is dead: and as to their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
they may be given up to
those which are so vile, as that it is
a shame to mention them; and
grow so base that they will sell
Heaven, as <hi>Esau</hi> did his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
for a Mess of Pottage. I
have heard of a man, who having
been drunk overnight, and passed
over a very narrow Bridge, which
no sober Horsman durst attempt,
being brought the next day to see
what danger he went through, fell
down in a swoon upon the sight
of it. But sinners are so besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the love of sin, that they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48223:19"/>
will on, though they are shewed
before that the Bridge they are
going to is impassable, and that
the Lake of Fire and Brimstone is
under it.</p>
                     <p>This is enough to have shown
the folly of sin, which whosoever
is guilty of, when he considers it,
will find reason enough to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of himself.</p>
                     <p>3. The third consideration in
this matter is that high Injustice
of which he makes himself guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that sins. There is nothing in
the world so due to any person, as
Obedience is to God. That which
is made by another, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Law from him. There is
nothing more absurd in Nature,
than for a Creature to be its own
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48223:20"/>
This was the Root upon which the
misery of Mankind grew at first,
that they would be <hi>sui juris,</hi> their
own Law-givers: and <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
still, he which sins knows <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
but his own Appetites, and this
he declares in his Actions. And
sometimes it comes to that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that he says so in words too, as
those Miscreants,<note place="margin">Ps. 12. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Our lips are our
own; who is Lord over us?</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
absurd! It is not so unjust
or shameful for Lacqueys to ride
on Horseback, and Princes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them on foot, as for a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to think to be at its own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and to speak and do what it
will. No, said those pious souls
who understood their estate,<note place="margin">Iames.</note> 
                        <hi>thou
hast made us, and not we our selves.</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48223:20"/>
And therefore, as the Apostle
adds, we should so speak, and so
do, as those who shall be judged
by the Creators Law, and give an
accompt to him who will pass a
severe sentence upon the injustice
of Disobedience.</p>
                     <p>Men are mightily concerned
for their own dues, and take it ill
if any deprive them of their Right.
Shall not the God of heaven and
earth regard what is due to him by
a Right which is transcendent to
all created propriety? See what
notice God takes of his wrongs,
<hi>A Son honoureth his Father,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>and a
Servant his Master. If then I be
a Father, where is mine Honour?
If I be a Master, where is my fear?</hi>
Art not thou ashamed, who art by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48223:21"/>
nature but a Servant, to deny the
homage which is due to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord of the World, and yet
art very careful of those petty
Rights which are only due to thee
by his appointment? Dost thou
think it a shame for Creatures to
do unjustly to one another, and yet
dost not blush to wrong thy God?
This is so strange a thing in Gods
accompt, that as the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi>
tells us God wonders at it;<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 8. 9.</note>
                        <hi>Will a man rob God?</hi> It is most
unlikely; <hi>yet you have robbed me.</hi>
God had bestowed the Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> upon them, but reserved
to himself, as Lord Proprietor,
several Tithes and Offerings which
he would have paid to him, as an
Acknowledgment of himself, of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48223:21"/>
whom they held what they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They pay'd not these Dues.
But God doth not care for it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
Doth he not? See what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
<hi>ye are curs'd with a dreadful
curse, because you have robbed me,
even this whole Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He which truly repents, turns
with shame for the wrong which
he hath done to his God, and
blushes as a penitent Thief when
he brings back stollen goods.<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>As
a Thief is ashamed when he is found,
so is the House of Israel.</hi> And so we
read in the Confessions of those
good men which prayed to God
for 'em, when they made their
Repentance publick, they were
ashamed and confounded when
they considered the wrongs which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48223:22"/>
they had done to God. <hi>To thee,
O Lord, belongs Righteousness,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 7, 8.</note> but
to us shame and confusion of face:</hi>
to us, not only the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
and Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but
to our Kings and Princes, <hi>because
we have sinned against thee.</hi> So
<hi>Ezra</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>4. This shame is heightened
by this, in that he which sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God is guilty of most hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Ingratitude. He which sins
offends his most good God, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his best Friend. Dost not
thou who sinnest, slight him in
whom thou livest, movest, and
hast thy being, affront him
who hath fed and clothed thee all
thy days? This Ingratitude is so
great an aggravation of the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48223:22"/>
of sin, that the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah</hi>
astonished at it,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 2, 3.</note> cries out
in Gods behalf, <hi>Hear O Heavens,
give ear O Earth;</hi> why, whats the
matter? <hi>I have nourished and brought
up Children, and they have rebelled
against me.</hi> Why, is that such a
matter that God should resent it
on that fashion? Yes. For as it
follows, it is a vileness so low that
Beasts are not capable of it;
<hi>The Ox knows his owner, and the
Ass his Masters Crib:</hi> and as they
come for meat to their Masters, so
they serve in grateful return for
what they receive. <hi>But Israel doth
not know, my people doth not consider.</hi>
They neither have a sense of me
their God, nor of the Favours they
have received from me, nor consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48223:23"/>
the Obligation which is upon
them to obey me, nor how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
they are in not obeying,
nor the baseness of their Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
whilst they disobey. So <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 31.</note>
Have I been a wilderness to
Israel, or a land of darkness, that
they say we are Lords, we will come
no more at thee?</hi> I thought I had
been to them that Fountain of
goodness at which they drank all
their days. I thought that by
the constant Irrigations of Mercy
I had made their souls like a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
garden. But it was true of
them which was said of <hi>Hezekiah,
He returned not as he received,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Chron. 32. 25.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his recovery from a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sickness, nor deliverance from
the potent Army of the <hi>Assyrians.</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48223:23"/>
Therefore the Penitent hath good
reason to say, I am ashamed, O
Lord, I blush to think how many
mercies I slight, how many obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
I trample upon, how base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unthankful I have been. Doth
<hi>Iesurun</hi> kick, and forget it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved
mercy which made him
fat? Because thou art full dost
thou sin, and not remember that
thou rebellest against him who fed
thee?<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>O foolish people and unwise,
do you thus requite the Lord?</hi> Or as
the Prophet,<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 8, 9.</note> Dost thou not know
that I gave thee thy Corn and
Wine, saith God, and that I mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
thy silver and thy gold?
I will return and take away my
corn, wine, and wooll, and make
thee know with what ingratitude
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48223:24"/>
thou hast forgot thy Benefactor
and chief Patron.</p>
                     <p>The Penitent may do well to
increase this shame in his soul, by
the consideration of some of the
chief mercies by which God hath
laid Obligations of Obedience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; and that will make him
say with <hi>Ezra—Have I sinned, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received such deliverance as
this?—Was I delivered to do abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations?
O my God, I am ashamed
to look up to Heaven—I blush and hide
my face.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to all considerations of
Ingratitude add always this, never
to be forgotten, the Love of thy
Saviour in dying for thy sins, and
then thou wilt say, Do I please
my self with committing sin, when
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48223:24"/>
my Saviour in pure love suffered
so much pain with infinite amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the Cross for it? What
am I so base as to trample under
my feet the Blood of the Son of
God, and to scorn the prayers
and tears of my Saviour? Those
whom this consideration doth not
make ashamed now, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with it for ever hereafter,
and beg Rocks to fall upon them,
that they may not come into the
presence of that Friend whom they
have so vilely abused; not only
because they see him now so great
that he can take vengeance upon
them, but because they perceive
themselves so base by Ingratitude,
that they highly deserve it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48223:25"/>5. Lastly, The Penitent hath
great reason to be ashamed of sin,
as for the aforementioned Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
so for this that he hath
made them out of measure sinful
by a horrid Perfidiousness. He
which sins at first breaks the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
the Oath which is
interwoven with our being, of
which the Philosopher spoke; God
making no Creature but of which
he takes an Oath, by the Law of its
Nature, that it shall be obedient
to him: But he is perfidious also,
because he breaks those voluntary
Promises which the sense of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
laid upon him, engaged
him to make to God. Sure this
will make the Penitent blush, when
he finds reason to say to his soul,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48223:25"/>
O my soul! Art not thou only so
vile as to consent to sin against
God, but also to do it when thou
hast vowed not to do so? and
when those Vows were made upon
most serious deliberation, and for
those Reasons which thou dost
still acknowledge to be most
weighty?</p>
                     <p>This is enough to have said to
shew, not only how necessary
Confession of sin is to Repentance,
but also how fit it is that sorrow
and shame for sin committed
should be joyned to the Confession
of it. Yet this must not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
so, as if they were only
applicable to some penitential so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
acts of Confession; for they
are to be continued through our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48223:26"/>
whole life: For a good man will
always be sorry, and ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
that he had once sinned.
Though God forgive, a true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
will hardly forgive himself.
A Heathen could say, That if we
believe there is a Providence, he
which hath sinned shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
if he grow good; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
yet he shall carry some marks
of old displeasure: For as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
there remains
in the souls of Penitents the marks
of old sins, as skars do in the
flesh, though the wounds be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48223:26"/>2. To Confession the Penitent
must add earnest Prayer for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
This we learn from our
blessed Saviour, who hath taught
us to put this into our Prayers, as
a chief petition,—<hi>Forgive us our
Trespasses.</hi> Shall God forgive such
as do not entreat him to do so?
It is fit the sinner should fall upon
his knees before the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and beg pardon. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
understood by reading the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> that the time
was at hand in which God had
promised so to pardon the sins of
the Jews, as to return their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
then he set himself to <hi>seek
it of God by supplication and prayer.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan 9. 2, 3.</note>
Why so? Because the promise was
made upon condition that they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48223:27"/>
should repent of their sins which
carried them captive, and pray
for pardon and return: For so
we read,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>I will plant that which
was desolate. and build the ruinous
places—I will yet for this be enquired
of by the house of Israel, to do it for
them; i. e.</hi> I will grant it to them
when they pray for it. Hereupon
this holy man began in prayer to
do his part, and directed them to
do theirs.</p>
                     <p>But as Prayer for Pardon is a
Duty unquestionable, so Ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is a qualification so requisite,
that without it Prayer will not be
accepted, as it appears by what
our Saviour hath taught us in his
Sermons, the Apostles in their
Epistles, sincere Penitents in their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48223:27"/>
praetise, and of which we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
because it hath ever been
made a condition of the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
promised.</p>
                     <p>It is usually expressed thus,
They shall find me if they seek me
with their whole heart: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
they are said to have sought
God <hi>with their whole desire.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 15.</note> We
read of the Prayer of Faith saving
the sick,<note place="margin">Iames 5. 5.</note> and obtaining forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sins; but the reason given
in the next verse, shows what kind
of Prayer it must be,<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>The effectual
fervent prayer of a righteous man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
much;</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.
The word signifies high, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Translators use two to express
the meaning of it. No doubt
rightly; For the Apostle intended
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48223:28"/>
such prayer as in which the most
lively working of the soul expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it self. The same word St.
<hi>Paul</hi> used,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> speaking of Faith which
saves, where he says that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>i. e.</hi> which
shows its vertue in a powerful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
and so is all one with
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as appears by two other
places in his Epistles put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For when he says of the
Word of God,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 13.</note> that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
he says it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> quick
and powerful in working. This
is enough to show the meaning of
the word; now to apply it to our
purpose. If such a fervency of
soul was requisite when a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man prayed for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of other mens sins, what is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48223:28"/>
quisite when an unrighteous man
prays for the pardon of his own?
Sure he needs to do as St. <hi>Iames</hi>
faith,<note place="margin">Iames 17.</note> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, to
pray very earnestly; vehemency
being usually signified in Hebrew
by the gemination or joyning the
Verb with the Noun.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, he which beggs
forgiveness of God in a languid
Prayer, doth declare plainly that
he neither minds to whom he prays,
nor for what: He which intreats
God to forgive him his sins, and
understands how great a thing he
asks, and is sensible in what need
he stands of it, and withal how
unworthy he is to receive it, and
considers the greatness of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of whom he begs it, and how
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48223:29"/>
much goodness that is which will
bestow it, and consequently how
high a favour it must be if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, will pray with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
earnestness for it. It is not fit
to put up any cold petition to
God, much less when we beg so
great a matter. How earnestly
would a condemned man beg his
life of the Judge, if he might
have it for asking; or but hope by
entreaty to revoke the sentence pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
against him?<note place="margin">Col 4. 12.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> useth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
expression, well signifying
the same thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
to strive earnestly in
Prayer, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did when he wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Angel, and would
not let him go till he blessed him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48223:29"/>When our blessed Saviour was
in an Agony, <hi>i. e.</hi> in conflict with
those amazing horrours which the
guilt of our sins set before him, he
is said to have prayed often, and
as that dreadful weight pressed
harder, he prayed more earnestly,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, extending, as I may
say, all the power of his soul to
its utmost compass; shewing the
earnest working of his soul after he
had risen from his knees, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his holy Body upon the
ground, lying prostrate before the
Eternal Father, as the Author to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, offering Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
with strong cries and
tears to him who was able to save
him, and was so delivered from
his fear, Hear, O Penitent, was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48223:30"/>
thy Saviour so earnest in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the conflict which he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the sins of others, and art
thou dull and flaccid in prayer for
the pardon of thy own? Sure thou
art not sensible what kind of thing
Divine Wrath is, or dost not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that sin brings with it an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to make the Offender suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it? dost thou think thy self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to endure it? or it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadest
thy self that it may be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
some other way? Awake,
awake, O drouzy soul, and pray
mightily to God that thy sins may
be forgiven thee, that thou mayst
not fall into the hands of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, who is a consuming fire;
pray that thou mayst be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so not be thrown into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48223:30"/>
burnings. If thou be'st
unconcerned or lazy in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
thou art more prophane than
<hi>Esau,</hi> who though he was vile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in selling his Birth-right,
yet when the Blessing was departed
from him, he not only prayed for
the reversion of the sentence by
which it was done, <hi>but sought it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with tears.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much will serve to have
spoken of the first part of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which though it be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be done, yet the second
must be added to it. Having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
changed our minds as to
what is past, and heartily begg'd
pardon for it, we must be sure to
have better care for the future. He
which doth not the first, will never
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48223:31"/>
think of the second; and though
he have done the former, if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
not to the latter, it will do
him no good, it being no better
than Corn in the blade which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
comes to an Ear. As <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
said well, <hi>Quid enim ex Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia

except it bring forth a better life.
Present penitence without future

                     <p>When <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Disciples upon profession of
Repentance, which they made by
confessing their sins to him, he bad

them to the Divine Favour,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48223:31"/>
except they brought forth fruits

our Return to God will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be so, if it be</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Speedy.</item>
                        <item>2. Sincere.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. The vileness of sin is so great,
as I show'd before, that a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48223:32"/>
cannot reflect seriously upon
it, but he must needs think it fit
to undo it as soon as he can. This
we see in St. <hi>Peter;</hi> as soon as he
thought what he had done, he went
presently out <hi>and wept bitterly,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring,
as soon as possibly he
might, to wash away his sin with
tears. Excellent is the counsel
which <hi>Salvian</hi> gives in this case,
<hi>Illico ubi concidere consurgant &amp; ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationem
protinus meditentur in lapsu,
ac si fieri ullo modo pernicitate poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis
potest, tam velox sit remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
resurgentis, ut u x possit vestigium
apparere collapsi.</hi> He which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
quickly declares how willing
he was not to have sinned.</p>
                     <p>1. This is reasonable; for no
man is sensible of danger approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48223:33"/>
but he will endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it as soon as he can, and he
may delay so long that it will grow
impossible. If a mans House be
on fire, will he not presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to quench it? If he be
bitten with a Serpent, doth he not
seek for present remedy? He which
is fallen into sickness makes haste
to send for a Physician, every body
knowing that recovery is then most
to be hoped for, when proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
are used in time. A Disease
may prevail so far by neglect of
those Medicines which would have
cured it at first, that neither they
nor any other will be able to do it
afterward. Delay in this affair
makes the work grow harder. By
repeating of sin the Offender har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48223:33"/>
his heart; and though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he turn Penitent, he will
find his task more difficult, because
instead of a slighter disposition,
which he might have more easily
conquered at first, he must now
conflict with a firm habit. Shall
he which cannot outgo a Footman
hope to outrun Horsmen?</p>
                     <p>2. The demerit of sin encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
by delaying to return. Can he
hope for mercy who hath stood out
in rebellion to the last? He which
delays to repent treasures up wrath
against himself, when as God knows,
if his wrath be kindled but a little,
there is no man able to endure it.
It is strange that any Conceit
should come into a mans Head
that acknowledgeth his dependance
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48223:34"/>
upon God, to make him defer his
return to him by repentance. It
is possibly this, He means at last
to repent of his negligence. Doth
he, and yet is deliberately negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
at present? It is a new sort
of Vertue this, to sin pretending
an intention to repent; and as odd
a kind of wisdom to abuse infinite
goodness in hope to find that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
of which the course of life
which we chuse makes us infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unworthy, and being continued
in will give us strong reasons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of when we dy.</p>
                     <p>3. Pardon is not to be had, no
nor repentance, when we will. He
who is so gracious, that he pleaseth
to pardon when we truly repent,
hath not promised we shall have
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48223:34"/>
grace to repent when we please.
We are advised in Holy Writ to
<hi>seek the Lord whilst he may be found:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 5. 5, 6</note>
and when that is we are told,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>I love
them that love me, and those that seek
me early shall find me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How applicable this is to the
matter of Repentance, we may see
by what is said in the fith and sixth
verses of <hi>Psalm 32. David</hi> was in
great distress by reason of Divine
Wrath, which lay upon him for his
sins; whereupon he took himself
to repentance, speedily bewailing,
and openly confessing his Faith to
to God, and so returning to his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
found pardon. <hi>For this shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that is godly pray unto thee
in a time when thou mayest be found.</hi>
He that knows how great a matter
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48223:35"/>
it is to be reconciled to an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God, and that there is a time of
finding mercy, which if it be slipt,
the sinner is eternally undone, will
thereupon make what speed he can
to return to God, and humbly seek
his favour in a seasonable address,
lest he lose himself with the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
                     <p>It is not many years since the
Master of a Ship loitering ashore,
and not taking the advantage of
one Tide when the Wind blew fair,
with which other Ships went out,
was forced by contrary Winds to
stay in the Port till the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Ships made their Voiage, and
return'd. They are bold people,
but extremely sottish, who slight
opportunities of doing that which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48223:35"/>
belongs to their chief good, when
they know they cannot command
the stay or return of such seasons.
Dost thou slight God in thy youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
health, when to have served him
early is the unspeakable consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of old age, and which they who
then want it would purchase with
all the World, if they had it, upon
their Death-bed? Is not old age
burthen enough except it be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
with the heavy remembrance
of a wicked life? This hath made
many to cry out with him in the
Tragedy,</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Euripid.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:48223:36"/>Alas for me, that men may not
grow younger twice, and as often
old, that so I might in my after life
correct what was not well done in
the former part of it.</p>
                     <p>4. Though a man begin never
so soon, this work of Repentance
is not to be done of a sudden: It
will require great pains, and much
time; and therefore none is to be
lost. Can sin, which hath taken
deep root in the soul, be drawn up
at the first pull? Can our unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to do it be mortified in a
moment? Is a habit of sin soon
master'd? No; but as we have
been longer in contracting it, and
so making it stronger; it will not
be conquered but by the contrary
habit of Vertue, which requires
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48223:36"/>
time to be implanted, grow and
get strength in the soul. It may
be that we have many Vices to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
and do we hope to do
that presently? We have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many Errors, and can we repent
of them all on a sudden? We have
many things to do, and those not
easie to one accustomed to sin; We
are to make our selves Vessels meet
for our Masters use, but it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
time to do it, considering
how we are put out of order by sin;
and therefore all possible speed is
necessary in the practise of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>2. As Repentance must be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
so it must be sincere; and that
we shall find, if it answer those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
of it which are given in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48223:37"/>
holy Scripture, vvhere it is called
<hi>The renewing of the mind, crucifying
the old man and his deeds, putting off
the body of sin and destroying it, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
the flesh with the affections and
lusts, purging our selves from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of flesh and spirit, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
holiness in Gods fear, being made
new creatures and partakers of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature,</hi> vvith many more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
to the same purpose.</p>
                     <p>The Sense of which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in these four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                     <p>1. Sincere Repentance begins
in a change of the inward disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for which Reason the true
Convert is called <hi>a new man,</hi> as we
learn from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is so great, that it denominates
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48223:37"/>
the Penitent to be <hi>a new Creature;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note>
which is not meant as to Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
of Nature, but Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Temper, making the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
not another person, but a
better Man. A few Scriptures
considered will make this so plain,
that every one may know what it
means, and judge himself accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
It consists in two things,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. In change of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</item>
                        <item>2. In Alteration of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. In change of Apprehension;
he which is truly Penitent hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sense of things than he had
before, which the Apostle calls
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48223:38"/>
                        <hi>renewing in the spirit of the mind,</hi> by
which he now understands the
goodness of God, and perceives
that to be perfect and most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
of which he had but mean
thoughts before. <hi>The carnal mind
perceives not the things of God, they
are foolishness to him;</hi> he understands
no reason in them: but the true
Penitent hath received another
mind, is made spiritual, and so
can discern them, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
that to be the chiefest wisdom,
which before he accounted extream
folly. He which lives in sin is so
besotted with carnal Lust, that he
can see no reason in Spiritual
things; no more can a blind man
judge of colours. The true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
thinks highly now of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48223:38"/>
favour of God, which he regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not before; and counts all things
dross in comparison of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ, which he despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
before; understands the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to be of infinite value, which
he contemned before; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the necessity of God's
pardon, the excellency of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the reasonableness of vertue,
and the necessary connexion which
is between goodness and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>2. It consists also in Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Affections; for as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
things better, so he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
affected towards them: without
this the former would be no proof
of a sincere change, but a sign of
hypocrisie, which a true Penitent
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48223:39"/>
doth as passionately desire to throw
out of his soul, as he would cast the
Devil out of his House, if it were
possessed by him. Many Scriptures
speak this plain enough,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Those who
are Christs, have crucified the flesh
with its affections and lusts—and
have put off the old man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22</note> 
                        <hi>which is
corrupt according to the deceitful
lusts.</hi> The true Convert hath a
<hi>new heart, another spirit,</hi> as it is
called <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 24. The heart of
stone is broke in pieces, and being
cast away, one of flesh is put in
the room of it; which is easily
known, for by its softness it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
impressions from those
things which before wrought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon it. The Iron sinew
is broken, and the stiff neck made
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48223:39"/>
pliable, stoops to the yoke of
Christ. Self-will is denied, and
uncontrolled appetite passeth into
a state of mortification; the same
mind beginning to be in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
which was in Christ Jesus; he
says with him, <hi>Not my will, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but thine be done:</hi> That which
pleaseth thee shall please me. Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
desire ceaseth, Covetousness
languishes, Pride is melted down
into Humility, <hi>Feroculum illud &amp;
petulcum animal cicuratur,</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and abusive temper is alter'd
into sweetness and respect, Goatish
lasciviousness is changed into cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
of disposition, Revenge turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Forgiveness, Malice into
Charity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48223:40"/>He which has repented sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
will by this find his conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not to be a vain pretense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he perceives Religion to have
passed into his Nature, and the
Gospel become a principle of new
life in his soul, and that by the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
entertainment of it there he
contrarily says of himself, I am
not I; <hi>Ego non sum ille Ego,</hi> I am
not that I which I was before: He
is another man, a new Creature,
a man now after Gods Heart: He
is now a Sacrifice acceptable to
God, because he is salted with fire,
that is, the vigour of the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
hath eaten out the Impurity of
his Affections, and like a Divine
Salt dried up those corruptions
which putrifie the soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:48223:40"/>2. The sincerity of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
declares it self in outward
expressions agreeable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
change, and makes the course
of life answerable to the temper of
heart. The Scripture tells us of
<hi>newness of life</hi> as well as of the <hi>new
man.</hi> The Baptist told his Proselytes
this same thing, when he bad them
<hi>bring forth fruits meet for Repentance;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note>
that is, to do works agreeable
to the nature of the thing it self
and the profession of it. The
sincere Penitent brings forth such
fruits, as demonstrate the Doctrines
of the Gospel like living Roots to
have been implanted in his heart;
<hi>i. e.</hi> he performs such actions as
flow properly from vertuous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
and Habits. This
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48223:41"/>
the Apostle told the <hi>Galatians</hi>
in other words,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>If you live in the
Spirit, walk in the Spirit—If you
live</hi>—i. e. have made the truth of
the Gospel the principle of your
life—<hi>walk in the Spirit;</hi> i. e. live
according to them, and let the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of heavenly Doctrine shine forth
in the beauty of holy Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Penitent now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
Christ for his Master; but
to little purpose, except he do what
he commands him.</p>
                     <p>Without a true change of soul
a man pretending to some acts of
Religion, is like a dead Tree, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which some branches of Fruit
are tied; and if he pretend to have
a living Root, but brings not forth
answerable fruits, he may make a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48223:41"/>
plausible show, because possibly
adorn'd with green leaves; but the
Tree is such as our Saviour will
cut down, and cast out of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
Our Saviour hath given but
one Rule, and they will do foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that go about to make another to
know the goodness of a Tree by,
and that is the fruit of it;<note place="margin">Matt. 7. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>For a good
Tree bringeth forth good fruits.</hi> He
doth not say that the Tree which
is bad now, may not be made good,
and then bring forth good fruits,
for that it may; but that so long
as it brings forth corrupt fruits it
is bad. Most are ready to allow
this Rule when they make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others; but doth it not hold
as well when they apply it to
themselves? Yes; and therefore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48223:42"/>
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> said well,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Little Children,
let no man deceive you: he that doth
righteousness is righteous, even as he
is righteous. Let no man deceive
you</hi>—Why, were any in danger in
that point? Yes, many did then,
as they do still, flatter themselves
that a good heart to God, as they
call it, and some certain desire of
living well, will be sufficient to their
Salvation: No, saith the Apostle,
<hi>He that doth righteousness, is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi>
He that will be accepted of
God must do righteousness, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to God an obedient Faith, by
which of old, as the Author to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>they wrought
righteousness: as he,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 29.</note> that is Christ,
<hi>was righteous,</hi> and so was accepted
of his Father; because, as he said
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48223:42"/>
himself, <hi>He always did those things
which pleased him.</hi> He who vvill
assure himself of his sincerity, must
make no nevv Rules to judge of it,
but keep true to the old one, and
not rest satisfied that he knovvs
his Duty, and approves of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will, or that he hath some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be obedient; No, he must
truly perform the actions vvhich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
vvith Gospel Principles and
Lavvs, still remembring that of
our Saviour, vvho is also our
Judge,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>If you know these things, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are you if you do them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. When you have got so far,
and find the state of your soul right
in the forementioned Particulars,
then remember that you must make
your conformity to the aforesaid
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48223:43"/>
Rules universal, and your Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
uniform to all the parts of
the Gospel. If your Obedience
be partial, you vvill find nothing
vvithin or vvithout that vvill keep
you from being at a loss, as to the
proof of your sincerity. If it be
necessary to forsake sin, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to forsake all sin.</p>
                     <p>It vvas the Prayer of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,<note place="margin">Ps. 119. 18</note>
                        <hi>That he might be found in Gods
Statutes, and so not be ashamed.</hi> Hovv
did he hope to attain this? He tells
us,<note place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Then shall I not be ashamed,</hi> then
I shall be sound, vvhen <hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to all thy Commandments.</hi> Then
I shall have confidence that I am
a sincere Servant of God, when I
indulge no sin, vvhen I devote my
soul to entire Obedience, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48223:43"/>
knovvingly disregard no Law of
his.</p>
                     <p>This cannot be more clearly
represented, than by that vvhich St.
<hi>Iames</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iames 2. 10.</note> hath said concerning this
matter, <hi>Whosoever shall keep the whole
Law, and yet offend in one point, is
guilty of all.</hi> If any say, Hovv can
vve keep the vvhole, and fail in
part, vvhen the vvhole includes all
the parts? They may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Apostle means, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
keeps the greater part, and
fails in some particular, disobeys
some Lavv of Christ, is guilty of
all; by sinning vvilfully against
one, he is guilty of all; <hi>i. e.</hi> he vvhich
sincerely respects the Authority of
the Lavv-giver, vvill shovv it in
obedience to his vvhole Lavv; for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48223:44"/>
he vvhich slights it in one, is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the breach of the rest, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he contemns the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
vvhich gave them all. That this
is his meaning vve are taught by
verse 11. vvhich says thus, <hi>For he
which said, Do not commit Adultery,
said also, do not kill: Now if thou
commit no Adultery, yet if thou kill,
thou art become a Transgressor of the
Law;</hi> and so art guilty of the
breach of all, <hi>i. e.</hi> shall be as lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Condemnation, as if thou
hadst sinned against all: Neither
shall Obedience performed to some
Lavvs save thee from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vvhich is due to the breach of
others. He vvhich serves a Prince
in many things, and yet offends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some Capital Lavv, vvill not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48223:44"/>
find his partial obedience save
him from the sentence of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which shall be passed upon
him for that.</p>
                     <p>To this I may add that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
saying of our Saviour to the
Pharisees,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 42.</note> when they pretended to
be worthy of acceptation, because
they had been very observant of
some things, though they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
others; How! saith our
Saviour, <hi>These indeed you ought to
have done, no doubt of it; but also
you ought not to have left the other
undone.</hi> And since they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to obedience,<note place="margin">v. 40.</note> for all this, <hi>Fools
that you are,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>did
not he which made that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
make that which is within?</hi> You
pretend to please God with obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48223:45"/>
you should do so; for he
is the supream Law-giver; What
then, will you do it with partial
obedience? Doth he expect that
all his Laws should be obey'd, or
doth he give you leave to pick and
chuse? Did not God, the great
Former of all things, who made
the inside and outside, expect that
you should be pure in soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
Do you think that external
washings purifie the soul? You
are as foolish in these thoughts, as
he should be who thinks a Cup is
clean, when only the outside is
washed. Will any man drink in
such a Cup? You please God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
with your Obedience, when
by sinning in some thing or other
you plainly affront him. He which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48223:45"/>
thinks to be accepted of God for
that partial regard show'd to some
of his Precepts, when he slights
others, can no more obtain it, than
a Lutonist can give content to such
as have Musical ears, when some
Strings of the Instrument upon
which he plays are out of Tune.</p>
                     <p>4. Sincerity must continue to
approve it self such by perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
This I shall explain as I
find it expressed in two or three
places of Sripture:—<hi>I will hear
what God will speak to his servants,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 85. 8.</note>
                        <hi>begging mercy of him:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 7.</note> and what doth
he say? <hi>He will speak peace to his
people,</hi> he will receive their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and pardon their sins, if they
repent sincerely of them:—<hi>but
let them not return to folly</hi>—This he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48223:46"/>
requires as a Condition of their
Forgiveness, that they do <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to folly,</hi> which I have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
demonstrated sin to be; they
must not relapse into their former
courses, which if they should, they
will add to their former sottishness,
and instead of approving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sincere Penitents, show that
they are most stupid Fools and vile
Hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>When our Saviour healed the
Paralytick;<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 14.</note> he bad him <hi>sin no more;</hi>
and knowing by his Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
what he had done 38 years
before, which occasioned his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
bad him take heed of doing
any such thing again; assuring
him, if he did, that he should be
worse punished, as a Contemned
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48223:46"/>
of the pardon now bestowed. So
when the same merciful Jesus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
a very bad woman a sin great
enough,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 11.</note> he dismissed her not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly,
but with this severe Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
added, That she should make
her Repentance sincere by <hi>sinning
no more.</hi> He did not say, Go, go,
thy Accusers are as bad as thy self,
live as thou wilt, I accept thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
I will save thee from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
now and hereafter: No;
but charged her to be sincere in
her Repentance; and as a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of it, to <hi>sin no more.</hi> By these
Instances we may see what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
takes for a proof of sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and it seems that he expects it
of all; for he prescribed the same
method, without alteration, to both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:48223:47"/>A sincere Penitent is one that
knows sin to be so base a thing, that
nothing but Infinite Goodness can
forgive it; and is so sensible of the
vile stain which it leaves upon his
soul, that he would, if he could,
wash it off with Tears of Blood;
and can he easily go and commit it
again? He is convinced that the
same wickedness and danger is in
it, though set off with an agreeable
Tentation, as was before in it,
when his Conscience was gall'd
with reflexion upon the commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it; and knows that he hath as
much need to sin no more, after he
hath repented of it, as he had to
vow he would not when he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
Can Damnation be made
plausible in any dress? Will any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48223:47"/>
man drink Poison, because he sees
it sweetned with a great quantity
of Sugar?</p>
                     <p>The ancient Fathers in their
pious Discourses concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
did usually inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
and
rejected those Penitents, who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and repenting, but repenting
and sinning still, checked their life
all along with one and the other;
and affirm'd, that such Converts
differ'd nothing from lame Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
except in this, that those
false Penitents knew they sinn'd,
and so were worse; and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
peremptorily that those who
sinned, pretended to be sorry, but
sinned still, had only a vain show
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48223:48"/>
of Repentance; and that the true
Penitent had such a sense of the
nature of sin, that he abhor'd to
commit it any more. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls it <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from dead works;</hi> of which
words what St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> said is a
very good Exposition,<note place="margin">Tom. 6. Orat. 19.</note> He which
repents <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius
lib.</hi> 6. said, <hi>That to repent
is to profess and affirm that we will sin
no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> tells us what
sense of old the Church of the God had
concerning the contrary sort of
Repentance,<note place="margin">Ecclus. 34. 25, 26.</note> in these words, <hi>If a
man wash himself from the dead, and
toucheth it again, what good shall that
washing do him?</hi> The Jews having
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48223:48"/>
touched any dead body, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
by the Law given <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 11.
and they were commanded to take
it off by <hi>water of Purification,</hi> as it
is called; but if they had washed,
and touched it again, what good
would that washing do? So he <hi>that
repents and fasts too,</hi> as they did in
the days of solemn Humiliation,
and then goes <hi>and does the same
things again, who will hear his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
and what good shall his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do him?</hi> He which bewails what
is passed, and hath no care to mend
for future, deplores his sin, and
commits it again, is like one who
washeth an unburnt Brick, the
more water he pours on the fowler
it is. It was the saying of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Writer, and what he said
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48223:49"/>
was warranted by one ancienter
than he,<note place="margin">2 Pet 2. 21, 22.</note> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Epistle hath defined, that it is
<hi>better never to have known the way
of Righteousness,</hi> which is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<hi>than having known it to turn
from it.</hi> And he there compares that
Repentance, which keeps not a man
from returning to sin, to the <hi>Dogs
returning to his Vomit,</hi> and <hi>the washed
Sows tumbling again in the next mire.</hi>
I shall close this with those words
of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 31.</note> which he spake to
such as believed on him, that they
might assure themselves, and not
mistake for what they saw in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at present—<hi>If you continue in
my words, i. e.</hi> the obedience of my
Doctrine, <hi>you shall be my Disciples
indeed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:48223:49"/>If that which hath been said
concerning Sincerity happen to
raise doubts in any soul concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his estate, and he begins to
say, That either the Conditions of
Salvation are very hard, or I am
no true Christian. I must answer,
That if those things which I have
said were not true, Christs Gospel
would not be that which it most
certainly is, the Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the Doctrine of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and that it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that Christ doth accept his
Servants to mercy, though they do
not perform perfect unsinning O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:
therefore I would speak
something more to determine this
matter, so as not to encourage Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
which is confessedly the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48223:50"/>
worst of sins, nor yet to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
any that is sincere, because
he is not perfect. Therefore I
will show what God requires of
us, and what he will accoount
sincerity. I will give the Measures
of it in five Particulars, which I
will endeavour to adjust accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the standard of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
the Infallible Rule, which is
the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>1. The Gospel requires great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
of Intention, and simplicity
of heart in our Return to God. So
the Prophet of his Penitents,<note place="margin">Ier. 24. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>I will
be their God, for they shall return to
me with their whole heart,</hi> having
taken it quite off from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Idolatries, and the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
which they had for their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48223:50"/>
old sins. It was said of the Tribe
of <hi>Zabulon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Chron. 12. 33.</note> who came to restore
<hi>David</hi> to his Throne, that they
were <hi>not of a double heart;</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
outwardly great love to <hi>David,</hi>
but hankering in their minds to the
House of <hi>Saul.</hi> Just as the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
set their faces towards the
Holy Land, and journeyed towards
it, but in their hearts turned back
to <hi>Egypt.</hi> They kept the steme of
the Flesh-pots in their phansies,
and had the rellish of the Onions
in their memories, and long'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them; and so went not toward
the promised Land with a full
heart, but would have been glad
of an opportunity to have return'd
to <hi>Egypt.</hi> So I remember the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi>
Cows went when they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48223:51"/>
the Ark to <hi>Bethshemesh;</hi> they
went, but they lowed as they went,
and had more mind to return to
their Calves, than to go forward.
Singleness of heart is necessary for
all who come unto God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> warned all
such to take heed of approaching
him <hi>with a double heart:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ecclus. 1. 28.</note> Which
counsel St. <hi>Iames</hi> repeats,<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Draw nigh
to God,</hi> but first <hi>purifie your hearts,
you double minded,</hi> whose Souls are
partly for God, partly for Sin;
which the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
calls <hi>drawing near with true heart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 22.</note>
purg'd from all Hypocrisie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>the God with whom we have to
do, loves Truth in the inward parts,</hi>
and can take no pleasure in such as
are double minded, <hi>i. e.</hi> fluctuate
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48223:51"/>
between a pretence of being vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and a Law of sin, called
<hi>halting between two opinions;</hi> leaning
one while one way, and one while
another, as those who halt do. It
was not a <hi>piece,</hi> but <hi>all,</hi> which was
meant in that Demand, <hi>My Son give
me thy heart;</hi> for so our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating
a Rule long before given,
says, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart,</hi> with thy
whole heart. The contrary is so
odious to God, that he declared
plainly that he hated the Jews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned,
because their <hi>heart
was not whole with him; they did not
follow him fully,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nam. 14. 24.</note> as was said of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah,</hi>
who had <hi>another spirit,</hi> but
<hi>turn'd aside like a deceitful bow;</hi> you
may as well make a crooked Bow,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48223:52"/>
carry an Arrow directly to the
Mark, as present any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God with a false heart.
Therefore our Lord in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Parable of the Sower hath
told us plainly, that his Gospel will
grow in no soyl, but a <hi>good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
heart.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> told the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they could present
no fruit as an acceptable Sacrifice
to God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 6.</note> except with <hi>unleavened
bread of sincerity;</hi> for Hypocrisie
sour's the person and his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>The true Convert endeavours
to bring himself to that pass, that
he can say truly, He loves God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things; which cannot be,
if he retain still the love of any sin
in his soul. That man is just as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48223:52"/>
religious as the <hi>Assyrian Samaritans,</hi>
mention'd 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 33. who blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Heathen Ceremonies with
Jewish Rites, made a Mungrel
Worship, and <hi>serv'd the Lord and
their own God's too.</hi> They did not
know that the Law given was, <hi>Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve.</hi> It was good
counsel of the old Philosopher,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Be one thing,
deal plainly with God. Dost thou
pretend to make over thy soul to
God by a Deed, and art so weak
as not to know that it will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor'd,
when thou hast spoil'd the
Grant which preserves, and maim'd
it with a power of Revocation?
Deal fairly; <hi>God will not be mocked.</hi>
The true Penitent must bid an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48223:53"/>
farewel to all his former sins,
and that he may practise them no
more, must cut off all affection to
every sinful way; as the wise Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
when he had landed his men
in the Country which he designed
to Conquer, burnt the Ships which
brought him thither, that so his
Souldiers might not upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
think of a cowardly return.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour hath declared,<note place="margin">Luke 9. 62.</note> That
he who <hi>puts his hand to the heavenly
Plough,</hi> and doth not renounce
what may make him <hi>look back,</hi> is
<hi>not fit for the Kingdom of God.</hi> He
which holds the Plough, and often
looks back, will make mad work
on't; his Furrows will be all
crooked.<note place="margin">Luke 17. 32.</note> When the same our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
bids us, <hi>Remember</hi> Lot's <hi>wife,</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:48223:53"/>
he signified to us plainly enough,
that such as have forsaken <hi>Sodom</hi>
and their sins, must not look back
with hankering eyes upon them.</p>
                     <p>If thy heart be sincere with
God, thou mayest do well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it to God upon thy knees in
some such words as these are, O
Lord, I have sinned against thee,
but I repent, and thou understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
the depth of my heart, and
knowest that I repent truly. Thou
knowest all things; thou knowest
that I love thee. In thy sacred
presence I make my Vow that I
will obey thee. I will observe the
Rules of my Nature so far, as by
them I am taught what my Duty
is: and where they fail, I will
read carefully thy Gospel, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48223:54"/>
what I find there to be thy Will,
shall be to me an indispensable
Law. I make this solemn prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
that I will harbour no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
of thine in my soul; and lest
any thing lurk there which may
displease thee, let me know my
heart by thy Instruction, and I
will cast it out. I desire to be in
thy sight an <hi>Israelite indeed,</hi> and pray
that I may inherit the blessing
which thou bestowest upon those <hi>in
whose spirit is no guile.</hi> This is
well expressed in that holy Prayer
which <hi>David</hi> made in these words,<note place="margin">Psa. 139. 23, 24.</note>
                        <hi>Try me, O God, and seek the ground
of my heart; prove me, and examine
my thoughts; look well if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way of wickedness in me, and lead
me in the way everlasting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:48223:54"/>2. Honest Intention must be
perfected with firm Resolution
and fixed purpose of soul; and
that must be formed and settled by
serious deliberation, that is, due
consideration of those things which
are the matter of Obedience, and
also the difficulties which may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in the doing them. He which
undertakes the business of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thus, will find in a little time
that he needed to have his Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so grounded. Our Saviour
in several of his excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
hath taught us this; let
us consider some of them:<note place="margin">Matt. 16. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>If any
man will come after me,</hi> that is, <hi>to
be my Disciple, let him deny himself;</hi>
he must think now of renouncing
all self-will, and resigning himself
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48223:55"/>
wholly to my Discipline, and take
my yoke upon his Neck, yield
himself wholly to be governed by
my Gospel. And lest we should be
mistaken, and so fly off afterward,
our Saviour hath in that told us
plainly what we must be, <hi>viz. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Righteous, Sober, Chast, Humble,
Charitable, Patient;</hi> and hath
shown us fully what the work of
his Servants is. Have you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
these things? Yes; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
nothing but what is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good; I cannot be happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
I be such a person as his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
requires. So far it is well,
but this is not all; for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
adds, That he <hi>must take up his
Cross and follow him; i. e.</hi> he must
not only be willing to compose his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48223:55"/>
temper and life according to our
Saviour's Doctrine and Example,
he must also be prepar'd to bear
patiently these Afflictions, which
may happen to him only for being
Christ's Disciple.</p>
                     <p>This our Saviour declared in
his general Discourses, and also
when any particular persons came
to be Proselytes, he dealt plainly
with them; and that they might be
fully informed, and follow him
upon good grounds, he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them with what they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
in his service.<note place="margin">Matt. 8. 19, 20.</note> A certain
Scribe, struck with admiration of
his Miracles, and thereupon pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
expecting that in a while such
a Person would make his Disciples
great, professed that he <hi>would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48223:56"/>
him wheresoever he went.</hi> Our
Saviour, to see if this forward Man
had any worthy Resolutions in him,
told him how mean his worldly
condition was, in that <hi>the Foxes
have holes</hi> in Earth, and <hi>Birds have
nests</hi> in Trees, <hi>but the Son of Man
hath not,</hi> as it happened to divers
of his Servants, <hi>any certain Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
No House of his own for
himself, much less to entertain his
followers. He bad him think of
this, and then resolve what to
do.</p>
                     <p>For the fuller Explication of
this matter concerning the right
forming of Christian Resolution,
let us read that Discourse which
our Saviour made to a great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
when he was giving them
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48223:56"/>
his Divine Instruction touching
this affair:<note place="margin">Luke 14. 26, 27, &amp;c.</note> He which will be my
Disciple, must not only embrace
my Doctrine; but must make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that possibly many things
will fall out to him for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and practise of my Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which will not be very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to flesh and blood; he may
perchance offend not only his
Neighbours, but his Parents, and
and make Enemies to him of his
best Friends; may endanger the
losing of his Liberty, and after that
his Life; and yet for all this he
must not forsake my service: For
if any <hi>man come unto me, and doth
not hate his Father, Mother, Wife,
and Children, and Brethren and
Sisters, yea and his own Life, cannot
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48223:57"/>
be my Disciple.</hi> Which words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be understood properly; for
it is impious to hate our Parents
and other Relations, and absurd
to hate ones self; but he means,
and other Scriptures teach us so,
that we must love all persons and
things less than our Saviour; and
that will appear, when we suffer
none of them to make us desert the
Obedience which we have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him. <hi>And he that doth not take
up his Cross, and come after me,</hi> &amp;c.
Not that Persecutions do always
follow the profession of Christian
Religion; or that any man is bound
upon the undertaking of it, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
all he hath in the World;<note place="margin">v. 33.</note>
not that we should presently do it
because we are Christians, but that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48223:57"/>
we should be prepar'd to do it,
preferring our Saviour before all
things, and being resolv'd to part
with all, rather than break our
Faith given to him.</p>
                     <p>To illustrate further what he
said concerning this way of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Resolution, our Saviour adds
two Comparisons, taken from the
Rules which men follow in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Houses and making War. If
any man think of raising a House,
he must cast up what it will cost
him, both for Materials and
Work; and if he begin to build,
being either not provided for so
much Charge, or not willing to
lay it out, he will leave off in the
middle of an imperfect Design,
and be laughed at for a foolish Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48223:58"/>
Or if a man go to War,
he will consult with himself whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath Supplies enough for
his Expedition, and Forces suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to fight his Adversary; else
he will think it better to keep
Peace if he have it, or send Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
for it upon as good
Conditions as he can get. So in
this Spiritual building or warfare,
for in divers respects Religion may
be compared to both, we must be
at much cost, a great deal must be
laid out, and the Enemy which
we have to oppose will bring much
Force against us; therefore we
must prepare before hand, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what we will do when it
comes to the push, and bear the
Crosses which we may meet, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48223:58"/>
follow Christ notwithstanding any
inconvenience which may happen
to us for so doing. He which
frames his Resolution so, will not
be surprised, <hi>i. e.</hi> have his heart
infeebled with sudden Assaults; he
foresaw what would come: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will he be weakned by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
he prepared himself for the
Incounter before hand. The wise
Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> understood this well
when he said, <hi>My son, if thon comest
to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for
tentation;</hi> which must be done by
planting a firm Resolution of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
in the bottom of our
hearts. Our Saviour hath given
the reason of this in the Parable of
the Sower, where he tells us of
many that may receive the Seed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48223:59"/>
that is the Doctrine of his Gospel,
into their hearts with joy, and it
may seem to grow and flourish in
their life, and yet it shall wither
in the time of Tentation, because
<hi>it wanted root,</hi> had not <hi>depth of earth
and moisture,</hi> as the Evangelists
phrase it differently, but meaning
the same thing, <hi>i. e.</hi> a well fixed
Resolution will maintain future O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as Corn is nourished
and supported by sufficiency of
moysture, which it receives from
a sound root fixed deep in a moist
ground, and by that inabled to
bring its fruit to perfection.</p>
                     <p>The Hypocrite and sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
considered together in this
matter, seem to me to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by <hi>Orphanah</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:48223:59"/>
when they began a Journey with
<hi>Naomi</hi> their Mother in Law, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that they would accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
her from the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> to
her own Country—They both set
out with great forwardness;<note place="margin">Ruth 1. 10.</note> but
when <hi>Naomi</hi> told them what small
expectation of worldly advantage
they could have in her, <hi>Orphanah</hi>'s
love began to vanish, and extended
only a farewell kiss;<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> but <hi>Ruth</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard the worst of it, would
not be so shaken off—I perceive
how it is, but my Resolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
firm for all that,—<hi>whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou goest I will go; and nothing
but death shall part thee and me.</hi> So
the true Christian to our Saviour,
I will follow thee, O Lamb of God,
wherever thou goest: I do not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48223:60"/>
with thee for small way and
fair weather; nothing but death,
no nor death it self shall part thee
and me: As thy love to me, O
Jesus, was stronger than death, so
shall mine be to thee. Neither
things present nor things to come,
nor life nor death could separate
St. <hi>Paul</hi> from the Love of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Thus a Christian doth become
stedfastly minded, or as in the
Hebrew, strengthens himself in
his Resolution, exhorting himself,
as the Apostle did the <hi>Antiochians,</hi>
to <hi>cleave to God with purpose of heart.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 11. 23.</note>
He did not make them believe that
they should not suffer much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
if they did so: No; for
he told them, as others, that they
must <hi>through many Tribulations enter
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48223:60"/>
into the Kingdom of God,</hi> but that
they should resolve <hi>to suffer hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as good Souldiers of Iesus Christ,</hi>
as he told <hi>Timothy,</hi> and gave him
for a pattern his own purpose, with
which he was well acquainted,
which was to serve Christ his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
though he knew how many
and how great Afflictions awaited
him continually in all places for so
doing.</p>
                     <p>If any say, It is necessary to
form a strong Resolution; but will
such thoughts as those do it? will
the fore-consideration of mischiefs
prepare us against them? Men by
foreseeing evils that may happen,
do excite themselves to take care
to avoid them by steering a Course
contrary to that which may lead
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48223:61"/>
upon them. To this I answer, That
considering before hand what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
may happen to us in
a matter undertaken upon weighty
Reasons, will make them hurt us
less when we meet them: but that
is not all which I meant as to this
Method of forming our Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for that we must add the
strengthening of Faith in our souls,
that we may have a firm belief of
these things which the Gospel hath
propounded to encourage us to
undertake the Obedience of it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all discouragements,
and that is the great Reward which
shall be given to obedient Souls.
When our Saviour told such as
came to him, that possibly they
might <hi>lose Father, Mother, Lands, Life,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48223:61"/>
for his sake,</hi> it had been a very poor
Motive to make them embrace his
Doctrine if he had said no more;
but he added, that such as did so
should have <hi>an hundred fold more,</hi>
that is, more true satisfaction in
what they did, than they could
have had in any other way in this
life, and <hi>in the world to come life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,</hi>
or eternal happiness.</p>
                     <p>Now that he who purposes to
obey Christ's Gospel sincerely
must fortifie his Resolution with
the strength of Faith, is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by an Apostle who had
Experience in this matter:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 9, 10.</note> The
Devil was in the world like a
<hi>roaring Lyon, seeking whom he might
devour,</hi> and would, if he could, by
Persecution destroy Christianity,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48223:62"/>
                        <hi>whom resist, being stedfast in the Faith,
knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your Brethren who are
in the world.</hi> But <hi>the God of all
Grace,</hi> the most merciful God, who
hath called <hi>us to eternal Glory by
Christ Iesus, after you have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a while, make you perfect, stablish,
strengthen, settle you.</hi> By what? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Apostle tells us,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 5.</note> by the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>;
or as <hi>v. 7. sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in or by Faith,</hi> by which you
are fixed to your Saviour, as a Tree
is to a strong Root, or a House to
a deep Foundation, for he useth
both Metaphors. Our Saviour
hath made no new Methods since,
and therefore every sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
must make use of this in the
forming of his Resolution, and in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48223:62"/>
so doing he may say thus to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
—O my Soul, thou art now
setting upon a course of holy Life
according to the Precepts of thy
Saviour, be real and make thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
strong, saying with that holy
man, I have fully purposed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
no more, I will serve thee
with my whole soul from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of my heart; I make a Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of my self to thy will, and
bind my self by a firm Vow, the
strongest Bond I can find, that I
will keep thy Commandments; and
when the Enemy of my soul shall
tell me that thus I shall miss the
pleasure of sin, I will tell him, I
know it, and that they are but for
a season, and to be despised in
comparison of the favour of God,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48223:63"/>
and joy of doing what we should;
and when he adds that probably I
shall suffer in this way many
things not very pleasing to the
flesh, I will tell him, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are I reckon them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to be compared to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Obedience; and when he
frights me with the austerity of a
strict life, I will tell him, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things have difficulty, and
ask him, if he have not in his
Ramblings observed the careful
observances of a Wrestler or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
how punctually they keep
themselves to strict methods of
preparation for their Conflict, when
all that they hoped for was but a
Crown of fading Leaves; and is it
irrational for me to do all I can
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48223:63"/>
for an eternal Crown? When he
bids me look upon those multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of suffering Christians, whom
Religion brought into mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in which they perished, I
will tell him that I will <hi>follow their
Faith, considering the end of their
Conversation,</hi> the happy close of
their holy Lives, which remov'd
them into the regions of endless
Bliss, and thither I will follow
them. And if he say, But he whom
you call Saviour was crucified.
Yes I will Answer, and died and
was buried, but he rose from the
dead, and ascended into Heaven,
and bade me follow him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I hope ere long to be with
him, I will keep in my way, which
will certainly bring me unto him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:48223:64"/>3. To these two we must add a
careful use of those means which
are appointed to make us such as
we are commanded to be; Christ
never intended his Gospel for idle
souls, <hi>i. e.</hi> such as will take no
pains to be saved, who will not
carefully endeavour to be made
good. They are not for Christ,
those delicate persons who cannot
endure to think of working out
their <hi>salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi>
nor will hear of giving dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to be found of God in peace.
Our Saviour hath told us expresly,
that he will condemn that Servant,<note place="margin">Luke 12. 47.</note>
who did not prepare himself to do
his Masters Will, either in the day
time being girt fit for any service,
and being ready with lighted Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48223:64"/>
to expect his Master when he
comes home at night.</p>
                     <p>A negligent Temper is odious
in this business.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Because it is trifling in a
matter of greatest Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</item>
                        <item>2. Because it is sordid, and
would serve the great and
good God with that which
costs it nothing.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. This Temper is far from
that which should be in a sincere
Christian, if it be liable to the said
Reproaches, as indeed it is. That
man whom sin hath made sick, and
will not carefully use the means
appointed for his recovery, either
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48223:65"/>
understands not his danger, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the method prescribed for
the cure of his Disease not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or will not be at the trouble
of undertaking such things as are
requisite to his recovery, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than do so, will remain in his
sin, that is, die of his sickness;
What prudent Physician would
meddle with such a Patient? It
may be the sick Hypocrite would
do some little things, when such as
are very great are necessary for his
health. This is well expressed in
that smart Letter which <hi>Diogenes</hi>
wrote to <hi>Dionysius,</hi> when some vain
Philosophers flattered him in his
great Vices: <hi>Alas! man,</hi> said
<hi>Diogenes, thy Diseases are such that
they need cuttings and burnings; but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48223:65"/>
thou hast got together a few Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers,
which say to thee as fond Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers
and Nurses do to sick Children,</hi>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
i. e. <hi>Take this my Child, pour it in,
if you love me do, a little more, eat
but this small bit.</hi> Triflers! The
Children are extream sick, and must
be made to take their Physick, or
die. The sincere Christian knows
that our necessitous condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a great care for the repair of
it; that the Gospel which we are
to obey is a Law of great Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and hath in it many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
requires obedience
in thought, temper, and action;
yes, and that with resistance of
many Temptations, strong, because
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48223:66"/>
agreeable to our natural Appetites,
which will mak our work to go on
sometimes like that of the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when he hales his Boat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Stream—And we shall
find hinderances from infirmity of
Flesh, and inconstancy of Spirit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
of our Senses and many
wild Phansies, besides the malice
of a watchful Devil. By this the
Penitent sees what need he hath of
great care in the use of all means,
which may carry him on in his
course; and he says, Since my
Saviour hath showed me the value
of my Soul, that it is of more worth
than the acquist of all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in the World for my whole
Life, and hath in great kindness
told me how I may save it, I will
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48223:66"/>
carefully keep to his methods,
knowing, that if I use not the means
given me for the avoiding of sin,
I shall be both guilty of the sin I
commit, and of negligence in not
endeavouring to prevent it, and so
draw upon my self foolishly a
double curse. He hath called me
to the heavenly Journey, and I
will undertake it. It is an easie
thing to take a Map and travel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a great part of the World by
the Eye; but he that will arrive
at a Country far distant from his
own, must go over many craggy
Hills, pass through many deep
ways, and cross rough Seas before
he can get thither; he that will
not begin his Journey except it be
made as easie to be performed, as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48223:67"/>
to be looked over in a Map, doth
plainly show that he did never
heartily, or else most foolishly,
design it. He which hath a Watch
in his Pocket may expect that it
should tell him the hours of the
Day, but not unless he skrew the
Spring to a just strength, and wind
it up at due seasons. God hath put
a Divine Principle like a Spring
of holy Life in our Souls, and it
will show its force in us by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
us feel in our selves a strong
propension to God, and an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to all goodness; but we must
wind it up daily, and strengthen
it with such Meditations and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as may keep it in vigor. Of
what life is a Watch, when the
Spring is spoiled or unbent? Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48223:67"/>
Grace is like sparks of Fire
hid in the Soul, but we must blow
them up, as the Apostles word is
(<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) the Fire will go
out,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 6.</note> which is not maintained with
proper fewel, and the Spirit may
be quenched.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 19.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The forementioned Temper
is rejected by the sincere Christian;
because it is sordid, and would
serve the great and good God with
that which costs little or nothing.
He that would do as little as he can
in Gods service, hath but mean
thoughts of that great God with
whom he hath to do, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not the greatness of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
which God hath in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
goodness promised to such as
serve him sincerely; or is so base,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48223:68"/>
that however he will do no more
than pleaseth himself in point of
Obedience. If this Christian had
been a Jew, you should have seen
him go to his Fold, and there
seek up and down till he had found
out a sheep, either lame, or such
as had but one eye, if none were
quite blind, and that he would
have gone and offered for a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
but God did then, and doth
still abhor that vile Temper. It's
true, God is so good, that in some
cases he doth <hi>accept the Will for the
Deed,</hi> when it is impossible to be
performed: but when the Case is
otherwise, we shall forfeit our
sincerity, and for not preparing
our selves to do our Master's Will
be beaten with many stripes. God
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48223:68"/>
is so gracious, that he hath mercy
upon our Ignorance, and pities
our invincible infirmities, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives
that sin which we could not
possibly or probably avoid, and
he helps our weaknesses: but still
requires that we should always
stand upon our guard, watch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
against surprises, as well as
abhor voluntary Transgression, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
and endeavouring nothing
so much as to please God; and so
much the rather, because we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Master whom vve
serve is so gracious, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accepts
vvhat vve have done hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
and sincerely, though it vvas
not the most vve could have done,
nor done in the best manner that
possibly vve could.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48223:69"/>4. Sincerity also supposeth that
vvhich Christ vvill require in
every true Disciple of his, a good
attainment, a competent profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in the state of Vertue. It
vvere a mean business, if the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Christian Religion should
be contracted into a few cold
Wishes, and the attainment of its
Professors, should not exceed the
faint <hi>Wouldings</hi> of Hypocrites; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
since the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is the most Noble in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and vvorks vvith the highest
Principles, and yet improve the
progress of its Disciples but into
such a motion as a Door hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Hinges, and so leave them
in the sad condition of those Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
vvhom the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48223:69"/>
                        <hi>who were always learning,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 7.</note>
but never came to the knowledge of
the Truth;</hi> vvho vvere alvvays
learning, came to those places
vvhere the Gospel vvas taught, but
vvere never able to come to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
the Truth of it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
What vvas the Reason?
Because they gave heed to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Doctrine of some seducing
Teachers, and so nourished their
Hypocrisie in Errour; but if they
had received the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
in the love of it, and resign'd
themselves to the government of it
vvith sincerity, it would have made
them another kind of people. For
this hear our Saviour—<hi>You shall
know the Truth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 8 32</note> 
                        <hi>and the Truth shall
make you free</hi>—If you receive my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48223:70"/>
Gospel vvith sincere Faith, it vvill
shovv it self in its effects upon you,
it vvill make you free. From
vvhat? from the slavery of sin,
from all habitual sin, and also from
the acts of gross sins, every one of
vvhich is damnable; which, as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> said, a Child of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do, or must cease to be the
Child of God if he do them, as
Murder, Adultery, Perjury, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
&amp;c. And if the true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
have been formerly given to
any sin, he vvill forsake that too:
So <hi>David, I kept me from mine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 18. 23.</note>
yes, vvhen he had repented;
and if he had not, he could not
have had any testimony of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The attainment of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Christian is to have goodness
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48223:70"/>
habitual to the soul, to be pleased
vvith doing his Duty. For this
see 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 3. This is the love of
God, that we keep his Commandments,
and his Commandments are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.
For whosoever is born of God
overcometh the World; and this is
the victory that overcometh the World,
even our Faith.</hi> The sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
shovvs his Love in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and not only so, but delights
to do his Duty. God's <hi>Commands
are not grievous, i. e.</hi> as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
said before, <hi>his yoke is easie,
and his burden is light;</hi> and being
born of God, he overcometh the
World by the Spirit of Faith
vvhich is in him, vvhich is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Spirit that is in the
World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:48223:71"/>This our Saviour expects, as
vve see in the promise vvhich he
made after his Ascension <hi>to him
that overcometh:</hi> not to him vvhich
fights only; no, but <hi>to him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh;</hi>
and this he might vvell
do, because he gave povver not
only to <hi>fight,</hi> but to <hi>overcome;</hi> and
said long before, that <hi>to whom much
is given, of them more shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi>
that is, such improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as may ansvver the bestovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>When our Saviour compared
himself to a Vine, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the Branches of it, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that he gave them sufficient
vital Juyce for the purpose,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 8.</note> he told
them that they vvere to <hi>glorifie
his Father by bringing forth much
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48223:71"/>
fruit,</hi> and then they should be, and
<hi>appear</hi> plainly <hi>to be his Disciples.</hi> By
which it is manifest, that our great
Shepherd would have his Flock to
be such Sheep as those which <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus</hi>
mentions, who were not to
bring their Hay and Grass and lay
it before their Shepherds, to let
them see how much they had eaten;
but having well digested their
Food, were to bring it forth in
Milk and Wool, and so to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themselves to him who sed
them. So sincere Christians are
not to declare what they are in
words or profession, much less in
vain ostentation, or to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
for what they are not; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
concocted our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in their souls, do as St.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48223:72"/>
                        <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Shew out of a good
conversation their works with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of wisdome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I think it not unfit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
every one, who would have
the Testimony of their Conscience
concerning their sincerity, that they
should take heed of excusing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to God, when they are not
such as they should be; no, though
they may seem to have some places
of Scripture on their side. And
for this I think it may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
to relate to you, what St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
told his Church at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
upon this occasion; he had
often reproved them for going to
the Heathen shows, which by their
immodesty were offensive to the
chaste, and also odious by their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48223:72"/>
cruel effusion of Humane blood;
After this some of his wandering
Sheep had gone to them again,
and when he still continued his
Reproof, they answered, That tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they did what they would not,
but thought that was no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
since St. <hi>Paul</hi> made the same
Defence for himself; and so they
were not more to be blamed than
he, since they disliked what they
did. This hypocritical pretext
put the holy man into a fit of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
Zeal, and he fell thus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; <hi>What,</hi> says he, <hi>do you
not only serve sin, but abuse the holy
Scripture? Do you satisfie your lusts,
and then reproach the honour of an
Apostle? I, I, every one that loves
to sin, desires to find out some excuse,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48223:73"/>
which might maintain his practise; and
now you fall foul upon an Apostle,
though I know it is not with an intent
to reproach him, but to make an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology
for your selves.</hi> Then that
they might not think that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
spake those words in that Chapter
of himself; but in the person of one
in conflict with sin, but at present
overcome by it, and being sensible
of his Danger, cries out, <hi>O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
man that I am, who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from this body of death?</hi> and
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself was not now
carnal, sold under sin, to obey
what it commanded; he adds,
<hi>Was St.</hi> Paul <hi>carnal, in whom Christ
lived, who was governed by the Holy
Ghost, who had Christ always speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him? &amp;c.</hi> To which one
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48223:73"/>
may very well add, What, was St.
<hi>Paul</hi> only a Servant of Christ's in
Notion of Mind, but not in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of Will, who had serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him faithfully so many years,
and suffered the loss of all things
for him, and was ready to do so
again? <hi>Whom the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Life had made free from the
Law of Sin and Death? who lived,
but no longer he, but Christ in him,</hi>
willing what he would in him, and
doing what he would by him; for
to him he had resign'd Soul and
Body? Strange! Is it the Art of
a true Christian to contrive how
he may evade his Duty instead of
doing it? Will any wise man build
the peace of his Conscience, and
lay the stress of his hopes upon
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48223:74"/>
Excuses? Can any man make us
believe that the chief of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
was so dull, as not to see a
difference between an Excuse and
an Aggravation? Doth any thing
aggravate a sin more than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it against ones conscience? Was
this the sincerity of an old Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the attainment of <hi>Paul</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
Had he but so learn'd Christ,
or taught him no better? To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself that he sinned, he did
what his Conscience told him he
should not have done? He hath
rejected this vile pretence as much
as can be in two places, where
he speaketh plainly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 1.</note>
                        <hi>I have lived in all good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to this day;</hi> i. e. according
to the Principles of Vertue,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48223:74"/>
which he had being a Jew; and
what, did he grow worse after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
No: for he saith, that
having received Christian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
he did then, as being more
obliged,<note place="margin">Acts 24. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>exercise himself always to
have a Conscience void of offence to
God and Man.</hi> It had been a brave
Defence (had it not?) for the
Primitive Christians to have told
the Heathens according to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
that they desired to
be better than they, but were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as bad; especially since they
had received in their Regeneration
a power, which enabled them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
those sins to which the
Heathens were slaves. For so the
same Apostle,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Walk in the Spirit,
and you shall not fulfil the Lusts of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48223:75"/>
the Flesh.</hi> Not that he meant dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if they live in the Spirit, they
should not live in the Flesh; no,
but that, if you follow the conduct
of the Spirit, you will receive
those assistances from it, which
shall enable you to overcome those
Tentations which Hypocrites pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
as the only Excuses, why they
live after the Flesh. But these as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances
must be made use of. A
man may be overcome of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
not stronger than himself,
if he will not use the Arms which
he hath to defend himself. It is
promised that <hi>if we resist the Devil,
he shall fly from us</hi>—But can any
man think that if he do not resist
the Devil, he will fly from him?
or that his yielding to the Devil
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48223:75"/>
will be any excuse to him when he
is overcome, and made his Slave,
when he did not resist him?</p>
                     <p>To close this; since foolish
Excuses are useless in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
let every sincere Christian
say to himself—O my soul, it is
time for thee to know what thou
hast attained in Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to seek a proof of Christ dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in thee, and to find a good
Evidence of true goodness. What
doth all that thou hast done amount
to? Dost thou find in thy self a
thankfulness which is in some good
measure answerable to the goodness
of Christ's Love, and the many
Benefits which thou hast received
from him? Hast thou that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
towards him which is due to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48223:76"/>
the Dignity of his Person? Is thy
Temper conformable to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and thy Life to his holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?
Dost thou only please thy
self in the contemplation of Divine
Truths, and rest in the speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of heavenly things? dost thou
not also endeavour to find the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Gospel Motives working in
thy soul to the ends for which they
were propounded? Dost thou
carefully read the holy Gospel, that
thou mayest not be ignorant of, or
forget any part of thy Duty, and
then pray with hearty Devotion for
Grace to help thee to obey, and
then makest use of what is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that thou mayest receive more,
as need shall require? Dost thou
give thy self leave to make Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48223:76"/>
Excuses for Disobedience,
and pretending that Christ is made
Righteousness to us, thinkest that
thou mayest indulge some sin in
thy self? or rather abhorring that
falsness, doest thou endeavour to
give Testimony of thy Love to
Christ's Person, by obeying his
Commands, and seekest Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
with God only upon the
terms which he hath appointed?
Dost thou find that as the first
purposes of thy soul were to obey,
so the habitual inclination of thy
mind doth propound still the same
way, and that the constant work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and daily motions of thy soul
are all set for the accomplishment
of thy holy purposes? The good
man, who finds that it is thus with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48223:77"/>
him, will be conscious to himself
of his sincerity to God; the inward
sense and feeling of his soul will
tell him, that his Conversion is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere:
as a man knows himself to
be an honest man, who endeavours
in all his actions to keep himself
close to the Rules of good Life.</p>
                     <p>5. To what hath been said I
need ad no more, but that the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Christian makes a daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
towards the perfection of
degrees, <hi>goes on to perfection,</hi> as the
Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> said. The
sincere Christian doth not make it
his work vainly to compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with others, whose defects he
thinks he hath espied, and please
himself in what he hath attained,
because they are not so good; but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48223:77"/>
humbly desires by daily endeavors
to grow better than himself, and to
bring the sincerity of his estate
nearer to the perfection of Degrees.
He is mindful of the advice given,
<hi>to grow in grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> He
grows in knowledge, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
his way to God better and
better; for <hi>the light of the Righteous
shines more and more to perfect day.</hi>
The Traveller that understands
his way pretty well, having a
great Journey to go, riseth it may
be by Moon-light, or takes the
first dawnings of the Morning for
his Guidance; but as the day comes
on, he grows more assur'd by the
clear light. But he grows in
Grace too, <hi>i. e.</hi> he is bettered in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48223:78"/>
soul, and does his Duty to God
better, and rides on more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and with more speed, as the
Traveller doth when he hath more
light to assure him of his way.</p>

to go to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that
there they might enjoy the presence

they envied the Happiness of Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows

had leave to make their nests there;
but more admired the felicity of
God's Servants who dwelt in that

who set and prepared their minds,
resolving to be there, and passing
from Valley to Valley (for the

by the common accidents of this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48223:80"/>
life he may be so hindred that he
shall slack his pace awhile, and by
the slumbers of the Night necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to refresh his wearied Body, his
more active thoughts are laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep;
yet the very Night passing
on with silent Minutes carries him,
as a ship under sail doth the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
sleeping in his Cabbin,
nearer to his Port, and when he is
awake, perceiving that he is still
in his way, he goes on rejoycing,
and makes what haste he can to
come to his Journeys end, the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of God in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Having shown the Nature of
Repentance, I come now to urge
the Practise of it with three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
which are these,
<list>
                           <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48223:80"/>
                           <item>1. The first is taken from the
reasonableness of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</item>
                           <item>2. The second is that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
which we
have to it from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, who is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to forgive the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</item>
                           <item>3. The third is taken from
the great and inevitable
Mischief which awaites
Impenitence.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. It is fit that sinners should
repent, because sin is the most
unnatural thing in the World. The
state of sin is a contra-natural
Temper, and the actions in which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48223:81"/>
it expresseth it self, are most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.
When <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
was sent before our Saviour to
prepare his way, that is, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
men for the receiving of his
Gospel, which is called <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 17.
to make a people ready prepared
for the Lord, when he begun his
work, by <hi>turning the disobedient to
the wisdom of the just;</hi> he was said
<hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>to restore
all things;</hi> the word signifies <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere
in naturae congruentem statum,</hi>
to reduce men into a state agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Nature, which by sin was
discomposed. What can be more
unnatural, than for the hearts of
Fathers to be set against their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and for Children to hate
their Parents? Out of that unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48223:81"/>
course of sin he brought
them by Repentance into their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Station.</p>
                     <p>For the reason asoresaid, sin
in Scripture is called <hi>distraction of
mind;</hi> for when the Prodigal Son
made sensible of his Error re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his Duty,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 17.</note> he is said, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>to come to himself;</hi>
Sin had made him mad. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Isaiah</hi> gives notice of the same
thing, when he said,<note place="margin">Isa. 46. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Shew your
selves men, return to your mind, ye
Transgressors.</hi> He that sins runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from God and his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
both at once. <hi>Resipiscentia,</hi> the
Latin word for Repentance, says
the same; for he that Repents doth,
as <hi>Lactantius</hi> says, <hi>Mentem quasi ab
insaniâ recipere.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48223:82"/>
second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 5.</note> calls it
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to awake one out
of a drunken sleep. Those who
slight the great Reasons of their
Duties to God, and leave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be hurried on in the
course of their lives by brutish
Appetites, act but like men who
are mad or drunk; and they will
confess it, if ever they do return
to a right use of their mind and
settled thoughts, which he hath
lost who thinks he may <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do</hi>
what he will. Nothing but want
of Reason will make any man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the loose Wit of a mad man,
and the wild motions of a Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
before the wise thoughts and
regular actions of sober men. He
which sins tears all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48223:82"/>
by which God hath engaged
him to Obedience, breaks all the
Bonds which his Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
hath laid upon his Soul, as the
Frantick in the Gospel did those
which were upon his Body; but
he hath another sense of things,
and will not do so, when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to a right mind.</p>
                     <p>It's true, it did not please God
at first to make us immutable, yet
that we might not fall into Error
by sudden Actions, he made us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to deliberate; and since we
do nothing so well usually but it
may be bettered, and do many
things so ill that they ought to be
mended, he gave us the power of
Animadversion, that by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon our selves and actions,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48223:83"/>
we might correct by after endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
that which was not so well
done at first; and it is most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
that we should make use
of this power, and fit for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
to say, It was best indeed
not to have sinned, but it is next

which signifies a going astray. He
must needs be out of his way, who
by sin is departed from the God of

take up, as the Apostles advice is,
<hi>Repentance towards God; i. e.</hi> he

We have been told, and that truly,
that <gap reason="foreign">

that a man doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

if we have by sin gone astray from

most reasonable, as his words are,

to repair the mischief
of our flight from above, from

                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48223:84"/>To show the reasonableness of
Repentance a little further, I shall
only add two things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That sin is the sickness,
deformity, and pain of
the soul.</item>
                        <item>2. That it is a bold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of that excellent
Order, which the Divine
Wisdom hath planted in
Humane Nature.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. Sin is the sickness, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and pain of the soul, and
is as destructive of its health, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and safety, as distempered
humours, defect in any Member,
solution of parts, or dislocation
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48223:85"/>
of a Joynt can be to the Body; and
if it be not timely cured, will be
the death of the Soul. Therefore
the recovery of a sinner is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Scripture by words which
signifie Restoring of health to a
sick Man, the cure of a wound,
the Reparation of a decayed or lost
Sense, the setting of a dislocated
Bone in the right place again, and
giving ease to one that is in pain.
And there is good Reason for it:
For is not an ignorant mind as bad
as a blind eye? A will disabled
to all virtuous choice worse than
a lame hand? And vile affections
more ugly than distorted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
An evil Conscience as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive
as a Cancer in the Breast?
Pining Envy as vexatious as the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48223:85"/>
gnawing of the Stomach? Are not
the Furies of Lust, and the Rage
of Drunkenness or Hellish Malice
as unnatural Distempers in the
Soul as Feverish heats in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
Is not the Soul as much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with thinking of the folly
of Surfeits, as the Body is afflicted
with the bad consequences of
them? Is not insatiable desire of
worldly Greatness, Riches, and
Pleasure, as bad as the Hydropick
Thirst?</p>
                     <p>A man would think himself in
a bad Condition, if he should find
himself deprived of Sense, deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any principal Member,
weakned in the powers of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
troubled with a deaf Ear, a
lame Hand, and gouty Feet, his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48223:86"/>
Blood inflamed, and feel himself
racked with the pain of the Stone;
he would have so little pleasure in
himself that he would hate life:
But he who is corrupted with sin
is in a worse condition, for he hath
neither beauty, health, or vigour
in his Soul. He is maimed in his
excellent Faculties, disabled to the
use of his best powers, and hath
defaced the beauty of his Soul,
which is Vertue. A good man
is pleased with himself, because
he feels that his soul is in health,
and that all his powers are in due
symmetry, and finds that in his
soul which should make a man in
love with himself. He perceives,
as <hi>Plato</hi> said, that he is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
or as his Scholar
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48223:86"/>
                        <hi>Plotin</hi> expressed it, <gap reason="foreign">

the Psalmists words, <hi>beautiful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>

it, with compleat vertue, which
is the highest participation of the
Divine Nature, by which we are
capable to imitate God, which we
then do when our souls are inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the sincere Love of God,
true Wisdom, venerable Prudence,
exact Justice, Godlike Benignity,
generous Courage, lovely Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
pure Chastity, discreet
Moderation, composed Passions;
and in short, when we have, as he
said, <gap reason="foreign">

honest Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
good Designs, prudent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48223:87"/>
Conversation, temperate Manners,
and indeed all the Actions and
Dispositions of Vertue.</p>
                     <p>These are the fair Delineations
of the Divine Image, and finding
those in his soul, a good man is
pleased with himself, and desires
to be as he is.</p>
                     <p>But these beautiful Characters
of Immortal Spirits are all defac'd
by wickedness; and after they are
blurr'd, whensoever the sinner is
forc'd to hold a Looking-glass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his soul, he throws it away,
because he cannot endure to see
himself. <hi>Aristotle</hi> said well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

A bad man hath no love

nothing in himself that is worthy

now nothing to rejoyce in. And
writing upon that Verse in <hi>Genesis,</hi>
that after man had perverted his

the Earth brought forth for his

he, and so did his heart too, it
could not do otherwise, adding
these words, <gap reason="foreign">

such passions as do prick and

                     <p>Besides that which I have said
upon this matter, I must add one
particular mischief, and that no
small one, which will always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb

an <hi>evil Conscience,</hi> a Serpent in the

                     <p>But when respect is had to
God, which it must and will have,
for it is his Deputy, the case is
much worse; for it will torment
the sinner, both with the sense of
his Disfavour, under which it puts
him at present, and with the fear
of that punishment which it makes
him expect in time to come. It is
a huge misery to be in such a state

as makes a man afraid. of God,

they might very well do so; for
is it not the destruction of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

him, to be deadned to a vital sense

sin is an insolent contempt of that

are better than their Bodies, and
that the Faculties of it do trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
those of the sensual Part; and
that the mind doth not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what is best, but hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
bestowed upon it to govern
the bodily Appetites, which being
inferiour in Nature, and needing
a Guide, ought to receive Law

                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:48223:93"/>The soul doth discover, being it
self taught of God, by its natural
light and super-added Revelation,
what is the happiness to which it was
made, the best good of which it is
capable, and shows the means by
which it may be attained, directs &amp;
assists in the use of them, propounds
rational Arguments to persuade to
use and persist in the use of them, &amp;
can baffle such Objections as are
raised, either by the homebred E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,

                     <p>The soul tells us what satisfaction
is allowable to the bodily appetites,

excess in the former, shows what
Moderation is, and the benefit of it,
and represents the mischief as well
as the sin of excess, &amp; threatens death
upon the eating of all forbidden
Fruit. Order is then observed, as it
ought to be, when all the Faculties
do obey this Superior, upon whom
God hath bestow'd power to discern
Freedom of choice, and authority

                     <p>Thus we are secure in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of God's Order, which if
we neglect, the mischief of our
disregard will soon appear in the
ill Consequences which attend it:
For God hath so framed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our Souls, and so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our most important Concerns,
that we can never break his Order
but we shall suffer for it. What
we neglect at present will meet us
in bad effects afterward. When

a Beast
with many Heads. It is bad enough
to contest with one Beast; but it is
much more hazardous, when a man
must scuffle with many. To this
dangerous Combat a sinner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
himself: When he hath
parted with his Reason, he hath
subjected his mind to the command
of every insulting Appetite, and
must comply with every foolish
Phansie: Being made the slave of
sin, he must, as the Apostle says,
serve divers Lusts, and so must
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48223:98"/>
needs be in a brave condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Arbitrary Command
not of one Tyrannical Patron, but
many, having indeed as many
Lords as Lusts; and how basely
they use their vitious slaves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding

feel to their grief, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
disturbance which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from them; being sometimes
more then half drowned with Wine,
sometimes set on fire with Wrath,
at other times swelled till they are
ready to break with Pride, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thrown into all dirty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant that some
hardned sinners say, That they feel
not the pains of sin which are so
talked of, neither are they much
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48223:98"/>
concerned, though they break that
precise order which is forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned:
They are well pleased with
the life of Sense, and are willing to
go as their Appetites lead them;
they esteem that order good enough
which some call Hurry; though
they be censured, yet they think
themselves well paid for what they
do with sleshly Divertisements;
and whatever Divines or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
say to the contrary, they see
no cause to repent of their
course.</p>
                     <p>To these men I shall only say
two things;</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That it is no sign of health
in a man to want feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48223:99"/>2. That there are Monsters
in the World, but no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
can be made from
them against Nature.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. It is no sign of health in a
man to want feeling. Is a man
to be acounted well, because he is
in an Apoplexie, and so not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of what you say or do to him?
Doth any man reckon it a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his body to want feeling or
any other sense? The soul hath its
Apoplexie too. A man may so
debauch his Nature with vitious
practises, that at last he shall be
past feeling, and commit all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with greediness, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith. He sins, and pleaseth
himself that he feels no remorse;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48223:99"/>
Is glad that he is listed in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a whining Penitent? No, he
is one of the <hi>Fortes Esprites:</hi> He
makes a mock of sin. Tell him
of Repentance? tell them that are
weary of their lives, he is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
Let the sick send for the
Physician out of his Bed: He may
sleep long enough for him, he needs
him not. Its ridiculous talk to
speak to him of a spiritual Guide,
he can govern himself.</p>
                     <p>This seems to be well; but the
Friends of a sick person are much
troubled, when they perceive that
he is not sensible of pain or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and they take it for a sign of
approaching death; neither do
they entertain any hope of life, till
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48223:100"/>
they have brought him to a sense of
his sickness &amp; weakness. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tells us of a <hi>seared Conscience,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim 4. 2</note> &amp;
of such whose minds are darkned,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18, 19.</note>
and of a reprobate mind, an undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
soul, and of a hardned heart
as callous as a Labourer's hand, and
of a heart waxen gross, that is, a
soul which hath no more sense of
God, than the fat heart of an Ox,
which in other places is called the
<hi>spirit of slumber;</hi> nothing can awake
such a person to mind his most
important concerns. A wicked life
benums a sinner, and we are no
more to regard his judgment of
things, than what a blind man says
of colours. A reprobate mind is
that sad punishment which God
doth often inflict upon wilful sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48223:100"/>
Since we know this, we
need not wonder that they do not
repent, though their Condition be
most dangerous; for they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it not.</p>
                     <p>2. There are Monsters in the
World, but no Argument can be
taken from them against Nature.
Will any body say that all should
be as they are? Shall Error be
set for a Rule? If one be born
deformed, or wanting some of
those integral parts which make up
a Body, would any that is in his
Wits be willing to be conform'd
to that unnatural Idea? If a man
had a Child born defective in any
Limb, blind, lame, or any way
mishapen; would he not think it
a great favour, if it might be
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48223:101"/>
granted to him, to have this Child
born again in a handsom form, and
restored to a beautiful proportion?
Wise men have ever thought, that
it is a greater monstrosity to be
mishapen in Soul;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 9</note> the Mind cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22</note>
the Affections corrupted

Nature.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> The Holy Scripture doth
very justly call this a Corruption
of Human Nature; for every thing
deserves that name, when it hath
lost that power which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Excellency of its Nature, and
by which it is fitted to its End.
This Degeneracy is so great, that
the Holy Scripture saith, Men are
degraded by it into the condition
of brute Beasts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. and in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48223:101"/>
other places. The Philosophers
saw it by the Light of Nature, and
have spoken more highly in the
case:<note place="margin">Arrian. l. 1. c. 3.</note>

more wretched and
abject, a man depraved with sin is
that. The Poets meant the same
when they spoke of the Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of <hi>Vlysses</hi> his Companions,
who by Debauchery were turned
into Swine, grunting in <hi>Circe</hi>'s
Prison, and there thrusting out
their Snouts through the Grates in
which they were kept Slaves. So
monstrous is the state of the Soul,
when it is made to truckle under
every ungoverned Passion.</p>

                     <head>Second Motive.</head>
                     <p>This is enough to have shown
the reasonableness of Repentance;
and I might now add the danger
which a sinner incurs by Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
for he makes himself li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that Vengeance, which God
will take for the contempt of his
Orders. But before I speak of
that, I shall discourse of my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Motive to Repentance, which
is taken from the Goodness of God
who is willing to forgive the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
sinner; and that is so great
an Encouragement to this Duty,
that the Apostle says <hi>it leads us to
Repentance.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> That it doth so, will
be seen plainly in the Account
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48223:102"/>
which I shall give of it in six Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p>1. The first Encouragement
is that Declaration which God
hath made concerning his own
Nature, that it is not implacable;
but that he is willing to forgive
those who have sinned, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of their sins. This Goodness
of the Divine Nature God made
to pass before <hi>Moses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 34, 5, 6.</note> when he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to see the the glory of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
when God proclaimed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be <hi>the Lord, the Lord God,
merciful and gracious, long suffering,
and abundant in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
iniquity transgression and sin.</hi>
This glorious Name was given, as
that by which God was willing to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48223:103"/>
be known to the World; and it
doth give us notice of that which
doth most concern us to know of
the Deity.</p>
                     <p>God by his Royal Prerogative
hath power to forgive, if he please.
By right of Creation he is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Rector of the World. He
who made all things, must need
have authority to give them Law;
it is fit that all Creatures should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
him who gave them their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
As he hath power to give
Law; so also to threaten in case of
Disobedience, and so he only is
<hi>Dominus poenarum:</hi> the punishment
of sin is solely at his appointment;
for whatsoever mischief sin may do
in the Consequences of it to others,
it is his Law which is violated by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48223:103"/>
it, it is his Authority which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted.</p>
                     <p>But as God hath only right to
punish; so, if he please, it is his
Prerogative not to punish. His
Threatnings are Conditional, and
so in themselves capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation.
He may depart from
his Right, if he will, and forgive
us what we are not able to pay.
He may pass by those wrongs for
which we can never make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends,
as indeed we cannot for
one Sin; For, as <hi>Daniel</hi> said, <hi>To
the Lord our God belong Mercies and
Forgiveness,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>though we have rebelled
against him.</hi> As it his Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
that he can forgive; so it
is his Divine Benignity, that he is
willing to do it. The goodness
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48223:104"/>
of God, for which we constantly
adore him, is a voluntary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of the Divine Nature to
do good to his Creatures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their several Capacities;
and he hath a particular Love to
Mankind, which makes him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to promote their Happiness;
and as sin is the only hindrance
of that, he hath declared his love
by his willingness to prevent the
mischievous effects of it by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.
Here the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth magnifie it self against
our wickedness, the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
finds a way to save the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
from the ruin of his own
Folly, and God's Justice shows
it self wise and good, not reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after that satisfaction which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48223:104"/>
cannot be had, to wit, not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the Offence be undone,
for that cannot be; nor yet seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the utmost which may be had,
which is, that the sinner be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed;
but is content with such
a Reparation as may be made of
the Divine Honour by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
by which sin is extirpated,
and the sinner saved.</p>
                     <p>I have spoken of this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
more largely, to fix a right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the temper of the Deity in
mens Souls. It is no small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to us that we know God is
not necessitated to execute his
Threatnings, and that he is of so
Benign a Nature, that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with his Right, rather
than ruin his Creatures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:48223:105"/>This is a mighty Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Repentance, and should
make every sinner say, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
did,<note place="margin">Micah. 7. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Who is a God like unto

passeth by the transgression of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of his Heritage? He retaineth
not his anger for ever, because he
delighteth in mercy.</hi> Art thou so
good, though I have been so bad?
I will rebel no more; I hope in

                     <p>We read that <hi>Benhadad</hi> and his
great Army invaded <hi>Israel;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Kings 20. 30.</note> and
when they were beaten, the very
Report that the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi>
were merciful, made them come
with Sackcloth upon their Loyns,
and Ropes about their Necks, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Pardon with all the signs of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48223:105"/>
Penitence and Submission. We are
told also in the Story of <hi>Augustus
Caesar,</hi> That there was one <hi>Corocot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
a <hi>Spanish</hi> Thief, so famous
for doing Mischief, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
promised Ten thousand <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterces</hi>
to him that should bring
him alive into his presence. Here
upon <hi>Corocotta</hi> fearing his danger
if he continued his Course, and
having heard of the generous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of <hi>Augustus,</hi> carried himself
to him. It could not be the hope
of the price set upon his head that
could make him do so; for what
pleasure can a man take in telling
money, when he is going to be
hanged? but the hope of Pardon,
which he obtained, and by the
Nobleness of <hi>Caesar,</hi> the money too.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48223:106"/>
Sure the Report which we have
heard of God,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 4.</note> that he <hi>is rich in
Mercy,</hi> should encourage us to
bring the Penitent Rebel into his
presence, and throw him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
before his Footstool. The
Throne is a Seat of Grace, and the
King who sits upon it is the Father
of Mercies. If we repent we may
come boldly, and have a good
hope to find favour.</p>
                     <p>Princes do invite rebellious
Subjects many times to lay down
their Arms by offering Acts of
Oblivion, and it usually prevails;
but however it may be the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as well as Clemency of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to offer pardon, because they
know no better way to overcome
sturdy Rebels: But the Argument
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48223:106"/>
is more cogent to make sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
when God offers pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is Almighty, &amp; so needs no
Arts to reduce the Obstinate; he
can destroy them when he pleaseth;
what he offers is mere Grace; he
would not have them perish
through their foolish wilfulness:
would he not? O then, Rebel
Heart, wilt thou not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
as <hi>Clem. Alexandr.</hi> Says,
wilt thou not run away from thy
disobedient Party? If thou hadst
been shut up in Despair, as the
Devils are, imprison'd and made
to know that thou wert reserved in
Chains without hope, till the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the great Day, thou
mightest have some colour for the
hardness of thy heart; but now,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48223:107"/>
when Grace is not denied, if thou
repentest not thou wilt have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say for thy self.</p>
                     <p>2. Especially since God hath
assured thee by an Oath, That he
<hi>delights not in the death of sinners,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 11.</note>
nor is pleased with the ruin of
such as have rebelled against him.
<hi>As I live, saith the Lord, I have no
pleasure in the death of the wicked,
but that the wicked turn from his way
and live.</hi> According to that of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 7.</note> He is <hi>not willing that any
should perish, but that all should
come to repentance:</hi> And that of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note> He <hi>would have all men to be
saved, and come to the knowledge of
the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's true, the Heathens painted
the Godhead after a wild sort, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48223:107"/>
their Pagods in dismal shapes
of grim Monsters, armed with
Claws and Teeth; Pictures not
unfit to represent those Devils
whom they worshipped. Who
having shown their Enmity to
God in making his Creatures Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
declared also their Malice
to Men, by making Cruelty a
great part of their Worship: not
only whilst they forced them to tear
their Skin with their Nails, and cut
their Flesh with Knives, as the
Worshippers of <hi>Baal</hi> did, of whom
wa read 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 28. and as other
Idolaters did, of whom we read in
Heathen Authors; but made them
<hi>sacrifice their Sons and Daughters to
Devils:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 106.</note> or as in the next Verse,
<hi>to the Idols of Canaan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 38.</note> in whom they
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48223:108"/>
were worshipped, and whose bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Rites they appointed: They
made their Children pass through
the Fire to <hi>Moloch;</hi> whether they
made them perish miserably in the
hollow breast of a burning Image,
or drew them so long between two
Fires that they died, the Cruelty
was so great, that they were fain to
stifle the sound of their dreadful
Shrieks with the noise of Drums.
This was the sense and practise of
the Eastern World; and the West
was not unlike to it, for to one I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
of <hi>America, Vitzliputsli,</hi> they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in some solemn Sacrifices
many thousands of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
flay'd alive, their breasts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cut open, and their warm hearts
taken out and presented to the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48223:108"/>
bloody Idol. How far our God
is from that temper, he hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
declared, since instead of
making us all dreadful Examples
of just Vengeance in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
he gave his own dear Son to
die for us.</p>
                     <p>That blessed Son was of the
same temper too, as you may see
in that part of his Story which is
recorded <hi>Luke.</hi> 18. 41. in which we
are told of his approach to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
not long before his death, where
foreseeing that great Change, which
for their sins their then flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Estate should in a short time
suffer, it is said, <hi>he wept over it.
Wept over it?</hi> They had given him
cause to <hi>insult</hi> over them, they were
as bad as sinners could be. They
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48223:109"/>
had rejected him the Messiah, the
great promise of God to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who came to them according
to all the prefigurations and predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which were given to their
Fathers: they acknowledged Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to be a sufficient Testimony
of God's mind, and yet disbelieved
him who gave them that proof:
they scorned the Doctrine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Goodness which he taught, and
yet confessed, that <hi>never man spake
as he spake:</hi> they despised the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld
Example of all Vertues
which he gave in his life, and put
him to death who had done them
all the good he could whilst he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
—yet knowing that for these
things in a while they should be
punished with inexpressible Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48223:109"/>
the foresight made his tears
fall from his eyes; and to these he
added his blood, for he died for
those who killed him, and joyned
his Prayers to it for the pardon of
such as had made him as miserable
as they could. After this how
can any sinner be afraid of God, if
he repent?</p>
                     <p>3. The third Enconragement
is, That God hath by all manner
of Invitations called sinners to
Repentance. The Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with frequent Exhortations
to this Duty, and Declarations
of God's desire of mens Return;
sometimes it records his Expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
with the Obstinate, whom
he also beseecheth by his Servants,
and Sometimes bad them in his
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48223:110"/>
Name to command sinners to save
themselves this way.</p>
                     <p>Exhortations we find often in
the Sermons of the Prophets, whom
he sent of old, rising early, and
sitting up late, to warn sinners of
their danger,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> and charged the
blood of such as perished upon
them, if they did not do it. This
was the first Sermon of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Forerunner,<note place="margin">Mark 1.</note> and his own,
<hi>Repent, and believe the Gospel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How desirous God was always
of this in his Creatures, these, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many other Expressions, give
witness—<hi>Oh that there were such an
heart in them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>that they would fear me,
that it might be well with them! O

                        <note place="margin">32. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>that they would

                        <note place="margin">Psal. 81. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>O that my people had
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48223:110"/>
hearkened to me!</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 19. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>O that thou hadst
known in this thy day the things which
belong unto thy peace!</hi> He expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
with them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>Why will ye die?</hi>
and by his Servants beseecheth
them—<hi>We are Ambassadours for
Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> as though God did beseech
you by us, <hi>We pray you in Christ's
stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> And
he commands <hi>all men every where
to repent.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 17. 30.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. To perfect this Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he hath assured pardon to
the Penitent by many plain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
in which God's goodness
is obliged by his Truth; which
being made, the Apostle said well,
that now, <hi>God is faithful and just to
forgive sinners.</hi> The Benignity of
the Divine Nature is a good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48223:111"/>
but when that hath
declared it self in particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
ensured by God's Veracity,
we have firm grounds of Hope,
plain measures of Expectation, and
he which doth not give credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, <hi>makes God a lyar,</hi> as St.
<hi>Iohn</hi> says; puts the same contempt
upon God which men do upon the
words of vain persons, who never
mean what they say, or are unable
to perform what they promise.
Without this Revelation a Heathen
could say,<note place="margin">Petron.</note> 
                        <hi>Qui desperat Deum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperat,
nec bonum credit,</hi> i. e. He
which despairs makes God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and doth not believe him to
be good. After all this wilt thou
not repent?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:48223:111"/>5. Especially when God hath
given a mighty Demonstration of
his full purpose to fulfil what he
hath promised to penitent sinners,
not only declaring these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
by his dear son, but by
making him</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. A Sacrifice of Expiation
for sinners in his Death,
and</item>
                        <item>2. Also an Advocate for
them since his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. God hath made him a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Expiation in his Death.
An Expiatory Sacrifice is when
one suffers for another, and so saves
the other from suffering; when
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48223:112"/>
Body is given for Body, Life for
Life. Such was our Saviour's
Passion for sinners: And therefore
the Apostle said,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>He gave himself
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
a ransom
for all men;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 20. 28.</note> Or as our Saviour said
himself, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a Ransom for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
He gave his Life as such a
price, by which Captives or Slaves
are set at Liberty; and therefore
he is said to have <hi>redeemed us from
the Curse,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>being made a Curse for us:</hi>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, He bought us off with
a great price from the Curse due
to our sins, being himself content
to be used for our sakes as one
who is accursed. What worse
things could happen to any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
man, than those which Christ
suffered? His Death was esteemed
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48223:112"/>
by all men as the most infamous
and most painful, and was looked
upon by the Eternal Father as the
common Penance of Mankind, for
whom he suffered it.</p>
                     <p>Thus our Saviour became our' <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>gave his life for ours;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 7.</note> and we
have (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>Redemption
through his blood, the forgiveness of our
sins;</hi> Yes, <hi>through his blood:</hi> For he
nail'd our Bond to his Cross,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 12.</note> and so
cancel'd it, and freed us from our
Debt. Thus hath God been willing
to let us know, how unwilling he is
to punish us if we repent. Though
it be of the nature of punishment
that it be inflicted for sin, yet it is
not necessary that it should be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the person offending, if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
will accept of another to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48223:113"/>
suffer for him, and so free him.
This is our Case; for God was
pleased to accept of the Temporal
Death of his dear Son, to free all
penitent sinners from Death Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                     <p>2. I need not prosecute this
comfortable Argument any further;
God hath by it abundantly signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his mind to relieve trembling
sinners, having made his Son a
Propitiation for them in his Death,
and declared also that he is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
for them since his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 1.</note>
                        <hi>If any man sin, we have
an Advocate with the Father.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
in this place signifies one
who deprecates Anger, mitigates
Wrath, begs pardon for such as
have offended. The Design of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48223:113"/>
the Gospel is to preserve us from
sin; but if one chance to fall into
sin, left he sin also into Despair,
it gives this encouragement to rise
by Repentance, because we have
an Advocate with the Father, the
Son of God, who intercedes for
us, pleads our cause in Heaven.
This Encouragement is great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many accounts;</p>
                     <p>1. Because long before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
he was designed to that
merciful Office by the Eternal
Father:<note place="margin">Is. 53. 12.</note> So we read in <hi>Isaiah</hi>
(which the Evangelist <hi>Mark</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to our Saviour) <hi>He shall
make Intercession for Transgressors,</hi>
deprecate the Divine Anger for
them, appear in the presence of
God for them. It is a great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48223:114"/>
to all thoughtful minds,
that they are assured of the truth of
his Commission: We are ignorant
upon what grounds some have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
this part of his Mediation
upon Saints or Angels. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath told us that <hi>Abraham
knows us not,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Is. 63. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>and that Israel is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of us, and that no man taketh
to him the honour of mediating for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with God, but he that is called
of God.</hi> But we have great hope
in this one Mediator,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> because God
hath given him the honour to stand
at his Right Hand, and plead for
sinners. He is the great <hi>Angelus
Orationis,</hi> as I think <hi>Tertullian</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him; who, when the prayers
of Saints goes up to Heaven, puts
in his Merits to make them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48223:114"/>
As for others, alas, poor
Souls! they have no merits to make
their own Prayers sweet, and how
then shall they perfume those of
others?</p>
                     <p>2. This our Advocate was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and is the most beloved Son
of God. He dwelt eternally in
the Bosom of the Father; a phrase
which signifies Intimacy and Love.
He is one to whom the Father ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
denied any thing: so he said
himself, <hi>I know that thou hearest me
always.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. It is a great Encouragement
that we have such an Advocate,
who by his Death merited a just
Right to intercede with God for
sinners. He might well pray for
pardon, who offered himself a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48223:115"/>
Sacrifice of Expiation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Release of Captives for
whom he had paid the Ransom.</p>
                     <p>We are not to think that in
Heaven our Saviour prays for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
offering up cries with tears
for them; but intercedes with the
Authority of Mediation, which he
obtained by his Death. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the presence of God for
us, offering great Reasons for our
pardon.</p>
                     <p>4. To this add, that he hath,
whilst he doth this, strong desires
in himself to have us made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of it. We are told that he
is a merciful High Priest in things
pertaining to God; and that he is
willing to make Reconciliation for
us: not like the Masters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48223:115"/>
in this World, who many
times are so hard to come at, that
it is easier to get a Petition grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King, than presented by
his Servant. No; he is so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that he hath bid us come bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Throne of Grace,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> and to
be confident that we shall obtain
mercy, and find grace to help in
time of need; we may come <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
freely declare our case
to God, have free access to him for
that purpose, and we shall not be
turned away with shame,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 18.</note> as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are when their Petitions are
slighted.</p>
                     <p>This goodness of our Saviour's
Temper is an inward Advocate for
us, always dwelling in his Breast,
making him willing to receive the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48223:116"/>
Petitions which we offer to him,
and also to present them to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Father, and to add to them
what may make them acceptable.
He show'd his benign Disposition
before he left this World, in that
kind Excuse which he made for the
neglect of his Friends,<note place="margin">Matt. 26. 40, 41.</note> who failed
him in a time when he much need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Service. For though he
reproved them for their fault—
<hi>What? could you not watch with me
one hour in this my great Agony?</hi> yet
he mercifully both told them their
Danger, and how to avoid it, and
made some Excuse for them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>The Spirit is willing, but the
Flesh weak.</hi> Besides this, he plainly
showed his good Temper, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cross he deprecated the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48223:116"/>
Vengeance of the Eternal Father,
and prayed it might not fall upon
such as had sufficiently deserved
it. These Considerations do give
vast encouragement to sinners to
repent, since by them they see how
easily they may come to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                     <p>To which I shall only add one
more, which is, That God hath
declared himself highly pleased
when sinners do repent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of his pardon. For this take
our Saviour's word,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>I say unto you,
that there is great joy in the presence
of the Angels of God over one sinner
that repenteth.</hi> This our Saviour
further expresseth in the Parable of
the Prodigal, which follows in the
same Chapter; for when he came
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48223:117"/>
back from his vicious Course, it is
said there, that <hi>his Father, when
he was afar off, had compassion on him,
ran to meet him, fell on his Neck and
kissed him,</hi> that is, gave him all
signs of Reconciliation, &amp; expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all decent Joy for his Return,
in killing the <hi>fatted Calf</hi> to make
him a Feast, and adding Musick
and Dancing to make it pleasant.
Though these things are spoken
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> yet we think wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
and rightly of God, when by
such Expressions we understand
how acceptable our Repentance
is to him, and by that are moved
to repent.</p>
                     <p>And now upon the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Considerations, how can the
sinner but fall upon his knees, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48223:117"/>
say? O Lord, I am sensible of my
folly, I am pain'd with my guilt;
I am so obnoxious to thy wrath,
that if thou shouldst mark my sin
in order to punishment, I know I
should not be able to abide it;
but I <hi>see there is mercy with thee that
thou mayst be feared;</hi> thy <hi>goodness
leads me to Repentance,</hi> and I will
follow its gentle conduct, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to thee: And thus I make my
Prayer; O Lord, though I most
justly deserve to be condemned,
yet I beseech thee not to condemn
me. What profit is there in my
Blood? Behold, I offer thee for
my Ransom a better Life than my
own, that of thy dear Son: and
since thou didst commend thy
Love to mankind, that he should
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48223:118"/>
die for sinners; O grant me part
in that Love. Since thou wast
pleased to make to meet upon him
the Iniquities of us all, lay mine
upon him I beseech thee. It is
easier for thee to pardon my sins,
than to have given thy dear Son
to be a Sacrifice for them. He hath
more pleased thee by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
than I have grieved thee by
my Disobedience. The voice of
his Blood cries lowder for pardon,
than my sins for vengeance. Since
thy beloved Son died for our sins,
and rose again for our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
since thou hast reconciled me
to thee by his death, now much
more let me be saved by his
life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:48223:118"/>And, O blessed Jesus, since
thou didst not refuse to die for my
sins, I pray thee that I may not
die for them too. After thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
thou didst declare that
thou camest not to be ministred
unto, but to serve others, and (O
unexpressible kindness!) to give
thy life a Ransom for many; it is
sufficient for the sins of all the
World; leave not mine out I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, but let me be one of
the Redeemed made happy by thee,
because thou madest thy Soul an
Offering for their sins. Thou wast
pleased, among thy Titles of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to take this of a Saviour; and
as thou didst not then despise that
merciful Office, so neither art thou
yet weary of it; Save me, even
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48223:119"/>
me also, I pray thee, and say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Soul, that thou art my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
It is long ago that thou
didst call to thee all such as are
<hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> I am one of
those, O Lord, my sins ly heavy
upon me like a load of Sand, and
without thy help the Burden will
grow intolerable; I beseech thee,
according to thy gracious promise,
to take it off and give me ease, <hi>O
Lamb of God, who takest away the
sins of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou wast pleased in the days
of thy Flesh to pity the miseries of
sinners; Thy Compassion is not
withered; thy pity is not dried
up, it extends it self from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to Generation; thou shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
mercy to thousands, and savest
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48223:119"/>
to the utmost of all times all that
come unto God by thee: I come
unto the Eternal Father hoping
in thy mediation; save me I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee, O Prince of pity.</p>
                     <p>Thou didst command thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to preach Repentance and
Remision of sins in thy Name, and
didst pray for such as should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in thee through their Word;
I am one of those, most merciful
Jesus, let the benefit of thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
reach me also. Thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tookest
to make Intercession for
sinners, and didst beg their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease,
as well thou mightest, for
thou didst pay their Debt; O
pray for me also, most merciful
Advocate. When thou wentest
into thy Glory, thou didst not
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48223:120"/>
leave the Remembrance of poor
Souls behind thee, but didst let
them know before thy departure
hence, that thou wast going to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the presence of God for
them; remember me too now thou
art in thy Kingdom, O Lover of
Souls, who ever livest to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed to the last
Motive, lest the former should miss
their desired Effect, I will stay
here, and briefly answer two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
which without any just
ground some have made to their
own hinderance in this Affair.</p>
                     <p>1. One saith, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all which hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed concerning the goodnefs
of God, yet I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48223:120"/>
he intends any kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me in his Declarations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he may be some secret will
have debarred me from having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
benefit by them.</p>
                     <p>2. Another saith, It may be
God would pardon me if I did
repent; but what am I better for
that, since I find in my self no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to repent?</p>
                     <p>1. To the first; After all that
full Declaration which God hath
made of his goodness, dost thou
doubt his Reality? And though
he hath affirmed his readiness to
save, doft thou think that by some
hidden Will he hath resolved thy
Damnation? Let me then say to
thee, in the words of a late Divine
of this Church—<hi>O thou Hypocrite!
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48223:121"/>
because thou hast two wills, one in thy
Words, and another in thy mind, dost
thou think that God hath so too? that
he speaks one thing, and means ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
That he hath a secret will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to his revealed? If it be
secret, how camest thou to know it?
No; thou art wicked in making God
a lyar and dissembler like thy self,</hi>
So he. I will add, That such blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
words, without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
will be severely accounted
for one day; and that God will
reprove thee, and set this, among
thy other sins, in order before thee.
Leave of these vile Imaginations,
and never let it enter into thy
mind to think, that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
one thing to men in his
Word, and hath decreed another
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48223:121"/>
concerning them in himself. He
is the God of Truth; and therefore
repent, and trust in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                     <p>2. To the other, Who says
he would, but hath no power to
Repent, and so looks upon the
goodness of God in forgiving the
Penitent as not available to him,
I answer; That it is true, since
our fall we cannot return to God
by our own weak power; but
that is no Excuse for Impenitence,
because God is ready to supply
that Defect with the Assiistance of
his Grace.<note place="margin">Act. 5. 31.</note> God was pleased to
make his dear Son a Saviour to
give repentance and remission of
sins; not only to pardon sinners
upon their repentance, but to give
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48223:122"/>
them grace to enable them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and so obtain pardon. This
grace may be had for asking—
<hi>He will give his Holy Spirit to them
that ask him.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 11. 13.</note> It is the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of him who hath commanded
us to will and do what we ought,
to enable us to will and do what we
ought.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This assistance of the Divine
grace I shall express in St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine's</hi>

in this, that God hath
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48223:122"/>
given us a Law full of good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;
but because our Will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we cannot do good, is
helpt and erected by the Spirit of
grace bestowed upon us.</p>
                     <p>It is a great favour, that God
hath been pleased to give us his
Gospel, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
saving grace; It shows
the way of Salvation to us: by it
we are made to understand the
most important concerns of our
souls; that shows us the gracious
conditions of our pardon, and
lays before us strong Reasons to
convince us of the necessity of our
complyance with what God hath
propounded, if we will be happy,
and demonstrates the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Obedience. But God is
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48223:123"/>
pleased also to invigorate his Gospel
Methods with the gracious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his benign Spirit, which
makes a Divine Light shine into
the Mind, clears up the mist of
Ignorance which lay upon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and makes us know the things
which belong to our peace; awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
our Consciences, and makes
us apprehensive of the danger of
sin, and affrights us with the truth
of Divine Threatnings; makes us
consider heavenly Motives, opens
our hearts, as it did <hi>Lydia</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Act. 16. 14</note> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the things which are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to us, and inclines us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the reason of them; it
raiseth our wills out of sloth and
languor by a secret ardor of life
conveyed into our Souls, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="243" facs="tcp:48223:123"/>
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, by ways which God
knows, as St. <hi>Basil</hi> saith, and so
puts into our minds good Desires,
and makes us begin to feel in our
Souls a hunger after Righteousness;
it melts us with the Love of God
and his dear Son, makes us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to sin any more, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
us with the hope of Pardon
and Restoration to the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and so conjures us by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Arguments to enter into the
Bands of the Covenant, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
us to submit thankfully to
the terms of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>Thus our blessed Saviour stands
at the Door and knocks;<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 20.</note> thus the
heavenly Father draws us to his
Son:<note place="margin">Io. 6. 44.</note> and the sinner should say—
I find the gracious Spirit of God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48223:124"/>
leading me towards the Land of
the Living. I will resign my self
to his Conduct, I will be led by
him, I will <hi>follow the Lamb whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he goes.</hi> Doth my Saviour
vouchsafe to knock at my Door?
I am infinitely beholden to him,
I will open to him, I will let him
in, and give him the possession of
my Soul.</p>
                     <p>This is the Divine grace, and
it is our Duty to make a careful
use of it; and then we shall have
more to help us to perfect what is
well begun. A ready complyance
with such merciful Assistance is
highly requisite; for if we resist
God's kind Motions, and slight
the help bestowed, we may fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the design of his Mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48223:124"/>
our selves, and make that
grace ineffectual which would have
saved us, if we had improved it
with our concurrent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
                     <p>We must not expect that God
should pull us out of a state of sin,
and drag us into a state of vertue by
an irresistible force: God is pleased
in Conversion to draw us towards
himself by the Cords of a Man, by
such Arguments as we understand
to be most reasonable, and by such
Motives as are apt to perswade
such as will consider, and by the
gentle Swasions of his good Spirit,
with the Cords of Love, and the
Bands of Kindness. We must not
think that God should act upon us
to the extent of his Omnipotence,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48223:125"/>
but according to his Wisdom. He
knows what help is sufficient for us,
and how fit it is that we should
thankfully use what is enough,
without asking what is too much.
He takes what method he pleaseth
in the dispensing of his grace,
which we are not to appoint, but
obeserve. Our Duty is to accept
of sufficient grace, and use it, that
we may be converted, and not
teach God how to convert us.</p>
                     <p>God was always displeased with
men, when neglecting the kindness
which he showed them, they
would prescribe him methods for
the communication of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:48223:125"/>
When the Israelites were led
through the Wilderness,<note place="margin">Ps. 78. 41.</note> they were
well enough provided for by God's
care, and should have been not
only content, but thankful: they
were neither; but lothing the
Bread of Heaven, which God had
appointed for them, they would
have Quails. They had them;
but they had better have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them: for God was angry at
their rude unthankfulness—For
the limited the Holy One of <hi>Israel.</hi>
They would not only be provided
for, but in such a way as they
themselves should describe.</p>
                     <p>We have a very good account
of this matter in that excellent
Parable of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 5.</note> where God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Jewish people, whom he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48223:126"/>
calls his Vineyard, saith, That he
planted it in a fat Soyl, hedged it,
that is, guarded it with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
set a Vine which was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
gave them excellent Laws,
the teachings of inspired men, and
the assistances of his grace, and all
sufficient means to promote their
bringing forth Fruit answerable to
his Care: But after all, instead of
good Grapes, they brought forth
wild Grapes; God was displeased,
and for the Justice of his Anger he
appealed to the Judgment and
Conscience of those who had slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Favours, and said, What
could I have done more to my
Vineyard than I have done? I have
done what I thought fit for me to
do, and bestowed what I thought
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48223:126"/>
enough for them to receive, and
because they have made me no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Returns, I will take away
my Hedge, and lay them waste.</p>
                     <p>Now sinner, take heed what will
become of thee, and have a care
of Folly in pretending to teach
God what he might have done
more for thee, and bring forth
Fruits meet for Repentance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the grace bestowed.<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 18.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Fig-tree in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
which having no Fruit upon
it when our Saviour sought it, was
cursed and withered: And take St.
<hi>Chrysost.</hi> counsel concerning it; <hi>We
were beaten in this type, thou art frighted
in this tree, thou art instructed, to thee is
given wholsome Admonition; prevent the
coming of the Lord with good Fruits:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48223:127"/>
What God expects from thee let him
find, let him have what he desires, lest
what happened to this Tree from God,
happen to thee also. It is not fit for
sinners to dispute concerning grace, but
to make use of it, and repent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Of this they ought to be
more careful, because God doth
allow fair space of time to make use
of the grace bestowed; he repeats
his methods of Salvation, and
sometimes alters them, which is a
great demonstration of his benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and ought to move us effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
to make use of it. Though
the Divine Spirit will not always
strive with men, yet he continues
his merciful Contest a great while.
Though sinners be dull in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending,
and careless in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48223:127"/>
of grace offered; yet
God is not presently weary, but
waits to see if at last they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.<note place="margin">Wisd. 12. 20.</note>
It is mentioned as a
great Favour which God bestowed
upon the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that he did
not destroy them at once, though
they highly deserved it, but gave
them space for Repentance. <hi>Thou
didst punish the condemned with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
giving them time and place
whereby they might be delivered from</hi>
their malice. God is pleased to
lengthen the tranquility of sinners,
as <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, and so gives op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to make use of grace not
only offered, but for some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time slighted, that so they
might be saved, if they will yet
make use of his Favour before their
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48223:128"/>
hearts are quite hardened through
the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
                     <p>We read of the Jews in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,<note place="margin">Isa.</note>
that they vexed the Holy
Spirit with their Disobedience; yet
we read, that he bore with their ill
manners (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) 40 years,<note place="margin">Act. 13 18.</note>
and so gave them fair space to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of their Ingratitude, and so
save their Souls, though their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kases
fell in the Desart. After they
were come to <hi>Canaan</hi> he used the
same Patience,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 15, 16.</note> sending his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
rising up early and sending
them, because he had compassion
on his People—and this he did
till there was no remedy. This
same gentleness did our Saviour
use towards them in the days of
his Flesh, which made him say,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48223:128"/>
when his grace was slighted,<note place="margin">Luke 13. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>O Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
Ierusalem, how oft would I
have gathered thy Children together,
as a Hen doth gather her Brood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her Wings, and ye would not?</hi>
The same gracious patience doth
he express towards us still. How
oft hath God warned us by our
Spiritual Guides, and the Checks
of our own Consciences? How oft
hath he advised us by such, whose
known Prudence and great Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was most likely to have made
their counsel acceptable? How
mercifully hath he tim'd his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals,
taking such seasons in
which we were in a temper most
likely to be wrought upon, both
when our hearts were softned with
the sense of some merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48223:129"/>
and melted with kindness,
the sparks of Ingenuity being blown
up into a flame, or when sickness
or some great affliction had sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off our Carelesness, made us
see great reason to think, and
shown us necessity to hearken to
advice?</p>
                     <p>Shall not the forementioned
Assistances, granted with so much
patience, make the sinner say? O
Lord, I am that barren Fig-tree
to which thou mightest have said
long ago, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee:</hi>
(O heavy Curse!) How oft have
I given thee cause to say, <hi>Cut it
down, why cumbreth it the ground?</hi>
And when I have begged that thou
wouldst stay another year, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to dig about it, and did not;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48223:129"/>
O Lord, thou hast not cut me
down, but spared me one year,
and another, and another. I thank
thee, and now I will abuse thy
goodness no longer. I will dig
about it with prayers, sighs, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and watching; I will water it
with my tears, and endeavour that
it may bring forth fruit answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to thy just expectation. O
foolish Soul! Is it nothing to play
with Divine Patience, and to make
God stand by whilst thou enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainest
thy self with every trifling
Vanity? O merciful Lord, how
many years have I grieved thee in
this Wilderness? How long hast
thou born with my manners? How
oft have I given thee cause to say
to me as once thou didst, being
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48223:130"/>
neglected by thy sleepy Spouse,
who slumbred whilst thou stoodest
knocking, and made thee suffer
the Injuries of the weather,<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>My
Head is filled with Dew, and my
Locks with the Drops of the Night,
before thou couldst have admittance?</hi>
There are many besides the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darens,</hi>
who have turned thee out
of their Coasts by their rudeness;
O Lord, I am one of them, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it with shame. But, O blessed
Jesus, go not from me, though I
deserve it. Return according to
thy Infinite goodness; I will ever
watch, I will never permit the
Door of my Soul to be shut against
thee.</p>

and doest the same, that thou shalt
escape the Iudgment of God? Or
despisest thou the Riches of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and forbearance, and long
suffering, not knowing that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God leadeth thee to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
But after thy hardness and
impenitent heart, treasurest up to thy
self wrath against the day of
Wrath and Revelation of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48223:131"/>
righteous Iudgment of God.</p>
                     <p>The goodness of God, as I
have shown, leads the sinner to
Repentance, and so to Happiness
by Pardon. This goodness he
despiseth, and maintains in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the hardness of an impenitent
heart, a heart that will not relent.
But thinkest thou this, O man,
that so doing thou canst escape the
Judgment of God? No; thou
dost but treasure up wrath to thy
self against the day of Wrath.
Every sinner hath his measure for
Iniquity, and the Impenitent fills
it up; God also hath his Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
for Vengeance, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
sinner doth there lay up
wrath against himself. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
this is a hidden Treasure, but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48223:131"/>
it shall be opened in the day of
Wrath, when God will reveal the
Righteousness of his Judgment
upon such as would not repent.</p>
                     <p>God hath always declared this
to be the last state of obdurate
sinners;<note place="margin">Ps. 68. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>He will wound the head of
his Enemies, and the hairy Scalp of
such a one as goes on still in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</hi>
Long before this it was
said plainly by <hi>Moses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deu. 29. 19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>If it come
to pass, when he heareth the words of
this Curse, that he bless himself in
his heart, saying, I shall have peace
though I walk in the imagination of
my heart, to add drunkenness to
thirst; The Lord will not spare him,
but then the Anger of the Lord and
his Iealousie shall smoke against that
man, and all the Curses that are
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48223:132"/>
written in this Book shall lie upon
him, and the Lord shall blot out his
Name from under Heaven.</hi> He that
despiseth the methods of God's
grace, and continues his Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and yet perswades himself
that all shall be well with him,
doth highly provoke God. The
Hope of the Disobedient is a
great part of their Disobedience;
for it is a presumptuous believing
against the express Declarations
of God's Will, and they shall be
punished for it as an aggravation
of their other sins. Such people
slight the Divine Threatnings, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
the Truth and Power of
God concerning their perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
but they shall pay dear for
it, especially in the great day of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48223:132"/>
Wrath, when Christ will come
in flaming Fire to render Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to those who acknowledge
God no better, and do wilfully
disobey his Gospel.</p>
                     <p>This misery is dreadful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Sufferings, to which the
Impenitent will be condemned, are
so great, that now they would be
intolerable, but which then they
shall be made to endure. Of this
I shall give account,

the Descriptions of them
which we find in Holy
Scripture.</item>
                           <item>2. By the deep Impressions
which they will make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the spirits of damned
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48223:133"/>
Impenitents, of which we
are told in Holy Writ.</item>
                           <item>3. By setting down four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Notices, which we
have received concerning
the dreadfulness of that
state.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. By a brief Rehearsal of the
Descriptions of the misery of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitents,
which we find record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Holy Scripture. It hath
pleased God to express the future
Torments of Impenitent Souls, by
taking resemblances from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
pains with which they are
now acquainted; and hath chosen
the most sharp of those which
men suffer on Earth, to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of those far greater which
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48223:133"/>
they shall suffer in Hell. I shall
name a few of them.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes that miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is described by the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Fire, than which nothing
is more sharp; which is called
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Hell Fire;</hi> which,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 49, 50. is called <hi>a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
of Fire, into which the wicked
shall be cast in the end of the World;</hi>
and <hi>Rev. 21. 8. a Lake of Fire
and Brimstone,</hi> into which several
sorts of sinners there named shall
be thrown; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. it is
called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is
translated <hi>Fiery Indignation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the fierceness of Divine
Vengeance. This is terrible,
and therefore such as are obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to it are there said to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48223:134"/>
a <hi>fearful expectation of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was a pain unspeakably
dreadful which those old sinners
endured, who were inclosed in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and made to perish in the
noysom smoke of Brimstone, and
the unsupportable Torment of
Fire: But that is nothing to
that which will be kindled in Hell,
where the Fire will never go out,
nor the Persons who are burnt in
it ever be consumed.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes this Punishment is
called the <hi>Gnawing of the never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Worm;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 9. 44.</note> sometimes it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by <hi>utter Darkness,</hi> which
signifies the utmost disconsolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a dismal Condition. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in Holy Writ is called <hi>Light,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1. 12.</note>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:48223:134"/>
and Heaven the Inheritance of the
Saints in Light. Those who are
cast into utter Darkness, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the farthest Distance
from God,<note place="margin">Psal.</note> who is the Fountain
of Life, and in whose Light the
Blessed see Light.</p>
                     <p>It is called <hi>The Blackness of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
i. e.</hi> the most Horrid,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 17</note> into
which no glimpse of Light shines.
This state is worse than that of a
Malefactor, who is condemned to
be made up between two Walls,
there to perish in Darkness, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and Solitude.</p>
                     <p>Sometime this dreadful misery
is signified by a <hi>Pit which hath no
bottom,</hi> into which the ungodly
are to be cast; and sometime by
the Torment of a <hi>perpetual Rack:</hi>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:48223:135"/>
sometime by a <hi>Cup of Wrath,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 10.</note> called
<hi>the Wine of the Wrath of God,</hi> mixt
with bitter Ingredients; and in
this World God doth make sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to drink some drops, but in
the great day he will make them
drink up the Dregs of it,<note place="margin">Ps. 75. 8.</note> the bitter
Wrath which lies in the bottom, in
which is no Alloy of Mercy.
Lastly, by the pains of the <hi>second
Death</hi> which the ungodly must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;
which is a thousand times
worse than the first; for that is
but a Temporal separation of the
Soul from the Body, this an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
separation of Body and Soul
from God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:48223:135"/>
2. The greatness of this Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is plainly declared by the deep
impressions, which we are told it
will make upon the spirits of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Impenitents, as we perceive
the acuteness of pain which men
suffer by the grievousness of their
Cries.<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 12.</note> Our Saviour says, that
in the place to which the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
shall be condemned, there will
be <hi>weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</hi>
These are Expressions of extreme
grief, and show the extremity of
Misery. A small matter will not
make one cry out, nor a little cold
make the Teeth chatter.<note place="margin">Rev. 6. 17.</note> No, it is
because <hi>the great day of wrath is
come, and who shall be able to abide
it?</hi> The Impenitent would then
be glad of Annihilation; it would
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48223:136"/>
be good for them that they were
nothing, or as our Saviour says,
<hi>That they had never been born.</hi> In
great Anguish they will say to the
<hi>Mountains, fall on us, and to the
Rocks, cover us, and hide us from
the face of him that sitteth upon the
Throne, and from the wrath of the
Lamb:</hi> But the Rocks will be as
deaf to the Impenitent then, as
they are to God now.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, The Impenitents
misery is made known to them
by four particular Notices which
are given them of their dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Condition in the other
World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:48223:136"/>
1. They are told beforehand
what Company they shall have in
Hell, and that is no better than the
<hi>Devil and his Angels,</hi> Haters and
hated of God: So the Sentence
runs,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>Go ye cursed into the Fire
prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
You hold of his side,<note place="margin">Wisd. 2. 24.</note> and
it is fit you should share in his
Lot. I called you to the hopes
of my Mercy, and offered you a
part in the happiness of Obedient
Souls; but you rather chose to
comply with your own and my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and to perish with Satan,
rather than to hearken to me. Get
you gone from me and all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into that Fire, which was not
designed for you, but was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the punishment of Devils;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48223:137"/>
but since you would have your
portion in it, I confirm your
choice.</p>
                     <p>This is sad: For the Devils
were always, and are still, Enemies
to Mankind: They were Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from the beginning, and are
Malicious to the end. To be shut
up with such Companions is a
greater Torment than to be nailed
up in a Vessel among Serpents.
Will impenitent sinners be able to
endure this? <hi>Can they dwell with
everlasting Burnings? Can they
make an agreement with Hell, and a
League with Devils?</hi> Do they think
that cursed Fiends will make them
welcome in Hell, because they
have perswaded them to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Can they expect entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48223:137"/>
from such as are shut up in
a lothsom Dungeon? What help
will they give others, who are
themselves in unspeakable Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and who are so malicious,
that, if they could, they would not?
<hi>It is better to repent, than to go to
such Company.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The Impenitent will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
pain'd, because they
will then see that it was their own
folly, which brought them into the
Misery which they shall then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
and that their Obstinacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
them of the Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
of which they might have
been possessors. Those who in
their life time would not be at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to be saved, shall then be
forced to entertain multitudes of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48223:138"/>
thoughts which will blow the Coles
of the unquenchable Fire. They
will be galled perpetually by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how sottishly they perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
sillily preferring a few short
Pleasures before everlasting Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and that notwithstanding it
was offered them, and they often
perswaded to chuse it. They will
then see, and grieve to see it was
folly enough to have chosen the
Temporary Pleasures of sin, though
for that they should only have been
deprived of Eternal Joys; but that
it was the highest Madness, when
for that they shall also suffer E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Pains, and find that the
greatness of their Worldly Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which they so much desired,
having heightened their sin, shall
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48223:138"/>
also add to the sharpness of their
punishment.</p>
                     <p>They will then see how sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they followed the evil Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their fellow sinners, tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon God's Commands, and
be sensible of the meanness of the
Excuse which they made for their
Unbelief, when they said, They
could not think there was such
a place as Hell, because they
never talked with any that was
there, or ever heard it proved by
Philosophy. And they will wish
then that they had believed God,
who told them that there was such
a place, that they might endeavour
to escape it, and not have heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
to their Ranting Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48223:139"/>
any Arguments against it,
made it their work to huff the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of it out of the World; and
that the rather, because they well
knew, that if there be such a place,
they themselves must be forced to
take an undesirable Lodging in it.
They will then see that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to ask for Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in matters of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
where God demands Faith
upon his Word, remembring how
sillily the old World laughed at
<hi>Noah</hi> for building a Ship to sail, as
they thought, upon dry ground,
refusing to believe that there would
be a Deluge, till they were aflote
upon the Waves of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:48223:139"/>
They will see then that Disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
after plain Declarations of
God's Will, was not Courage, but
stupid Presumption; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in sin against great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to the contrary, was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Obstinacy. They will then
confess that no Tentation was a
just Counterpoise to God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and that their sensual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
were no lawful warrant for
the contradiction of the Reason of
their Minds, and that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
folly to slight the Motions
of God's Spirit, and hearken to
the Suggestions of the Devil. Will
any dare to say to God then, <hi>I
knew thou wast austere, and reapest
where thou didst not sow?</hi> No; but
remembring that they were graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48223:140"/>
and often assisted, they will
then too late curse the baseness of
their Negligence and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>They will then be ashamed to
return to God, having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Errand upon which
he sent them into the World, but
very much to the contrary of it;
and be afraid, because they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>not having left any Testimony of
their Vertue behind them,</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
damning Examples of Vice.
They will hate their Being, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
by the sharp Remorse of
their once baffled Consciences, that
they must be their own Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
whilst the space which was
granted them for Repentance,
makes their Impenitence more
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48223:140"/>
Criminal; and the sense of their
having highly deserved what they
suffer will make them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that they are but justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of that small Relief, which
is commonly allowed to the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
Pity.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, The Impenitent
will be gal'd with Envy, to see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
possess that Happiness which
once they might have enjoyed, but
then slighted, and of which they
are now for ever deprived. This
we learn from our Saviour,<note place="margin">Luke 13. 28, 29.</note> 
                        <hi>There
shall be weeping and gnashing of
Teeth, when ye shall see</hi> Abraham,
<hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the
Prophets, in the Kingdom of God,
and you your selves thrust out. And
they shall come from the East, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48223:141"/>
from the West, and from the North,
and from the South, and shall sit
down in the Kingdom of God.</hi> This
sight will whet the Teeth of the
never dying Worm, which will
not only bite with the never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
remembrance of their un wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
and vex with the pain of
late Repentance and continual
Self-accusation; but also pine with
Envy to see others happy in what
they threw away. That which
our Saviour added in this matter,<note place="margin">v. 30.</note>
is very considerable, <hi>There are last
which shall be first, and there are first
which shall be last.</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which proud sinners despise,
as persons a great way farther from
Happiness than themselves, whom
they laugh at for their Ignorance,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48223:141"/>
slight for their mean Condition,
and jeer for their precise Life,
which shall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
shall be stopt. So it was
with the Jews to whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
spoke, they looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as Sons of the Kingdom,
Heirs of Happiness, great in
Knowledge, splendid in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
beloved of God, satisfied
in present Enjoyments, and big
with Expectation; yet these so
seemingly forward should be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
by such as they thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to eat with them; and these
should sit down with their pious
Ancestors, where they, their boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Progeny, should be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:48223:142"/>
                        <hi>This matter is well expressed</hi>
Wisd. 5. <hi>from the first Verse to the
seventh,</hi> Then shall the righteous
man stand in great boldness before the
face of such as have afflicted him, and
made no account of his Labours.
When they see it, they shall be troubled
with terrible fear, and shall be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at the strangeness of his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so far beyond all that they looked
for. And they repenting and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for anguish of spirit, shall say
within themselves, This was he whom
we had sometime in Derision, and a
Proverb of Reproach. We Fools ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
his life madness, and his end
to be without honour. How is he
numbred among the Children of God,
and his lot is among the Saints? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have we erred from the way of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48223:142"/>
Truth, and the Light of Righteousness
hath not shined upon us.</p>
                     <p>This excellent Author gives an
account of these Hectors, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.
where he tells us of them, that
they placed all Happiness in this
present Life—<hi>Verse</hi> 2. <hi>We are born
at all adventure, and we shall be
hereafter as though we had never been:</hi>
and therefore they <hi>crown'd their
Heads with Rose-buds, and filled
themselves with wine,</hi> being careful
<hi>lest they should go away without their
part of Iollity.</hi> As to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, he declares their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<hi>verse</hi> 10, 12, 13, 14, 15. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they abused him with Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and treated him with all
Cruelty in this World; but when
they come into the other, and see
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48223:143"/>
him stand in great boldness before
God, they are seized with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
fear, and vexed with Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
at his Happiness, amazed
at the strangeness of his salvation,
whom before they scorn'd. All
Impenitent sinners will be in such
pain at our Saviour's coming,
when they see obedient Souls ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up to meet him in the Air, and
find themselves left upon the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Earth, till they be called before
his Throne, and be there adjudged
to a worse Fire.</p>
                     <p>The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> set
a sharp Edge upon his Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 1.</note>
when he put it into these words,
<hi>Let us therefore fear, lest a promise
being left us of entring into his Rest,
any of you should come short of it.</hi>
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:48223:143"/>
It is not easie to imagin what
grief seized the Unbelieving Jews,
when they saw <hi>Canaan,</hi> and beheld
those before them who were to go
into that good Land, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bar'd from it. After the
pronuntiation of that sad Doom,
with what pain did they wear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the hated remnant of their
Lives, wandring in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Much more grievous will it
be to see the Saviour of the World
come with his glorious Attendants,
and take up all good men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and carry them to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and leave the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent,
not to perish in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
but to be carried to that
Company and Torment which I
have mentioned before. <hi>Who
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48223:144"/>
would not repent that knows this?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. The misery of the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
will be unsupportable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will despair of ever
mending their Condition. It must
needs put Vinegar into their
Wounds, when they are assured
that they cannot be healed.</p>
                     <p>This Assurance depends upon two
things,
<list>
                           <item>1. Upon this, That they are
told before hand that the
Sentence which will be
pronounced, is irreversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</item>
                           <item>2. Upon this, That they
know that he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
it, is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48223:144"/>
and so can secure the
Execution of it.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. The Sentence is recorded in
Scripture, and there we find it Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reversible:
It is, <hi>Go into ever last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 25. ult.</note> 
                        <hi>into Fire which shall never
be quenched; the Worm which torments
you shall never die. The Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is everlasting.</hi> Those who
are cast into the Lake are ordered
to be <hi>tormented there for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 14.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the Sentence, and he
who pronounceth it is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and so can secure the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it. He who could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Fire of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s
Furnace from burning, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or consuming his Servants,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48223:145"/>
must needs be able to make a Fire
which will burn and torment, and
yet not consume his Enemies. Shall
bold sinners be annihilated because
they desire it, knowing they shall
have no part of Felicity, if there
be any in the other World? No;
God hath appointed them worse
than so; and it is but just. Why
should not God punish such as
long as he pleaseth, who sinned as
long as they could? Why should
their punishment have an end, who
would never leave sinning? Life
was propounded upon good terms,
which if it were refused, it was
declared that Death would be the
Consequent: they were perswaded
to chuse Life, they would not;
and having refused it, will they be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48223:145"/>
angry that they suffer what they
would have? A Law was given by
the Soveraign Rector of the
World, Death was threatned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the breach of it; they would
break it: they were condemned
by that Law; yet Pardon was
offered, they would not accept
it: so that they perisht not because
they sinned, nor yet because they
were condemned; but because
they would be Executed. Their
Misery is their Choice. But, as
I said, this makes it unspeakably
great, it will have no end. There

                     <head>The Conclusion.</head>
                     <p>Now I am come to the Close
of this Discourse, which I shall
shut up with this short Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Let us all, in the fear of
God, endeavour by timely and
true Repentance to escape the
Wrath to come: <hi>Knowing the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Lord, let us perswade our
selves to this Duty.</hi> Let us not
baffle all the Methods of his Grace,
and amongst others this of his
Threatnings. Have we no Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
upon which God can work?
Are not the Threatnings which I
have mentioned dreadful? Have
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48223:147"/>
we no Fear in us? or are we
afraid of any thing but God?
Have we lost the use of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Principle of Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when it is applied to our
greatest Danger? Are Eternal
Happiness and Misery words
only? Do they not signifie
things of greatest Importance?
And yet do they make no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon our hard hearts?
Sure then they are grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Stone, and not to be soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
except in the Lake of Fire
and Brimstone. <hi>No, rather, O
merciful God, take them out of our
Breasts, and into their room put
hearts of Flesh.</hi> Must we needs
sin on though we be damned
for it? What is it that makes
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48223:147"/>
sin so dear to us? We have
been told by one whom we
ought to believe, <hi>That it were
much better for us to go into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
with an Eye plucked out, with
the loss of a right Hand, or a Foot
cut off, than to carry a whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
into Hell.</hi> Yes; but we sin
for fear.<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 28.</note> How? <hi>Do we fear
them, who can kill the Body</hi> (if
they be permitted from above)
<hi>but after that can do no more,
and not dread him who can cast
both Body and Soul into Hell?
It is a dreadful thing to fall
into the Hands of the Living
God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="292" facs="tcp:48223:148"/>
Impenitent, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
dost thou sin on, and put
the Evil Day from thee, whose
approach thou canst no more
delay, than hinder the Morning
Sun from rising at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Minute?<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 3.</note> Dost thou not
know that thy <hi>Iudgment doth not
linger, and that thy Damnation
slumbereth not?</hi> Pardon upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is given at an easie
rate, and upon that it may be
had. Sure thou darest not ask
of God leave to sin; what
then makes thee so bold as not
to repent? He that sins, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
He that Repents not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
his Rebellion; And can
that man think that God will
not be even with him? <hi>How
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48223:148"/>
can such a one escape the Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hell?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 23. 33.</note> Shall God ever
hearken to thee crying from
Hell, who dost despise him who
hath spoken to thee from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
Be wise, fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
remembring that good
advice which is given thee
<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 57, 58, 59. <hi>Why even
of your selves judge ye not what
is right? When thou goest with
thine Adversary to the Magistrate,
as thou art in the way, give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that thou mayest be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him; lest he hale thee to
the Iudge, and the Iudge deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thee to the Officer, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
cast thee into Prison. I tell
thee thou shall not depart thence
till thou hast paid the very last
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48223:149"/>
mite.</hi> In these words our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
doth reproach men, for
not using the same prudence in
managing their affairs with God,
which they do with men. It
is their known practise, that
when they have a difference of
Concern with another who hath
an Advantage against them, they
compose it as soon as they can,
hoping the sooner they do it
to have fairer terms, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if they put off the
matter till it come before the
Judge, he will pronounce se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
against them, and that
having stood out to the last,
their Adversary will make his
benefit of the Sentence, and
force them to pay the whole
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48223:149"/>
Debt, or else lie in Prison.</p>
                     <p>How much more should we
give diligence to be reconciled
to God? Shall we maintain an
Action at Law in which we are
sure to be cast, and that against
God? <hi>Do we contend with the
Lord? Are we stronger than He?</hi>
No; let us humble our selves
speedily before him, and make
our peace as soon as we can.
He that stands out in sin can
hope for no pardon at the day
of Judgment. Let us do as the
Psalmist bids us,<note place="margin">Ps. 2. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Kiss the Son lest
he be angry, and ye perish in the way;
when his wrath is kindled but a
little, blessed are all they that put
their trust in him.</hi> Let us with
all Expressions of humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48223:150"/>
address our selves to the
Son of God, who only can
reconcile us to his Father; and
do it speedily, lest loitering in
the way of sin, his Wrath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake
us, and we perish in our
sinful Course. If his Anger
once begin to burn, there is no
Happiness, but for such who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
have made him their
Friend, and so can now put
their Trust in him. And let
every Penitent for his Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
know, that in so doing
he doth comply with the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God, who designing our
good, hath made his Threatnings
one means of our Salvation. He
hath menaced sin, and let us
know the sad Doom of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48223:150"/>
not that thereby we should
be affrighted into Despair, but
that by this means we might be
more easily perswaded to sin no
more, and so escape the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
threatned:<note place="margin">Iob. 5. 34.</note> For our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hath told us what he hath
said of the Wrath to come, as he
hath all other things in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
to this end, <hi>that we might be
saved.</hi>

                  <p>THese Considerations about
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by a Person of an excellent
<hi>Genius</hi> and Ability to consider the
Nature of the things he is wont to
discourse upon, being fallen into

publish them; I thought the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
so weighty, and the way of
handling it both so discreet and
solid, that I could not forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
it to the Press, being
fully persuaded, the Publick in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as well as all Persons in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
that are concern'd for the

find sufficient cause to be pleased
with the publication of it. To
which I have nothing to add but
that, whereas at the beginning of
the following Discourse there is
mention made of its being to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of <hi>Two</hi> Parts; one, to shew,
that a Christian <hi>need</hi> not lay aside
his Reason; and the other, that he
is <hi>not commanded</hi> to do so: The
Author thought fit to keep that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which concern'd the latter,
from <hi>now</hi> accompanying the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
which seems the most seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,

                  <head>THE
Preface.</head>
                  <p>'TIs the just Grief, and frequent
Complaint of those that take to
heart the Concerns of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
that they see it now more
furiously assaulted and studiously under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
than ever, not only by the vicious
Lives of Men, but by their licentious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
I know, there have been Vices in
the World, as long as there have been Men:
And 'tis an observation as old as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
Eccles. 7. 10. That Men are apt to
look upon their own Times as worse than
those that preceded them. And because I
remember too, that in reciting this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
he disapproves it; I shall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
whether other Ages have been less
faulty than this we live in: But this I
think I may say with as much Truth as
Grief, that, among us here in <hi>England,</hi> the
Times, to which our memory can reach,
have been less guilty, than the present Time
is, of a <hi>spreading</hi> and <hi>bold</hi> Profaneness.
For, though many allow'd themselves to
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:48223:155"/>
court Gold, and Cups, and Mistresses, little
less than now they do; yet these were still
acknowledg'd to be Faults even by those
that committed them, and the <hi>Precepts</hi>
and the <hi>Counsels</hi> of Religion were neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or disobeyed, but not their <hi>Authority</hi>
thrown off or affronted; Men retaining
yet such a kind of respect for Her, as the
elder Son in the Parable did for his Father,
when, receiving a command from him to go
and work in his Vineyard, he answer'd, <hi>I
go Sir,</hi> though <hi>he went not,</hi> Mat. 21. 30.
But now too many of the Vicious do not
only scandalously violate the Laws of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but question the Truth, and despise
the very Name of it. They rather choose to
imitate the Rebels in the other Parable, and
say of Religion what they did of their
lawful King, when they insolently declar'd,
<hi>that they would not have him to reign
over them,</hi> Luke 19. 14. They seek not to
hide their sins like <hi>Adam,</hi> but think either
to cover or protect all others by that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all, <hi>Impiety;</hi> and, instead of cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conscience into silence, (as sinners, not
impudent, are wont to do,) by deceitful
promises of repenting hereafter of their
sins, they endeavour to stifle or depose it, by
maintaining, that <hi>Repentance</hi> is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of mind, and <hi>Conscience</hi> ought not
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:48223:155"/>
to be look'd on as the Vicegerent of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whose very Existence or Providence they
dispute.</p>
                  <p>And that which more troubled me, and
made me most apprehend the spreading of
this Impiety, was, that it was propagated in
a new way, that made me fear, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not only of vulgar Preachers, but even
of learned Divines themselves, would be
much less fit than formerly to give a check
to its progress. For, till of late, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of our Infidels did, either as Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
question the Historical part of the
Scriptures, and perhaps cavil at some of the
Doctrines; or, if they employed Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Arguments, as <hi>Pomponatius</hi> and
<hi>Vaninus</hi> did, they borrow'd them from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi>
or the Peripatetick School. And
against both these sorts of Adversaries, the
learneder Champions of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
such as <hi>Vives, Mornay,</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
had furnish'd Divines with good and
proper Weapons. For, the Historical part
of the Scriptures, and especially the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
were strongly confirmable by competent
Testimonies, and other Moral Proofs, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in their kind. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> being
himself a dark and dubious Writer, and his
Followers being on that account divided
into Sects and Parties, which for the most
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:48223:156"/>
part had nothing to alledge but his single
Authority, 'twas not difficult to answer the
Arguments drawn from the Peripatetick
Philosophy; and, if that could not have
been done, it had not been difficult to reject
the Doctrines themselves as false or preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
But our <hi>new Libertines</hi> take an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
and shorter way, (though I hope it
will not be a more prosperous one,) to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
Religion. For, not troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to <hi>examine</hi> the Historical or Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
parts of Christian Theology, in such a
way as <hi>Jews, Pagans, Mahometans,</hi> would
do; These deny those very Principles of
Natural Theology, wherein the Christian,
and those other differing, Religions agree,
and which are <hi>suppos'd</hi> in almost all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
that pretend to Revelation, namely,
the Existence and Providence of a Deity,
and a Future State (after this life is ended.)
For, these Libertines own themselves to be
so upon the account of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> or
other <hi>Mechanical,</hi> Principles of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and therefore to press them with the
Authorities wont to be employ'd by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
is improper, since they are so far from
paying any respect to the venerable Fathers
of the Church, that they slight the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Heathen Philosophers themselves,
judging no Writers worthy of that name,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:48223:156"/>
but those that, like <hi>Leucippus, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Epicurus,</hi> &amp;c. explicate things by
Matter and Local Motion; and therefore
'tis not to be expected, that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
any more the Peripatetick Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Scotus</hi> or <hi>Aquinas,</hi> than the
<hi>Homilies</hi> of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> or St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom;</hi>
and to give <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself the
Title of <hi>The Philosopher,</hi> were enough to
make some of them conclude the Ascriber
were <hi>no Philosopher.</hi> And this, by the
way, may excuse me for not having brought
into the following Papers the Sentences of
the <hi>Fathers</hi> or the <hi>Moralists,</hi> or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any of the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Philosophers,</hi>
which I should have declin'd
to employ, though my frequent removes
from place to place, when I was writing these
Papers, had not deny'd me the convenience
of a Library.</p>
                  <p>Things being at this pass, though the Title
of this Discourse acknowledges the Author
of it to be a <hi>Layman;</hi> yet I shall not beg
pardon for the ensuing Papers as for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
upon the Ecclesiasticks. For
besides that, though I know some Functions,
yet I know no Truths, of Religion, that
have the peculiarity of the <hi>Shew-bread</hi>
under the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 4. with which it
was lawful only for the Priests to meddle; I
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:48223:157"/>
will not so far mistrust the Charity of
Churchmen, as not to suppose, that they
will rather thank than blame any man,
that being not altogether a stranger to this
warfare, offers them his assistance against
the common Enemy in so important a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and so great a danger. The Fathers,
and other Divines, being wont to compare
the Church Militant to a ship, 'twill not be
an improper extension of the Comparison,
to say, that, when the Vessel is threatned
with shipwrack, or boarded by Pyrates, it
may be the Duty not only of profess'd Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but any private Passenger, to lend his
helping hand in that common danger. And
I wish, I were as sure, that my endeavors
will prove successful, as I am, that such
Churchmen as I most esteem will think
them neither needless nor unseasonable.
Nay, perhaps my being a Secular person, may
the better qualifie me to work on those I am
to deal with, and may make my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
though not more solid in themselves,
yet more prevalent with men that usually
(though how justly, let them consider,)
have a particular pique at the Clergy, and
look with prejudice upon whatever is taught
by men, whose interest is advantag'd by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what they teach believed. And I was
the more invited not to be a meer Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:48223:157"/>
or a lazy Deplorer of the danger I saw
Religion in, because it seem'd not unlikely,
that <hi>Philosophical Infidels,</hi> as they would
be thought, would be less tractable to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
though never so good Humanists and
Antiquaries, than to a person that reasons
with them upon their own grounds, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
with them in their own way, having
had a somewhat more than ordinary curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to acquaint himself with the <hi>Epicurean</hi>
and <hi>Cartesian</hi> Principles, and exercise
himself in that Philosophy, which is very
conversant with things Corporeal, and
strives to explain them by <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and shakes off all Authority (at least
that is not infallible.) Vpon such Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
as these, I comply'd with an occasion
I had of solemnly asking <hi>Reason</hi> the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
that <hi>Joshua</hi> once ask'd the Angel that
appear'd to him in the Plains of <hi>Jericho,
Art thou for us, or for our Adversaries?
Josh.</hi> 5. 14; and of committing to Paper
those thoughts that should occur to me on
that Subject. And this I the rather did,
that I might thereby as well contribute to
my own satisfaction as to that of my
Friends. For, as I think, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that belongs to this life, that so much
deserves our serious care as what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of us when we are past it; so I
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:48223:158"/>
think, that he who takes a resolution either
to embrace or reject so important a thing
as <hi>Religion,</hi> without seriously examining
why he does it, may happen to make a good
Choice, but can be but a bad Chooser. And
that I might not exclude, by too early a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
those things, that, for ought I knew,
might hereafter be pertinent and useful, I
threw my Reflections into one Book, as into
a Repository, to be kept there only as a heap
of differing materials, that, if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
worth it, they might be afterwards
review'd, and sorted, and drawn into an
orderly Discourse. But, before I began to
do what I intended, a succession of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
(wherewith 'twould not be proper
to trouble the Reader,) quite diverted
me to employments of a very distant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
so that these Papers, being thrown
by, did for divers years lie neglected, with
many others, till at length the person, for
whose perusal I in the first place design'd
them, join'd with some other intelligent
Friends to urge me to send them abroad,
though I was not in a condition to give them
the finishing strokes, or so much as to fill up
several of the Blanks, my haste had made
me leave to be supply'd when I should be at
leisure. And indeed, notwithstanding the
just aversness I had from letting a piece so
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:48223:158"/>
incomplete and uncorrected appear in this
Critical Age; yet the hopes, they confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave me, that this piece, such as it is, might
not be unacceptable nor useless, were not, I
confess, altogether groundless.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novelty</hi> being a thing very acceptable in
this age, and particularly to the persons I
am to deal with, to whom perhaps 'tis
none of the least endearments of their
Errors, I despair not, that 'twill somewhat
recommend these Papers, to which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to commit not Transcripts of what
I thought they may have already met with
in Authors, but such considerations, as a
<hi>serious attention,</hi> and the <hi>nature of the
things</hi> I treated of, suggested to me; so
that most of the things will perhaps be
thought new; and some few things coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
with what they may have elsewhere
met with, may possibly appear rather to
have been suggested by considering the same
subjects, to other Authors and to me, than
to have been borrowed by me of them. But
some few things, I confess, I employ, that
were commonly enough employed before, and
I hope, I may in that have done Religion
no disservice; For having taken notice, that
some of the more familiar Arguments had
a real force in them, but had been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:48223:159"/>
proposed as to be lyable to exceptions
that had discredited them; I made it my
care, by proposing them more cautiously, to
prevent such objections, which alone kept
their force from being apparent.</p>
                  <p>I was not unmindful of the great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
this Tract was likely to undergo,
partly for want of a more curious method,
and partly because my other occasions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that if I Published it at all, it must
be left to come abroad unpolish'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finished.
But though this Inconvenience had
like to have supprest this Discourse; yet the
force of it was much weaken'd by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that this immethodical way of
Writing would best comply with what was
designed and pretended in this Paper, which
was, not to write a compleat Treatise of the
Subject of it; but only to suggest about it
some of those many considerations, that
(questionless) might have occurred to (what
I do not pretend to) an Enlightned and
Penetrating Intellect. And the Loadstone,
divers of whose <hi>Phenomena</hi> are mention'd
in the body of this little Tract, suggested
somewhat to me in reference to the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it, by exciting in me a hope,
that, if this Discourse have any thing near
as much Truth as I endeavour'd to furnish
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:48223:159"/>
it with, that Truth will have its operation
upon sincere Lovers of it, notwithstanding
the want of regularity in the method: As
a good Loadstone will not, by being rough
and rudely shap'd, be hinder'd from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
its Attractive and Directive powers
upon Steel and Iron.</p>
                  <p>As for the Style, I was rather shy than
ambitious of bringing in the <hi>Thorns</hi> of
the School-men or the <hi>Flowers</hi> of Rhetoric:
For, the latter, though they had of their own
accord sprung up under my Pen, I should
have thogh improper to be imployed in so
serious and Philosophical a Subject: And
as to the former, I declin'd them, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance
to the humor of my Infidels, who
are generally so prejudic'd against the
School-men, that scarce any thing can be
presented them with more disadvantage
than in a Scholastick dress; and a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
will scarce pass for a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with some of them, if it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into a Syllogism in mode and figure.
That therefore, which I chiefly aim'd at in
my expressions, was significancy and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that my Reader might see, that I was
willing to make him judge of the strength
of my Arguments, and would not put him
to the trouble of divining in what it lay,
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:48223:160"/>
nor inveigle him by ornaments of speech,
to think it greater than it was. I was
also led by my Reason, as well as by my
Inclination, to be careful not to rail at my
Infidels: And though I have some cause to
think, that many of them had their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
debauch'd by their lives, and
were seduc'd from the Church not by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras</hi>
or <hi>Pyrrho,</hi> but by <hi>Bacchus</hi> and
<hi>Venus;</hi> yet I treat them as supposing them
to be what they would be thought, Friends
to Philosophy: And being but a <hi>Layman,</hi>
I did not think my self obliged to talk to
them as out of a Pulpit, and threaten them
with Damnation unless they believ'd me,
but chose to discourse to them rather as to
erring <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> than Wicked wretches.</p>
                  <p>This moderation that I have us'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, will, I hope, induce them to
grant me two or three reasonable requests;
whereof the <hi>first</hi> shall be, that they would
not make a final judgment of these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
till they have perus'd them quite
through; especially having in their Eye
what is declar'd in the <hi>Preamble,</hi> where
both the design and scope of the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and what it does not pretend to, is
exprest. The <hi>next</hi> thing I am to request
of them, and my Readers, is, that they
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:48223:160"/>
would not have the meaner thoughts of my
Arguments for not being propos'd with the
confidence, wherewith many Writers are
wont to recommend weaker proofs. For I
wrote to intelligent Men, and, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such, I never observ'd that a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
ceas'd to be thought one for
being modestly propos'd; but I have often
known a good Argument lose of its credit
by the invidious Title of a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And I must further beg my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to estimate my <hi>Design</hi> in these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
by the <hi>Title</hi> of them, in which I do not
pretend to make Religion trample upon
Reason, but only to shew the <hi>Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness</hi>
of the one to the other, and the
friendly agreement between them. I am a
person, who looking upon it as my Honour
and Happiness to be both a <hi>Man,</hi> and a
<hi>Christian,</hi> would neither write nor believe
any thing, that might misbecome me in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of those two capacities. I am not a
Christian, because it is the Religion of my
Countrey, and my Friends; nor, because I
am a stranger to the Principles either of the
<hi>Atomical,</hi> or the <hi>Mechanical</hi> Philosophy.
I admit no mans Opinions in the whole
lump, and have not scrupled, on occasion,
to own dissents from the generality of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:48223:161"/>
men, whether Philosophers or Divines:
And when I choose to travel in the beaten
Road, 'tis not because I find 'tis the Road,
but because I judge 'tis the Way. Possibly
I should have much fewer Adversaries, if
all those that yet are so, had as atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
and impartially consider'd the Points
in Controversie as I have endeavour'd to
do. They would then, 'tis like, have seen,
that the Question I handle, is not whether
Rational Beings ought to avoid Vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Assents, but whether, when the Historical
and other Moral Proofs clearly sway the
Scales in favour of Christianity, we ought
to flie from the Difficulties that attend the
granting of a Deity and Providence, to
Hypotheses, whether Epicurean or others,
that are themselves incumber'd with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
Difficulties: On which account I
conceive, that the Question between them
and me is not, whether They, or I, ought
to submit to Reason (for we both agree in
thinking our selves bound to that;) but
whether They or I submit to Reason the
fulliest inform'd, and least byass'd by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,
Vanity, or Secular Interest.</p>
                  <p>I reverence and cherish Reason as much, I
hope, as any of them; but I would have
Reason practise Ingenuity as well as Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:48223:161"/>
and both industriously pry into things
<hi>within</hi> her sphere, and frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(what no Philosopher that considers
will deny) that there are some things <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond</hi>
it. And in these it is, that I think it
as well her Duty to admit Revelation, as
her Happiness to have it propos'd to her:
And, even as to Revelations themselves, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Reason to judge <hi>of</hi> them, before she
judges <hi>by</hi> them. The following Papers
will, I hope, manifest, that the main dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt my Adversaries and me
is, that they judge upon particular Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Objections, and I, upon the
whole matter. And to conclude; <hi>as</hi> I make
use of my Watch to estimate Time, when
ever the Sun is absent or clouded, but when
he shines clearly forth, I scruple not to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and adjust my Watch by his Beams cast
on a Dial; <hi>so,</hi> wherever no better Light is
to be had, I estimate Truth by my own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
but where Divine Revelation can be
consulted, I willingly submit my fallible
Reason to the sure Informations afforded by
Celestial Light.</p>
                  <p>I should here put an end to this long
Preface, but that to the things, which have
been said concerning what I have written of
my own, I see 'tis requisite that I add a
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:48223:162"/>
few words about what I quote from other
Writers; especially because in this very
Preface I mention my having intended
to entertain my Friend with my own
Thoughts. Of the Citations therefore that
my Reader will meet with in the following
Papers, I have this Account to give him:
(1.) That I had written the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Distinctions to which they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
before I met with these cited Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which I afterwards inserted in the
Margent, and other vacant places of my
Epistle. (2.) That these Passages are not
borrow'd from Books that treat of the
Truth of the Christian Religion, or of
Christian Theology at all, but are tak'n from
Authors that write of Philosophical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and are by me apply'd to Mine, which
are usually very distant from Theirs. (3.) If
you then ask me, why I make use of their
Authority, and did not content my self
with my own Ratiocinations? I have this to
Answer; that my design being to convince
another who had no reason to look upon my
Authority, and whom I had cause to suspect
to have entertain'd some prejudices against
any Reasons that should come from one that
confessedly aim'd at the defending of the
Christian Religion, I thought it very proper
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:48223:162"/>
and expedient to let him see, that divers of
the same things (for substance,) that I
deliver'd in favour of that Religion, had
been taught as Philosophical Truths by <hi>Men</hi>
that <hi>were not</hi> profess'd Divines, and
<hi>were</hi> Philosophers, and such strict Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists
too, as to be extraordinarily care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
not to take any thing into their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
upon the account of Revelation. And
on this occasion let me observe to you, that
there are some Arguments, which being
clearly built upon Sense or evident Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
need borrow no Assistance from the
Refutation of any of the Proposers or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers,
and may, I think, be fitly enough
compar'd to Arrows shot out of a Cross-Bow,
or Bullets shot out of a Gun, which have
the same strength, and pierce equally, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be discharg'd by a Child, or a
strong Man. But then, there are other Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations,
which either <hi>do,</hi> or are <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd</hi>
to depend, in some measure, upon the
judgment and skill of those that make the
Observations whereon they are grounded,
and their Ability to discern Truth from
Counterfeits, and Solid things from those
that are but Superficial ones: And these
may be compar'd to Arrows shot out of a
Long-Bow, which make much the greater
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:48223:163"/>
impression, by being shot by a strong and
skilful Archer. And therefore when we
question, what Doctrines ought or ought not
to be thought Reasonable, it do's not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
facilitate a Propositions appearing (not
Contrary, but) Consonant to Reason, that
'tis look'd upon as such by those that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the Masters of that Faculty.</p>

                  <head>SOME
CONSIDERATIONS
ABOUT
The Reconcileableness
OF
REASON &amp; RELIGION.
The First Part.</head>
                  <p>AS to what you write in your
Friends name, near the
bottom of the first page
of your Letter, perhaps I
shall not mistake, if I guess,
that, when He seems but to propose a
<hi>Question,</hi> he means an <hi>Objection;</hi> and
covertly intimates, that I, among many
others, am reduc'd to that pass, that to
embrace our <hi>Religion,</hi> we must renounce
our <hi>Reason;</hi> and consequently, that to
be a <hi>Christian,</hi> one must cease to be a
<hi>Man,</hi> and much more, leave off being
a <hi>Philosopher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48223:165"/>What liberal Concessions soever some
others have been pleas'd to make on
such an Occasion as this, they do not
concern me; who, being ask'd but my
own Opinion, do not think my self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible
for that of others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that I may frame my Answer so, as
to meet both with the obvious sense of
the Question, and the intimated mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Him that proposes it, I shall
roundly make a <hi>Negative</hi> Reply, and say,
<hi>That I do not think, that a Christian, to be
truly so, is oblig'd to forego his Reason; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by denying the Dictates of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or by laying aside the Vse of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doubt not but this Answer is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enough from what your Friend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects;
and perhaps those Grants, that
have been made by the Indulgence or
Inadvertency of many persons, eminent
for being Pious or Learned, may make
you your self startle at this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And therefore, though you will
not, I know, expect an Answer to what
Objections your Friend may make, since
he has express'd but what He thinks
ought to be a Christian's Opinion, not
what he has to object against what is
so; yet, to satisfie those Scruples that
you your self may retain, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48223:165"/>
(but with the Brevity that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Letter) to acquaint you <hi>by
themselves,</hi> with <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>Positive</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements,
that have led me to this
Opinion, and <hi>interweave some others,</hi> in
answering the chief Objections that I
think likely to be made against it.</p>
                  <p>And this Preamble, short as it is, will,
I hope, serve to keep you from mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my design; which, as you may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from what I have intimated, is not
to give you the <hi>positive</hi> proofs of the
Christian Religion (which is not here
to be expected from a bare Defendant,)
but to give you some <hi>Specimens</hi> of such
general Considerations, as may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
shew, that the Matter (or Essential
Doctrines) peculiar to the Christian
Religion, is not so repugnant to the
Principles of true Natural Philosophy,
as that to believe them, a Man must cease
to act like a Rational Man, any more
than he would be oblig'd to do by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
other Religions, or ev'n the
Tenents that have been held without
disparagement to their Intellectuals,
by the meer Philosophers themselves;
which last Clause I add, because I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
you do not expect, that I should
be follicitous to vindicate the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48223:166"/>
belief of a Deity from being Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional;
since, besides that perhaps your
Friend would think himself affronted
to be dealt with as an <hi>Atheist,</hi> without
having profess'd himself one, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of a Deity blemishes
the Christian's Reason no more, than it
do's that of Men of all Religions, not
to say of all Mankind; and imports no
other contradiction to Reason, than
what has been judg'd to be none at all
by the Greatest, if not by all, of the
Philosophers that were fam'd for being
guided by Reason (without Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.)
And I shall venture to add (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the by) that, <hi>as</hi> I do not for my own
part think the Atheists Philosophical
Objections (if your Friend had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them) to be near so considerable
for weight or number, as not only those
few that deny a God, but many of those
that believe one, are wont to think; <hi>so</hi>
the Christian is not reduc'd, as is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
to make the Being of a Deity a
meer <hi>Postulatum;</hi> since, besides the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Arguments he can alledge in
common with the best Champions for a
Deity, he has a peculiar Historical Proof
that may suffice; the Miracles perform'd
by Christ and his followers being such,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48223:166"/>
that if the matter of Fact can be (as it
may be) well evinc'd, they will not
only prove the rest of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but in the first place, That there
must be a God to be the Author of
them.</p>
                  <p>But though of the two things which
my design obliges me to Endeavor the
making good of, the most Natural order
seems to be, that I should <hi>first</hi> shew,
That no Precepts of Christianity do
<hi>command</hi> a Man to lay aside his Reason
in matters of Religion; and <hi>then,</hi> That
there is nothing in the Nature of the
Christian Doctrine it self that makes a
Man <hi>need</hi> to do so; Yet I think it not
amiss in treating of these two Subjects
to invert the Order, and <hi>first</hi> consider
that difficulty which is the Principal, and
which your Friend and You jointly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to have my thoughts of; namely,
<hi>Whether there be a necessity for a Christian
to deny his Reason?</hi> And <hi>then</hi> we shall
proceed to examine, Whether, though
he <hi>need</hi> not disclaim his Reason, it be
nevertheless his <hi>Duty</hi> so to do?</p>

                     <p>To proceed then to the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that make up the former Part of
this Epistle; <hi>I shall in the</hi> first <hi>place di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
betwixt that which the Christian
Religion it self teaches, and that which is
taught by this or that Church or Sect of
Christians, and much more by this or that
particular Divine or Schoolman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Need not persuade you, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but know it so well already, that
there are many things taught about the
Attributes and Decrees of God, the
Mysteries of the Trinity, and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and divers other Theological Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
about which not only private
Christians, but Churches of Christians
do not at all agree. There are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Men, whose Ambition, or Boldness,
or Self-conceit, or Interest, leads them
to obtrude upon others, as parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Things that are not only Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but oftentimes Enemies to it. And
there are others, who out of an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Devotion are so sollicitous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the Number and the Wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mysteries, that, to hear them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48223:167"/>
propose and Discourse of things, one
would judge, that they think it is the
office of <hi>Faith,</hi> not to elevate, but to
trample upon <hi>Reason;</hi> and that things
are then fittest to be believ'd, when they
are not clearly to be proved or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
And indeed, when on the one
side I consider the charitable design of
the Gospel, and the candid simplicity
that shines in what it proposes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and on the other side, what
strange and wild Speculations and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
have been father'd upon it, not
only in the Metaphysical Writings of
some Schoolmen, but in the Articles of
Faith of some Churches; I cannot but
think, that if all these Doctrines are
parts of the Christian Religion, the
Apostles, if they were now alive,
would be at best but <hi>Catechumini;</hi> and I
doubt not but many of the nice Points
that are now much valued and urg'd by
some, would be as well disapproved by
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as by <hi>Aristotle;</hi> and should be
as little entertain'd by an Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
as a Rigid Philosopher. I do not
therefore allow all <hi>that</hi> for Gospel,
which is taught for such in a Preachers
Pulpit, or ev'n a Professors Chair. And
therefore, if Scholastick Writers, of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48223:168"/>
what Church soever, take the liberty of
imposing upon the Christian Religion
their Metaphysical Speculations, or any
other meerly humane Doctrines, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, I who, not without some
Examination, think Metaphysicks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
not to have been for the most
part over-well understood, and apply'd,
shall make bold to leave all such private
Doctrines to be defended by their own
Broachers or Abettors; and shall deny,
that it will follow, That in case of this
multitude of Placets, which some bold
Men have been pleased to adopt into
the Catalogue of Christian Verities,
any or all should be found inconsistent
with right Reason, the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must be so too. For by that name I
understand onely that System of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
Truths that are clearly deliver'd
in the Scriptures; or by legitimate and
manifest consequences deduc'd thence.
And by this one Declaration so many
unnecessary and perhaps hurtful Retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to Christianity will be at once
thrown off, that I doubt not, but if you
consider the Matter aright, you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
discern, that by this first Distinction
I have much lessen'd the work that is to
be done by those that are to follow it.</p>

                     <head>SECT. II.</head>
                     <p>In the next place, among the things
that seem not rational in Religion, I
make a great difference between those,
in which unenlightned Reason is manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a competent Iudge, and those which
Natural Reason it self may discern to be
out of its Sphere.</p>
                     <p>You will allow me, That Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Theology is sufficient to evince
the Existence of the Deity; and we
know that many of the old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
that were unassisted by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were, by the force of Reason, led
to discover and confess a God, that is, a
Being supremely perfect; under which
Notion divers of them expresly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
him. Now, if there be such a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
'tis but reasonable to conceive, that
there may be many things relating to
his Nature, his Will, and his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of things, that are without the
<hi>Sphere</hi> of meer or unassisted Reason.
For, if his Attributes and Perfections
be not fully comprehensible to our
Reason, we can have but inadequate
Conceptions of them; and since God
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48223:169"/>
is a Being, <hi>toto Coelo,</hi> as they speak, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from all other Beings, there may be
some things in his Nature, and in the
manner of his Existence, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Example or perfect Analogy
in inferior Beings. For we see, that
ev'n in Man himself the Coexistence
and intimate Union of the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that is, an Immaterial and a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
substance, is without all President
or Parallel in Nature. And though the
truth of this Union may be prov'd; yet
the manner of it was never yet, nor
perhaps ever will be, in this Life clearly
understood, (to which purpose I shall
elsewhere say more.) Moreover, if we
suppose God to be Omnipotent, (that
is, to be able to do whatever involves
no Contradiction that it should be
done,) we must allow him to be able
to do many things that no other Agent
can afford us any Examples of, and some
of them perhaps such, as we, who are
but finite, and are wont to judge of
things by Analogy, cannot conceive
how they can be perform'd. Of the
last sort of things may be the recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a sufficient quantity of the scatter'd
matter of a Dead humane Body, and the
contriving of it so, that (whether alone
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48223:169"/>
or with some addition of other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)
upon a reconjunction with the
Soul, it may again constitute a living
Man, and so effect that Wonder we call
the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Of the latter sort is
the Creation of Matter out of nothing,
and much more the like Production of
those Rational and Intelligent Beings,
<hi>Humane Souls.</hi> For as for <hi>Angels</hi> (good
or bad,) I doubt, whether meer Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
can evince their Existence,
though I think it may the possibility
thereof. And since we allow the Deity
a Wisdom equal to this boundless Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
'tis but reasonable to conceive, that
these unlimited Attributes conspiring
may produce Contrivances and frame
Designs, which we Men must be unable
(at least of our selves) sufficiently to
understand, and to reach to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of. And by this way of arguing
it may be made to appear, That there
may be many things relating to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
above the reach of unenlightned
humane Reason. Not that I affirm <hi>all</hi>
these things to be in their own Nature
incomprehensible to us (though <hi>some</hi>
of them may be so,) when they are
once propos'd; but that Reason by its
own light could not discover them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48223:170"/>
and therefore it must owe its
knowledge of them to Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if God vouchsafes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
those things to us, since not only
he must needs know about his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Attributes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what we cannot
possibly know unless he tells us, and
since we know, that whatever he tells
us is infallibly true, we have abundant
Reason to believe rather what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
to us concerning Himself and
Divine things, than what we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
or guess about them by Analogy
to things of a nature infinitely distant
from his, or by Maxims fram'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of inferior Beings. If
therefore he clearly reveal to us, That
there is in the Godhead, Three distinct
Persons, and yet that God is One, we,
that think our selves bound to believe
God's Testimony in all other Cases,
ought sure not to disbelieve it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself, but to acknowledge, that in
an unparallel'd and incomprehensible
Being, there may be a manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
not to be parallel'd in any other
Being, though it should never be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by us Men, who cannot clearly
comprehend, how in our selves two such
distant Natures as that of a gross Body
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48223:170"/>
and an immaterial Spirit, should be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so as to make up one Man. In such
cases therefore as we are now speaking
of, there must indeed be something that
looks like captivating ones Reason, but
'tis a submission that Reason it self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
us to make; and he that in such
points as these believes rather what the
Divine Writings teach him, than what
he would think if they had never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him, does not renounce or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
his Reason, but suffers it to be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil
to an Omniscient and Infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer,
who can teach him such things,
as neither his own meer Reason, nor any
others could ever have discovered to
him.</p>
                     <p>I thought to have here dismiss'd this
Proposition, but I must not omit to give
it a confirmation afforded me by chance
(or rather Providence:) For, since I
writ the last Paragraph, resuming a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Enquiry, I met in prosecuting
it with a couple of Testimonies of the
truth of what I was lately telling you,
which are given not by Divines or
Schoolmen, but by a couple of famous
Mathematicians, that have both led the
way to many of the Modern Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
to shake off the reverence wont
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48223:171"/>
to be born to the Authority of great
Names, and have advanc'd Reason in a
few years more than such as <hi>Vaninus</hi> and
<hi>Pomponatius</hi> would do in many Ages;
and have always boldly, and sometimes
successfully attempted to explain intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly
those things, which others scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
not either openly or tacitly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
inexplicable.</p>
                     <p>The first of these Testimonies I met
with in a little <hi>French</hi> Treatise put out
by some Mathematician, who, though
he conceals his Name, appears by his
way of writing to be a great <hi>Virtuoso,</hi>
and takes upon him to give his Readers
in <hi>French</hi> the new thoughts of <hi>Galilaeo,</hi>
by making that the Title of his Book.
This Writer then speaking of a Paradox
(which I but recite) of <hi>Galilaeo's,</hi> that
makes a point equal to a Circle, adds,
<hi>Et per consequent l'on peut dire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pag. 22, 23.</note>
                        <hi>i. e.</hi> and consequently one
may say, that all Circles are equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
themselves, since each of them is
equal to a point. For though the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
be overpower'd by this Idea or
Notion; yet Reason will suffer it self
to be persuaded of it. I know <hi>(con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
he)</hi> divers other excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(besides <hi>Galilaeo</hi>) who conclude
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48223:171"/>
the same thing by other ways, but all
are constrain'd to acknowledge, that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible</hi>
and <hi>infinite</hi> are things that do
so swallow up the mind of Man, that he
scarce knows what to pitch on, when he
contemplates them. For it will follow
from <hi>Galilaeo</hi>'s Speculation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
passage I have cited, to shew you, that
<hi>Galilaeo</hi> is not the only Philosopher and
Mathematician who has confess'd his
Reason quite passed about the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of what is Infinite.</p>
                     <p>The other Testimony I mention'd to
you, is that of the excellent <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>
in the second Part of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Philosophy,<note place="margin">Numb. 34:</note> where
speaking of the Circle to be made by
Matter moving through places still les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
and lesser, he has this ingenious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment;
<hi>Fatendum tamen est</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>in motu isto aliquid reperiri,
quod mens quidem nostra percipit esse
verum, sed tamen quo pacto fiat non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendit,
nempe Divisionem quarundam
particularum Materiae in infinitum, sive
indefinitam, atque in tot partes ut nulla
cogitatione determinare possimus tam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iguam,
quin intelligamus ipsam in alias
adhuc minores reipsa esse divisam.</hi> And
in the Close of the next Paragraph, he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48223:172"/>
gives this for a Reason, why, though we
cannot comprehend this indefinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
yet we ought not to doubt of
the truth of it, That we discern it to
be of that kind of things that cannot
be compriz'd by our minds as being but
finite.</p>
                     <p>If then such bold and piercing Wits,
and such excellent Mathematicians are
forc'd to confess, that not only their
own Reason, but that of Mankind may
be passed and non-plus'd about <hi>Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which is an Object of contemplation
Natural, nay, Mathematical, and which
is the Subject of the rigid Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of pure Mathematicks; why should
we think it unfit to be believ'd, and to
be acknowledg'd, that in the Attributes
of God, who is essentially an Infinite
Being, and an <hi>Ens singularissimum,</hi> and in
divers other Divine things, of which
we can have no knowledge without
Revelation, there should be some things,
that our Finite understandings cannot,
especially in this life, clearly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="section">

                     <head>SECT. III.</head>
                     <p>To this Consideration, I shall for Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
sake subjoin another, which I leave
to your Liberty to look upon, as a distinct
one, or as an Enlargement and Application
of the former.</p>
                     <p>I consider then, that there is a great
difference between a Doctrines being
repugnant to the general and well-weigh'd
Rules or Dictates of Reason, in
the forming of which Rules it may be
suppos'd to have been duly consider'd;
and its disagreeing with Axioms, at the
Establishment whereof the Doctrine in
Question was probably never thought
on. There are several Rules that pass
current ev'n among the most Learned
Men, and which are indeed of very great
use when restrain'd to those things
whence they took their Rise, and others
of the like nature; which yet ought
not to overthrow those Divine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
that seem not consonant to them.
For the Framers of these Rules having
generally built them upon the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
they had made of Natural and
Moral things, since (as we lately argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48223:173"/>
Reason it self cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
there are some things out of its
Sphere, we must not think it impossible,
that there may be Rules, which will
hold in all inferior Beings for which
they were made; and yet not reach to
that infinite and most singular Being
call'd God, and to some Divine matters
which were not taken into Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
when those Rules were fram'd. And
indeed, if we consider God as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Universe, and the free Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisher
of the Laws of Motion, whose
general Concourse is necessary to the
Conservation and Efficacy of every
particular Physical Agent, we cannot
but acknowledge, that by with-holding
his Concourse or changing these Laws
of Motion, which depend perfectly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Will, he may invalidate most, if
not all, the Axioms and Theorems of
Natural Philosophy: These supposing
the Course of Nature, and especially the
Establish'd Laws of Motion among the
parts of the Universal Matter, as those
upon which all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
depend. 'Tis a Rule in Natural
Philosophy, that <hi>Causae necessariae semper
agunt quantum possunt;</hi> But it will not
follow from thence, that the Fire must
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48223:173"/>
necessarily burn <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
or their Cloaths, that were cast
by the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King's Command into
the midst of a Burning fiery Furnace,
when the Author of Nature was pleas'd
to withdraw his Concourse to the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the flames, or supernaturally
to defend against them the Bodies that
were exposed to them. That Men once
truly dead cannot be brought to life
again, hath been in all Ages the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of meer Philosophers; but though
this be true according to the Course of
Nature, yet it will not follow but that
the contrary may be true, if God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
either to recall the departed Soul
and reconjoin it to the Body, if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization
of this be not too much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,
or by so altering the Fabrick of
the matter whereof the Carkass con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
as to restore it to a fitness for the
Exercise of the Functions of Life. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably
to this let me observe to you,
that, though it be unreasonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Miraculous Effect when attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
onely to a meer Physical Agent; yet
the same thing may reasonably be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
when ascrib'd to God, or to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
assisted with his absolute or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Power. That a Man born
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48223:174"/>
blind should in a trice recover his sight
upon the Application of Clay and Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
would justly appear incredible, if
the Cure were ascrib'd to one that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a meer Man; but it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that it ought to be incredible, that
the Son of God should work it. And
the like may be said of all the Miracles
perform'd by Christ, and those Apostles
and other Disciples of his, that acted by
virtue of a Divine Power and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
For in all these and the like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it suffices not to make ones Belief ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational,
that the things believ'd are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be true according to the
course of Nature; but it must be shewn,
either that they are impossible even to
the Power of God to which they are
ascrib'd, or that the Records, we have
of them, are not sufficient to beget Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in the nature of a Testimony; which
latter Objection against these Relations
is Forreign to our present Discourse.
And as the Rules about the power of
Agents will not all of them hold in
God; so I might shew the like, if I had
time, concerning some of his other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes:
Insomuch that ev'n in point of
Justice, wherein we think we may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
make Estimates of what may or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48223:174"/>
may not be done, there may be <hi>some</hi>
cases, wherein God's supreme Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as Maker and Governor of the
World, places him above <hi>some</hi> of those
Rules; I say, <hi>some,</hi> for I say not above
<hi>all</hi> those Rules of Justice which oblige
all inferior Beings, without excepting
the greatest and most absolute Monarchs
themselves. I will not give Examples
of his Power of Pardoning or Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Penalties, which is but a relaxing
of his own Right; but will rather give
an instance in his Power of afflicting
and exterminating Men, without any
Provocation given him by them. I will
not here enter upon the Controversie
<hi>de Iure Dei in Creaturas,</hi> upon what it is
founded, and how far it reaches. For,
without making my self a party in that
Quarrel, I think, I may safely say, that
God by his right of Dominion, might,
without any violation of the Laws of
Justice, have destroy'd and ev'n annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before they had
eaten of the forbidden Fruit, or had
been commanded to abstain from it. For
Man being as much and as intirely God's
Workmanship as any of the other
Creatures; unless God had oblig'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by some promise or pact to limit the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48223:175"/>
Exercise of his absolute dominion over
him, God was no more bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> long alive, than he
was to preserve a Lamb, or a Pigeon;
and therefore, as we allow, that he
might justly recall the Lives he had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
those innocent Creatures when he
pleas'd, (as actually he often order'd
them to be kill'd and burn'd in Sacrifice
to him:) so he might, for the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Power to the Angels, or for
other Reasons, have suddenly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Lives of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> though
they had never offended him. And upon
the same grounds he might without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
have annihilated, I say not,
damn'd their Souls; he being no more
bound to continue Existence to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler,
than a less noble Creature: As he
is no more bound to keep an <hi>Eagle</hi> than
an <hi>Oyster</hi> always alive. I know, there
is a difference betwixt Gods resuming
a Being he lent <hi>Adam,</hi> and his doing the
same to inferior Creatures: But that
disparity, if it concern any of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
will concern some other than
his Justice; which allow'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
at pleasure the Being he had only
lent them, or lay any Affliction on them
that were lesser than that Good could
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48223:175"/>
countervail. But mentioning this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
only occasionally, I shall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
it any further, but rather mind
you of the Result of this and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Consideration; which is, That
Divinely reveal'd Truths may <hi>seem</hi> to
be repugnant to the dictates of Reason,
when they do <hi>but seem</hi> to be so: Nor
does Christianity oblige us to question
such Rules as to the cases they were
fram'd for, but the application of them
<hi>to</hi> the Nature of God, who has already
been truly said to be <hi>Ens singularissimum,</hi>
and <hi>to</hi> his absolute Power and Will; so
that we do not reject the Rules we
speak of, but rather limit them; and
when we have restrain'd them to their
due bounds, we may safely admit
them.</p>
                     <p>From Mens not taking notice of, or
not pondering this necessary limitation
of many Axioms deliver'd in general
terms, seems to have proceeded a great
Error, which has made so many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men presume to say, That this or
that thing is true in Philosophy, but
false in Divinity, or on the contrary:
As for instance, that a Virgin, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such, may have a Child, is look'd
upon as an Article which Theology as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48223:176"/>
to be true, and Philosophy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
impossible. But the Objection
is grounded upon a mistake, which
might have been prevented by wording
the Propositions more warily and fully.
For though we grant, that, Physically
speaking, 'tis false, that a Virgin can
bring forth a Child; yet that signifies
no more, than that, according to the
course of Nature, such a thing cannot
come to pass; but speaking absolutely
and indefinitely, without confining the
Effect to meer Physical Agents, it may
safely be deny'd that Philosophy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
it impossible that a Virgin
should be a Mother. For why should
the Author of Nature be confin'd to the
ways of working of dependent and
finite Agents? And to apply the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the Divines that hold the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I oppose; I shall demand, why God
may not out of the substance of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
form a Man, without the help of a
Man, as well as at the beginning of the
substance of a Man he form'd a Woman
without the concurrence of a Woman?
And so, that <hi>Iron</hi> being a Body far hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,
(<hi>in specie,</hi> as they speak,) will,
if upheld by no other Body, sink in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is a Truth in Natural Philosophy;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48223:176"/>
but since Physicks themselves lead Men
to the acknowledgment of a God, 'tis
not repugnant to Reason, that, if God
please to interpose his Power, he may
(as in <hi>Elisha</hi>'s case) make <hi>Iron</hi> swim, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by withholding his concourse to the
Agents, whatever they be that cause
Gravity in Bodies, or perhaps by other
ways unknown to us; since a vigorous
Loadstone may, as I have more than
once try'd, keep a piece of Iron, which
it touches not, swimming in the Air,
though this thin Body must contribute
far less, than water would, to the
sustaining it aloft.</p>
                     <p>That strict Philosopher <hi>Des Cartes,</hi>
who has with great Wit and no less
Applause attempted to carry the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Powers of matters higher than
any of the Modern Philosophers; this
Naturalist, I say, that ascribes so great a
power to <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> was so far
from thinking, that what was impossible
to them, must be so to God too, that,
though he were urg'd by a learned Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
with an Argument as likely as
any to give him a strong Temptation to
limit the Omnipotence of God; yet
ev'n on this occasion he scruples not to
make this ingenious and wary Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48223:177"/>
and that in a private Letter;
<hi>For my part,</hi> says he, <hi>I think we ought
never to say of any thing that 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to God. For all that is true and
good being dependent on his Almightiness,
I dare not so much as say, that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make a Mountain without a Valley or
cannot make it true,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Volum. second Lettre vi.</note> 
                        <hi>that one
and two shall not make three;
but I say only, that he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me a Soul of such a nature, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive a Mountain without a Valley,
nor that the Aggregate of one and of two
shall not make three,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I say only,
that such things imply a Contradiction in
my Conception.</hi> And consonantly to
this in his Principles of Philosophy he
gives on a certain occasion this useful
Caution,—<hi>Quod ut satis tutò &amp; sine er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi

eâ nobis cautela est utendum,</hi>

                     <p>In the next place, I think we ought to
distinguish between Reason consider'd in
it self, and Reason consider'd in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of it, by this or that Philosopher or
by this or that Man, or by this or that
Company or Society of Men, whether all
of one Sect, or of more.</p>
                     <p>If you will allow me to borrow a
School-phrase, I shall express this more
shortly by saying I distinguish between
Reason <hi>in Abstracto,</hi> and <hi>in Concreto.</hi>
To clear this matter, we may consider,
That whatever you make the Faculty
of Reason to be in it self, yet the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocinations
it produces are made by
Men, either singly reasoning, or concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the same Ratiocinations and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions;
and consequently, if these
Men do not make the best use of their
Reasoning Faculty, it will not be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
that what thwarts <hi>their</hi> Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
must likewise thwart the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or the Dictates of <hi>right Reason.</hi> For,
Man having a Will and Affections as
well as an Intellect, though our Dijudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and Tenents ought indeed (in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48223:178"/>
matters speculative) to be made and
pitch'd upon by our unbiass'd Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings;
yet really our Intellectual
Weaknesses, or our Prejudices, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possession
by Custom, Education, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
our Interest, Passions, Vices, and I know
not how many other things, have so
great and swaying an Influence on
them, that there are very few Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that we make, or Opinions that we
espouse, that are so much the pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of our Reason, that no personal
Disability, Prejudice, or Fault, has any
Interest in them.</p>
                     <p>This I have elsewhere
more amply discours'd of
on another occasion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall now add but this,<note place="margin">About the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions.</note>
That the distinction, I have been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
does (if I mistake not) reach a
great deal further than you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of. For not only whole Sects,
whether in Religion or Philosophy, are
in many cases subject to Prepossessions,
Envy, Ambition, Interest, and other
misleading things, as well as single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but, which is more considerable
to our present purpose, the very Body
of Mankind may be embued with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and Errors, and that from their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48223:178"/>
Childhood, and some also ev'n from
their Birth, by which means they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
undiscern'd and consequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reform'd.</p>
                     <p>This you will think an Accusation as
bold as high; but to let you see, that
the Philosophers, you most respect, have
made the same Observation, though
not apply'd to the same case, I must put
you in mind, that Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
begins his Principles of Philosophy
with taking notice, That, because we
are born Children, we make divers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Judgments of things, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
are wont to continue with us all
our Lives, and prove radicated Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that mislead our Judgments on so
many occasions, that he elsewhere tells
us, he found no other way to secure
himself from their Influence, but once
in his Life solemnly to doubt of the
Truth of all that he had till then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
in order to the re-examining of
his former Dijudications. But I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
our illustrious <hi>Verulam</hi> warrants a
yet further Prejudice against many
things that are wont to be look'd on as
the suggestions of Reason. For having
told us, That the Mind of Man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
with four differing kinds of Idols
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48223:179"/>
or Phantasms, when he comes to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them, he teaches, that there are not
only such as Men get by Conversation
and Discourse one with another, and
such as proceed from the divers <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
or <hi>Theories</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and from the perverse ways of
Demonstration, and likewise such as are
personal to this or that Man, proceeding
from his Education, Temperament, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but such as he calls <hi>Idola tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
because they are founded in humane
Nature it self, and in the very Tribe or
Nation of Mankind; and of these he
particularly discourses of seven or eight;
As that the Intellect of Man has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Propensity to suppose in things a
greater order and equality than it finds,
and that being unable to rest or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce,
it does alwayes tend further and
further; to which he adds divers other
innate prejudices of Mankind, which
he sollicitously as well as judiciously
endeavors to remove.</p>
                     <p>Now, if not only single Philosophers,
and particular Sects, but the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Mankind be subject to be sway'd
by innate and unheeded Prejudices and
Proclivities to Errors about matters
that are neither Divine, nor Moral, nor
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48223:179"/>
Political, but Physical, where the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of Truth is exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to humane Nature, and is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with consequences distasteful to
it: Why may not we justly suspect not
only this or that Philosopher or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Sect; but the generality of Men,
of having some secret propensities to
err about Divine things, and indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to admit Truths, which not only
detect the weaknesses of our Nature,
and our personal disabilities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
offend or mortifie our Pride and
our Ambition, but shine into the Mind
with so clear as well as pure and
chaste a light, as is proper both to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to our selves and others our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Faults, and oftentimes to cross
our Designs and Interests?</p>
                     <p>And to this purpose we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that divers of those very Idols,
which my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> observes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
or pervert Mens Judgments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to things <hi>Natural,</hi> may probably
have the same kind of influence (and
that much stronger) on the minds of
Men in reference to <hi>Supernatural</hi> things.
Thus he takes notice, that, if some
things have once pleas'd the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
'tis apt to draw all others to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48223:180"/>
comport with, and give Suffrage, to
them, though perhaps the Inducements
to the contrary belief be either more
numerous or more weighty. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
also, that Man is apt to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his senses and other perceptions as
the measures of things, and also, that the
understanding of Man is not sincerely
dispos'd to receive the light of Truth,
but receives an infusion as it were of
adventitious Colours (that disguise the
light) from the Will and Affections,
which makes him sooner believe those
things that he is desirous should be true,
and reject many others upon Accounts
that do no way infer their being false.
Now if we apply these things to Divine
Truths (to which 'twere well they
were less justly applicable) and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that in our Youth we generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
but with things Corporeal, and are
sway'd by Affections that have them
for their Objects, we shall not much
wonder, that Men should be very prone,
<hi>either</hi> to frame such Notions of Divine
things as they were wont to have about
others of a far different and meaner na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<hi>or</hi> else to reject them for not being
Analogous to those things which they
have been us'd to employ for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48223:180"/>
of truth and falsity. And if we
consider the inbred pride of man, which
is such, that if we will believe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
story, ev'n <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be like God knowing good and
evil, we shall not so much marvel, that
almost every man in particular makes
the Notions he has entertain'd already,
and his Senses, his Inclinations and his
Interests, the Standards by which he
estimates and judges of all other things,
whether natural or reveal'd. And as
<hi>Heraclitus</hi> justly complain'd, that every
man sought the knowledge of natural
things in the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> that is, himself,
and not in the <hi>Macrocosm,</hi> the World;
so we may justly complain, that men
seek all the knowledge, they care to
find, or will admit, either in these little
worlds themselves, or from that great
World, the Universe; but not from
the Omniscient Author of them both.
And lastly, if ev'n in purely Physical
things, where one would not think it
likely, that rational Beings should seek
Truth with any other designs than of
finding and enjoying it, our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are so universally byass'd, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon by our Wills and Affections;
how can we admire, especially if we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48223:181"/>
admit the fall of our first Parents, that
our Passions and Interests, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
our Vices should pervert our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects
about those reveal'd Truths;
divers of which we discern to be above
our comprehensions, and more of which
we find to be directly contrary to our
Inclinations,</p>

                     <p>And now 'twill be seasonable for me
to tell you, That I think, there may be
a great difference betwixt a things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to <hi>right Reason,</hi> or so much
as to any <hi>true Philosophy,</hi> and its being
contrary to the <hi>receiv'd Opinions</hi> of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
or to the Principles or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of <hi>this or that Sect</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>For here I may justly apply to my
present purpose, what <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>
judiciously said on another Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
that Philosophy was neither Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetical,
nor Stoical, nor Epicurean,
but whatsoever among all those several
parties was fit to be approv'd.</p>
                     <p>And indeed if we survey the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi>
and Opinions of the several Sects
of Philosophers, especially in those
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48223:181"/>
points wherein they hold things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Theological Truths, we shall
find many of them so slightly grounded,
and so disagreeing among themselves,
that a severe and inquisitive Examiner
would see little cause to admit them
upon the bare Account of his being a
Philosopher, though he did not see any
to reject them upon the Account of his
being a Christian. And in particular,
as to the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> who by invading
all the Schools of <hi>Europe</hi> (and some in
<hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi>) have made their Sect
almost Catholick, and have produc'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the famous Questioners of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in the last Age, and the first
part of this; the World begins to be
apace undeceiv'd as to many of their
Doctrines, which were as confidently
taught and believ'd for many Ages, as
those that are repugnant to our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and there is now scarce any of the
modern Philosophers that allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the free use of their Reason,
who believes any longer, <hi>that</hi> there is
an Element of Fire lodg'd under the
suppos'd Sphere of the Moon; <hi>that</hi>
Heaven consists of solid Orbs; <hi>that</hi> all
Celestial Bodies are ingenerable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible;
<hi>that</hi> the Heart, rather than
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48223:182"/>
the Brain, is the Origine of Nerves;
<hi>that</hi> the torrid Zone is uninhabitable;
and I know not how many other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the <hi>Aristotelians,</hi> which our
<hi>Corpuscularian</hi> Philosophers think so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
worth being believ'd, that they
would censure him, that should now
think them worthy to be sollicitously
confuted; upon which score, I presume
you will allow me to leave those and
divers others as weak Peripatetick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
to fall by their own groundles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>But you will tell me, that the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi>
and the <hi>Somatici,</hi> that will allow
nothing but Body in the World, nor no
Author of it but Chance, are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Enemies to Religion than the
<hi>Aristotelians.</hi> And indeed I am apt to
think they are so, but they may well be
so without deserving to have any of
their Sects look'd upon as Philosophy it
self, there being none of them that I
know of, that maintain any Opinion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with Christianity, that I think
may not be made appear to be also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to Reason, or at least not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable
by it. You will not expect
I should descend to particulars, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
having expresly discours'd against
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48223:182"/>
the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Hypothesis of the Origine
of the World in another Paper; and
therefore I shall observe to you in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophers, who
lay aside all Supernatural Revelation in
their Inquiries into Natural things, do
yet both think, and, as to the two first
of them, very plausibly prove, the three
grand Principles of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> That the
little Bodies he calls Atoms are indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
That they all have their motion
from themselves, and That there is a
<hi>vacuum</hi> in <hi>rerum naturá,</hi> to be as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to meer Reason, as the <hi>Epicureans</hi>
think the Notion of an Incorporeal
Substance, or the Creation of the
World, or the Immortality of the Soul.
And as for the new <hi>Somatici,</hi> such as
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> (and some few others) by
what I have yet seen of his, I am not
much tempted to forsake any thing that
I look'd upon as a Truth before, ev'n in
Natural Philosophy it self, upon the
score of what he (though never so
confidently) delivers, by which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I see not, that he hath made any great
discovery either of new Truths, or old
Errors. An Honourable Member of the
Royal Society, hath elsewhere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
shewn, how ill he has prov'd his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48223:183"/>
own Opinions about the Air, and some
other Physical Subjects, and how ill he
has understood and oppos'd those of
his Adversary. But to give you in this
place a <hi>Specimen</hi> how little their repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
to his Principles or Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
ought to affright us from those
Theological Doctrines they contradict,
I shall here (but not in the Body of this
Discourse, for fear of too much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
it) examine the fundamental
Maxim of his whole Physicks, <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is removed but by a Body contiguous
and moved;</hi> it having been already shewn
(by the Gentleman newly mention'd)
that, as to the next to it, which is, <hi>that
there is no vacuum,</hi> whether it be <hi>true</hi> or
no, <hi>he</hi> has not <hi>prov'd</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>If no Body can possibly be moved
but by a Body contiguous and moved,
as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> teaches; I demand, How
there comes to be Local motion in the
World? For, <hi>either</hi> all the portions of
matter that compos'd the Universe, have
motion belonging to their Nature,
which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> affirm'd for their
Atoms; <hi>or</hi> some parts of Matter have
this motive power, and some have not;
or else none of them have it, but all of
them are naturally devoid of Motion.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48223:183"/>
If it be granted, that Motion does na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
belong to all parts of Matter, the
dispute is at an end, the concession quite
overthrowing the <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> If it be
said, that naturally some portions of
Matter have Motion, and others not,
then the Assertion will not be Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
true: For though it may hold in
the parts that are naturally moveless or
quiescent, yet it will not do so in the
others, there being nothing that may
shew a necessity, why a Body, to which
Motion is natural, should not be capable
of moving without being put into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by another contiguous and moved.
And if there be no Body to which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is natural, but every Body needs an
outward movent, it may well be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
How there comes to be any thing
Locally mov'd in the World; which yet
constant and obvious experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates,
and Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny. For if no part of Matter
have any Motion but what it must owe
to another that is contiguous to it, and
being it self in Motion impels it; and
if there be nothing but <hi>Matter</hi> in the
World, how can there come to be any
Motion amongst Bodies, since they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have it upon the score of their own
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48223:184"/>
nature, nor can receive it from external
Agents. If Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> should reply, that
the Motion is impress'd upon any of the
parts of the Matter by <hi>God,</hi> he will say
that which I most readily grant to be
true, but will not serve <hi>his</hi> turn, if he
would speak congruously to his own
<hi>Hypothesis.</hi> For I demand, Whether
this Supreme Being, that the Assertion
has recourse to, be a Corporeal or an
Incorporeal Substance? If it be the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and yet be the efficient Cause of
Motion in Bodies, then it will not be
Universally true, that whatsoever Body
is moved, is so by a <hi>Body</hi> contiguous and
moved. For, in our supposition, the
Bodies that God moves either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
or by the intervention of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Immaterial Being, are not moved
by a <hi>Body</hi> contiguous, but by an <hi>Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi>
Spirit. But because Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> in
some Writings of his, is believed to
think the very Notion of an Immaterial
Substance to be absurd, and to involve
a Contradiction, and because it may be
subsum'd, that if God be not an Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substance, he must by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
be a Material and Corporeal
one, there being no <hi>Medium Negationis,</hi>
or third Substance that is none of those
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48223:184"/>
two: I answer, That, if this be said, and
so that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Deity be a Corporeal
one, the same difficulty will recurr, that
I urg'd before. For this Body will not,
by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s calling or thinking it <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
cease to be a true Body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
a portion of <hi>Divine</hi> Matter
will not be able to move a portion of
our <hi>Mundane</hi> Matter without it be it
self contiguous and moved; which it
cannot be but by another portion of
Divine Matter so qualified to impress a
Motion, nor this again but by another
portion.</p>
                     <p>And besides, that it will breed a
strange confusion in rendring the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Causes of things, unless an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
be found to teach us how to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
accurately the <hi>Mundane</hi> Bodies
from the <hi>Divine</hi> (which will perhaps
prove no easie task;) I see not yet, how
this <hi>Corporeal Deity</hi> will make good the
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> I examine. For I demand,
How this <hi>Divine Matter</hi> comes to have
this Local Motion that is ascrib'd to it?
If it be answer'd, That it hath it from
its own Nature, without any other
Cause; since the <hi>Epicureans</hi> affirm the
same of their Atoms, or meerly <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane</hi>
Matter, I demand, How the Truth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48223:185"/>
of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Opinion will appear to
me, to whom it seems as likely by the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature that occur, that
<hi>Mundane</hi> Matter should have a congenit
Motion, as that any thing that is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
can be <hi>God,</hi> and capable of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it; which to be, it must, for ought
we know, have its Subsistence divided
into as many minute parts, as there are
Corpuscles and Particles in the World
that move separately from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
ones. And, to draw towards
a Conclusion, I say, that these minute
<hi>Divine</hi> Bodies, that thus moved those
portions of <hi>Mundane</hi> Matter, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> denies that they
can be moved but by Bodies contiguous
and moved, these Divine Substances, I
say, are, according to the late supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
true Bodies, and yet are moved
themselves not by Bodies contiguous
and moved, but by a Motion which must
be <hi>Innate,</hi> deriv'd or flowing from their
very essence or nature, since no such
Body is pretended to have a Being as
cannot be refer'd as a portion, either to
the <hi>Mundane,</hi> or the <hi>Divine</hi> Matter. In
short, since Local Motion is to be found
in one, if not in both, of these two
Matters, it must be natural to (at least
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48223:185"/>
some parts of) one of them in Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Hypothesis; for, though he
should grant an <hi>Immaterial</hi> Being, yet it
could not produce a Motion in any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
since, according to him, no Body
can be moved but by another <hi>Body</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
and mov'd.</p>
                     <p>As then to this grand Position of Mr.
<hi>Hobbs,</hi> though, if it were cautiously
propos'd as it is by <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> it may
perhaps be safely admitted, because <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesius</hi>
acknowledges, the first Impulse
that set Matter a moving, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Motion once begun, to
come from God; yet, as 'tis crudely
propos'd by the favourers of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi>
I am so far from seeing any such cogent
Proof for it, (as were to be wish'd for
a Principle on which he builds so much,
and which yet is not at all evident by
its own light,) that I see no competent
Reason to admit it.</p>
                     <p>I expect your Friend should here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to what I have been saying, that
formerly recited Sentence, that is so
commonly employ'd in the Schools as
well of Divines as of Philosophers:
That such or such an Opinion is true in
Divinity, but false in Philosophy; or
on the contrary, Philosophically true,
but Theologically false.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48223:186"/>Upon what Warrant those, that are
wont to employ such Expressions,
ground their Practice, I leave to them
to make out; but as to the Objection it
self, as it supposes these ways of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be well grounded, give me leave
to consider, That <hi>Philosophy</hi> may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
two things, which I take to be very
differing.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>first</hi> 'tis most commonly employ'd
to signifie a System or Body of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and other Doctrines of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Sect of those Philosophers that
make use of the Word. As when an
<hi>Aristotelian</hi> talks of Philosophy, he usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
means the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> as an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean</hi>
do's the <hi>Atomical,</hi> or a <hi>Platonist</hi>
the <hi>Platonick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we may also in a more general
and no less just Acception of the term,
understand by Philosophy, a Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of all those Truths or Doctrines,
which the natural Reason of man, freed
from Prejudices and Partiality, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by Learning, Attention, Exercise,
Experiments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can manifestly make
out, or by necessary consequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from clear and certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48223:186"/>This being briefly premis'd, I must in
the next place put you in mind of what
I formerly observ'd to you, that many
Opinions are maintain'd by this or that
Sect of Christians, or perhaps by the
Divinity-Schools of more than one or
two Sects, which either do not at all
belong to the Christian Religion, or at
least ought not to be look'd upon as
parts of it, but upon supposition, that
the Philosophical Principles and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinations,
upon which, and not upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
or meer Revelation, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
to be founded, are agreable to
right Reason.</p>
                     <p>And having premis'd these two
things, I now answer more directly to
the Objection; that, if Philosophy be
taken in the first sense above-mention'd,
its teaching things repugnant to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
especially taking this word in the
more large and vulgar sense of it, will
not cogently conclude any thing against
the Christian Religion. But, if Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
be taken in the latter sense for
true Philosophy, and Divinity only for
a System of those Articles that are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reveal'd as Truths in the Scriptures;
I shall not allow any thing to be false in
Philosophy so understood that is true in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48223:187"/>
Divinity so explain'd, till I see some
clearer Proof of it than I have yet met
with. I have had occasion in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Discourse, to say something, that
may be apply'd to the Point under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
and in the following part of this
Letter I shall have Occasion to touch
upon it again: And therefore I shall
now say but this in short, That 'tis not
likely, that God, being the Author of
Reason as well as Revelation, should
make it mens Duty to believe as true
that which there is just Reason to reject
as false.</p>
                     <p>There is indeed a Sense, wherein the
Phrases, I disapprove, may be tolerated.
For if by saying, that such a thing is
true in Divinity, but false in Philosophy,
it were meant, that if the Doctrine were
propos'd to a meer Philosopher, to be
judg'd of according to the Principles of
his Sect, or at most according to what
he, being suppos'd not to have heard of
the Christian Religion, or had it duly
propos'd to him, would reject it, the
Phrase might be allow'd, or at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd.
But then we must consider,
that the Reason why such a Philosopher
would reject the Articles of Christian
Faith, would not be, because they could
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48223:187"/>
by no <hi>Mediums</hi> be possibly prov'd, but
because these Doctrines being founded
upon a Revelation, which he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
either not to have heard of, or
not to have had sufficiently propos'd to
him, he must, as a Rational man, refuse to
believe them upon the score of their
Prooflesness. And the same Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
supposing him to be a true one,
though he will be very wary, how he
admits any thing as true that is not
prov'd, if it fall properly under the
cognizance of Philosophy; yet he will
be as wary, how he pronounces things to
be false or impossible in matters which
he discerns to be beyond the reach of
meer natural Reason, especially if So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Learned men do very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
pretend to know something of
those matters by Divine Revelation,
which though he will not easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be a true one, yet he will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
in case it should be prov'd true, to
be a fit <hi>Medium</hi> to evince Truths, which,
upon the Account of meer natural
Light, he could not discover or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.
To be short, such a Philosopher
would indeed reject some of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our Faith hypothetically, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48223:188"/>
upon supposition that he need employ
no other Touchstone to examine them
by, than the Principles and Dictates of
<hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> that he is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with (upon which score I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shew, that divers strange Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Experiments, and other Discoveries
would also be rejected;) but yet he
would not pronounce them false, but
upon supposition that the Arguments,
by which they lay claim to <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
are incompetent in their kind.
For as he will not easily believe any
thing within the Sphere of Nature that
agrees not with the Establish'd Laws of
it; so he will not easily adventure to
pronounce one way or other in matters
that are <hi>beyond</hi> the Sphere of Nature:
He will indeed (as he justly may,) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
as full a Proof of the Divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
that is pretended, as the Nature
of the thing requires and allows; but
he will not be backward to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that God, to whom that Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is ascrib'd, is able to know and to do
many more things than we can expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<hi>How He</hi> can discover, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
How any <hi>Physical Agent</hi> can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48223:188"/>[Since I propos'd to you this fifth
Consideration, I happen'd to light on a
passage in <hi>Des Cartes's</hi> Principles, which
affords of what I have been
discovering the Suffrage of a
Philosopher,<note place="margin">Princip. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los. part. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. Artic. 25.</note> that is wont
to be accus'd of excluding
Theology too scrupulously out of his
Philosophy. His words are so full to
my present Purpose, that I need not, to
accommodate them to it, alter one of
them, and therefore shall transcribe
them just as they lie: <hi>Si fortè nobis De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
de seipso, vel aliis, aliquid revelet, quod
naturales Ingenii nostri vires excedat, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
sunt mysteria Incarnationis &amp; Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,
non recusabimus illa credere, quamvis
non clarè intelligamus, nec ullo modo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimur,
multa esse tum in immensa ejus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,
tum etiam in rebus ab eo creatis, quae
captum nostrum excedant.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And let me add on this occasion, that
whereas the main Scruples that are said
to be suggested by Philosophy against
some mysterious Articles of Religion,
are grounded upon this, that the <hi>Modus,</hi>
as they speak, of those things is not
clearly conceivable, or at least is very
hardly explicable; these objections are
not always so weighty as perhaps by the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48223:189"/>
confidence wherewith they are urg'd,
you may think them. For whereas I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to you already, that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
things maintain'd by School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
which are not contained in the
Scripture, that observation is chiefly
applicable to the things we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering;
since in several of these nice
Points, the Scripture affirms only the
thing, and the Schoolmen are pleas'd
to add the <hi>Modus:</hi> And as by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
boldness the School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
determine many things without
Book; so the scruples and objections
that are made against what the Scripture
really delivers, are usually grounded
upon the Erroneous or Precarious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
of the School Philosophers, who
often give the Title of Metaphysical
Truths to Conceits that do very little
deserve that name, and to which a rigid
Philosopher would perhaps think that
of Sublime Nonsense more proper. But
of this I elsewhere say enough, and
therefore shall now proceed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
I chiefly intended, <hi>viz.</hi> That
from hence, <hi>That the</hi> Modus <hi>of a revealed
Truth is either very hard, or not at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable,</hi>
it will not necessarily follow,
that the thing it self is irrational, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48223:189"/>
the positive Proofs of its Truth
be sufficient in their kind. For ev'n in
Natural things Philosophers themselves
do and must admit several things,
whereof they cannot clearly <hi>explicate</hi> or
perhaps <hi>conceive</hi> the <hi>Modus.</hi> I will not
here mention the Origine of Substantial
Forms as an instance in this kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though it may be a fit one as to
the Peripatetick Philosophy; yet not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
that there are any such Beings, I
will take no further notice of them; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
because for a clear Instance to
our present purpose, we need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than our selves, and consider the
Union of the Soul and Body in man.
For who can Physically explain, <hi>both</hi>
how an immaterial Substance should be
able to guide or determine, and excite
the motions of a Body, and yet not be
able to produce motion in it (as by
dead Palsies, great Faintnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it
appears the Soul cannot,) <hi>and,</hi> which is
far more difficult, how an incorporeal
Substance should receive such Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the motions of a Body, as to
be thereby affected with real pain and
pleasure; to which I elsewhere add
some other properties of this Union,
which, though not taken notice of, are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48223:190"/>
perhaps no less difficult to be conceiv'd
and accounted for. For how can we
comprehend, that there should be <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
such an intimate Union betwixt
two such distant Substances as an (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal)
Spirit and a Body, as that
the former may not, when it pleases,
quit the latter, which cannot possibly
have any strings or chains that can tye
or fasten to it that which has no Body
on which they may take bold. And I
there shew, that 'tis full as difficult, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically
to explicate how these so differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Beings come to be united, as how
they are kept from parting at pleasure,
both the one and the other being to be
resolv'd into the meer appointment of
God. And if to avoid the abstruseness
of the <hi>Modus</hi> of this Conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Rational Soul and the Humane
Body, it be said, as 'tis by the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that the former is but a certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of the finer and most subtle
parts of the latter, the formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
abstruseness of the Union betwixt
the Soul and the Body will indeed be
shifted off; but 'twill be by a Doctrine
that will not much relieve us. For those
that will allow no Soul in Man but
what is Corporeal, have a <hi>Modus</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48223:190"/>
that I doubt they will alwayes
leave a Riddle. For of such I desire,
that they would explain to me, (who
know no effects that Matter can produce
but by Local Motion and Rest, and the
consequences of it,) how meer matter,
(let them suppose it as fine as they
please, and contrive it as well as they
can) can make Syllogisms, and have
Conceptions of Universals, and invent
speculative Sciences and Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in a word do all those things
which are done by Man, and by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animal; and he that shall intelligib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explicate to me the <hi>Modus</hi> of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
framing Theories and Ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
will, I confess, not only instruct
me, but surprize me too.</p>
                     <p>And now give me leave to make this
short Reflection on what has been said
in this Section, compar'd with what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
I said in the first Section: That if
on the one hand we lay aside all the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
Opinions that the Schoolmen
and other bold Writers have unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
father'd on Christian Religion,
and on the other hand all the Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conceits repugnant to Christianity,
which the Schoolmen and others have
prooflesly father'd upon Philosophy, the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48223:191"/>
                        <hi>seeming</hi> Contradictions betwixt solid
Divinity and true Philosophy will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be but <hi>few,</hi> as I think the <hi>Real</hi>
ones will be found to be <hi>none at all.</hi>

                     <p>The next Consideration I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
is, That a thing may, if singly or
precisely consider'd, appear Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which yet may be very Credible,
if consider'd as a Part of, or a manifest
Consequence from, a Doctrine that is
highly so.</p>
                     <p>Of this I could give you more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in several Arts and Sciences, than
I think fit to be here specifi'd; and
therefore I shall content my self to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
three or four.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Astronomers</hi> tell us that the
Sun, which seems not to us a foot broad,
nor considerably bigger than the Moon,
is above a hundred and threescore times
bigger than the whole Globe of the
Earth, which yet is forty times greater
than the Moon; the thing thus naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propos'd, seems very Incredible. But
yet, because Astronomers very skilful
in their Art, have, by finding the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48223:191"/>
of the Earth, and observing
the Parallaxes of the Planets, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the proportion of these three Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to be such as has been mention'd,
or thereabout, ev'n Learn'd and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men of all sorts, (Philosophers,
Divines, and others,) think it not Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
to admit what they affirm.</p>
                     <p>So the relations of Earthquakes that
have reach'd divers hundreds of miles;
<hi>of</hi> Eruptions of fire, that have at once
overflown and burn'd vast Scopes of
Land; <hi>of</hi> the blowing up of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
by their own fires; <hi>of</hi> the Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of new Islands in the Sea it self,
and other <hi>Prodigies of too unquestionable
Truth;</hi> (for I know what work Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Superstition have made about
other Prodigies:) If they were attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but by slight and ordinary Witness,
they would be judg'd Incredible, but
we scruple not to believe them, when
the Relations are attested with such
Circumstances, as make the Testimony
as strong as the things attested are
strange.</p>
                     <p>If ever you have consider'd, what
<hi>Clavius,</hi> and divers other Geometricians
teach upon the sixteenth <hi>Proposition</hi> of
the third Book of <hi>Euclide,</hi> (which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48223:192"/>
contains a Theorem about the Tangent
and the Circumference of a Circle,)
you cannot but have taken notice, that
there are scarce greater Paradoxes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
by Philosophers or <hi>Divines,</hi>
than you will find asserted by <hi>Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
themselves. And though of late
the Learned Jesuit <hi>Tacquet,</hi> and some ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid
<hi>Mathematicians,</hi> have question'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of those things, yet ev'n what
some of these severe Examiners confess
to be Geometrically demonstrable from
that Proposition, contains things so
strange, that Philosophers themselves,
that are not well acquainted with that
Proposition and its Corollaries, can
scarce look upon them as other than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
or at least Incredible,
things; which yet, as improbable as they
are consider'd in themselves, ev'n rigid
Demonstrators refuse not to admit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are legitimately deducible
from an Acknowledg'd truth.</p>
                     <p>And so also among the <hi>Magnetical</hi>
Phaenomena there are divers things,
which being nakedly propos'd must
seem altogether unfit to be believ'd, as
indeed having nothing like them in all
nature; whereas those that are vers'd
in Magnetick Philosophy, ev'n before
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48223:192"/>
they have made particular Trials of
them, will look upon them as credible,
because, how great Paradoxes soever
they may seem to others, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
and consequent to the Doctrine
of Magnetism, whose grand Axioms
(from what cause soever Magnetisms
are to be deriv'd) are sufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest;
and therefore a Magnetical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
would not, though an ordinary
Philosopher would, think it unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to believe, that one part of the same
Loadstone should draw a Needle to it,
and the other part drive the same Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
from it; and that the Needle in a
Seamans Compass, after having been
carry'd perhaps many hunder'd Leagues
(through differing Climates, and in
stormy weather) without varying its
Declination, may upon a sudden, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any manifest cause, point at some
part of the Horizons several whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
distant from that which it point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to before. To which might here
be added divers other scarce credible
things, which either others or I have
try'd about Magnetical Bodies; but I
shall hereafter have occasion to take
notice of some of them in a fitter
place.</p>

                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48223:193"/>Wherefore, when something deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in or clearly deduc'd from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is objected against, as a thing
which it is not reasonable to believe,
we must not only consider, whether, if
it were not deliver'd in that Book, we
should upon its own single Account
think it fit or unworthy to be believ'd;
but whether or no it is so improbable,
that 'tis more fit to be believ'd, that all
the proofs that can be brought for the
Authority of the Scripture are to be
Rejected, than that this thing which
comes manifestly recommended to our
belief by that Authority, is worthy to
be Admitted: I say, <hi>manifestly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by that Authority,</hi> because that, if
the thing be not clearly deliver'd in
Scripture, or be not clearly and cogent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deduc'd thence, so far as that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is wanting, so far the thing it self
wants of the full Authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to impose it on our assent.</p>
                     <p>[Perhaps it will procure what I have
said the better Reception, if I add a
couple of Testimonies not of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>Bigots,</hi> no nor of any devout <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
of the Church; but of two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Authors of Sects, and who in their
kinds have been thought extremely
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48223:193"/>
subtle Reasoners, and no less rigid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters
of Reason in whatever they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p>The first passage I shall alledge, is the
Confession of <hi>Socinus,</hi> who in his second
Epistle to <hi>Andreas Dudithius,</hi> speaks
thus: <hi>I am verò ut rem in pauca confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,
quod ad meas aliorúmve opiniones,
quae novitatis prae se ferunt speciem, attinet,
mihi ita videtur; si detur, Scripturam sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram
ejus esse Authoritatis, ut nullo modo
ei contradici possit, ac de interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
illius omnis duntaxat sit scrupulus,</hi>
(which he allows) <hi>nihil, utut veri simile
aut ratione conclusum videatur, asserri con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
eas possit quod ullarum sit virium,
quotiescunque illae sententiis atque verbis
illius Libri aut rationibus liquidò inde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
is probatae atque assertae fuerint.</hi> Which
confession of <hi>Socinus</hi> is surpass'd by
that of his Champion <hi>Smalcius,</hi> to be
produc'd elsewhere in this Paper. The
other passage I met with in
the Excellent Monsieur <hi>Des
Cartes's</hi> Principles of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,<note place="margin">Part. 2. Artic. 34, 35.</note>
where discoursing of the either
Infinite or Indefinite Division of the
Particles of Matter, which is necessary
to make them fill exactly all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringly
figur'd spaces, through which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48223:194"/>
various motions do sometimes make
them pass; he confesses (as he well
may,) that the point is exceedingly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse,
and yet concludes: <hi>Et quamvis
quomodo fiat indefinita ista Divisio cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione
comprehendere nequeamus, non
ideo tamen debemus dubitare quin fiat,
quia clarè percipimus illam necessario se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui
ex natura materiae nobis evidentissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè
cognita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>And in this place it may be seasonable
as well as pertinent, to take notice of
three or four particulars, which, though
they be in some measure imply'd in the
former general Consideration, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to be distinctly inculcated here,
both for their importance, and because
they may as well be deduc'd as Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries
from the foregoing Discourse, as
be confirmed by the proofs I shall add
to each of them. Of these the <hi>first</hi>
shall be this, that we must not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude a thing to be contrary to
Reason, because Learned Men profess
or ev'n complain, that they are not able
clearly to <hi>comprehend</hi> it, provided there
be competent proof that it is true, and
the thing be Primary or Heteroclite.</p>
                     <p>For it is not <hi>alwayes</hi> necessary to the
making the belief of a thing Rational,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48223:194"/>
that we have such a Comprehension of
the <hi>thing</hi> believ'd as may be had and
justly required in <hi>ordinary Cases;</hi> since
we may be sure of the Truth of a
thing, not only by Arguments suggested
by the Nature of the thing it self clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood by us; but by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Testimony of such a Witness, as we
know will not deceive us, and cannot
(at least in our Case) be reasonably
suspected to be himself deceiv'd. And
therefore it may in <hi>some Cases</hi> suffice to
make our belief Rational, that we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discern sufficient Reason to believe
that a thing is true, whether that Reason
spring from the Evidence and Cogency
of the extrinsick Motives we have to
believe, or from the Proofs suggested to
us by what we know of the Thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
nay, though there be something
in the nature of that Thing, which do's
puzzle and pose our Understanding.</p>
                     <p>That many things that are very hard,
and require a great attention, and a
good judgment to be made out, may
yet be true, will be manifest from what
I shall within a Page or two note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
divers Geometrical Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which require, besides a good stock
of knowledge in those matters, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48223:195"/>
invincible Patience to carry so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things along in ones Mind, and go
thorow with them. That also there are
other things, which, though they be as
manifestly Existent, as those newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
can be demonstratively True, are
yet of so abstruse a kind, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
difficult to frame clear and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
Notions of their Nature, we
might learn, if we were inquisitive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
ev'n from some of the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
things; such as, for instance, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Time:</hi> As to the former whereof,
<hi>(Matter,)</hi> though the World and our
own Bodies be made of it, yet the Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's
that are wont to be framed of it
ev'n by the greatest Clerks, are incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
with too great difficulties (some
of which I elsewhere mention) to be
easily acquiesc'd in by considering Men.
And as for the latter, <hi>(Time,)</hi> though
that justly celebrated saying of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,
Si nemo ex me quaerat quid sit
Tempus, scio; si quaerenti explicare velim,
nescio;</hi> seem in the first part of it to
own a knowledge of what Time is, yet
by the latter part, (wherein he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
he cannot declare what it is,) I am
not only allow'd to believe that he
could not propose an intelligible Idea
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48223:195"/>
of it, but invited to think that in the
first part of the sentence he only meant,
that when he did not attentively consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Nature of it,</hi> he thought he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it, or that he knew <hi>that there
is</hi> such a thing as <hi>Time,</hi> though he could
not explain <hi>what it is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed, though <hi>Time</hi> be that,
which all Men allow to be, yet, if <hi>per
impossibile</hi> (as the Schools speak) a
Man could have no other Notion or
Proof of Time and Eternity, (even
such Eternity as must be conceded to
something,) than what he could col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
from the best Descriptions of its
Nature and Properties that are wont to
be given; I scarce doubt, but he would
look upon it as an unintelligible thing,
and incumber'd with too many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be fit to be admitted into a wise
mans Belief. And this perhaps you will
grant me, if you have ever put your self
to the Penance of perusing those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
Disputes and Speculations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> that partly in
<hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Commentators, and
partly among the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and others,
are to be met with upon these abstruse
Subjects. And no wonder, since the
Learned <hi>Gassendus</hi> and his Followers
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48223:196"/>
have very plausibly (if not solidly)
shewn, that <hi>Duration,</hi> (and Time is but
Duration measur'd) is neither a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
nor an Accident, which they also
hold of <hi>Space;</hi> about which the Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
among Philosophers and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are but little, if at all, inferiour to
those about <hi>Time.</hi> And I the rather
choose to mention these instances of
<hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Space,</hi> because they agree very
well with what I intimated by the
expression of <hi>Primary</hi> or <hi>Heteroclite</hi>
things.</p>
                     <p>To which may be referr'd some of
those things, that are call'd <hi>Spiritual</hi> or
<hi>Supernatural,</hi> about which the same
Considerations may have place, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by Reason of this Affinity between
them, that when we treat of either,
some Proofs may in certain Cases be
sufficient, in spite of such Objections, as
in other (and more ordinary Cases)
would invalidate Arguments seemingly
as strong as those Proofs.</p>
                     <p>If it be here objected, That I am too
bold in venturing without the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or Authority of Learned Men,
to introduce so great a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
other things and those which I
call <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>Heteroclite:</hi> I answer,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48223:196"/>
That I shall not solicitously enquire,
whether any others have had the same
thoughts that I propos'd; since, whether
they be new or no, they ought not to be
rejected, if they be Rational.</p>
                     <p>And I have this inducement to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that there ought to be in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
a great difference between them and
other things, and consequently between
the judgments we make of the ways of
arguing about them, and about other
things; so that they are exceeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be clearly conceiv'd and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by our imperfect Faculties, and by
that difficulty apt to make what Men
say of them, though true, to be less sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
and acquiesced in, than things
not more true or rational, suggested up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enquiries about Subjects more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
or which are at least more propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
to our Faculties: For, those ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
things, of which we have been
speaking, being such, as either have no
proper and clear <hi>Genus,</hi> by the help of
which they may be comprehended, or
have not any thing in Nature, that is
(sufficiently) like them, by a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to which we may conceive them;
or being perhaps both <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroclite</hi>
too, as not being deriv'd from
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48223:197"/>
the common Physical Causes of other
things, and having a Nature widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from the rest of things; 'tis no
wonder, that our limited and imperfect
Understandings should not be able to
reach to a full and clear Comprehension
of them; but should be swallow'd up
with the Scruples and Difficulties that
may be suggested by a bold and nice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into things, to which there seems
to belong, in some respect or other, a
kind of Infinity.</p>
                     <p>Upon these, and other Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of kin to them, I count it not irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
to think that things <hi>Primary</hi> and
<hi>Heteroclite,</hi> as also by a parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
some things Immaterial and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
may be sufficiently prov'd in
their kind, if there be such a positive
proof of them as would be competent
and satisfactory, in case there were no
considerable Objections made against
the thing prov'd (especially supposing
that the asserted Doctrine be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred
with much greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
than the contrary Doctrine, or
than any other, propos'd concerning
that Subject:) Nay, I know not, why we
may not, in judging of Primary and of
Immaterial things, safely enough prefer
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48223:197"/>
that Opinion, which has the more Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<hi>Positive Proofs,</hi> though it seem lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to somewhat the greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies;
because in such cases our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is gratify'd with what it
most requires in all cases, that is compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<hi>Positive</hi> Inducements to assent; and
it is not confounded by the Objections,
because a disability to answer them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and fully may very well proceed
either from the too abstruse Nature of
the thing, or the limitedness and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our humane Intellects.</p>
                     <p>And thus we may render a Reason,
why, when we discourse of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Matters, we may sometimes
reasonably acquiesce in proofs in spight
of such Objections as in ordinary cases
would be prevailing ones. For the
things, about which these proofs are
conversant, being <hi>Primary</hi> or <hi>Heteroclite,</hi>
or of as abstruse a Nature as if they
were so, it too often happens, that, what
Opinion soever we choose about them,
we must admit something that is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with great difficulties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will be liable to great Objections,
that perhaps will never be directly and
satisfactorily answer'd. And since it
may fare thus with us, where two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48223:198"/>
Opinions are contradictory, we may
conclude, that those difficulties will not
cogently evince the falsity of a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Opinion, which are but such,
that the same, or as great, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against another, that either is
manifestly or confessedly a Truth, or
which must necessarily be admitted to
be one, if the contrary Theological
Tenet be suppos'd not to be one.</p>
                     <p>2. Another Corollary that may be
drawn from the Discourse that afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us the former, may be this; That it
may not be unreasonable to believe a
thing, though its <hi>Proof</hi> be very difficult
to be understood. To manifest this, I
shall need no other Argument, than
what may be afforded by divers Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical
and other Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations;
some of which are fetch'd by
intermediate Conclusions from Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
so very remote, and require so long
a <hi>series</hi> of <hi>Mediums</hi> to be employ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, that <hi>not only</hi> a Man that
were of <hi>Pilate's</hi> temper, who having
ask'd Him that could best tell him, <hi>What
is Truth,</hi> would not stay awhile to be
satisfi'd about his Inquiry, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he reaches half way to the End of
the Demonstration, or perhaps of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48223:198"/>
                        <hi>Lemma's,</hi> be quite discourag'd from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
any further; <hi>but</hi> ev'n sedulous
and heedful Perusers do find themselves
oftentimes unable to carry along such a
chain of Inferences in their minds, as
clearly to discern whether the whole
Ratiocination be coherent, and all the
particulars have their due strength and
connection. And if you please to make
a Tryal upon some of the Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Vitellio,</hi> or ev'n of <hi>Clavius,</hi> that
I can direct you to, I doubt they will
put you to the full Exercise of your
Patience, and quite tire your Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And though the modern Algebrists
by their Excellent way of expressing
Quantities by Symbols, have so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg'd
Geometrical and Arithmetical
Demonstrations, that by the help of <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
'tis sometimes easie to Demonstrate
that in a Line, which in the ordinary
way would require a whole Page, (as
our most Learned Friend Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> has
ingeniously shewn, by giving the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of about twenty of Mr.
<hi>Hobbs's</hi> Theorems in less than so many
Lines;) yet some Demonstrable Truths
are so abstruse, that ev'n in the Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
way Men need more attention to
discern them, than most Men would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48223:199"/>
in any Speculation whatsoever.
And <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> himself, as famous and
expert a Master as he was in this way,
confesses in a Letter to one of his
Friends, that the Solution of a Problem
in <hi>Pappus</hi> cost him no less than six weeks
study; though now, most Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Demonstrations do indeed seem far
shorter than they are, because that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elid's
Elements</hi> being generally receiv'd
among Mathematicians, all his Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are so many <hi>Lemmata,</hi> which need
be but refer'd to in the Margin, being
known and demonstrated already. By
all which it may appear, that, granting
some Theological Truths to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of by many as things so mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and abstruse, that they cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
discern the force of those Proofs,
that <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> and other subtile Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
have propos'd to evince them;
yet if other Learned Men, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Estimators, and are accustomed
to bring much Patience and Attention
to the discernment of difficult and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Truths, profess themselves sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd
with them, the Probations may
yet be cogent, notwithstanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to have their strength apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For if such a difficulty ought to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48223:199"/>
pass for a mark that a Ratiocination is
not valid, no Reasonings will be found
fitter to be rejected or distrusted, than
many of those whose Cogency has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
such a Repute to Mathematical
Demonstrations.</p>
                     <p>3. It may also be deduc'd from the
foregoing discourse, That 'tis not <hi>always</hi>
against Reason to embrace an Opinion
which may be incumbred with a great
Difficulty, or liable to an Objection not
easie to be solv'd; especially if the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be such, that other Opinions about
it avoid not either the same Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,
or as great ones. The <hi>first</hi> part
of what is said in this Consideration,
will often follow from the Supposition
made in the precedent Discourse. For
those things that render a Doctrine or
Assertion difficult to be conceiv'd and
explain'd, will easily supply the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
of it with Objections against it.</p>
                     <p>And as for the <hi>latter, viz.</hi> the Clause
which takes notice that the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to which 'tis annex'd, will chiefly
take place in that sort of Opinions that
are specifi'd in it; it will need but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of distinct Proof.</p>
                     <p>For 'tis manifest enough, that if the
Subject or Object, about which the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48223:200"/>
propos'd is conversant, be such,
that not only the contradictory Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but others also, are obnoxious ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the same Inconveniencies, or to
others that are equal or greater; the
difficulties that are urg'd against a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Doctrine, may (as hath been
shewn already in the first Corollary)
be rationally enough attributed, not to
the unreasonableness of the Opinion,
but to somewhat else.</p>
                     <p>The last Consectary, that (as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated)
may be deduc'd from the
precedent Discourse, is, That 'tis not
always Unreasonable to believe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Theological for a Truth, which
(I do not say is <hi>truly inconsistent with,</hi>
but) <hi>we do not clearly discern to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
very well with something else that we
also take for a Truth,</hi> or perhaps that is
one indeed; if the Theological Tenet
be sufficiently prov'd in its kind, and be
of that sort of things that we have been
of late and are yet discoursing of.</p>
                     <p>The generality of our Philosophers,
as well as Divines, believe, That God
has a foreknowledge of all future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies;
and yet how a certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
can consist with the Free-will
of Man, (which yet is generally grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48223:200"/>
him, in things meerly Moral or Civil,)
is so difficult to discern, that the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
are wont to deny such things, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the will of free Agents, to
be the proper Objects of Omniscience;
and the Head of the Remonstrants,
though a very subtle Writer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that he knows not, how clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make out the consistency of Gods
Prescience and Mans freedom; both
which he yet confesses to be Truths,
being compell'd to acknowledge the
former, (for the latter is evident,) as
well by the Infiniteness that must be
ascrib'd to Gods Perfections, as by the
Prophetick Predictions, whereby such
contingent Events have been actually
foretold. And the reconcilement of
these Truths is not a difficulty peculiar
to the Christian Religion, but concerns
speculative Men in all Religions, who
acknowledge the Deity to be infinitely
perfect, and allow Man, as they do, to
be a free Agent.</p>
                     <p>[But I have made this Section so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix
already, that I must not enlarge on
this third particular. And therefore I
shall shut it up with an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> which may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
not only to it, but to almost all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48223:201"/>
that has been discours'd in this Section,
and indeed to a great part of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
He then in an Epistle, that came
not forth till some years after the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
death, speaks thus to the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Adversary to whom 'tis addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
<hi>As I have often said, when the
Question is about things that relate to
God, or to what is Infinite, we must not

of them,</hi>

                     <p>And now 'tis time to advance to one
of the main Considerations I had to
propose to you concerning the Subject
of this Letter, and it is this; That when
we are to judge, whether a thing be
contrary to Reason or not, there is a
great deal of difference, whether we
take Reason for the Faculty furnish'd
only with its own innate Principle, and
such Notions as are generally obvious,
(nay, and if you please, with this or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48223:201"/>
that Philosophical Theory;) or for
the Faculty illuminated by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
especially that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Books commonly call'd the
<hi>Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To clear and inforce this the better,
I shall invite you to take notice with
me of the two following particulars.</p>
                     <p>We may then in the <hi>first</hi> place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
That ev'n in things meerly Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
Men do not think it at all Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
to believe divers such things upon
extrinsecal Proofs, especially the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the skilful, as, if it were not
for that Testimony, a Man, though born
with good parts, and possibly very
Learn'd in the Peripatetick or some
other particular Philosophy, would
look upon as Irrational to be believ'd,
and contrary to the Laws of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Of this I shall give you some Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Loadstone,</hi>
and particularly such as these; <hi>That</hi> the
Loadstone, though (as was above inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated)
with one part it will draw,
yet with another the same stone will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the same point of the same excited
Needle; and yet at the same time be
fit to attract either point of another
Needle that never came near a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48223:202"/>
before: <hi>That</hi> though it be the
Loadstone that imparts an attractive
virtue to the Iron, yet when the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
is cap'd, as they call'd it, and so
a piece of Iron (and consequently a
distance) is interpos'd betwixt the stone
and the weight to be rais'd, it will take
up by many times more than if it be it
self apply'd immediately thereunto,
insomuch that <hi>Mersennus</hi>
relates,<note n="*" place="margin">In his little Tract <hi>de Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netis Propric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus.</hi> p. m. 350.</note> that (if there be
no mistake,) he had a
Loadstone that of <hi>it self</hi>
would take up but half an
Ounce of Iron, which when <hi>arm'd</hi> (or
cap'd) would lift up ten Pounds,
which (says he) exceeded the former
weight three hundred and twenty
times: <hi>That</hi> a Mariners Needle, being
once touch'd with a vigorous Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
will afterwards, when freely
poiz'd, turn it self North and South;
and if it be by force made to regard
the East and West, or any other points
of the Compass, as soon as 'tis left at
liberty, 'twill of its self return to its
former Position: <hi>That</hi> a Loadstone float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on water, will as well come to, and
follow a piece of, Iron that is kept from
advancing towards it; as, when it self
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48223:202"/>
is fix'd, and the Iron at liberty, 'twill
draw that Metal to it: <hi>That</hi> without
any sensible alteration in the Agent or
the Patient, the Loadstone will in a
trice communicate all its virtues to a
piece of Steel, and enable that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them to another piece of the
same Metal: <hi>That</hi> if a Loadstone, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been markt at one end, be cut
long-wise according to its <hi>Axis,</hi> and one
Segment be freely suspended over the
other, the halves of the markt end, that
touch'd one another before, will not
now lie together, but the lower will
drive away the upper; and that which
regarded the North in the markt end of
the intire Loadstone, will join with that
extreme of the lower half, which in the
intire stone regarded the South: <hi>That</hi>
(as appears by this last nam'd Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
there are the same Magnetical Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in the separated parts of a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
as in the intire stone; and if it be
cut, or even rudely broken into a great
many parts or fragments, every one of
these portions, though perhaps not so
big as a Corn of Wheat, will, if I may
so speak, set up for its self, and have its
own Northern and Southern Poles, and
become a little Magnet, <hi>sui juris,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48223:203"/>
upon the stone from which
'twas sever'd, and from all its other parts:
<hi>That,</hi> if a Loadstone be skilfully made
Spherical, this little Magnetick Globe,
very fitly by our <hi>Gilbert</hi> call'd a <hi>Terrella,</hi>
will not only, being freely plac'd, turn
North and South, and retain that Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but have its Poles, its Meridians,
its <hi>AEquator,</hi> &amp;c. upon good grounds
designable upon it, as they are upon the
great Globe of the Earth And this
will hold, whether the <hi>Terrella</hi> be great
or small.</p>
                     <p>I might not only much encrease the
number of these odd Magnetical <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena's,</hi>
but add others about other
Subjects: But these may suffice to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
to us this Reflection, That there is
no doubt to be made, but that a Man,
who never had the opportunity to see or
hear of Magnetical Experiments, would
look upon these as contrary to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Nature, and therefore to the
Dictates of Reason, as (accordingly)
some Learned <hi>Aristotelians,</hi> to whom I
had occasion to propose some of them,
rejected them as Incredible. And I
doubt not, but I could frame as plausible
Arguments from the meer Axioms of
Philosophers, and the Doctrine of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophick
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48223:203"/>
Schools against some Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which Experience hath
satisfi'd me of, as are wont to be drawn
from the same Topicks against the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
Articles of Faith; since among
the strange Properties of the Loadstone
there are some, which are not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and stupendious, but seem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Dictates of the received
Philosophy and the course of Nature.
For, whereas Natural Bodies, how sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
soever, require some particular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
in the <hi>Medium</hi> through which
their Corpuscles are to be diffus'd, or
their Actions transmitted, so that Light
it self, whether it be a most subtile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or a naked Quality, is resisted by all
opacous <hi>Mediums,</hi> and the very <hi>effluvia</hi>
of Amber and other Electricks will not
permeate the thinnest Glass, or even a
sheet of fine Paper; yet the Loadstone
readily performing his Operations
through all kind of <hi>Mediums,</hi> without
excepting Glass it self.</p>
                     <p>If the Poles of two Magnetick Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
do both of them regard the North,
another Philosopher would conclude
them to have a <hi>Sympathy,</hi> at least to be
unlikely to disagree; and yet, if he
bring these Extremes of the same Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48223:204"/>
within the reach of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
one will presently drive away
the other as if there were a powerful
<hi>Antipathy</hi> between them.</p>
                     <p>A somewhat long Needle being plac'd
horizontally, and exactly poiz'd upon
the point of a Pin, if you gently touch
one end with the Pole of a vigorous
Magnet, that end shall manifestly dip or
stoop, though you often take it off the
Pin, and put it on again. And this
inclination of the Needle will continue
many years, and yet there is not only
no other sensible change made in the
Metal by the Contact of the Loadstone;
but one end has requir'd a durable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderancy,
though the other be not
lighter, nor the whole Needle heavier
than before. And the <hi>Inclination</hi> of
the Magnetick Needle may be by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
touch of the Loadstone taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
without lessning the weight of the
part that is depriv'd of it.</p>
                     <p>The Operation that in a trice the
Loadstone has on a Mariners Needle,
though it makes no sensible change in
it, or weakens the Loadstone it self, will
not be lost, though you carry it as far as
the Southern Hemisphere; but it will
not be the same in all places, but in some
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48223:204"/>
the Magnetick Needle will point di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
at the North, in others 'twill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
or <hi>decline</hi> some degrees towards
the East or the West: And, which seems
yet more strange, the same Needle in
the same place will not always regard
the same point of the Compass, but,
lookt on at distant times, may vary from
the true Meridian, sometimes to the
West, and afterwards to the East.</p>
                     <p>All the communicable virtues of the
Magnet may be imparted to Iron, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any actual Contact of the two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but barely by approaching in a
convenient way the Iron to the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
for a few moments. And the
Metal may likewise be depriv'd of
those virtues in a trice, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Contact by the same or another
Loadstone.</p>
                     <p>If you mark one end of a Rod, or
other oblong piece of Iron, that never
came near a Magnet, and hold it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly,
you may at pleasure, and
in the hundreth part of a minute, make
it become the North or South Pole of
a Magnetical Body. For it, when 'tis
held upright, you apply to the bottom
of it the North-extreme of an excited
and well-poiz'd Needle, the lower end
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48223:205"/>
of the Iron will drive away that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,
which yet will be drawn by the
upper end of the same Iron. And if
by inverting you make this lower end
the uppermost, it will not attract, but
repel the same Lilly or North-point of
the Needle, just under which it is to be
perpendicularly held.</p>
                     <p>Though, <hi>vis unita fortior,</hi> be a receiv'd
Rule among Naturalists; yet oftentimes,
if a Magnet be cut into pieces, these will
take up and sustain much more Iron than
the intire stone was able to do.</p>
                     <p>If of two good Loadstones the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
be much bigger, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
stronger than the other, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
will draw a piece of Iron, and retain
it much more strongly than the lesser;
and yet, when the Iron sticks fast to
the greater and stronger Loadstone, the
lesser and weaker may draw the Iron
from it, and take it quite away.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> (to mention now
no more,) are so repugnant to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sentiments of Naturalists, and the
ordinary course of things, that, if ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
to any Testimony of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
these Magnetical Properties had
been propos'd to <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, he
would probably have judg'd them ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48223:205"/>
things, as repugnant to the Laws
of Nature: Nevertheless, though it
seems incredible, that the bare touch of
a Loadstone <hi>should impart</hi> to the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Needle a Property, which, (as far
as we know) nothing in the whole
World that is not Magnetical can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
or possess; and should ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
(as Men suppose) upon it at
three or four thousand Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
yet this is believ'd by the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks
themselves upon the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those Navigators that have fail'd
to the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies;</hi> and divers
even of the more rigid of the modern
Philosophers believe more than this,
upon the Testimony of <hi>Gilbert, Cabaeus,
Kircherus,</hi> and other Learned Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Writers, who have affirmed these
things; most of which I can also averr to
you upon my own knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Habitableness of the Torrid
Zone,</hi> though (as I lately noted) upon
probable grounds deny'd by <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
and the generality of Philosophers for
many Ages; yet not only that, but its
Populousness is now confidently belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schoolmen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who never were there.</p>
                     <p>And though <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and some other
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48223:206"/>
eminent Astronomers, did with great
care and skill, and by the help of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,
as well as Observations, frame a
Theory of the Planets so plausibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd,
that most of the succeeding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
for 12 or 14 Ages acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esc'd
in it; yet almost all the modern
Philosophers and Astronomers, that
have search'd into these matters with a
readiness to believe their Eyes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their Reason to act freely, have
been forc'd, if not to reject the whole
Theory, yet at least to alter it quite, as
to the Number and Order of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
though these last nam'd Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are sometimes <hi>solely,</hi> and always
<hi>mainly</hi> built upon the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
to us by two or three pieces of
glass plac'd in a long hollow Cane, and
honour'd with the name of a <hi>Teles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last of the two things I invited
you to consider with me, is this, That
when we are to judge, which of two dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
Opinions is most Rational, <hi>i. e.</hi>
to be judg'd most agreeable to right
Reason, we ought to give sentence, not
for that which the Faculty, furnish'd
only with such and such Notions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vulgar or borrow'd from this or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48223:206"/>
that Sect of Philosophers, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
but that which is prefer'd by the
Faculty furnish'd either with all the
Evidence requisite or advantagious to
make it give a right Judgment in the
case lying before it; or, when that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had, with the best and fullest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
that it can procure.</p>
                     <p>This is so evident by its own light,
that your Friend might look upon it as
an affront to his Judgment, if I should
go about solicitously to prove it. And
therefore I shall only advertise you,
that, provided the Information be such
as a man has just cause to believe, and
perceives that he clearly understands, it
will not alter the case, <hi>whether</hi> he have
it by Reason, as that is taken for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
furnish'd but with its inbred No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and the more common Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>or</hi> by some Philosophical Theory,
<hi>or</hi> by Experiments purposely devis'd, <hi>or</hi>
by Testimony Humane or Divine, which
last we call <hi>Revelation.</hi> For all these
are but differing ways of informing the
Understanding, and of signifying to it
the same thing; as the Sight and the
Touch may assure a Man, that a Body is
smooth or rough, or in motion or at
rest; (and in some other instances se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48223:207"/>
senses discover to us the same Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which is therefore call'd <hi>Objectum
Commune;</hi>) and provided these Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
have the conditions lately inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
which way soever the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
receives them, it may safely
reason and build Opinions upon them.</p>
                     <p>Astronomers have within these 100
years observ'd, that a Star hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
among the Fix'd ones for some time,
and having afterwards disappear'd, has
yet some years after that, shew'd it self
again. And though, as to this surprising
<hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> our Experimental Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
could have contributed nothing
to the producing it, and though 'tis
quite out of all the received Systems of
the Heavens that Astronomers have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
deliver'd; yet the Star it self
may be a true Celestial light, and may
allow us to Philosophize upon it, and
draw Inferences from the Discoveries it
makes us; as well as we can from the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of those Stars that are not
extraordinary, and of those Falling
Stars that are within our own Ken and
Region.</p>
                     <p>That the Supernatural things, said to
be perform'd by <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi>
might, if true, supply us with <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48223:207"/>
and <hi>Mediums</hi> whereby to constitute
and prove Theories, as well as the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
of meer nature, seems tacitely
indeed, but yet sufficiently, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
by those modern Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
that care not to take any other way
to decline the Consequences that may
be drawn from such Relations, than sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitously
to shew, that the Relations
themselves are all (as I fear most of
them are) false, and occasion'd by the
Credulity or Imposture of Men.</p>
                     <p>But not to do any more than glance
at these matters, let us proceed upon
what is more unquestionable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that, since ev'n our most Critical
Philosophers do admit many of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing
Attributes of Magnetick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which themselves never had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to see, upon the Testimony of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
and others, who never were able
to give the true causes of them; because
they look upon those Relators as honest
Men, and judicious enough not to be
impos'd upon as to the matter of Fact:
Since (I say) such amazing things are
believ'd by such severe Naturalists, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Authority of Men who did not
know the intimate nature of Magnetick
Bodies; and since these strange <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48223:208"/>
are not only assented to as true
by the Philosophers we speak of, but
many Philosophical consequences are
without haesitancy deduc'd from them,
without any blemish to the judgment of
those that give their Assent both to the
Things and the Inferences; why should
it be contrary to Reason to believe the
Testimony of God either about his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which He can <hi>best,</hi> and He alone
can <hi>fully</hi> know, or about the things
which either he himself has done, as the
Creation of the World and of Man;
or which he means to do, as the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World, (whether the whole
World, or our great <hi>Vortex</hi> only, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
not,) and the raising both of good
and bad Men to life again, to receive
Rewards and Punishments, according
to their Demerits. For methinks that
Apostle argues very well, who says, <hi>If
we receive the testimony of
men,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John. v. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>the testimony of God is
greater;</hi> especially about such things
concerning his own Nature, Will, and
Purposes, as 'tis evident that Reason, by
its own unassisted light, cannot give us
the knowledge of.</p>
                     <p>So that we Christians in assenting to
Doctrines upon the account of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48223:208"/>
need not, nor do not, reject the
Authority of Reason, but only appeal
from Reason to it self, <hi>i. e.</hi> from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as it is more <hi>slightly,</hi> to its Dictates,
as 'tis more <hi>fully</hi> inform'd. Of which
two sorts of Dictates there is nothing
more rational, than to prefer the latter
to the former.</p>
                     <p>And for my part I am apt to think, that,
if what has been represented in this
<hi>Section</hi> were duly consider'd, this alone
would very much contribute to prevent
or answer most of the Objections, that
make such of the Questioners of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as are not resolutely vitious,
entertain such hard thoughts of some
Articles of the Christian Faith, as if
they were directly repugnant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
For, (as we were observing)
<hi>that</hi> is not to be look'd on as the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Reason, that is pronounc'd
ev'n by a rational Man according to a
Set of Notions, though the Inferences
from these would be rational, in case
there were nothing else fit to be taken
into consideration by him that judges;
but <hi>that</hi> is rather to be look'd upon as
the judgment of Reason, which takes
in the most Information procurable, that
is pertinent to the things under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48223:209"/>
And therefore Men, though
otherwise learn'd and witty, shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
not equal Estimators of the case
of those that believe the Articles we
speak of, when they pronounce them to
assent Irrationally, because the things
they assent to cannot be demonstrated
or maintain'd by meer natural Reason,
and would probably be rejected by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,
Epicurus, Aristotle,</hi> or any other
of the ancient Philosophers, to whom
they should be nakedly propos'd, and
whose judgment should be desir'd about
them. For, although this Allegation
would signifie much, if we pretended to
prove what we believe only by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
drawn from the nature of the
thing assented to; yet it will not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
much in our case, wherein we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to prove what we believe, <hi>chiefly</hi> by
Divine Testimony, and therefore ought
not to be concluded guilty of an Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Assent, unless it can be shewn, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Divine Testimony is not duly
challeng'd by us for the main of our
Religion; or that in the particular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
we father something on that Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
which is not contain'd in it, or
rightly deducible from it. And to put
us upon the proving our particular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48223:209"/>
of Faith, sufficiently deliver'd in the
Scriptures, and not knowable without
Revelation, by Arguments meerly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
without taking notice of those we
can bring for the proof of that Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on whose account we embrace
those Articles, is to challenge a Man to
a Duel, upon condition he shall make no
use of his best weapons; and is as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
as if a Schoolman should chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
your Friend to prove, that the
<hi>Torrid Zone</hi> is inhabited, against the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> are wont to
give to prove it uninhabitable, without
allowing him to make use of the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Navigators, who assure us of
the constant <hi>Brises</hi> that daily ventilate
the Air, and qualifie that heat which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
would not be supported, and
who furnish us with those other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
whereon to build our proofs,
which we, that were never there, can
have but by Relation.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, the limitations, that
Christian Religion <hi>puts</hi> to some of the
dictates of Philosophy, which were
wont to be admitted in a more general
and unrestrained Sense, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
about God and the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
it <hi>superadds</hi> to those which the light of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48223:210"/>
Nature might lead Men to about the
same Subjects; though to some they
may seem injurious to Philosophy and
Reason, are as little unkind to either,
as is the Gardener to a Crab-stock, or
some such other wild Plant, when by
cutting off some of the Branches, and
by making a slit in the Bark, that he
may graft on it a Pare-main, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
choice Apples, by this seemingly
hard usage he brings it to bear much
nobler fruit, than, if left to its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
condition, it ever would have
done.</p>
                     <p>I know not, whether to all that
hath been said in this <hi>Section,</hi> I may not
add thus much further, that it sometimes
happens, that those very things, which
at first were propos'd to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and believ'd upon the score
of Revelation, are afterward assented
to by it upon the account of meer Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
To which purpose I consider, that
not any of the ancient Philosophers,
nay (as far as I have read) ev'n of
those that believ'd God to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the World, dream'd, that He
created Matter of nothing, but only
form'd the World out of praeexistent
Matter, whereas Christian Divines usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48223:210"/>
teach as an Article of Faith, That,
besides what they call a mediate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as when Fishes were made out of
the water, or <hi>Adam</hi>'s body was made
out of the earth, there was an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Production of Matter it self out of
nothing.</p>

                     <p>After what has been hitherto dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd,
it may be seasonable to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what kind of Probation, or what
degree of Evidence may reasonably be
thought sufficient to make the Christian
Religion thought fit to be embrac'd.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps I shall not need to tell you,
that, besides the Demonstrations wont
to be treated of in vulgar Logick, there
are among Philosophers three distinct,
whether <hi>kinds</hi> or <hi>degrees,</hi> of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
For there is a <hi>Metaphysical</hi>
Demonstration, as we may call that,
where the Conclusion is manifestly
built on those general Metaphysical
Axioms that can never be other than
true; such as <hi>Nihil potest simul esse &amp;
non esse; Non Entis nullae sunt Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
Reales,</hi> &amp;c. There are also <hi>Physical</hi>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48223:211"/>
Demonstrations, where the Conclusion
is evidently deduc'd from Physical
Principles; such as are, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil
fit. Nulla substantia in nihilum redigitur,
&amp;c.</hi> which are not so absolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as the former, because, if there be a
God, He may (at least for ought we
know) be able to create and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Substances; and yet are held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
by the ancient Naturalists,
who still suppose them in their Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
And lastly, there are <hi>Moral</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,
such as those where the
Conclusion is built either upon some
one <hi>such</hi> proof cogent in its kind; or
some concurrence of probabilities that
it cannot be but allowed, supposing the
truth of the most receiv'd Rules of
Prudence and Principles of Practical
Philosophy.</p>
                     <p>And this <hi>third</hi> kind of Probation,
though it come behind the two others
in certainty, yet it is the surest guide,
which the <hi>Actions of Men,</hi> though not
their <hi>Contemplations,</hi> have regularly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
them to follow. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of a <hi>Moral</hi> Demonstration are
the surest that Men aspire to, not only
in the conduct of private Mens affairs,
but in the Government of States, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48223:211"/>
ev'n of the greatest Monarchies and
Empires. And this is considerable in
<hi>Moral</hi> Demonstrations, that such may
consist, and be as it were made up of
particulars, that are each of them but
probable; of which the Laws estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
by God himself among his own
People, as well as the practice of our
Courts of Justice here in <hi>England,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us a manifest instance in the case of
Murder, and some other Criminal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
For, though the Testimony of a
<hi>single</hi> Witness shall not suffice to prove
the accus'd party guilty of Murder; yet
the Testimony of <hi>two</hi> Witnesses, though
but of equal Credit, that is, a second
Testimony added to the first, though of
it self never a whit more credible than
the former, shall ordinarily suffice to
prove a Man guilty; because it is
thought reasonable to suppose, that,
though each Testimony <hi>single</hi> be but
probable, yet a concurrence of such
Probabilities (which ought in Reason
to be attributed to the Truth of what
they jointly tend to prove) may well
amount to a Moral certainty, <hi>i. e.</hi> such a
certainty as may warrant the Judge to
proceed to the sentence of death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Indicted party.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:48223:212"/>
To apply these things now to the
<hi>Christian Religion:</hi> If you consider, with
how much approbation from discerning
Men that judicious Observation of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
has been entertain'd, where he
says, that 'tis as unskilful and improper
a thing to require <hi>Mathematical</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
in <hi>Moral</hi> Affairs, as to take up
with Moral Arguments in matters Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical;
you will not deny, but that
those Articles of the Christian Religion
that can be prov'd by a Moral, though
not by a Metaphysical or Physical, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
may without any blemish
to a Man's Reason be assented to; and
that consequently (by vertue of the
foregoing Considerations) those other
Articles of the Christian Faith, that are
clearly and legitimately deducible from
the so demonstrated Truths, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
without disparagement be assented
to.</p>
                     <p>We may also here consider further,
That the choosing or refusing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Christian Religion, which is
not propos'd to us only as a System of
Speculative Doctrines, but also as a
Body of Laws, according to which it
teaches us, that God commands us to
worship Him, and regulate our Lives;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48223:212"/>
the embracing, <hi>I say,</hi> or not embracing
this Religion, is an act of humane
choice, and therefore ought to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
according to the dictates of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Now, though in matters that
very much import us, we may wish for
and endeavor after such Reasons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to determine our Resolves, as may
amount to Moral Demonstrations; yet
Prudence will not always require, that
we should refuse to act upon Arguments
of a less Cogency than Moral Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.
For oftentimes in humane
Affairs it so falls out, that divers hazards
or other inconveniences will attend
whatever resolution we take; and in
that case, all that Prudence requires, or
can enable us to do, is, to take that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
which upon the whole matter
seems to be preferable to any other;
though that which is thus prefer'd, may
perhaps be liable to some Objection
that cannot be directly answer'd, but
only obliquely, by the preponderancy
of the Arguments that persuade the
choice against which the Objection is
made.</p>
                     <p>But here perhaps you will tell me,
that the safest way in a case of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
is to suspend an action that is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48223:213"/>
every way attended with difficulties, and
to forbear either embracing or reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Christian Religion, till the truth
or falseness of it come to appear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and unquestionable.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer, that indeed in
matters of bare Speculation, about
which our <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> only need to
be conversant, the suspension of Assent
is not only practicable, but usually the
safest way; but <hi>Des. Cartes</hi> himself, who
has been the greatest Example and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcator
of this Suspension, declares,
that he would have it practis'd onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
humane <hi>Speculations,</hi> not about hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<hi>Actions; Sed haec interim dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
ad solam</hi> contemplationem <hi>veritatis
restringenda; non quantum ad usum vitae:
quia persaepe rerum agendarum occasio
praeteriret, antequam nos dubiis nostris
exolvere possemus. Non raro quod tantum
est verisimile cogimur amplecti, vel etiam
interdum, etsi è duobus unum altero ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risimiliùs
non appareat, alterutrum tamen
eligere.</hi> And in some of his other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
he speaks so much to shew, that
'tis unreasonable to expect in matters,
where embracing or rejecting a course
that requires practice is necessary, such a
certainty as he judges necessary to make
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48223:213"/>
a true Philosopher acquiesce in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Propositions about speculative
matters, that I find by one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that he was vehemently accus'd
for having taught, that Men need not
have as sure grounds for choosing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and avoiding vitious courses, as
for determining about things meerly
Notional.</p>
                     <p>And here let me observe to you the
difference, that I take notice of in the
cases where we are put upon delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
whether we will choose or refuse a
thing propos'd. For it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to us, either as a proffer on
whose acceptance an advantage may be
hop'd, or as a duty, which, besides the
advantage it promises to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
has a Penalty annex'd to the
non-performance, or as an onely expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to avoid a great mischief, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a great good.</p>
                     <p>Thus when in the <hi>Theatrum Chymicum</hi>
some of its chief Authors, as <hi>Lully,
Geber, Artephius,</hi> who pretend to have
been <hi>Adepti,</hi> i. e. Possessors of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir,
very earnestly exhort their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to apply themselves to so noble
and useful a study as <hi>Alchymy</hi> (by the
help of which, the last nam'd <hi>Artephius</hi>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:48223:214"/>
is said to have liv'd a 1000 years,) they
make but a Proposition of the first sort.
For though a prosperous attempt to
make the <hi>Philosophers stone</hi> (supposing
there be such a thing) would possess a
Man of an inestimable Treasure; yet,
if he either refuse to believe these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or, if he do believe them, refuses
to take the pains requir'd of him that
would follow their counsel, he can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miss of the wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they would
make him hope for, but is really never a
whit the poorer, or in a worse condition
than if they had not endeavour'd to
engage him.</p>
                     <p>But if an absolute Sovereign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
something to be done by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and to enforce his Command,
does not only propose great Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses
to those that shall perform what
is prescrib'd, but threatens heavy penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to the disobedient; this will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the second sort of Cases above
mention'd, in which, as 'tis evident, a
Man has not the same latitude allow'd
him as in the first.</p>
                     <p>But if we suppose, that a Man by a
translation of very peccant Matter has
got a spreading Gangrene in his Arm,
and a skilful Chirurgion tell him, that,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48223:214"/>
if he will part with his Arm, he may be
recover'd, and save his life, which else
he will certainly lose: This Case will
belong to the last sort above mention'd;
the Patients parting with his Arm being
the onely remedy of the Gangrene, and
expedient to save his life, and recover
his health. And here also 'tis manifest,
that there are far stronger Motives,
than those mention'd in the first Case,
to make a positive and timely Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>To bring this home to our Subject, I
need but mind you, that the Christian
Doctrine does not only promise a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to sincere Believers, but threatens
no less than a Hell to the Refractory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The voice of</hi> Moses <hi>to the</hi> Iews <hi>is
this,</hi> Behold, I set before you this day a
blessing and a curse;<note place="margin">Deutr. 11. 26, 27, 28.</note> a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
if ye obey the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord your God,
which I command you this day; and a
curse, if ye will not obey the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord your God, but turn aside
out of the way which I command you this
day.</p>
                     <p>And the Commission that Christ gave
his Apostles to preach the Gospel, runs
thus: <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48223:215"/>
the Gospel to every creature,</hi> i. e. to all
Mankind;<note place="margin">Mark 16. 15, 16.</note> 
                        <hi>he that believeth,
and is baptiz'd, shall be sav'd;
but he that believeth not, shall
be damn'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this you may perceive, that as far
as there is either truth or probability
in the Christian Religion, so far forth
he that refuses to become a Disciple to
it, runs a venture, not only to lose the
greatest blessings that Men can hope, but
to fall eternally into the greatest mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that they can fear. And indeed our
Case in reference to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
may not only be refer'd to the
second sort of Cases lately mention'd,
but to the third sort too. For as the
language of the Author of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion was to his Auditors, <hi>If ye
believe not that I am He</hi> (the
Messias) <hi>ye shall dye in your
sins;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 8. 24.</note> so of the two greatest Heralds of
it, the one tells the <hi>Iews</hi> that neither is
there salvation in any other: For, <hi>there
is no other Name under heaven
given among men whereby we
must be saved:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note> And the other tells the
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> That the <hi>Lord Iesus shall
be reveal'd from heaven with his mighty
Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48223:215"/>
on them that know not God, and obey not
the Gospel of our Lord Iesus
Christ;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>who shall be punish'd
with everlasting destruction
from the presence of the Lord, and from
the glory of his power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By all this it appears, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion is not propos'd barely as
a proffer of Heaven in case Men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, but as a Law that Men should
embrace it upon the greatest penalty,
and as the onely expedient and remedy
to attain eternal happiness, and escape
endless misery; so that the forbearing
to submit our necks to the yoke of
Christ, being as well a ruinous course, as
to reject it, that which Reason here
puts us upon, is, not so much to consider,
whether or no the Arguments for the
Christian Religion be Demonstrations,
and will enable a Man to answer directly
all Objections and Scruples; (for there
are divers courses that Prudence may
enjoin a Man to steer, whilst Philosophy
suggests speculative doubts about the
grounds of such Resolutions:) but
whether it be more likely to be true,
than not to be true, or rather, whether
it be not more adviseable to perform
the conditions it requires upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48223:216"/>

expectation of obtaining the
blessings it promises, than by refusing it
to run a probable hazard of incurring
such great and endless miseries as it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
threatens.</p>
                     <p>It will perhaps be said, that this is a
hard Case But that is an Allegation I
am not here to consider; since it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belongs to the Doctrine about the
Providence of God, who being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Author and absolute Lord of the
Creatures, who can receive neither
Laws nor Benefits from them, that can
oblige him to them; has a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
them what Laws he thinks fit, that
are not impossible for them to obey, and
to punish their disobedience to such
Laws; and much more has a right to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
what conditions he pleases to that
inestimable Felicity he holds forth; the
proffer of it upon any terms being a free
act of his meer goodness, and the value
of it incomparably surpassing whatever
we Men can do or suffer to obtain it;
especially considering, that, as he might
enforce his Commands, as Sovereigns
commonly do by threatning Penalties
to the disobedient, without proposing
Rewards to the performers; so he has
given Men such probable Arguments to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48223:217"/>
ground their expectations on, that they
will be self-condemn'd, if they reject
the Religion he proposes, and yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it to be decent (if I may so speak)
for him to crown their Faith with unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
blessings. But, as I was saying,
the direct and full Answer to this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
belongs not to this place, where
it may suffice to say, that whether the
Case be hard or no, yet this is the Case.
And therefore though the proofs of the
Christian Religion did not amount
(which yet I do not grant) to Moral
Demonstrations, a Man may act ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in embracing that Religion, if, all
things consider'd, it appear more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be true, than not to be true.</p>
                     <p>And I shall by and by shew you, that
this is not the onely Case, where Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
puts us upon making resolutions
notwithstanding contrary doubts.</p>
                     <p>I know the harshness of the Case is
by most Men made to consist in this,
That for a Religion, whereof the truth
suppos'd in its promises and threats is
not demonstratively prov'd, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
up our pleasures, and sometimes
undergo considerable hardships and los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and consequently we must quit what
is certain, for what is uncertain. I have
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48223:218"/>
in another Paper had occasion to say
something else to this Objection, than
what (to avoid repetition) shall make
up my present Answer, which consists of
two parts.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first</hi> whereof is, That what we
are to give up to become Christians, is
not really so valuable in itself as the
Objecters think, and that 'tis of scarce
any value at all, if compar'd to the
goods we may acquire by parting with
them. For alas! what is it that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
requires us to forego, but small
petty enjoyments? which those, that
have had the most of, have found them,
and pronounced them unsatisfactory
whilst they possest them, and which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
experience shews to be no less
transitory, than they have been declar'd
empty, since a thousand Accidents may
take them from us, and Death will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
after a short time (which can
be but a moment compar'd to Eternity)
take us from them. And if it be said,
that these Enjoyments, such as they are,
are at least the only happiness that we
can make our selves sure of, I must free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profess, that I think it therefore the
more reasonable to part with them, if it
be necessary upon the hopes that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48223:218"/>
Religion gives us. For (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if a Man behold those things not
only with a Philosophical eye that can
look <hi>through</hi> them, but with a Christian
eye that can look <hi>beyond</hi> them,) if there
be no greater happiness, I do not think
so poor a thing as Men call Happiness
worth being greedily desir'd; and if
there be such a transcendent happiness
as Christianity holds forth, I am sure,
that deserves to be the object of my
Ambition. So that either the Meanness
of worldly happiness will make me
think it no great misery to want it, or
the Excellency of heavenly Felicity
will make me think it great wisdom to
part with earthly for it.</p>
                     <p>And now, in the <hi>second</hi> part of my
Answer, I must invite you to consider
with me, that Christian Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
not of us actions more imprudent,
than divers others, that are generally
look'd upon as complying with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Prudence, and some of them
practis'd by great Politicians themselves
in the weighty affairs of State.</p>
                     <p>You know what a common practice
it is in great storms at Sea, for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
themselves to throw over-board
their Goods, and perhaps too their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48223:219"/>
(as in <hi>Paul</hi>'s case) though they
be sure to lose what they cast away, and
are not certain either that this loss will
save the ship, or that the ship may not
be sav'd without it. The wisest, and
ev'n the worldliest Men, whether Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or private persons, think themselves
never more so, than when they toyl and
lay out their care and time, and usually
deny themselves many things to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
advantagiously for Children which
they have but a Womans word for, and
consequently a bare Moral probability
to assure them to be theirs.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Small Pox</hi> many Physitians are
for Bleeding, and others (as most of
our English Practitioners) are very
much against it. Supposing then (which
is no very rare Case) that a person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
by that disease, be told by one
of his Physitians, that unless Nature be
eas'd of part of her burden by Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
she will never be able to overcome
the disease; and on the contrary, the
other assures him, that, if by exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the treasure of life (the Blood)
he further weakens Nature which is but
too weak already, the disease must
needs overcome her: What can a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Man do in this Case, where he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48223:219"/>
can take no resolution, against which
probable Arguments, that are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and fully to be answer'd, may not
be oppos'd, and where yet the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of his resolution may be as rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
as the venturing to take either of
those he is invited to?</p>
                     <p>And in the formerly mentioned Case,
of a Man that has a spreading Gangrene
in his Arm, if he consents that it be cut
off, which Prudence often requires that
he should do, he is certain to lose one
of his usefullest limbs, and is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
but that he may save his life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that loss, nor that he shall save it by
that loss.</p>
                     <p>And to give you an Instance or two
of a more publick nature: How many
Examples does History afford us of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Generals, and other great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
who have ventur'd their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and their Lives to seize upon places
promis'd to be betray'd to them by
those they had corrupted with money;
though the ground, upon which they
run this hazard, be the engagement of
some, who, if they were not Traytors
that could falsifie their faith, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been brib'd to make so crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and ignominious an engagement?
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48223:220"/>
How often have the greatest Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
either resolv'd to enter into a War,
or taken courses that they foresee will
end in a War, upon the informations
they receive from those they have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in other Princes Councils;
though, to believe such Intelligencers,
those who venture so much upon their
informations, must suppose them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and perfidious Men?</p>
                     <p>It were not difficult, to add other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to the same purpose, by which
join'd with what has been above dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd,
it may appear, that a Man need
not renounce or lay aside his Reason to
resolve to fulfill the conditions of the
Gospel, though the Arguments for it
were none of them demonstrative ones.
For so much as a Probability of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by it such inestimable blessings, as it
proposes, and little more than a bare
Probability of incurring, by rejecting
it, such unspeakable miseries as it threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens,
may rationally induce a Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
upon fulfilling its reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and his Prudence may very well
be justifi'd if it do but appear, that
(1) It is more probable that some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
should be true, than that so many
well attested Miracles alledg'd by the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48223:220"/>
ancient Christians should be false; and
that God who is the Author of the
World, and of Men, (for so much, I
think, may be Physically prov'd) should
leave Man whom he has so fitted, and
by benefits and internal Laws obliged to
worship him, without any express dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
how to do it: And that (2) If
there be any true Religion, the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is the most likely to be that, in regard
not only of the excellency of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Promises, but of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Miracles that bare witness to
it, the Records of which were made by
honest plain Men, who taught and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
the strictest virtue, and who knew
their Religion condemn'd Lying, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
join'd their Doctrine and Narratives
with their blood: the truth of which
was so manifest in the times when they
were said to be done, that the evidence
seem'd abundantly sufficient to convert
whole Nations, and among them many
considerable and prudent persons, who
had great opportunity as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to examine the truth of them, and
who were by their interest and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so indispos'd to embrace Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that, to make a sincere profession of
it, they must necessarily relinquish both
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48223:221"/>
their former Religion, and their former
Vices, and venturously expose for it not
only their Fortunes, but their Lives.</p>
                     <p>If it be here objected, that it is very
harsh, if not unreasonable, to exact up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so great penalty as Damnation so
firm an assent, as is requisite to Faith, to
such Doctrines as are either obscurely
delivered, or have not their truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively
made out: I answer, that
whatever others may think, I don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that there is any degree of Faith
absolutely necessary to salvation, that is
not sutable to the evidence that Men
may have of it, if they be not wanting
to themselves through Laziness, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
Vice, Passion, Interest, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
culpable defect. For considering
that God is just, and gracious, and has
been pleas'd to promulgate the Gospel,
that Men whom it supposes to act as
such (that is, as rational Creatures)
should be brought to salvation by it; I
see no just cause to think, that he intends
to make any thing absolutely necessary
to salvation, that they may not so far
clearly understand as they are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
distinctly and explicitely to believe
it; and what is not so deliver'd, I should,
for that very Reason, unwillingly admit
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48223:221"/>
to be necessary to salvation: And you
may here remember, that I formerly
told you, I was far from thinking all the
Tenents either of the Schools, or of
particular Churches, to be so much as
Christian Verities, and therefore am very
unlike to allow them here to be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
and necessary ones; and I take it
to be almost as great as common a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
that all the Doctrines that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</hi>
fundamental Articles, must <hi>be</hi> fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
too; as if because the Head
is a noble part of the Body, and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to life, therefore all the hair that
grows upon it, must be thought such
too. But then as to the absolute firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Assent, that is supposed to be
exacted by Christianity to the Articles
it delivers, I am not sure that 'tis so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in all cases to true and saving
Faith, as very many take it to be. For
first the Scripture itself tells us, that
some of the Truths it reveals, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable
Mysteries, and some other
Points are <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
and 'tis unreasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that the highest firmness of Assent
is to be given to such Articles, or to
those parts of them, as their obscurity
keeps us from having so much reason to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48223:222"/>
think that we clearly understand them,
as we have to suppose we understand
those that are far more plainly reveal'd.
And (secondly) to speak more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
'tis harsh to say, that the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Faith is necessary to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
since Mens natural capacities and
dispositions, and their education, and
the opportunities they have had of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
informed, do very much, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not culpably, dispose some more
than others to be diffident, and apt to
haesitate, and frame doubts. And the
same Arguments may appear evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to one Man to make it his duty
to believe firmly what they persuade,
which in another, naturally more scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
or better acquainted with the
difficulties and objections urged by the
opposite Party, may leave some doubts
and scruples excusable enough. And
when either the Doctrine itself is not
clearly deliver'd, or the Proofs of it,
that a Man could yet meet with, are
not fully cogent; for that Man, not to
give such Truths the same degree of
Assent that Demonstration may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
is not, as many interpret it, an
affront to the Veracity of God, since he
may be heartily disposed and ready to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48223:222"/>
believe all that shall appear to him to
be revealed by God, and only doubts,
whether the thing proposed be indeed
revealed by him, or whether the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Party rightly understands the
sense of these words wherein the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is contain'd; which is not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
God, but himself: And that in
some cases, a degree of Faith not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from doubts, may, through Gods
goodness, be accepted, we may learn
from hence, that the Apostles themselves,
who were so much in Christs favour,
made it their Prayer to him, <hi>That he would
encrease their Faith:</hi> And he that beg'd,
that if he could do any thing for his
son, and cryed out, <hi>Lord I believe, help
thou my unbelief,</hi> was so far accepted by
that merciful High Priest, who is apt to
be toucht with the sense of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that his Request was granted,
though it could not be so but by having
a Miracle done in his favor. The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
distrest by a storm, and crying to
their Master, as thinking themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very point of perishing, were
saved by him at the same time when he
gave them the Epithet <hi>of men of little
faith:</hi> And at another time, <hi>Peter</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Sea, though he had lost a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48223:223"/>
degree of that Faith that made him first
engage upon that adventure, and was
reproved for it by Christ, was yet rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from that sinking condition which
both he and his Faith were in. And
we are told, in the Gospel, of a Faith,
which, though no bigger than a grain of
Mustard-seed, may enable a Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
Mountains: And though this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
speaks not primarily of justifying
Faith, yet still it may serve to shew, that
degrees of Assent, far short of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
may be so far accepted by God, as to
be owned by miraculous Exertions of
his Power. For the <hi>Faith</hi> then that is
made a necessary condition under the
Gospel, as the genuine fruit and scope
of it is <hi>Obedience;</hi> so 'tis not indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably
such a Faith as excludes doubts,
but refusals. And though the Assent
be not so strong as may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a Demonstration; yet it may
be graciously accepted, if it be but
strong enough to produce Obedience;
and accordingly whereas <hi>Paul</hi> in one
place declares, <hi>that in Christ Iesus neither
circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
but faith operative through love;</hi>
we may learn his meaning from a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
place, where varying the words, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48223:223"/>
not the sense, of the latter part of the
sentence, he says, <hi>that in Christ Iesus nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumcision availeth any thing, nor
uncircumcision but the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God.</hi> I readily grant,
that attainment of a higher degree of
Faith is always a blessing, and cannot
be sufficiently prized, without being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
aimed at; but there are in some
Virtues and Graces degrees, which
though to reach be a great happiness,
yet 'tis but the endeavoring after them
that is an indispensible Duty. Likewise
'tis true, that the firmness of assent
to Divine Verities, does, in some regard,
bring much honour to God; as 'tis said
of the Father of the Faithful, (who in
reference to the promise made him of
<hi>Isaac,</hi> did not consider his own age, nor
<hi>Sarahs</hi> long barrenness, so as to entertain
any diffidence of what God had told
him,) that being mighty in faith, he
gave glory to God: But 'tis true too,
that in another respect a practical assent
built upon a less undoubted evidence,
may have its preheminence; for when
Christ now risen from the dead, had said
to the distrustful <hi>Didimus,</hi> Thomas, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast seen me, thou hast believed;</hi> he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48223:224"/>
immediately adds, <hi>But blessed</hi> (that is,
peculiarly and preferably blessed) <hi>are
those that have not seen, and yet have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;</hi>
and indeed he does not a little
honour God, (in that sense wherein
Mortals may be said to honour him)
who is so willing to obey and serve him,
and so ambitious to be in an estate
where he may always do so, that upon
what he yet discerns to be but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of the Christian Religions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the most acceptable to God, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
it with all its difficulties and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and upon this score venturously
resolves to submit, if need be, to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and actual dereliction of all his
Sins and Lusts, and perhaps his Interest
and his Life too, upon a comparatively
uncertain expectation of living with
him hereafter.</p>

                     <head>The Conclusion of the First Part.</head>
                     <p>And here I will put a Period' to my
Answer to your Friends Question in
one of the two senses of it, and so to
the first Part of this Discourse. Against
all which perhaps your Friend will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
That at this rate of arguing for
the Christian Religion, one may Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize
for any Opinion, and reconcile
the most unreasonable ones to right
Reason. But 'tis not difficult for me to
reply, That this Objection is grounded
either upon a mistake of the design of
this Letter, or upon the overlooking
of what is suppos'd in it. For I do not
pretend, that the Considerations hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
alledg'd should pass for Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Truth of Christianity,
which is to be prov'd <hi>by</hi> the excellency
of the Doctrines it reaches, and that of
the Rewards it promises, (both which
are worthy of God,) and <hi>by</hi> divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arguments, especially the <hi>Divine
Miracles</hi> that attest it: But that which
I was here to do, was, not to lay down
the grounds why I receiv'd the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, but to return an Answer,
backt with Reasons, to the Question
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48223:225"/>
that was propos'd: <hi>Whether I did not
think, that a Christian, to continue such,
must deny or lay aside his Reason?</hi> The
sum of the Answer is this, That the
Doctrines <hi>really propos'd</hi> by the Christian
Religion, seeming to me to be by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Arguments sufficiently prov'd in
their kind, so as that the <hi>proofs</hi> of it,
whether they be <hi>demonstrative</hi> or no,
are <hi>sufficient,</hi> (the nature of the things
to be prov'd, consider'd) to justifie a
rational and prudent Man's embracing
it; this Religion (I say) seeming to
me to have such positive Proofs for it, I
do not think, that the Objections, that
are said to be drawn from Reason against
it, do really prove the belief of it to
be inconsistent with right Reason, and
do outweigh the Arguments alledgable
in that Religions behalf. To propose
some of the general grounds of this
Answer of mine, was the design of the
Considerations hitherto discours'd of;
which (as I hinted to you at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
could be no other than general,
unless you had mention'd to me some of
your Friends particular Objections,
which when he tells you, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
find that I have already given you
the grounds of answering them. And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48223:225"/>
though to propose Arguments to evince
positively the Truth of our Religion
after the example of the excellent <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and some other very learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
be not, as you see, either my task
or my design; yet if you attentively
consider what I write in that short Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
wherein I manage but that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
popular Argument for Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that is drawn from the Miracles that
are said to attest it, you will perchance
be invited to think, that when all the
other Proofs of it are taken in, a Man
may, without renouncing or affronting
his Reason, be a Christian.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed to the more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of what I presum'd your
Friend will object, I answer, That the
considerations I have alledg'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of some Mysteries of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, will not be equally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to the most absurd or unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Opinions. For these Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are offer'd as Apologies for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctrines, but upon two or all of
these three Suppositions. The first,
That the Truth of the main Religion
of which such Doctrines make a part, is
so far positively prov'd by real and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controul'd
Miracles, and other compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48223:226"/>
Arguments, that nothing, but the
manifest and irreconcileable Repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of its Doctrines to right Reason,
ought to hinder us from believing them.
The second, That divers of the things,
at which reasonable Men are wont to
take exception, are such, as Reason it
self may discern to be very difficult, or
perhaps impossible for us to understand
perfectly by our own natural light. And
the third, That some things in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
which many Men think contrary
to Reason, are, at most, but contrary to
it, as 'tis <hi>incompetently</hi> inform'd and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
but not when 'tis more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
and particularly when 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
and assisted by Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And as I think these three Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
are not justly applicable, (I
say not, as the Objection does, to the
most absurd, or unreasonable Opinions,
but,) to any other Religion than the
true, which is the Christian; so the last
of these Suppositions prompts me to
take notice to you, that, though we
ought to be exceeding wary, how we
admit what pretends to be supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
reveal'd; yet if it be attended
with sufficient evidence of its being so,
we do very much wrong and prejudice
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48223:226"/>
our selves, if out of an unreasonable
jealousie, or, to acquire or maintain the
repute of being wiser than others, we
shut our eyes against the light it offers.
For besides that a Man may as well err
by rejecting or ignoring the Truth, as
by mistaking a falshood for it; I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
that those Men that have an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of knowledge, which other Men
either have not, or, (which is as bad)
refuse to employ, have a very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
above others towards the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of Truth, and with far less
parts than they, may discover divers
things, which the others, with all their
Pride and Industry, shall never attain to.
As when <hi>Galilaeo</hi> alone among the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Astronomers was Master of a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescope,</hi>
'twas easie for him to make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
discoveries in Heaven of things, to
which not only <hi>Ptolomy, Alphonsus,</hi> and
<hi>Ticho,</hi> but ev'n his Masters, <hi>Aristarchus
Samius,</hi> and <hi>Copernicus,</hi> themselves never
dream'd of, and which other Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
cannot see but by making use of
the same kind of Instrument. And on
this occasion let me carry the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
suggested by the <hi>Telescope,</hi> a little
further, and take notice, that if Men
having heard, that there were four Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48223:227"/>
moving about <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
is an opacous body, and sometimes
horn'd like the Moon, had resolv'd to
examine these things by their naked
eyes, as by the proper Organs of Sight,
without employing the <hi>Telescope,</hi> by
which they might suspect, that <hi>Galilaeo</hi>
might put some Optical delusion upon
them; they would perhaps have assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in great multitudes to gaze at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that (since <hi>plus vident
Oculi quam Oculus</hi>) the number of eyes
might make amends for their dimness.
This attempt not succeeding, they
would perhaps choose out some of the
youngest and sharpest sighted Men, that
by their piercing eyes that may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
which ordinary ones could not
reach. And this Expedient not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
neither, they would perhaps
diet their Stargazers, and prescribe them
the inward use of Fennel, and Eye-bright,
and externally apply <hi>Collyriums</hi>
and Eye-waters, and those to as little
purpose as the rest. With such a pity,
mix'd with Indignation, as <hi>Galilaeo</hi>
would probably have look'd on such
vain and fruitless attempts with, may a
judicious Christian, that upon a due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
admits the Truth of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48223:227"/>
look upon the presumptuous and
vain endeavors of those Men, who, by
the goodness of their natural parts, or
by the improvements of them, or by the
number of those that conspire in the
same search, think, with the bare eye of
Reason to make as great discoveries of
heavenly Truths, as a person assisted by
the Revelations, contain'd in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
can with great ease and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriness
attain. To which let me add
this further improvement of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
that <hi>as</hi> a skilful Astronomer will
indeed first severely examine, whether
the <hi>Telescope</hi> be an Instrument fit to be
trusted, and not likely to impose upon
him; but being once resolv'd of that,
will confidently believe the discoveries
it makes him, however contrary to the
receiv'd Theories of the Celestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and to what he himself believ'd
before, and would still, if the <hi>Telescope</hi> did
not otherwise inform him, continue to
believe; <hi>so</hi> a well qualifi'd Inquirer into
Religions, though he will be very wary,
upon what terms he admits Scripture;
yet if he once be fully satisfi'd, that he
ought to admit it, he will not scruple to
receive upon its authority whatever su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Truths it clearly discloses to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48223:228"/>
him; though perhaps contrary to the
Opinions he formerly held, and which,
if the Scripture did not teach him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
he would yet assent to. And
<hi>as</hi> the <hi>Galaxy</hi> and other whitish parts of
the Sky, were by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
and many other Philosophers,
who look'd on them only with their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
eyes, for many Ages reputed to be
but Meteors; but to those that look on
them with an eye assisted by the <hi>Teles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,</hi>
they plainly appear true Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made up of a multitude of bright
(though little) Stars; <hi>so</hi> there are
Theological Doctrines, which to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
and others that look on them
with the naked eye of Natural Reason,
seem to be but light and fantastical
things; which yet, when Reason, assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and heightned by Revelation, comes
to contemplate, it manifestly sees them
to be true and celestial Lights, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
