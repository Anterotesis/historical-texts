         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Entred according to ORDER.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RAlph,</speaker>

               <p>What News?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Why, they ſay my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> walks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>And do you believe it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Why not? may not Lords walk as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>That's not the buſineſs—but I perceive you have heard but a piece of the Story—you have not heard how the Ghoſt came to be rais'd, nor how he was laid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Rais'd and Laid!—why then I warrant you take it to be nothing but a piece of Impoſture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing more certain,—a meer ſilly, idle, fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh contrivance of a Cabal of bigotted <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs a Bigotted <hi>Papiſt</hi> is a very ſottiſh ſort of Animal—But what did this deep deſign drive at?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Why, <hi>Sir,</hi> a certain <hi>Vintner</hi> not far from <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton-Square,</hi> a well-wiſher, you may be ſure, to any Religion he could get by, had a mind to draw cuſtome to his empty Houſe—For he had a vaſt proſpect of gain from the ſucceſs of the Action—For quo he to himſelf, the people will cry, whether ſhall we go? Go! ſays ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we'l go to the <hi>Hobgoblin</hi> that counterfeited the Lord <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Ghoſt—for thought he, every body will be glad to ſee a <hi>Hobgoblin.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Puh—This is ſome invention of yours to put a trick upon the poor <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>An Invention of mine! 'Tis all about the Town—and beſides, there is nothing more common among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> then to counterfeit Spirits and Ghoſts—I find you never read the Story of the four Monks of <hi>Bearn</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> that were hang'd for counterfeiting the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary;</hi> not of the Country Curate that lay with his Neece in the ſhape of St. <hi>Barbara.</hi> But the Fryer had not ſo good luck: For he living in a young Widows Houſe, would fain have frighted the young Widow into his Laſcivious Embraces—and to that purpoſe haunted her Chamber every Night in a Winding-Sheet: But ſhe being a Woman of mettle, hid a Friend of hers privately in her Chamber, that gave the Spirit ſuch a ſevere Cudgel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correction, as made him quickly beg Quarter for his bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bones.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>But all this while, where was the Profundity of the deſign?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>The profundity of the Deſign was to put the Lord <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Speech upon Dr. <hi>Burnett</hi>—And of this they were reſolv'd to have an acknowledgement out of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel's</hi> own Mouth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>That was hard to do, when his Head was cut off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Oh—but though the Head of his Body was cut off, the Head of his <hi>Ghoſt</hi> was ſtill on—However, tho' it be not to be deny'd, that a Spirit without a Head has a very brisk motion, yet the Committee were not ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as to know how to bring his Ghoſt out of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire</hi> into <hi>Bloomsbury-Square</hi>—and therefore another expedient was to be found out—The Committee was extreamly puzl'd to find out this Expedient, till the <hi>Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> inſpir'd no doubt with his own <hi>Pipes</hi> and <hi>Tierces,</hi> had it preſently in his Pate—Quo he, Ladies and Gentlemen, why may not I act a <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> as well as <hi>Matt. Medbourn?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Frolick for Frolick now, it would be a very good humour to Indict this <hi>Vintner</hi> upon the Statute of 21 <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> 26. for endeavouring to perſonate the Lord <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Ghoſt, on purpoſe to procure an acknowledgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his will and conſent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Faith <hi>Sir,</hi> the very Action it ſelf procur'd him puniſhment enough, to be well drub'd, and two ſuch lovely Forehead marks of <hi>Knave</hi> and <hi>Fool,</hi> that Ten Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, with all the Soap in the City, will never waſh off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Pardon me, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have a greater opinion of the <hi>Vintner,</hi> and that he acted what he did in the imitation of <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Eneas,</hi> who both went to viſit <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but this ſame <hi>Vintner</hi> undertook to be even a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Inhabitant of the Lower Shades himſelf, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Popiſh Intereſt, which was much a more daring deed then that of <hi>Theſeus.</hi> The <hi>Vintner</hi> had Liſted himſelf in Hell, which <hi>Theſeus</hi> never did.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Ay—but <hi>Theſeus</hi> was <hi>Theſeus; Theſeus</hi> kick'd <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpina's</hi> Dog before her Face, in her own Dining-Room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this Bugbear of a <hi>Vintner</hi> ſuffer'd himſelf to be thraſh'd like any mortal Coward, and yet the Fool had not the wit to <hi>Vaniſh.</hi>—They ſay, had the Earth yielded never ſo little, the firſt blow the Beadle hit, had ſtruck him down to the place from whence he pretended to come.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>But can you tell who hatch'd this Chicken of a Deſign?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Politick Heads, <hi>Sir,</hi> Politick Heads—very Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Heads—and of both Sexes too I aſſure ye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, I admire neither of their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities; and as for the Women, I find 'em much more famous for the crafty carrying on a Love intrigue, or concealing their private enjoyments, then in managing <hi>Hobgoblin</hi> Plots.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I do tell ye, this Committee conſiſted of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons Male and Female—<hi>Imprimis,</hi> The Man of the Houſe, and his Wife, chief <hi>Preſidenceſs</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. In the next place, two <hi>Fiſhmongers</hi> in <hi>Bloomsbury,</hi> if you hunt after the name of the one, you may eaſily find it: The other a moſt rude and ungraceful acknowledger of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s former favours, as who had all along ſerv'd his Table from his own Shop; his Grandfather ſeems to have bin the Son of <hi>Tomlins.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Fiſhmongers,</hi> Sir, were notably drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Conſpiracy—'twas emblematical—For as great undertakings require great ſilence, ſo none more likely then <hi>Fiſhmongers</hi> to bear the Proverb always in mind, <hi>As mute as a Fiſh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>The next was a <hi>Tallow-Chandler,</hi> who, tho' he live by the Night, takes his name from <hi>Noon-Day.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Why that was it that ſpoil'd the whole Plot, to engage a <hi>Tallow-Chandler</hi> in deeds of Darkneſs.</p>

               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Oh <hi>Sir,</hi> but he was to have been a Witneſs—and none ſo fit to be witneſs as a Man of Light—beſides, <hi>Sir,</hi> he was to attend the <hi>Hobgoblin,</hi> and none ſo fit as a <hi>Tallow-Chandler</hi> to hold a Candle to the Devil. But obſerve how the <hi>Tallow-Chandler</hi> was match'd; for the other witneſs was to be a <hi>Papiſtical Printer</hi> in the Neighbourhood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>There y'are right again—for if the Truth ſhould chance to ſlip out of the <hi>Chandlers</hi> memory, the <hi>Printer</hi> had always a <hi>Regiſter</hi> ready to refreſh it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>By what I hear, theres no ſuch need of rubbing up the <hi>Tallow-Chandlers</hi> memory. A my word Sir, yare got into pleaſant Company—Heres a <hi>Vintner</hi> acts the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil—and a <hi>Tallow-Chandler</hi> acts a Judge—and Judges Sir, are no Fools to have their Memories rub'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Who the Devil made the <hi>Tallow-Chandler</hi> a Judge?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Wine and Fat Venſon, Sir, at the <hi>Crown-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Bloomsbury;</hi> For there it was that the <hi>Tallow-Chandler,</hi> a witty Jocoſe Droll of a <hi>Tallow-Chandler,</hi> finding there was ſomething to be done to gratify the Company (for it was at a publick Venſon-Feaſt) took upon him the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Coife, and cauſing Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> to be arraign'd before him, Mercileſly Condemn'd him to be Hang'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>What had the <hi>Tallow-Chandler</hi> to do with Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi>—Surely he is to ſtand or fall by another ſort of Judicature then ſix i'th Pound.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Sir, 'twas done to pleaſe a brace of Reverend Juſtices that were Stewards of the Feaſt—And ſuch frolicks as theſe, Lord Sir, you cannot imagin how they digeſt Venſon Paſty Pudding-Cruſt—There are ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo hot, that you would admire they do not melt their Greaſe, and get the Scratches with Galloping after ſuch fancies as theſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>And yet when this <hi>Tallow-Chandler</hi> ſerv'd Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> with Candles, he did not ſcruple to take his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, notwithſtanding he might not then be of his ſevere Judges preſent opinion: And therefore there is ſome hope yet left, that Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> may ſweeten up his Judge into a Reprieve, upon a promiſe of laying in his <hi>Winter</hi> ſtore out of <hi>Bloomsbury.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>There was an <hi>Apothecary</hi> too, whoſe ſpleen was extreamly tickl'd at the Conceit of their deſign. Repute makes him a perſon of a bulky ſtature, famous for the beauty of his Wainſcot Lady, and the wit of his Son, whom he teaches to curſe the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>M.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Why truly, this <hi>Pothecary</hi> is highly to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded for his Loyalty: for to ſhew the Exquiſiteneſs of his Allegiance, he ſends his Child to the Devil to confirm it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>There were ſeveral others that met at two or three of theſe conſults, that have open'd their Purſes to ſave their Reputation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>I am not apt to believe, that people who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd themſelves with ſuch a ridiculous Sham as this, had much Reputation to loſe; and therefore their <hi>Peter-Pence</hi> were ill beſtow'd. The Proverb is, <hi>Diſcover, and ſhame the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>That never could be better don then by the Dreſs with which they diſguis'd him: For certainly all the <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Zunies</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew-Fair</hi> were never ſo quaintly rigg'd, as this ſame <hi>Hob-thruſh</hi> of a <hi>Vintner</hi> was equipped to act his Tragick-Comedy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>As how?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt they hung about his Neck a large <hi>Night-Rail,</hi> which the Gentlewoman of the Houſe lent him out of her Zeal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Moſt Enigmatical, Problematical, Emphatical, and Emblematical—for a <hi>Night-Rail</hi> being a kind of a Cloak, was moſt proper to cover a piece of Knavery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>To hide his lower parts, the <hi>Fiſhmongers</hi> lent him their <hi>Aprons.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>More Enigmatical ſtill—For <hi>Fiſhmongers</hi> being men of Lent and Faſting days—the <hi>Fiſhmongers Aprons</hi> were to put the Ghoſt in mind of his ſorrow, contrition and repentance, for owning a Speech that was none of his own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>By your favour, Sir, here's a Breach of an Act of Parliament diſcover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, to bring a Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of his Grave in <hi>Linnen,</hi> whereas the ought to have appear'd in <hi>Crape;</hi> and being a Lord, in Lac<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Crape</hi> too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>well! But what had the Goblin about his Head?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>His head was muffl'd up in a white Dlaper Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin—to ſhew that the Letter was diaper'd with the Inventions of ſeveral Writers, and not of one plain Woofe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Shame ſaw the Luggs on 'em, for a Company of Dotards—as if the Devil were grown as fantaſtical as the <hi>French,</hi> to change his Old faſhions—Now the old faſhions of Ghoſts, ever ſince I heard of Ghoſts, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, a Winding-ſheet with two Knots, and a Taper in the Spirits hands, with which the <hi>Chandler</hi> might eaſily have furniſh'd the Devil.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>In this Mere-maids Attire, he went attended with the two <hi>Fiſhmongirs</hi> for his Guard, and the <hi>Chandler</hi> and <hi>Printer</hi> were to be Witneſſes they ſaw the Apparition—At length, when he came to his Poſts, as the Contrivers had laid it, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tis to be ſuppoſed, near the Houſe where the Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi> Liv'd, he fell a groaning like an Oxe at the firſt Sticking; nay, he groan'd even like the Groaning-board it ſelf; and after a ſhort preamble of Lamentations lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uttered, He cryed out, <hi>Oh—I have no reſt becauſe of the Speech that I never made, but Dr.</hi> Burnet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>There's no fear ont', but he'l be taught to groan better when he comes to groan for himſelf. One would have thought he ſhould have practis'd the Art of Groaning more accurately before he went to groan upon ſuch an Occaſion as this—He ſhould have groan'd as if he had been groaning for his Life, that had taken ſuch a part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him—but it ſeems he rather fell a braying, then a groaning, and ſo diſcover'd himſelf—for upon the noiſe, as ſome Report, or at leaſt as the Goblin deſerv'd, one of the Watch coming up to him, and perceiving by his Shoes, that he had no Cloven-Feet, <hi>Can't ye be quiet,</hi> quo he, <hi>in your Grave? I'le make ye quiet;</hi> and with that, gave him ſuch a Palt o'th Pate and the Thigh, as quickly chang'd the Colour of his Ghoſtly Habit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>I' good faith, the Watchman did more then all the Comittee could do—For they only ſtrove to make him a faigned Goblin, but the Watchman made him a real <hi>Raw-Head and Bloody Bones</hi>—A Cataſtrophe that ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize juſtly deſerv'd—But what became of poor <hi>Raw-Head</hi> and <hi>Bloody-bones?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>The now real Goblin was forc'd to confeſs his name, and the names of his Aſſociates, and to chear up the Watch with Drink and Money for the fright he had put 'em in, and ſo they let him go, to groan forth his own Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Gulls that ſet him at Work.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph,</speaker>
               <p>Well, I will ſay nothing of the Speech one way nor other, but ſure it was an act neither generous nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like, to raiſe up an Impoſtor to diſturb the ſilence of a Gentlemans Grave that had paid his laſt debt to Juſtice.</p>
