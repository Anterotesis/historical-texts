            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AFter the death of <hi>Antonius, Cleopatra</hi> (liuing still in the Monument shee had caused to be built,) could not by any means be drawne forth, although <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius Caesar</hi> verie earnestly laboured it: &amp; sent <hi>Proculeius</hi> to vse all diligence to bring her vnto him: For that hee though it woulde be a great ornament to his Tryumphes, to get her aliue to Rome. But neuer woulde shee put herselfe into the hands of <hi>Proculeius,</hi> although on a time he found the meanes, (by a window that was at the top of the Monument,) to come downe vnto her: where hee perswaded her (all hee might) to
<pb facs="tcp:5446:59"/>
yeeld herselfe to <hi>Caesars</hi> mercie. Which shee, (to be ridd of him,) cunningly seemed to grant vnto. After that, <hi>Octauius</hi> in person went to visite her, to whom shee excus'd her offence, laying all the fault vpon the greatnes, and feare shee had of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and withall, seemed verie tractable, and willing to be disposed of by him.</p>
                  <p>Where-vpon, <hi>Octauius</hi> (thinking himselfe sure) resolu'd presently to send her away to Rome. Whereof, <hi>Dolabella</hi> a fauorite of <hi>Caesars,</hi> (and one that was grown into some good liking of her,) hauing certified her, shee makes her humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he would suffer her to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fize to the ghost of <hi>Antonius:</hi> which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, shee was brought vnto his Sepulcher, where after her rites performed, shee returned to the Monument, and there dined, with great magnificence. And in dinner time, came there one in the habite of a Countriman, with a basket of figgs vnto her, who (vnsuspected) was suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to carry them in. And in that basket (among the figges) were conuaid the Aspicks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with shee did herselfe to death. Dinner beeing
<pb facs="tcp:5446:59"/>
ended, shee dispatched Letters to <hi>Caesar,</hi> contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing great lamentations: with an earnest suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that shee might be entomb'd with <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> Wherevpon, <hi>Caesar</hi> knowing what shee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, sent presently with all speed, messengers to haue preuented her death, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, before they came was dispatched.</p>
                  <p>

                        <l>This act of life, that part of Fates assign'd mee:</l>
                        <l>What glory or disgrace heere this world lends,</l>
                        <l>Both haue I had, and both I leaue behinde mee.</l>
                        <l>And now Ã´ Earth, the Theater where I</l>
                        <l>Haue acted this, witnes I dye vnforst.</l>
                        <l>Witnes my soule parts free to <hi>Anthony,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>And now proude Tyrant <hi>Caesar</hi> doe thy worst.</l>
                        <l>This sayd, shee stayes, and makes a suddaine pause,</l>
                        <l>As twere to feele whither the poyson wrought:</l>
                        <l>Or rather els the working might be cause</l>
                        <l>That made her stay, as likewise may be thought.</l>
                        <l>For in that instant I might well perceiue,</l>
                        <l>The drowsie humor in her falling brow:</l>
                        <l>And how each powre, each part opprest did leaue</l>
                        <l>Theyr former office, and did sencelesse grow.</l>
                        <l>Looke how a new-pluckt branch against the Sunne,</l>
                        <l>Declynes his fading leaues in feeble sort,</l>
                        <l>So her disioyned ioyntures as vndonne.</l>
                        <l>Let fall her weake dissolued limmes support.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb facs="tcp:5446:97"/>
Yet loe that face the wonder of her life,</l>
                        <l>Retaines in death, a grace that graceth death,</l>
                        <l>Couller so liuely, cheere so louely rife,</l>
                        <l>That none wold think such beauty could want breath.</l>
                        <l>And in that cheere, th'impression of a smile</l>
                        <l>Did seeme to shew shee scorned Death and <hi>Caesar,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>As glorying that shee could them both beguile,</l>
                        <l>And telling death how much her death did please her.</l>
                        <l>VVonder it was to see how soone shee went,</l>
                        <l>Shee went with such a will, and did so haste it,</l>
                        <l>That sure I thinke shee did her paine preuent,</l>
                        <l>Fore-going paine, or staying not to taste it.</l>
                        <l>And sencelesse, in her sinking downe shee wryes</l>
                        <l>The Diadem which on her head shee wore,</l>
                        <l>Which <hi>Charmion</hi> (poore weake feeble mayd) espyes,</l>
                        <l>And hastes to right it as it was before.</l>
                        <l>For <hi>Eras</hi> now was dead, and <hi>Charmion</hi> too</l>
                        <l>Euen at the poynt, for both would imitate</l>
                        <l>Theyr Mistres glory, striuing like to doo.</l>
                        <l>But <hi>Charmion</hi> would in this exceede her mate,</l>
                        <l>For shee would haue this honour to be last,</l>
                        <l>That should adorne that head that must be seene</l>
                        <l>To weare a Crowne in death, that life held fast,</l>
                        <l>That all the world might know shee dyde a Queene.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb facs="tcp:5446:97"/>
And as shee stood setting if fitly on,</l>
                        <l>Lo in rush <hi>Caesars</hi> Messengers in haste,</l>
                        <l>Thinking to haue preuented what was doone,</l>
                        <l>But yet they came too late, for all was past.</l>
                        <l>For there they found stretch'd on a bed of gold,</l>
                        <l>Dead <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and that proudly dead,</l>
                        <l>In all the riche attyre procure shee could,</l>
                        <l>And dying <hi>Charmion</hi> trymming of her head.</l>
                        <l>And <hi>Eras</hi> at her feete, dead in like case.</l>

                           <hi>Charmion,</hi> is this well doone? said one of them.</l>

                        <l>And with that word, yeelds too her faithful breath,</l>
