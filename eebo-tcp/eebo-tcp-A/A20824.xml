            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE NINTH EGLOG.</head>
            <l>VVhen cole-blacke night with sable vaile</l>
            <l>eclipsd the gladsome light,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Rowland</hi> in darkesome shade alone,</l>
            <l>bemoanes his wofull plight.</l>
            <lg>
               <l>WHat time the wetherbeaten flockes,</l>
               <l>forsooke the fields to shrowd them in the folde,</l>
               <l>The groues dispoyl'd of their fayre summer lockes,</l>
               <l>the leaueles branches nipt with frostie colde,</l>
               <l>The drouping trees their gaynesse all agone,</l>
               <l>In mossie mantles doe expresse their moane.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When <hi>Phoebus</hi> from his Lemmans louely bower,</l>
               <l>throughout the sphere had ierckt his angry Iades,</l>
               <l>His Carre now pass'd the heauens hie welked Tower,</l>
               <l>gan dragge adowne the occidentall slades,</l>
               <l>In silent shade of desart all alone,</l>
               <l>Thus to the night, <hi>Rowland</hi> bewrayes his moane.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh blessed starres which lend the darknes light,</l>
               <l>the glorious paynting of that circled throane,</l>
               <l>You eyes of heauen, you lanthornes of the night,</l>
               <l>to you bright starres, to you I make my moane,</l>
               <l>Or end my dayes, or ease me of my griefe,</l>
               <l>The earth is frayle, and yeelds me no reliefe.</l>

               <l>then <hi>Tytan</hi> is when brightest he hath shone,</l>
               <l>Why shouldst thou now shut vp thy blessed light,</l>
               <l>and sdayne to looke on thy <hi>Endymion</hi>?</l>
               <l>Perhaps the heauens me thus despight haue done,</l>
               <l>Because I durst compare thee with their sunne.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>If downe-cast lookes with darksome cloudes opprest,</l>
               <l>or words which with sad accents fall and rise,</l>
               <l>If these, nor her, nor you, to pittie moue,</l>
               <l>There's neither helpe in you, nor hope in loue.</l>

               <l>Vnto thy hart more hard then flintie rocke,</l>
               <l>And lastly thus depriu'd me of their sight,</l>

               <l>and recketh as the rustick madrigall,</l>
               <l>Her lippes prophane <hi>Ideas</hi> sacred name,</l>

               <l>Those gorgeous garlands and those goodly flowers,</l>
               <l>wherewith I crown'd her tresses in the prime,</l>
               <l>She most abhors, and shuns those pleasant bowers,</l>
               <l>made to disport her in the summer time:</l>
               <l>She hates the sports and pastimes I inuent,</l>
               <l>And as the toade, flies all my meriment.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With holy verses heryed I her gloue,</l>
