            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Ten Seaſonable Queries, PROPOSED By a PROTESTANT that is for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to all Perſwaſions.</head>
            <p>
               <label>I.</label> WHether any Real and Zealous Papiſt was ever for Liberty of Conſcience? it being a fundamental Principle of their Religion, That all Chriſtians that do not believe as they do, are Hereticks, and ought to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <label>II.</label> Whether the King be a Real and Zealous Papiſt? if he be; whether he can be truly for Liberty of Conſcience?</p>
            <p>
               <label>III.</label> Whether this King in his Brother's Reign did not cauſe the Perſecution againſt Diſſenters to be more violent than otherwife it would have been?</p>
            <p>
               <label>IV.</label> Whether he doth not now make uſe of the Diſſenters to pull down the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as he did of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to ruin the Diſſenters, that the Papiſts may be the better enabled, in a ſhort time, to deſtroy them both?</p>
            <p>
               <label>V.</label> Whether any ought to believe he will be for Liberty any longer than it ſerves his turn? and whether his great eagerneſs to have the Penal Laws and Teſt repealed be onely in order to the eaſie eſtabliſhing of Popery?</p>
            <p>
               <label>VI.</label> Whether if theſe Penal Laws and Teſt were repealed, there would not many turn Papiſts that now dare not?</p>
            <p>
               <label>VII.</label> Whether the forcing of all that are in Offices of Profit or Truſt in the Nation, to loſe their Places, or declare they will be for Repealing the Penal Laws and Teſt, be not Violating his own Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, and a new Teſt upon the People?</p>
            <p>
               <label>VIII.</label> Whether the Suſpending the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the Diſpoſſeſſing of the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge of their Freeholds, the Impriſoning and Proſecuting the Seven Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for Reaſoning according to Law, are not ſufficient inſtances how well the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Repeal his Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, wherein he promiſeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and maintain all his Biſhops and Clergy, and all other his Subjects of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in quiet and full enjoyment of all their Poſſeſſions, without any moleſtation or diſturbance whatſoever?</p>
            <p>
               <label>IX.</label> Whether the Uſage of the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> for theſe three years paſt, be not a ſufficient warning not to truſt to the Declaration, Promiſes or Oaths in matters of Religion of any Papiſt whatſoever?</p>
            <p>
               <label>X.</label> Whether any Equivalent whatſoever under a Popiſh King, that hath a ſtanding Army, and pretends to a Diſpenſing Power, can be as equal ſecurity as the Penal Laws and Teſt, as affairs now ſtand in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any think fit to Anſwer theſe <hi>Queries,</hi> they are deſired to do it as plainly and fairly as they are here put.</hi>
