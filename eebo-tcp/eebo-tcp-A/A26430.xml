            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>FROM THE <hi>Inſurance-Office for Houſes,</hi> ON THE Back-Side of the Royal-Exchange.</head>
            <p>IT was thought fit to give this Advertiſement, That whereas there are Propoſitions in Print, ſetting forth the Rates and Terms for <hi>Inſuring of Houſes;</hi> being <hi>Six Pence</hi> in the <hi>Pound</hi> Rent for Brick-Houſes, and <hi>Twelve Pence</hi> for Timber, with Deduction for the Ground-Rent; for which, the <hi>Office</hi> is to Re-build, or to Pay the Party, whoſe Houſe is Inſured, <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> for every <hi>Ten Pounds per Annum</hi> Rent, that is Inſured, as oft as the ſaid Houſe is Burnt down, according to the Election then made at the Time <hi>of Inſurance.</hi> And whereas thoſe Words, <hi>Burnt Down,</hi> were not ſo large, but that they might admit of a Queſtion, <hi>whether it was intended, that Houſes Blown up, or Pulled down, were to be Rebuilt, or receive Satisfaction, as if they were Burnt down?</hi> And likewiſe, thoſe Words did not make Proviſion, in caſe the Houſes were only Damnified. It is thought fit therefore to declare, That it is the Intent of the <hi>Inſurers,</hi> that Houſes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that are Blown up, and Pulled down, as well as Burnt down, ſhould be Re-built at the Charge of the <hi>Office,</hi> or receive Satisfaction in Money, according as in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were ſet forth, for Inſuring of Houſes, and in a New Edition now expreſſed; the Former Copy being ſince Corrected, and the Words added, <hi>Burnt down, Demoliſhed, or any wiſe Damnified, by reaſon of Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe it might occaſion ſome Diſpute about the Expences of Work-Men, in making good the Damages where the Houſe is neither Burnt down nor Demoliſhed, but only Broken or Damnified; it is thought neceſſary to avoyd ſuch Differences, that the <hi>Office</hi> ſhould have the Liberty to ſet their own Work-Men, to Repair all ſuch Damages: And if they are not Repaired at the Charge of the <hi>Office</hi> within Two Months after the ſaid Damages made, then to Forfeit the whole Sum expreſſed in the Policy, as if the ſame were Burnt down or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed: The Penalty is made the Greater, to avoyd all Suſpicions of Difference, that might ariſe about the Charge of the <hi>Reparation,</hi> that Difference being Avoided, there can ariſe no Diſpute; for the Breaches and Damages then made, will be as Viſible and Certain, as if the <hi>Inſured Houſe were Burnt Down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was promiſed in the <hi>Printed Propoſitions,</hi> That the <hi>Names</hi> of the <hi>Inſurers,</hi> and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the Eſtates or Securities lye, with the <hi>Names</hi> of the Truſtees, ſhould in a ſhort time, be ſet forth; that all Satisfaction might be given, as far as is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Names</hi> of the Parties that are Principally concerned, Are <hi>Samuel Vincent,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Dr. <hi>Nicholas Barbon,</hi> who have the Security or Fund in their Poſſeſſion; there are ſeveral other Perſons that are Sharers, whoſe Moneys is to pay off the incumbrances on the ſeveral Eſtates, which becauſe it is not Material to the Security, their Names are here Omitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Eſtates</hi> that are intended to be Setled for the Security, are the Ground-Rents of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Buildings, being <hi>One Thouſand</hi> &amp; <hi>Fifty Pounds per Ann.</hi> And the Ground-Rents at the Lower-End of Saint <hi>Martins-Lane,</hi> from the <hi>Strand</hi> to the Church-Yard, being <hi>Three Hundred For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Seven Pounds</hi> per Ann. And the Ground-Rents of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Buildings, without <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> being <hi>Seven Hundred</hi> and <hi>Nine Pounds</hi> per Ann. whereof <hi>Four Hundred Pounds</hi> per Ann. or thereabouts, is Built, and the other a Building; being in the whole <hi>Two Thouſand One Hundred</hi> and <hi>Six Pounds</hi> per Ann. (the Rental of which Eſtates are to be ſeen at the <hi>Office,</hi> by all Perſons that deſire to ſee them): Which Security is more then the Undertakers did at Firſt propoſe. But finding their Propoſitions meet with a general Acceptance, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling not to be wanting on their part in the Security.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Names</hi> of the Truſtees upon whom theſe Eſtates are to be Setled, cannot yet be declared; becauſe it is intended they ſhall be choſen by the Conſent of thoſe Perſons that have already Subſcribed, and that ſhall Subſcribe before the Firſt of <hi>June;</hi> and to that intent it's deſired, that all Perſons that have Subſcribed, and that ſhall before that Time Subſcribe, would pleaſe to meet at the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> on the Eighth of <hi>June,</hi> next, at Three of the Clock in the Afternoon, to give their Advice, and Conſent in Chooſing the Truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees: That time being thought moſt convenient.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time it may be convenient, for the Subſcribers to Name Counſel for Setling of the <hi>Conveyances,</hi> and to Appoint ſome of their Number (in the behalf of the reſt) to ſee the Incumberances Diſcharged from the ſeveral Eſtates, and the Conveyances executed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true intent and meaning of the aforeſaid <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> at the Charge of the <hi>Office.</hi>
