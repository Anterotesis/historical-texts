            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I do declare, if any charge me with too much <hi>Keenneſs</hi> and <hi>Acrimony</hi> in my Reproofs, that this is my <hi>Apology</hi> before God and the World: I had no Intention to <hi>Expoſe,</hi> but to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> the <hi>Refuſers</hi> of the <hi>New Oaths,</hi> having no Pique or Quarrel at any Man's Perſon, though I muſt be excus'd as to his Opinions and Actions.

            <p>When I conſidered the general <hi>Stupidity</hi> of the meaner ſort, the <hi>Indifferency</hi> and <hi>Luke-warmneſs</hi> of ſome of the better Rank, and the <hi>Activeneſs</hi> and <hi>Intriegueing</hi> of the <hi>High-flown Monarchical Men,</hi> I thought it not convenient to put <hi>Honey</hi> into the Sacrifice inſtead of <hi>Salt,</hi> and to bring the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and remiſneſs of <hi>Eli,</hi> when there was more need of the Zeal and Courage of <hi>Phinehas.</hi>

            <p>THOUGH God be the Soveraign Lord of All, by Right of Creation, Dominion and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in which Senſe he is a God to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Enemies of his Truth, as Jews, Pagans, Mahometans, and Hereticks, the Denyers of his Being not excepted; they ſubſiſt and are maintained by his Bounty, for he giveth them <hi>Life and breath, and all things,</hi> Acts 17. 25. and maketh his <hi>Sun to riſe on the Evil, and ſendeth Rain on the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> Mat. 5. 45. yet he

is in a more ſpecial manner the God of the Faithful, he is <hi>their. God</hi> in Covenant, and they <hi>his People,</hi> Jer. 32. 38. To theſe he imparts his Graces, and deals out his more than common Favours. Theſe are <hi>his Elect, his Choſen</hi> out of the World, <hi>A peculiar Treaſure, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Prieſts, and an Holy Nation,</hi> Exod. 19. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>The School-men ſet forth their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him in a three-fold Reſpect, of his ſingular Care of them, the Holy Service they perform to him, and the great Reward where with he Crowns them.<note place="margin">Aquin. <hi>ſup.</hi> Rom.

               </note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a little variation of the Words, we may ſay to them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did to <hi>Iſrael, Happy-are ye,</hi> O Believers! <hi>Who is like unto ye,</hi> O People, <hi>ſaved by the Lord?</hi> Deut. 33. 29. <hi>The eternal God is your Refuge, and underneath are the everlaſting Arms,</hi> Deut. 33. 27.</p>
            <p>But though the Church be God's peculiar Favorite, and under the watchful Eye of Heaven; yet the Devil and his Inſtruments bear a mortal hatred to Her, and render her Condition a perpetual Warfare upon Earth.</p>
            <p>But her ſecurity being laid in the Divine Protection, which ſtill <hi>encompaſſeth</hi> Her <hi>with Favour, as with a Shield,</hi> Pſal. 5. 12. In vain are all Attempts and Deſigns of Her Enemies. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might conſider theſe words with reſpect to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes of the Faithful, and ſhew how God is with them by his Spirit, Graces, and Providence, to Guide, Aſſiſt, and Protect them; and how he ſecures them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the many Fears that ariſe from inward Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and outward Aſſaults, by ſtrengthening their

Faith againſt all that is formidable in the World, and confirming their Hope <hi>in the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> from which nothing can <hi>ſeparate</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But having an intention to re-mind you of the ſignal Mercies vouchſaf'd this Nation, no leſs ſhamefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſted by ſome, than unthankfully forgot or miſapplied by others; I ſhall handle them with relation to this Church and People. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Give you the importance of this Phraſe, <hi>If God be for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Remember you wherein <hi>God hath manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s already.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. Then this Phraſe, <hi>If God be for us,</hi> imports two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>God's <hi>Gracious Preſence,</hi> and</item>
               <item>His <hi>Particular Providence,</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, by God's <hi>Gracious Preſence,</hi> with a Church or People, I underſtand his being ſo with them, as to ſet up and maintain Truth and Goſpel, his Worſhip and Ordinances amongſt them, and to gather to himſelf a willing and obedient People, that deſire to know him and his Law, and to ſerve him with Reverence and Godly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105685:5"/>
Fear; and who diligently obſerve the Sacraments and Rites of his <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> againſt the apparent <hi>Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> made upon the <hi>Church,</hi> by the <hi>Inventions</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of Men: For <hi>Humane Additions</hi> are not only <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded,</hi> but <hi>Forbidden</hi> in the Service of God, and the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. and conſequently the Church had the promiſe of God's Preſence granted, upon no other Terms, but an <hi>exact Conformity</hi> to what he had <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There muſt be a <hi>Divine Warrant</hi> for our Faith and Practice (let ſubtile Men deviſe what Diſtinctions and Evaſions they can to reconcile the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and their <hi>Innovations)</hi> or we cannot expect God's merciful <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of our Services. For to ſtamp any thing of but a Humane Original with a Divine Character, and thruſt it upon the Conſciences of Men to bind unto Obedience, is the advancing of our <hi>Own</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Chriſt's Supreme Authority,</hi> who is the only <hi>Law-giver</hi> to his Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Phraſe, <hi>If God be for us,</hi> imports his <hi>Particular Providence</hi> over a People, or Nation. By which, I mean, his more immediate Concernment for them, as when he viſibly aſſerts their Cauſe, which he moſt commonly does by Inſtruments unthought of, or, perhaps deſpiſed by the Enemy, but ſpecially Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by God to accompliſh their Deliverance in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers overthrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the</hi> Providence <hi>of God may be conſidered, either more largely, which I call his</hi> general, <hi>or in the former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, which may be termed his</hi> particular Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105685:5"/>
To his <hi>general Providence</hi> are ſubject all things in the World, the ſmalleſt and moſt inconſiderable in our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem are not excluded; <hi>The very hairs of our head are all numbred,</hi> Mat. 10. 29, 30. and <hi>two Sparrows ſold for a Farthing fall not on the ground without it.</hi> They that have excepted Inferiour Matters from it, as being (in their Opinion) derogatory to God's tranſcendent Majeſty to ſtoop ſo low, have inſtead of magnifying, leſſen'd his Royal Prerogative; his Providence being as uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd as his Eſſence and Dominion.</p>
            <p>It was therefore a groſs Error in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to confine it to the Moon, by ſhutting out all things below, as <note n="a" place="margin">Legat. pro Chriſt.</note>

and bring within the Line of his Providence, not only intellectual and ſenſitive Beings, but Plants, Meteors, and all things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 8, 16.</p>
            <p>But of all ſublunary Things, Man (made after the Image of God) falls more expreſly under his Care: For, as he <hi>made him a little lower than the Angels, ſo he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him above the other Creatures, and crown'd him with Glory and Honour,</hi> Pſal. 8. 5. And, if Man ſingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, be ſo near unto him, then much more Man in Society, Bodies and Communities of Men.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Particular Providence</hi> is converſant about Good Men, and eſpecially about a People or Nation, profeſſing and practiſing his Holy and Eternal Truth; for 'tis not a bare and abſtract Profeſſion; 'tis not the Pomp and Splendour of our Devotions, nor the crying out with thoſe Jews in the Prophet, <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 7. 4. but plainneſs and ſincerity of Heart, and a truly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Uniform Life, that will entitle us to his Gracious Favour. And for a People, thus Evangelically qualified, the <hi>Right Hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to paſs.</hi> And as in <hi>Common Calamities,</hi> the Good oft-times ſuffer with the Bad, though with this difference, the Good are better'd and refin'd thereby, and the Bad become much worſe; ſo in <hi>Publick Mercies,</hi> the Evil participate with the Righteous, and are preſerved for their Sakes: Thus the Prayers of <hi>Moſes</hi> prevailed for the Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 31. 7. to 15. and the Peoples requeſting <hi>Samuel, to pray to God for them that they died not,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 19. intimates their Safety lay in his Interceſſion. And this ſhews, though the Wicked are by far the major part, what exceeding Love God hath for his People, when his Mercy ſhall preſerve the very Tares for the Wheat ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105685:6"/>
But now, though the Wicked ſhare with the Godly in <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>National Mercies,</hi> yet the uſes are vaſtly different which they draw therefrom; the Godly are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to Humility, Thankfulneſs, and Obedience to clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Communion with God, and warmer Reſentments of his Love; whereas the Wicked ſuck Poiſon out of his Goodneſs, by unthankfully abuſing it to Luxury &amp; Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and taking occaſion thereby to ſin more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and ſecurely. I wiſh, beſides that other of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and cenſuring, grown too common among us, the ſin of prophane Ingratitude be not laid to our Charge. For ſince our late <hi>Great Deliverance,</hi> how few with the one <hi>Leper return Glory to God,</hi> Luke 17. but how many with the <hi>other Nine</hi> forget him? Nay, do we not rather ſeem to have an Inclination to our former Slavery, than any true Affection to our preſent Freedom? as though to walk at large were leſs deſireable, than Chains and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
            <p>The old Romans were ſo fooliſhly ſuperſtitious, as to build an Altar to a Feaver, and ſo become Worſhippers of their Diſeafe: and is not our Folly altogether as great, to Idolize our Enemy, and make inevitable Ruine our Sanctuary? To put the Sword, which we ought to keep for our Defence, into an Adverſary's Hand to protect us, is as unpardonable a Weakneſs, as to throw our ſelves into the Fire, in hopes of being ſaved by a Miracle.</p>
            <p>When God preſcribes Means and ſecondary Helps, we muſt obey his Order, and implore his Bleſſing in the uſe of them. Though God be pleaſed ſometimes to Act ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, not only without, but contrary to means; yet we muſt not leave the uſual way of <hi>Providence,</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105685:7"/>
preſently expect <hi>Wonders.</hi> We know who hath ſaid, That <hi>man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word, which proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> Mat. 4. 4. and yet that word is annex'd to <hi>Bread,</hi> and not to <hi>Stones;</hi> and 'tis not <hi>Truſting,</hi> but <hi>Mocking,</hi> and <hi>Tempting</hi> of God, to faſt till <hi>Stones</hi> ſhould be converted into <hi>Bread.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is impoſſible to God, but what implies Weakneſs or Contradiction; he can as eaſily defeat our Enemies without <hi>Fleets</hi> and <hi>Armies,</hi> as he ſmote <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Camp, and <hi>made them in one night all dead Corps,</hi> 2 Kings 19, 35. But as the <hi>Sword of Gideon</hi> was to go along with the <hi>Sword of the Lord,</hi> as a Teſtimony of <hi>Obedience,</hi> not an Addition of <hi>Strength,</hi> Judg. 7. 18. and as <hi>David,</hi> though he confeſs'd, <hi>The Lord ſaveth not with Sword and Spear;</hi> yet took a <hi>Sling and</hi> a <hi>Stone</hi> for his Weapon, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 47, 49. So muſt we depend upon God in the uſe of his appointed Means, not in Confidence of their Help, but in Obedience to his Divine Order. And thus truſting in him, in a dutiful Subordination to his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> we may be ſure of his <hi>Gracious Protection.</hi> Then will he be with us, as he was with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua, He will not fail us, nor forſake us,</hi> Joſh. 1. 5.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105685:7"/>
of her Pilot,</hi> at the Haven where ſhe would be, we may with Admiration reflect upon the many immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers ſhe hath paſt.</p>
            <p>To make which Reflection work the more kindly; give me leave to remember you, of what Almighty God hath ſo lately done for us, by removing the Invaſions made upon our <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Rights,</hi> and fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the grand Deſign upon the Reformation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For our <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> what Invaſions were made upon them, the Hiſtory of the late Arbitrary Reign is ſo well known, that 'tis impoſſible to be miſtaken. Liberty and Property, the Birth-right of every Engliſh Man, were rendered meer Titulary things; and Parliamentary Law, by which we ought to be govern'd, was laid aſide as uſeleſs, while the Will and Pleaſure of the Prince uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Legiſlature. For the <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> (the moſt exorbitant thing that ever could be advanc'd) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet up above known Eſtabliſhed Laws, and made the ſole Standard of Government, brought both our Lives, Liberties, Honours and Eſtates entirely under it.</p>
            <p>By vertue of this <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> we ſaw Popiſh Judges and Juſtices ſit in Courts of Judicature, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia was put into the hands of unqualified Officers, and a ſtanding Army kept up contrary to Law. The liberty of chooſing Members of Parliament was wholy taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, by ſerving Corporations with <hi>Quo Warranto's,</hi> and forcing them to ſurrender their Charters, and to receive them again with ſuch Alterations, that might make room for <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Magiſtrates, or at beſt ſuch indifferent Proteſtants, as were prepared not to hinder the great Intriegue. The Violence done to <hi>Magdalen-Colledge</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105685:8"/>
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> in outing the Preſident and Fellows of their Freeholds, by an illegal High-Commiſſion-Court, for their ever memorable ſteddineſs to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and Statutes of their Founder; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning the Biſhops, and trying them as Criminals, for preſenting a moſt humble Petition, that they might be excus'd diſtributing a Declaration grounded upon the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> were but the beginning of our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, the ſevere Prologue to a diſmal Tragedy.</p>
            <p>So that being invaded daily in our <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> we had nothing left us, but a fearful Expectation of merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Oppreſſion, had not God ſent us ſeaſonable ſuccour by his <hi>Preſent Majeſty</hi>'s means, to whom, under God, we owe the reſcuing our Lives and Liberties out of our Enemies hands.</p>
            <p>Let this conſideration be well weigh'd, and unleſs Slavery be more eligible than Freedom; and Tyranny, than the Bleſſing of an eaſie Government, as the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made upon our Civil Rights were actually many, and the ſubſequent juſtly dreaded dangers more: ſo the Deliverance muſt be acknowledged to be extraordinary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God has done great things for us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> ſo has he done no leſs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending our <hi>Religion,</hi> which was the mark our Enemies chiefly ſhot at, as is obvious from the Methods they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigably purſued to overthrow it. Popiſh Chappels and Schools were erected throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and <hi>Popery</hi> it ſelf, which is downright <hi>Idolatry,</hi> condemn'd by Scripture, and juſtly baniſh'd by our <hi>Laws,</hi> was publickly tolerated againſt both. <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who were wont to walk in diſguiſe, put off their Vizards; and as ambitious of being known, appear'd openly at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105685:8"/>
               <hi>Maſs.</hi> They Married, Baptized, Conſecrated, made ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſions, Proſelyted the Looſe, Ignorant and Debauch'd, and bid defiance to our Laws.</p>
            <p>Statutes made againſt Correſpondence with the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſuſpended, and <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours</hi> were ſent, and <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s received, by none other Authority but the <hi>Omnipotent Diſpenſing Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> pretended a favourable Deſign, but was ſoon diſcovered to be all ſham; for Liberty and Infallibility being utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, it was quickly found out (even by thoſe they thought to have gain'd by it) notwithſtanding its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretexts of Conſcience and Moderation, to be a trick to engage <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whoſe ſtrength lies in their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> into mutual <hi>Quarrels</hi> and <hi>Contentions;</hi> that the Contrivers might thereby the more ſucceſsfully have ruin'd us.</p>
            <p>By theſe and ſuch like Methods, they vigorouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and thought themſelves ſo certain of Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing their <hi>Apoſtolical Church,</hi> that they ridicul'd our Religion, call'd us Hereticks to our Faces, and threatned us not only with the Writ <hi>De Haeretico comburendo,</hi> but to ſacrifice our <hi>Bibles</hi> to their Rage. And had they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered in their Counſels, as God might juſtly have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them for our Sins, this flouriſhing Kingdom had ſoon been turn'd into an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a Field of Bloud, and the <hi>Marian</hi> Racks, Stakes and Gibbets would have been acted over again. I tremble to think what the <hi>French and Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> have ſuffered, and what we might have lookt for from Men of the ſame bloudy Principles here. I need not tell you, that Cruelty is one principal part of their Religion, &amp; that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> has made
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105685:9"/>
more Martyrs than the Ten Perſecutions. Hiſtories are ſo full of their Maſſacres and Murthers, that 'tis no <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole</hi> to ſay, the Butcheries of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have exceeded thoſe of <hi>Pagan Rome,</hi> and Chriſt's <hi>Pretended Vicar</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the utmoſt Rage and Inhumanity of all the <hi>Heathen Emperours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all; for, if they had ſucceeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Hopes, or rather, Confidences: How had this Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> become the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt?</hi> How had the goodly <hi>Vine</hi> of the Reformation, which the <hi>Lord of the Vine-yard had planted, made to take deep root in our Land,</hi> pruned and cultivated, and <hi>caus'd to ſpread out her Branches like the Cedars of Lebanon, been rooted up and devoured by the Italian Boars, and Wild-Beaſts</hi> of <hi>Doway</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> Pſal. 80. 8, 9, 10, 13.

            <p>If any thing can ſhake off our Lethargy, and work in us a through Reſentment of a Mercy, methinks it ſhould be this. Behold!

            <p>O wonderful work! the Pit that was digg'd, the Diggers are fallen into, the ſnare that was laid has catch'd the Fowlers; the Lion that ſtood open-mouth'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, hath deſerted his Prey, and the Babel-Builders were confounded in their Work and Language in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.

            <p>But to return (if I may call this a Digreſſion) to the ſubject in hand, our Supports are as many as the Benefits we enjoy; upon which I might enlarge: but in a word, the unparallel'd Accompliſhments of our King, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of our Parliament, the ſteady Alliance of our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, the general Quiet at Home, and wonderful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of our Arms Abroad, loudly proclaim the Divine Aſſiſtance, and certainly foretell a proſperous Futurity, if not prevented by our Impieties.

            <p n="2">2. From his <hi>Promiſes;</hi> touching which, this Rule is to be obſerved, <q>That being generally made to all, or particularly to ſome, they are equally applicable to any, in any condition, unto which they are ſuitable. For they all meet in Chriſt, as the ſeveral Lines of a Circumference do in the Center, and ſo are no otherwiſe diviſible to ſeveral Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, than the Exigence of their particular Eſtates doth diverſify them, and ſo fit them for ſuch Promiſes, as now to others, or at other times to themſelves would be unſeaſonable.</q>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> upon 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</note> When therefore we meet with any Promiſe in Scripture which is parallel to our caſe, we may apply it to our ſelves, and it does as truly belong to us, as to whom it was made, if we are under equal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and Qualifications.

            <p>All our Title to the Promiſes depends upon our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation: Now the Covenant conſiſts of Mercies promiſed on God's part, and Duties commanded on ours, which are ſo inſeparably connected, that the latter muſt of neceſſity be done, to give us any rational inducements

From the <hi>Examples</hi> of the Faithfull, who all along proceed upon this Topick, and have left their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of God's Deliverances for Documents to us, we may draw the like comfortable inferences that they did. Thus when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were afraid of the <hi>Giants of the Land, Moſes</hi> encouraged them with this Argument, <hi>Dread not, neither be afraid of them; the Lord your God which goeth before you, he ſhall ſight for you, according to all that he did for you in Aegypt before your Eyes: And in the Wilderneſs, where thou haſt ſeen how the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his Son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this Place,</hi> Deut. 1. 29, 30. 31. And again, <hi>I commanded Joſhua</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at that time,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thine eyes have ſeen all, that the Lord your God hath done unto theſe two Kings. So ſhall the Lord do unto all the Kingdoms whither thou paſſeſt, ye ſhall not fear them; for the Lord your God he ſhall ſight for you,</hi> Deut. 3. 21, 22. So <hi>David</hi> argued, when he was to fight <hi>Goliah, The Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the Lyon, and out of the Paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 37. And ſo the Faithful in the Prophet, <hi>Art not thou he, that didſt cut Rahab, and wound the Dragon? Art not thou he, that didſt dry the Sea, the waters of the great deep? that madeſt the depths of the Sea, a way for the ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſs over? Therefore the redeemed of the Lord ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and come with ſinging unto Zion, and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their head,</hi> Iſa. 51. 9, 10, 11.</p>

deny'd ſucceſs to him, and gave it to us: Who continues in the Communion of that <hi>Apoſtatical Church,</hi> which God hath viſibly caſt  off and forſaken, for her ſpiritual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries and other deteſtable Crimes.<note place="margin">

            <p>There is a twofold uſe of God's Judgments, the one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, and the other ſpiritual, the firſt is that which hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Impenitents make of them, but the ſecond is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to the truly Faithful.

               <hi>He hardned himſelf Voluntarily, and God Judicially,</hi> Exod, 7. 13, &amp; 10, 1, 20, 27. For God is often ſaid in Scripture to harden the Heart, but he doth it not by <hi>infuſing</hi> any <hi>Evil Qualities;</hi> but ſometimes by <hi>forſaking</hi> and not <hi>hindering</hi> the Sinner, and ſometimes by <hi>delivering him over to vile affections and a reprobate Mind,</hi> Rom. 1. 26, 28. This diſtinction is ſound, but the Blaſphemy of <hi>Florinus,</hi> and the Hereſy of <hi>Pelagius</hi> muſt be carefully avoided.</p>
            <p>It is one of the ſaddeſt Symptoms in the World, when the Sinner is not ſoftened under the mighty hand of God, but Anvile-like, grows harder under Blows, and a moſt infallible ſign that God will not deſiſt, but proceed in his Judgments againſt the Incorrigible, becauſe he will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when he judges, and for that reaſon, will judge
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105685:13"/>
till he overcomes. If therefore the <hi>Papiſt</hi> will <hi>ſtop his Ears,</hi> &amp; <hi>cloſeh is Eyes, that he may neither hear with the one, nor ſee with the other,</hi> his Reſolution is deſperate, and madneſs incureable; and God will leave him to himſelf, as he did <hi>Ephraim;</hi> becauſe <hi>he is joyned to Idols, let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> Hoſea 4. 17.</p>
            <p>But as he is not <hi>Spiritually</hi> wrought upon, ſo neither is he to any degree of <hi>Common Civility;</hi> for he is ſo very ingrateful to thoſe that give him his Life, that were it in his Power, he would requite their Clemency with a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Aſſaſſination. And this he gives us occaſion to believe not only by his unquiet deportment, and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Rancour, which expreſſes it ſelf in <hi>Groundleſs Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, Falſe Reports, Seditious Libels, Bitter Invectives,</hi> and <hi>Perpetual Plotting</hi> againſt the Government: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the avow'd Doctrines and Authentick Principles of his Church; for having implicitly reſign'd his Soul to the <hi>Paternal Conduct</hi> of thoſe Holy Fathers, the <hi>Prieſts and Jeſuits,</hi> our Sacramentally-ſworn Enemies, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Filial Obligation</hi> to deſtroy us, as oft as thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Guides ſhall ſee it good for the Catholick-Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Titulary Proteſtant</hi> falls next under Reproof, and deſerves to be reprehended as publickly, as he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately attacks us. 'Tis true, he pretends to be of our Communion, but ſeeing his Actions do not anſwer his Pretences, he is in this particular worſe than the Papiſt, who is what he pretends. The Papiſt is our open Enemy, but he is our ſecret one, and his Wound, like that of a Friend, is of all the moſt deadly. He is angry with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is done, becauſe not done after his Humour. The <hi>Breaking</hi> of the <hi>Original Contract</hi> ſmells too much in his Noſtrils of <hi>Forty One:</hi> The names of <hi>Convention</hi>

and <hi>Parliament</hi> go down with him like Chopt-Hay, and ſo cannot tell which to diſlike moſt, the <hi>Taxes</hi> or <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He greatly admired the Penal Laws, becauſe they gave him Power to ſcourge when he pleaſed; but being Repealed, he crys, he is undone. He has a great many Fears upon him, but his chiefeſt is, that Ceremonies will be aboliſh'd, and the Cleak be equalized to the Surplice, for he dreads Presbytery more than Popery: But he will do well to conſider, that Ceremonies are in their <hi>own nature Indiſſerent and Alterable,</hi> that there is no Sanctity now in Veſtments, <note place="margin">Preface to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer-Book.</note> and that the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Aſſemblys Catechiſm, are not at ſuch Odds, but that they may meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Friendly Union, were it not for his Pride, Intereſt, or Prejudice. <note place="margin">The Proteſtant Union.</note>

His Diſcourſe of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, by which he thought he could have ſalv'd his Old Oaths, is all Banter; for a Regent muſt have had all the Power, and the late King but the bare Title, and Allegiance muſt have been ſworn to the Regent, to aſſiſt and defend him in the Regency; ſo that if the late King ſhould, during the Regency, have raiſed an Army (as now) and ſought by force to recover the Soveraign Power, were not the Subjects that ſwore Allegiance to the Regent, bound to aſſiſt him againſt the King? if they did not aſſiſt him, they were perjur'd; if they did, 'tis clear their former Oaths were laid aſide.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but by the way acquaint, though without any Deſign to Reflect upon; thoſe Reverend and Learned Gentlemen, who refuſe Taking of the New Oaths, that I fear, their Refuſal contributes too much to our Diſſettlement, and the Reſtrengthning the Papal Intereſt, which latter would certainly ſink, were it not thus collaterally ſupported; and that it is guilty of great Pride, and Uncharitableneſs, when they ſhall not only not quietly ſit down and enjoy their private Opinion to themſelves, but ſhall print it (under the Name of <hi>[The Hiſtory of Paſſive Obedience.]</hi> which has been requited with one of <hi>Self Defence)</hi> and oppoſe it to the publick Senſe of the Kingdom, and thereby condemn ſo many <hi>Wiſe, Learned, Judicious and conſcientious Men,</hi> both of the Clergy and Laity, that have taken the New Oaths, of <hi>Lying and Perjury,</hi> the moſt infamous Crimes that can be faſtned upon a Nation; and therefore I would entreat thoſe Gentlemen, either to a peaceable Acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

            <p n="1">1. That <hi>this Monarchy</hi> is not a bare Inheritance, but an Inheritance accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying  an Office of Truſt; <note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. Their Second Aſſertion, That the <hi>King is unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to any humane Power,</hi> is merely precarious; for <hi>if he be limited in the uſe and exerciſe of his Power, by humane poſitive Laws,</hi>
