            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE STATIONER
TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His, being one of the <hi>Authours</hi>
first <hi>Poems,</hi> was composed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares agone; and vnknown
to him, gotten out of his custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
by an acquaintance of his.
And comming lately to my
hands without a Name, it was thought to haue
so much resemblance of the <hi>Maker,</hi> that many,
vpon the first sight, vndertooke to guesse who
was <hi>Author</hi> of it: And, perswaded that it was
likely also, to become profitable both to them,
and mee.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, I got it authorised, according
to Order: intending to publish it, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inquiry. But, attaining by chance a more
perfect knowledge to whom it most properly
belonged: I thought it fitting to acquaint him
therewithall. And did so; desiring also, both
his good will to publish the same, and leaue to
passe it vnder his <hi>Name.</hi> Both which, I found
him very vnwilling to permit; least the seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:20942:3"/>
lightnesse of such a <hi>Subiect,</hi> might some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
disparage, the more serious <hi>Studies,</hi>
which he hath since vndertaken.</p>
            <p>Yet, doubting (this being got out of his
Custod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>) some imperfecter <hi>Coppies</hi> might
hereafter be scattered abroad in writing, or, be
vnknowne to him, imprinted: He was pleased
(vpon my importunities) to condescend that it
might be published, without his <hi>Name.</hi> And his
words were these.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When (said he) I first composed it, I well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
thereof; and it well enough became my
yeares: but now, I neither like, nor dislike it.
That (therefore) it should be di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ulged, I desire
not: and whether it be, or whether (if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
so) it bee approoued or no, <hi>I care not.</hi> For
this I am sure of: howsoeuer it be valued; it is
worth as much as I prize it at: likely it is also
to be as beneficial to the World, as the World
hath been to me; and will be more then those
who like it not, euer deserued at my hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These were his speeches: And (if you loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for a <hi>Prologue;</hi> thus much he wished me to
tell you, in stead thereof: because (as he sayd)
hee himselfe had somewhat else to doe. Yet,
(to acknowledge the truth) I was so earnest
<pb facs="tcp:20942:3"/>
with him, that, as busie as he would seeme to
be, I got him to write this <hi>Epistle</hi> for me: And
haue therunto set my <hi>Name.</hi> Which, he wished
me to confesse: Partly, to auoid the occasion
of belying my Inuention; and partly, because
hee thought some of you would suppose so
much.</p>
            <p>I entreated him, to explaine his meaning,
in certaine obscure passages. But, he told me,
how that were to take away the employment
of his <hi>Interpreters:</hi> Whereas, he would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely,
leaue somewhat remaining doubtfull,
to see what Sir POLITICKE WOVLD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEE,
and his Companions could picke out
of it.</p>
            <p>I desired him also, to set downe, to what
good purposes, this <hi>Poeme</hi> would serue. But
his Reply was: How, that would bee well
enough found out, in the perusing, by all such
as had honest vnderstandings: and they who
are not so prouided; hee hopes will not read it.
More, I could not get from him.</p>
            <p>Whether therefore, this MISTRESSE
OF PHIL'ARETE, bee really a <hi>Woman,</hi>
shaddowed vnder the name of VIRTVE:
or VIRTVE onely, whose louelinesse is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb facs="tcp:20942:4"/>
by the Beautie of an excellent <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
Or, whether it meane both together;
I cannot tell you. But, thus much I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
for your money: that, heere, you shall
find familiarly expressed, both such <hi>Beauties</hi> as
young men, are most intangled withall; and
and the excellency also of such, as are most
worthy their affection. That, seeing both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tially
set foorth, by him that was capable
of both, they might the better settle their loue
on the best.</p>
            <p>Heereby also, those <hi>Women,</hi> who desire to
bee truely beloued, may know what makes
them, so to be. And, seeke to acquire those
accomplishments of the <hi>Mind,</hi> which may
endeare them, when the sweetest Features of
a beautifull Face, shall bee conuerted into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities.
And, here is described, that Loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of theirs, which is the principall obiect
of wanton affection, to no worse end: but,
that those, who would neuer haue lookt on
this <hi>Poeme</hi> (if <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> had beene
therein, no otherwise represented, then as they
are obiects of the Soule) might, where they
expected the satisfaction of their sensualitie
onely; meet with that also, which would insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naute
<pb facs="tcp:20942:4"/>
into them, an apprehension of more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and most excellent perfections. Yea,
whereas, the common opinion of <hi>Youth</hi> hath
been; that, onely old men, and such as are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or past delighting in a bodily louelinesse,
are those who are best capable of the <hi>Mindes</hi>
perfections: And, that they doe therefore so
much preferre them before the other; because
their Age, or stupiditie hath depriued them of
being sensible what pleasures they yeelde.
Though, this be the vulger errour; yet, here it
shal appeare, that he, who was able to conceiue
the most excellent pleasingnesse, which could
be apprehended in a Corporall <hi>Beautie;</hi> found
it (euen when he was most enamour'd with it)
far short of that vnexpressible sweetnes, which
he discouered in a virtuous and well-tempered
Disposition. And if this bee not worth your
money, keepe it.</p>

What in others we preferre,</l>

            <l>But, each part suruei'd a sunder,</l>

For, though (they must confesse) they often heare,</l>

            <l>Or, that so young, and so obscure a <hi>Swaine,</hi>

            <l>They wondred at it. And some thus surmizd,</l>

            <l>Some news or message, these new guests had broght him,</l>
            <l>And, to make hast away (it seemes) besought him.</l>

            <l>Might not be taxed by a rude departure,</l>
            <l>Himselfe excusing, he those <hi>Nymphs</hi> did pray:</l>

Who, as it seemes (he said) were therefore come;</l>

            <l>Of whom he sung. Yet many deeme that this,</l>

                  <l>And, I both awake, and sleeping,</l>

                  <l>Somewhat then, I would haue sayd;</l>

                  <l>For, me thought, when speake I would,</l>

louing Friend, vpon his
departure.</head>
               <l>SWift <hi>Time,</hi> that will by no entreaty stay,</l>
               <l>Is now gone by, and summons me away.</l>
               <l>And, what my griefe, denies my tongue to doe,</l>
               <l>My true affection driues my pen vnto.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Deare Heart;</hi> that day, and that sad houre is come,</l>
               <l>In which, thy face I must be banisht from:</l>
               <l>And goe to liue, where (peraduenture) we</l>
               <l>Hereafter must, for aye, deuided be.</l>
               <l>For, twixt our bodies, which now close are met,</l>
               <l>A thousand Hills and Vallies shall be set:</l>
               <l>A thousand Groues, a thousand weeping Springs,</l>
               <l>And many thousand other enuious things,</l>
               <l>Which, when we are departed, keepe vs may,</l>
               <l>From comming nearer, till our dying day.</l>
               <l>So these our hands, which thus each other touch,</l>
               <l>Shall neuer after this time doe so much.</l>
               <l>Nor shall these eyes, which yet themselues delight,</l>
               <l>(with mutuall gazing on each other light)</l>
               <l>Be euer raysed vp againe, so neare,</l>

               <l>Nor ere againe, through those their Christall orbes,</l>
               <l>Reade what sad passion, our poore hearts disturbs.</l>
               <l>Which when we think vpon, we scarce containe,</l>

               <l>A storme of Passions we must venture through.</l>
               <l>Whose fury, I would stay to see ore-past</l>

               <l>With some worse perill, ouerwhelme vs both.</l>

               <l>And bring vs to such passe (at last) that we</l>

To master my affections: or to goe</l>
               <l>On those affaires, that Reason calls me to.</l>
               <l>Those Parents that discreet in louing be,</l>
               <l>When on their new-borne child a Wen they see,</l>
               <l>Which may (perchance) in aftertime, disgrace</l>
               <l>The sweete proportion of a louely face:</l>
               <l>(Although it wound their soules to heare the mone,</l>
               <l>And see the tortures of their <hi>pritty one</hi>)</l>
               <l>To weepe a little, rather are content,</l>
               <l>Whilst he endures the Surgeons Instrument;</l>
               <l>Then suffer that soule blemish there, to spread;</l>
               <l>Vntill his face be quite disfigured.</l>
               <l>So, we betwixt whose soules, there is begot</l>

               <l>That may the beauty of our loue ore-throw:</l>
               <l>Let's rather beare a little discontent;</l>
               <l>And learne of Reason, those things to preuent</l>
               <l>Which marre affection. That our friendship may</l>

               <l>There is, indeed, to gentle hearts, no smarting,</l>
               <l>That is more torment to them, then departing</l>

               <l>As you are loth I should depart away:</l>

               <l>Then, let vs pleased part; and though the dearenes</l>

               <l>And, since we must compelled be to liue,</l>
               <l>By time and place diuided; let vs striue</l>
               <l>In the despight of time and distance, so</l>
               <l>That loue of virtue may more perfect grow:</l>
               <l>And that this seperation, we lament,</l>
               <l>May make our meeting fuller of content.</l>
               <l>Betwixt our bodies (this Ile not deny)</l>
               <l>There is a deare respectiue sympathy;</l>
               <l>Which makes vs mutually both ioy, and grieue</l>
               <l>As there is cause. And farther, I belieue,</l>

               <l>Whilst their eternall substance, doth endure:</l>
               <l>No, not our absence; nor that mightie space,</l>
               <l>Betwixt my home, and your abiding place.</l>
               <l>For, ere your Eyes, my eyes had euer seene;</l>
               <l>When many thousand furlongs lay betweene,</l>
               <l>Our vnknowne bodies: And before that you</l>
               <l>Had seene my face, or thought the same to view,</l>
               <l>You most entirely loued me (you say)</l>
               <l>Which shewes our soules had then found out the way,</l>
               <l>To know each other: And vnseene of vs,</l>
               <l>To make our bodies meet vnthought of, thus.</l>
               <l>Then; much lesse now, shall hill, or dale, or groue,</l>
               <l>Or, that great tract of ground which must remoue</l>
               <l>My body from you: there, my soule confine,</l>
               <l>To keepe it backe from yours: or yours from mine.</l>
               <l>Nay, being more aquainted then they were,</l>
               <l>And actiue spirits, that can any where</l>
               <l>Within a moment meet. They to and fro,</l>
               <l>Will euery minute to each other go</l>
               <l>And, we shall loue, with that deare loue, wherein</l>
               <l>Will neither be offence, nor cause of sinne.</l>
               <l>Yea, whereas carnall loue, is euer colder,</l>
               <l>As youth decayes; and as the flesh growes older:</l>
               <l>And, when the body is dissolued, must</l>
               <l>Be buried with obliuion in the dust.</l>
               <l>We, then shall dearer grow: and this our loue,</l>

For, theres no mortall power can rob true Friends,</l>
               <l>Of that which noblest Amitie attends.</l>

               <l>In them, more noble makes it, by the triall.</l>
               <l>Tis true; that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we part, we know not whether</l>

               <l>As you haue said. Yet, wherefore should we grieue,</l>

               <l>If we did also know, that when we die,</l>

               <l>Whose loue is carnall, are tormented, when</l>
               <l>Death calls them hence: because they robbed be</l>
               <l>Of all their hope (for euermore) to see</l>
               <l>The obiect of their Loue: we shall auoid,</l>
               <l>That bitter anguish wherewith they are cloyd.</l>
               <l>And, whensoer'e it happens, thou, or I,</l>
               <l>Shall feele the time approaching vs to dye;</l>
               <l>It shall not grieue vs at our latest breath,</l>
               <l>To mind each other on the bed of death:</l>
               <l>(Because of any ouersight, or sinne,</l>
               <l>Whereof we guiltie in our soules haue bin)</l>
               <l>Nor will death feare vs, cause we shall perceiue</l>
               <l>That these contentments, which we had not leaue</l>
               <l>To take now we are liuing; shall be gaind,</l>
               <l>When our imprison'd soules shall be vnchaind.</l>
               <l>Nay rather wish to dye, we might possesse</l>
               <l>The sweet fruition of that happinesse,</l>
               <l>Which we shall then receiue, in the perfection</l>
               <l>Of Him, that is the fulnesse of Affection.</l>
               <l>If Time preuented not, I had in store</l>
               <l>To comfort thee, so many Reasons more,</l>
               <l>That thou wouldst leaue to grieue; although we should</l>
               <l>Each others persons neuer more behold.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20942:118"/>
But, there is hope. And then, that know you may,</l>
               <l>True <hi>Friends</hi> can in their absence find the way.</l>
               <l>To compasse their contentments, whom they loue:</l>
               <l>You shall ere long, the powre it hath, approue.</l>
               <l>Meane while, you still are deare: yea, liue or dye,</l>
               <l>My soule shall loue you euerlastingly.</l>
               <l>And howsoere, there seeme such cause of sorrow;</l>
               <l>Yet, those that part, and thinke to meet to morrow,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Death</hi> may diuide to night; And, as before,</l>
               <l>Their <hi>Feare</hi> was lesse, their <hi>Griefe</hi> will be the more.</l>
               <l>Since therefore, whether far I liue, or nigh,</l>
               <l>There is in meeting an vncertaintie.</l>
               <l>Let vs, for that which surest is, prouide.</l>
               <l>Part like those Friends, whom nothing can diuide:</l>
               <l>And, since we Louers first became, that we,</l>
               <l>Might to our power each others comfort be:</l>
               <l>Let's not the sweetnesse of our loue destroy;</l>
               <l>But, turne these weepings into teares of ioy.</l>
               <l>On which condition, I doe giue thee, this;</l>
               <l>To be both <hi>Mine,</hi> and <hi>Sorrowes</hi> parting-kisse.</l>
