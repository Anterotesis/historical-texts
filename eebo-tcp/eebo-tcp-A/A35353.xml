            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>ſeene his Starre in the Eaſt, and are come to worſhip him: Hee told us the Names of the Wiſe Men, and their profeſſion, Conjuring: And in the end told the people, that if they would find Chriſt, they muſt come to the ALTAR,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51991:7"/>
and there they ſhould find him really preſent, if any where.</hi> This is written in the Aldermans Bible; but in the Tranſcript he writ further to me, thus; <hi>But the Cathedrall Doctor did ſo conjure, that I went away with my haire an end, and came no more to the Cathedrall in eight yeares after, and I never could be in tune, till the comming of the Noble Scots: And the Parliament comming on, ſet mee right againe.</hi>

            <p>On <hi>Aſcenſion Thurſday</hi> (as they call it) 1642. Another <hi>Cathedrall Doctor</hi> Preacht there, that it was a <hi>duty of the Text, that all that have Knees ſhould bow them at the Name of Jeſus.</hi> This Prelate that pleaded ſo for bowing, (hearing that ſome of the Pariſhioners of <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> did not kneele at the <hi>Communion)</hi> came and adminiſtred it there himſelfe, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51991:8"/>
was ſo punctuall for their Kneeling, that hee lookt very low, to ſee if the Females kneeled. That <hi>Learned, Religious, Good Society</hi> (as they ſtile their <hi>Cathedrall</hi> in their <hi>Prelaticall Prayer)</hi> had a Sermon Preached on <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Sunday</hi> (as they call it) 1642.

               <hi>to another, Holy,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which the <hi>Grandee, or Prior</hi> of that <hi>Cathedrall Covent</hi> Preached, ſaying, <hi>hence is juſtified our Cathedrall</hi> ſinging of Pſalmes from one ſide of the Quire to the other: And then hee proceeded, upon that occaſion, to a large Diſcourſe in the behalfe of <hi>Church Muſicke and Organs:</hi> I never heard more pleading for <hi>Cathedrall Piping;</hi> he was ſo vehement in his Diſcourſe for Organes, that he was almoſt out of breath: It ſeemes he feared the fall of Cathedrall Quire-Service, and Organs, he was ſo earneſt to uphold them, but in vaine, as the event proves.</p>
            <p>And this puts me in minde of a very little witty Girle in that Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall: <note place="margin">The Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Collicke, or belliach.</note> who being with her mother lately, where a ſicke man lay groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very loud: <hi>Mother,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>why groanes this man ſo?</hi> It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>It is becauſe he hath a paine in his belly:</hi> This Girle being a little after with her mother, at their <hi>Cathedrall-Quire-Service:</hi> and hearing the Deane <hi>roaring out</hi> the Baſe, in the <hi>Quire-Conſort: Mother</hi> (ſaid ſhee) <hi>Hath</hi> Mr. <hi>Deane a paine in his belly he roares ſo?</hi> It was a few moneths ſince preached in that Cathedrall, <hi>That all were revolted from the King, and muſt come, as</hi> Benhadads <hi>ſervants did, with ropes about their neckes.</hi> A vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume would not containe the <hi>Malignant paſſages</hi> preached in that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">More ſtrange Malignant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> ſince the <hi>Parliament</hi> began. Theſe following paſſages have beene vented there after laſt <hi>Michael-tide 1643. O Lord give the King more hands to fight for him,</hi> Uriah <hi>was a generous Cavalier:</hi> Another preached there ſince; <hi>Men will excuſe their ſinnes; ſo pride is called handſomneſſe; ſo an impious and raſh vow, is called a holy Covenant; dethroning of Majeſty, is called ſetting up Chriſt in his Throne; Fomenting of an unnaturall civill Warre, is called advancing of the true Religion.</hi> Another ſince that, <hi>Bad zeale is a worke of the fleſh; ſuch zeale have they who would pull downe Biſhops, Becauſe (like the Hereticke of old) they cannot attaine to that place themſelves: Like that of the Anabaptiſticall Reformers in</hi> Germany, <hi>who under pretence of Reformation, robbed and plundered. This</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is but a Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prelates allow conſecrated Snuffers, but no Extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers, for bad Church Lights.</note> 
               <hi>tricke of thoſe, who pretend to be moſt contrary to Jeſuites.</hi> Another ſince that, preached there: ſaying, <hi>Prieſts are lights: If the Candle burne dimme, men uſe to ſnuffe it, not to put it out; thoſe that are intoxicated, uſe to put out the Candle while they go about to ſnuffe it: and the ſnuffs were conſecrated too. And ſince that, a Cathedrall Doctor preached there, of counterfeiting the Kings Great Seale,</hi> when the <hi>New great Seale legally</hi> came forth <hi>by authority of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi> for the good of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And when ſome notorious <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> and <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> both Prieſts and others, were ſecured in <hi>Canterbury.</hi> the ſame <hi>Cathedrall Prelate</hi> preached at that time of ſome that were great Profeſſors of Religion, yet were moſt forward to perſecute their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51991:9"/>
and hale them to priſon. And ſince that, when the <hi>Images</hi> in that <hi>Cathedrall</hi> began to be <hi>demoliſhed,</hi> the ſame <hi>Cathedraliſt</hi> preached the next Sabbath of Rifling, and Pillaging Churches, telling the people that ſuch were worſe then <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> or <hi>Infidels,</hi> which (as is conceived) <note place="margin">More Incen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diary Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral preaching, and malignant ſtuffe.</note> was a cauſe of the mutiny in <hi>Canterbury</hi> the next day. This man preached to his Pariſhioners after the Communion, ſaying, Thoſe that came up to the Railes, ſhould meet Chriſt in the Clouds; but thoſe that came not up, Chriſt would ſay to them, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And another paſſage of a Cathedrall Sermon there, was this: There is a people come on ſhore, which thinke their owne fancies to be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and doubtleſſe they will plead at the laſt day, We have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Churches and Chappels, O God, in thy name, we have robbed, and plundered in thy name, we have kept Conventicles in thy name, wee have undervalued Superiorities and dignities in thy name.</p>
            <p>The laſt <hi>vapour</hi> vented in that <hi>Cathedrall,</hi> was, that it is <hi>Intemperate zeale, and fiery fury to reforme before the enemy be ſubdued:</hi> The Prayer was, <hi>that God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A Cathedrall Cooler.</note> 
               <hi>would make us ſober Proteſtants.</hi> It ſeemes the view of the Reformed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Windowes of the Sermon-houſe did offend, or <hi>ſtrange-cooling</hi> came in by the breaches in them. But it's hoped the burning of that rich Altar-<hi>Glory,</hi> will produce a reſult, that will begin the reparations there, to keepe out ſuch <hi>chilling vapours.</hi> To which may be added the (now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered) rich ſilver Baſin and Ewer, and other ſumptuous common Plate of that <hi>Cathedrall Corporation,</hi> uſed at <hi>Cathedrall Feaſts:</hi> and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-Baſin, and Candleſticks (if they be not conveyed to <hi>Oxford)</hi> will helpe that worke. And as the <hi>Cathedrall Sermons</hi> were none of the beſt, ſo thoſe Cathedrall Prelates kept godly Preachers farre from them, <note place="margin">A good prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher neere a Cathedrall, a Miracle.</note> by combined caution.

            <p>But this is no <hi>Cathedrall newes;</hi> and if they be ſuch now, being under a cloud, what were they in their <hi>High Cathedrall ſplendor,</hi> when they ſwayed all by their <hi>PRELATIC ALL WILL?</hi> And if they be ſo <hi>malignant</hi> in publique againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with <hi>Papiſts, bloody Iriſh Rebels, Damnee Ruffians, and plundering Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,</hi> and other common enemies of our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, what have beene the private <hi>Counſels,</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of thoſe <hi>Cathedrall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> to ſupport <hi>Popery, Prelacy,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny?</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Cathedrall Prelats at Canterbury,</hi> hearing a rumour (though falſe) <note place="margin">Cathedrall joy at falſe newes for Prelacy.</note> that the <hi>Scots</hi> had yielded to entertaine <hi>Biſhops,</hi> at the Pacification in the North, in the yeare 1639. they were overjoyed at that newes, being before in a quaking feare, that having on <hi>each ſhoulder a ſteeple or two,</hi> and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall on their head, they ſhould be eaſed of their beloved burden, by a <hi>Reformation,</hi> which they feared might reach from <hi>Edenborough</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to <hi>Canterburie</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> well knowing, that <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls</hi>

            <p>And to expreſſe their great <hi>triumph,</hi> at that newes, they did then, in the Summer time, in the <hi>height</hi> of their <hi>Prelaticall glory,</hi> ſet up, upon the foure <note place="margin">Flags of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph on the Cathedral ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> Pinacles of their higheſt <hi>Cathedrall ſteeple,</hi> called <hi>Bell-harry ſteeple,</hi> 4 great iron fanes, or flags, on which the <hi>Coate-Arms</hi> of the <hi>King, Prince, Church,</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterburie</hi> were ſeverally guilded, and painted: But in the end of December following, in the midſt of their Cathedral <hi>Ioviali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtmas Gamballs,</hi> there was a Gamball plaid by the flag, which <note place="margin">A Prelaticall fall at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie.</hi>

               <hi>pulld down</hi> the top of the pinacle, which upheld them, and were carryed (partly againſt the wind) a good diſtance from the ſteeple, on which they ſtood, and fell upon the roofe of the Cloyſter, in which Cloyſter, the Armes of the Arch-Biſhoprick of Cant. were carved, &amp; painted on the lower ſide, or concave of the Arch, or ſeeling of the Cloyſter; which Armes in the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, were daſhed in peices by the Armes which fell from the pinacle of the ſteeple; <hi>The Arms of the preſent Arch-Biſhop of Canterburie, brake downe</hi>
