            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:94639:10"/>
               <hi>passible</hi> and obnoxious to <hi>death,</hi> should any man <hi>confess</hi> to him that he design'd to <hi>murther</hi> him, he would suffer <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to be <hi>kill'd,</hi> rather then reveal the <hi>Confession.</hi> To this <hi>Perron</hi>'s Reply is so impertinent and superficial, as one would even blush to see how he shuffles it over. The <hi>Confessor</hi> (says he) needs not <hi>reveal</hi> the manner of his <hi>Treason,</hi> 'tis enough he give the <hi>King</hi> warning to take heed of himself.

            <p>I cannot affirm that all our <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are of this <hi>Belief;</hi> but then I can hardly call them <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;</hi> indeed, (my <hi>Lord</hi>) they are not <hi>through-pac'd.</hi> We see how <hi>Barclay,

            <p>One would think the divine right of <hi>Kings</hi> as <hi>Superiors,</hi> Obedience to <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> Relative duty of <hi>Subjects,</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> Example, had been so positively describ'd and secur'd by that admirable <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that all who profess themselves of that Belief, <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of that <hi>Religion,</hi> and who pretend so much to extraordinary <hi>Illumination,</hi>

oblig'd likewise to elevate their voices, and to represent those <hi>pernicious Consequences</hi> as to what regards the safety of his Sacred <hi>Person,</hi> and the good of his <hi>Estate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostle S. <hi>Peter</hi> establishes for the two principal parts of Piety, the Fear of God, and the Honour which is due to Kings: <hi>Deum timete, Regem honorificate.</hi> If these <hi>Divines</hi> have satisfied the <hi>first</hi> of these obligations, by the just aversion they have stirr'd up in all pious persons to the pernicious adulation of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> which they have discover'd to be no less then a kind of <hi>Idolatry</hi>: it were but reasonable that others should satisfie the <hi>second,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring all those who bear any love or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their <hi>King,</hi> with the horrour which they ought to have of a <hi>Doctrine</hi> which may prove to funest to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and is in danger of ravishing from him the most august and supreme Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he has receiv'd from <hi>God,</hi> which is to depend on <hi>him</hi> alone in <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> and to be independent of all other Powers upon the face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94639:19"/>True it is, that his <hi>Majesty</hi> has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been advertis'd of it, and has clearly perceiv'd by that light and vivacity of spirit which all <hi>Europe</hi> admires in a Prince so young, of what pernicious Consequence this novel Doctrine was which they would introduce into his <hi>State,</hi> and the advantage which they might take to establish their pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who design nothing more then to reach the Heads of <hi>Kings,</hi> and even subject them in Temporals.</p>
            <p>It were fit therefore that all the world knew as much, that those who are not sensibly touch'd with the prospect of an Error so prejudicial to <hi>Religion,</hi> (as falsly imagining it to concern the <hi>Divines</hi> onely) may at least be affected with the consideration of the prejudice which it may bring to the <hi>State,</hi> and to the sacred and inviolable rights of the Crowns of our <hi>Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But since the address which has been made use of by the Partisans of those corrupt Opinions has been to infuse it into the minds of the people masked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vizor of <hi>Religion</hi> and respect
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94639:19"/>
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to decry the opposers of it as enemies to the holy <hi>See</hi>; it is necessary we should defeat their artifice by discovering it to the world, and by teaching them to distinguish (as our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done before us) the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical See</hi> from the <hi>Court Politick of Rome,</hi> which are things totally different: For that which we are to understand by the <hi>Apostolical Seat</hi> is, that Spiritual Authority of the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> gave to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> residing in the <hi>Pope,</hi> and which all <hi>Christians</hi> are oblig'd to acknowledge and reverence, by an inseparable union with it, as the very center of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Church.</hi> But the <hi>Court Politick of Rome</hi> is nothing else but that Swarm of Courtiers who are about the <hi>Pope's</hi> person to advance their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and thrust themselves into Church-Dignities; and the person of <hi>Popes</hi> consider'd not as <hi>Popes,</hi> but as <hi>Men,</hi> who being as obnoxious as others to their Ambition and other humane passions, suffer themselves to be often transported by the adulation of their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94639:20"/>
               <hi>Courtiers,</hi> to attribute to themselves, without reason, Rights and Prerogatives which <hi>God</hi> never gave them, and that are equally prejudicial to the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Kings,</hi> the repose of the People, the tranquillity of the <hi>Church,</hi> the good of the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and, in fine, to the true and solid grandeur of the holy <hi>See</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>In this sense it is we shall speak of the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> in the present Treatise, as so many great persons and Saints have already done, by opposing themselves to their unjust pretensions, without at all thinking they did thereby in the least violate the respect which they ow'd the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; to which they, on the contrary, believ'd these Opinions must needs be most disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous. And we have so much the more liberty to doe it now, since the moderation of the present <hi>Incumbent</hi> speaks him very far from these ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts.</p>
            <p>Now amongst all these illegitimate Usurpations of the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> thus considered, there has none of them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94639:20"/>
proved more funest to <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and even to <hi>Popes</hi> themselves, then that by which some of them have been transported to domineer over <hi>Kings,</hi> to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves their Superiours and Judges in the administration of their <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and by pretending of a right, when they fansied it for the cause of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> to depose them of their <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,</hi> and give their <hi>Estates</hi> to others, or to abandon them to the first <hi>Usurper</hi> who had power to make himself Master.</p>
            <p>It's impossible to describe those hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Confusions which this pretence of theirs hath brought forth in <hi>Italy</hi> and in <hi>Germany</hi> for so many Ages together, the Warrs it has kindled, the Bloud it has made to be spilt, the <hi>Provinces</hi> it has rendred desolate, the <hi>Cities</hi> it has ruin'd, the Scandals and Disorders which it has filled the <hi>Church</hi> with: But one of its worst effects is, that it has render'd the holy <hi>See</hi> (which should as well be the centre of the love of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as of the Unity of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94639:21"/>
               <hi>Church</hi>) odious both to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> by making them to look upon the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> not as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Father,</hi> full of tenderness for all his <hi>Children</hi>; but as a Temporal <hi>Prince,</hi> that would trample all other <hi>Princes</hi> under his feet, and render himself abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Master of all the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> of the Earth. This is one of the main causes which has made so many people revolt against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the most usual pretence which they have taken to hinder many <hi>Christians</hi> from paying that observance to <hi>Popes</hi> which they are oblig'd to render them, by confounding it with these odious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses. For having once anticipated the <hi>People</hi> with this erroneous opinion, That one could not acknowledge in the <hi>Pope</hi> that real Authority which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> has given him, without owning <hi>that</hi> also which these <hi>Sycophants</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him over <hi>Temporals</hi> and <hi>States</hi>; they have by an hateful <hi>Schism</hi> kept them from acknowledging the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> for fear lest they should be bound likewise to own
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94639:21"/>
him for their <hi>King</hi> and Master.</p>
            <p>It concerns the <hi>Church</hi> therefore to take away this color from <hi>Schism,</hi> which is the greatest of all mischiefs, by sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Spiritual power of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Bishop,</hi> as it has been instituted by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and acknowledg'd by all <hi>Catholicks,</hi> from this false and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant power, which Ambition and Flattery would adde to it, repugnant to the spirit of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and the Doctrine of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the Zeal of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>France</hi> for the maintenance of the Sovereignty of <hi>Kings</hi> against the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises of those who, subverting the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>God,</hi> would have it to depend upon this Spiritual Jurisdiction, is no less advantageous to the <hi>Church</hi> then to the <hi>State</hi>; and that, on the other part, there is nothing more prejudicial to them both, then that low and fleshly prudence of these <hi>Theologues,</hi> who think to exalt the divine Grandeur of the prime Minister of the new Law, which wholly consists in the love to eternal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94639:22"/>
good things, and in the despising of the things of this World, by secular and temporal advantages which <hi>God</hi> did never annex to him; or that seek to enlarge their fortunes by this pretended Zeal for the enlargement of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis known to the whole World, that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have within these <hi>hundred years</hi> been the chief defenders of these ambitious pretences, and that their <hi>Society</hi> has employ'd the most renown'd of its <hi>Writers</hi> to disseminate this Doctrine every-where: It is this which has been taught by <note n="(a)" place="margin">In his Book of the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It's above an hundred years since, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> gave a famous <hi>Arrest</hi> upon this Subject, the 4 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1561. against a certain <hi>Bachelour</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> who had put it into his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94639:23"/>
               <hi>Thesis,</hi> That it was in the Power of the <hi>Pope</hi> to excommunicate <hi>Kings,</hi> to give away their <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and to absolve their <hi>Subjects</hi> of their <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Fidelity.</hi> This <hi>Proposition</hi> was declar'd seditious; the <hi>Bachelour</hi> being not to be found, it was order'd that the <hi>Bedel</hi> of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> vested in a red Hood should disavow it before a <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> and the chief of the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi>; and that during four years space there should no publick Disputation be permitted in the <hi>College</hi> where it was defended. This whole affair is twice told us in the <hi>Bibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othec du Droit,</hi> under the words <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> p. 4478. and <hi>Effigies,</hi> p. 1110. And <hi>Bouchel,</hi> who is the Author of this <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> in reciting of this History adds this Remark; <hi>The plain truth is, that within these fifty years past there is come a certain new Sect to be planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, called by the name of</hi> Jesuites, <hi>who maintain Propositions quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ours, to the very ruine of the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>Parliament</hi> testifies its zeal for the Interests of the <hi>King</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94639:23"/>
               <hi>Crown</hi> upon several other occasions; as when it condemn'd to the fire the 8 of <hi>Iune</hi> 1610. the Book of the <hi>Iesuite Mariana,</hi> intituled, <hi>De Rege &amp; Regis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutione</hi>; and that after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Iu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 26. 1614. it treated that of <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> intitul'd, <hi>Defensio Fidei Catholicae.</hi>

            <p>But there was never any thing more celebrious upon this subject then that which pass'd 1626. in the censure of <hi>Santarel.</hi> This <hi>Iesuite</hi> had written a Book of <hi>Heresie, Schism, Apostasie,</hi> &amp;c. printed at <hi>Rome</hi> 1625. <hi>permissu superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> in which (following the common sentiments of his Society) he taught, <hi>That the Pope might punish Kings and Princes with temporal pains, depose and deprive them of their Kingdoms and States for the crime of Heresie, and for other causes; as when they were cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any fault, if he find it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; when they become negligent of their duties; when they are incapable to govern, and their persons burthensome to their Kingdoms:</hi> He adds, <hi>That the</hi> Apostles <hi>were not subject to the secular Princes but</hi> de facto <hi>onely, not</hi> de jure;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94639:24"/>
               <hi>and in summe, that since the</hi> Pontifical Majesty <hi>had been establish'd, all other Potentates were become but his Vassals.</hi>

            <p>So soon as ever this <hi>Book</hi> appear'd in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> knowing that the Doctrine was invented and publish'd for the universal destruction of <hi>Civil Polity,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which was at that time gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the most <hi>Christian,</hi> most clement and just King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, that in treading the steps of their Ancestors, she might testifie her zeal and affection as well towards this Religious Prince, as towards the whole most Christian <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and at the same time satisfie that which all honest men requir'd of her; resolv'd to examine the <hi>two</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Santarel,</hi> 30, and 31, where this matter was treated of: And on the 1 of <hi>April</hi> 1626. having first heard the <hi>Deputies</hi> report, and consider'd the several <hi>Opinions</hi> of all the <hi>Doctors,</hi> she condemn'd the <hi>Positions</hi> (being the common Opinion of the <hi>Iesuites</hi>) for a novel, false and erroneous <hi>Doctrine,</hi> repugnant to the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and that

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94639:25"/>
should be torn and burnt, and that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> should be oblig'd to disavow and detest it, and to approve the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of the <hi>Sorbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This vigorous resistence of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> and <hi>Sorbon</hi> has of late render'd the <hi>Iesuites</hi> a little more reserv'd in producing to the world this pernicious <hi>Doctrine.</hi> But as they never abandon what they have once undertaken, they have invented a way of establishing it after a more dextrous, but more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, manner: for daring no more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it grossly and <hi>in terminis,</hi> they work more subtily to introduce the <hi>Principles</hi> on which it depends by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence; wisely judging, that if once by their artifice they can but deceive the vigilancy of our <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi> and the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> they shall easily make the <hi>People</hi> swallow it when-ever they please, and that as a Truth indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which they will shew by a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence from what they have already made pass for a most Catholick Verity.</p>
            <p>This is that which the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94639:25"/>
done in maintaining that famous <hi>Thesis</hi> of the 12 <hi>December</hi> 1661<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a <hi>Catholick Truth</hi> repugnant to the <hi>Greek Heresie</hi> concerning the <hi>Primacy</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> namely, <hi>That</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>hath given to all Popes</hi> (<hi>whenever they shall speak</hi> è Cathedra) <hi>the same Infallibility him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had, as well in matters of</hi> Right, <hi>as in those of</hi> Fact.</p>
            <p>And that we might not imagine there were any great mystery in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>When they should speak out of their Chair, Cùm loquerentur ex Cathedra,</hi> they expresly declare, that this <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> does not concern the <hi>Pope</hi>'s speaking in the head of a <hi>General Council</hi>: And in proposing for example, for <hi>one</hi> Constitution made <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> the <hi>two</hi> Constitutions on the <hi>Five Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi> they give us clearly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that they do not pretend, that to the end the <hi>Pope</hi> should speak from his <hi>Chair,</hi> it were necessary for him to assemble so much as a <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of his <hi>Province,</hi> as the other <hi>Popes</hi> did; or that he should consult the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> as they have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94639:26"/>
since done, (enterprising nothing (how inconsiderable soever) but by the advice of their Brethren, <hi>De consilio Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi>;) but that 'tis sufficient for him to speak in his <hi>Bulls,</hi> or from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> which use to be pasted up on the Gates of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>in Campo de Fiori</hi>; this being the onely solemnity which at <hi>Rome</hi> they pretend does render them sufficiently authentick, and that without so much as thinking it necessary they should be receiv'd and publish'd in the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See now to what a height the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> pretensions are come. All that the <hi>Popes</hi> say in their <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as well on matters and questions of <hi>Fact</hi> as those of <hi>Right,</hi> is to be look'd on as indubitably true as if <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> had himself avow'd it; the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Infallibility</hi> being still the same, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their reckoning) on these occasions and incounters, as that of the <hi>Son of God</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>Now how little so ever one knows of the Fundamentals of <hi>Santarellism,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:94639:26"/>
that is to say, of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which affirms the <hi>Pope</hi> has power to depose <hi>Kings,</hi> it must needs be acknowledged that it is establish'd by this <hi>Thesis</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and that it is after a sort made more pernicious and criminal then ever it has hitherto been. For the defenders of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> so prejudicial to <hi>Kings,</hi> were contented to establish this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power in <hi>Popes,</hi> by shewing that they themselves did attribute it to themselves by several <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>; and that so we were bound to believe them, as being <hi>infallible</hi> in matters concerning <hi>Faith.</hi> But there was none of them that yet durst deny but that <hi>Popes</hi> might fail and be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>exercise</hi> of this power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none of them did ever think them <hi>infallible</hi> in Questions which concern'd the <hi>Fact</hi>; whereas the <hi>Iesuites</hi> now presume on both: They render <hi>Popes</hi> absolutely Masters of <hi>Kings,</hi> in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to them (who by so many <hi>Bulls</hi> have defin'd their Superiority over the Temporalty of <hi>Kings</hi>) the very same <hi>Infallibility</hi> with <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> even in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94639:27"/>
matters of <hi>Right</hi>; so as they leave a <hi>King</hi> whom a <hi>Pope</hi> had <hi>deposed</hi> no place of <hi>appeal,</hi> or so much as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that the <hi>Pope</hi> might be mistaken in the matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> upon which they had judged him worthy of so severe a punishment: since by this new <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Clermont</hi> he is equally <hi>infallible,</hi> whether he judge in general, that he has this power to depose <hi>Kings,</hi> which is the Question <hi>de jure</hi>; or in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that <hi>such</hi> a <hi>King</hi> merits to be so us'd, which is the Question <hi>de facto.</hi> We must therefore clear these <hi>two</hi> points; <hi>One,</hi> that the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> in matters of <hi>Right</hi> is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> the establishment of his Power over <hi>Kings</hi>; the <hi>other,</hi> that his <hi>Infallibility</hi> in matters of <hi>Fact</hi> takes away all means from the <hi>Kings</hi> they please to depose, to complain of so rigorous a Sentence.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> 'tis an easie matter to convince all the world of it: nor ought we to imagine it a Consequence held onely by those who profess themselves enemies to the <hi>Iesuites Doctrine,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94639:27"/>
which the <hi>Iesuites</hi> disavow; 'tis a Consequence which they themselves derive from it, which they every-where acknowledge must needs follow, and which does so indeed naturally and of necessity. For <hi>Popes</hi> (as <hi>Iesuites</hi> themselves have learn'd us,) have so many waies decided that they have power to degrade <hi>Kings,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of their <hi>Kingdoms</hi> when-ever they judge it for the interest of <hi>Religion</hi>; that if to be <hi>Catholick</hi> one is oblig'd to consider all that <hi>Popes</hi> say in their <hi>Chair,</hi> that is, by their <hi>Bulls,</hi> as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions of infallible authority, and <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> pronounc'd even by <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Kings,</hi> their <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> must either renounce the quality of <hi>Catholick,</hi> or else tamely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that <hi>Kings</hi> are Sovereigns independent in respect of their own <hi>Subjects</hi> and other <hi>Princes,</hi> but nothing so in regard of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but that <hi>he</hi> has power to make them descend from their <hi>Throne,</hi> and to resolve them into their simple Originals; so as exercising a Royalty superiour to theirs, it may be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94639:28"/>
said of his <hi>Empire</hi> as an heathen <hi>Poet</hi> said of <hi>that</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Omne sub regno graviore regnum est.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All this is an infallible consequent of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> well prove. For who can chuse but believe that <hi>Popes</hi> have the power to depose <hi>Kings,</hi> if once he be persuaded that their Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are so many <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; when it shall be shew'd him that <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> has decided it in express terms in a <hi>Council</hi> held at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 1067, according to <hi>Onuphrius, Baronius,</hi> and all the <hi>Iesuites, Quòd Papae liceat Imperatores deponere; quòd à Fidelitate iniquorum subditos potest absolvere?</hi> Whence <note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <hi>Lessius</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> concludes (supposing the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi>) That this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is no <hi>problematick Doctrine,</hi> but a constant <hi>Truth,</hi> not to be deny'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violation of our very <hi>Faith. We must absolutely believe</hi> (says he) <hi>that this Doctrine</hi> (viz. that the <hi>Pope</hi> may depose <hi>Kings,</hi>) <hi>is an undoubted truth, and not such as we may believe what we please of; but such an one as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94639:28"/>
certain, not to be contradicted without wounding our Faith. And this I prove, first, Because these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are defin'd in proper terms in the</hi> Roman <hi>Synod under</hi> Gregory <hi>the VIIth</hi>, <hi>where it is affirm'd, that the Pope may depose Emperours, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Subjects of wicked Princes from their Oath of Allegiance and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. Now a Definition made by a Pope in Council is matter of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is clear now without mincing, nor can it be more expresly declar'd that the power to depose <hi>Kings</hi> is a necessary consequent of <hi>Infallibility</hi>; so as those <hi>Iesuites</hi> must needs be very impudent who shall after this dare to affirm, that they are their <hi>Enemies</hi> who derive this sequel from their <hi>Doctrine.</hi>

               <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> under the feign'd name of <hi>Sculkenius,</hi> writing against <hi>Widrington,</hi> proves in the same manner by this <hi>Gregorian</hi> Decree, that the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Superiority over <hi>Kings</hi> is an Article of Faith, <hi>'Tis an Heresie</hi> (saies he) <hi>to affirm that the Pope, as Pope, and</hi> ex jure divino, <hi>has not the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94639:29"/>
power to depose Secular Princes of their States, as oft as the publick good or some urgent necessity of the Church does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. I prove this Conclusion. An Opinion becomes heretical when its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory is</hi> de Fide: <hi>But it is</hi> de Fide <hi>that the Pope has power to depose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; since it has been defin'd and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by</hi> Gregory <hi>the VIIth</hi> 
               <hi>in a</hi> Roman <hi>Council, where it saies expresly, That the Pope may depose an Emperour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now who can deny this <hi>Conclusion</hi> that holds but the <hi>Principle,</hi> which is, That what has been defin'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by a <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>de Fide</hi>? Is not this <hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> invincible, supposing the <hi>Maxime</hi> to be true? By consequent then, who can doubt but that, according to the <hi>Iesuites</hi> opinion and the truth it self, the power of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Kings</hi> is in the <hi>Pope</hi> a certain Consequence of his <hi>Infallibility</hi>?</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> has so often decided the same Point, that no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94639:29"/>
man questions his pretence of making it an Article of <hi>Faith</hi>; as may yet be seen in the <hi>Bull</hi> of the Deposition of the <hi>Emperor Henry</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, made likewise in <hi>Council,</hi> where, addressing his speech to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he thus expostulates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now therefore exert and vindicate your power, O great and most holy Princes of the Apostles, that all the world may take notice and acknowledg, that if you can bind and loose in Heaven, you can also on Earth dispose of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, of Kingdoms, Principalities and Marquisates, in summe, of all mens goods and fortunes whatsoever, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them away from those who deserve them not, and by bestowing them on others.—For if you judge things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, shall we believe you have not the power to judge of Temporal and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular? Let all the Kings and Princes of the Age learn what your grandeur is and your power, and not dare to despise the Commandments of your Church: and be sure to leave such prompt and lasting marks in the judgment which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94639:30"/>
you exercise against</hi> Henry, <hi>that his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine be not attributed to the fate of arms or fortuitous accidents of War, but to your sole and almighty power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In consequence of this he denounc'd to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> as from <hi>God,</hi> that he should never win battel. But if <hi>Popes</hi> are <hi>infallible</hi> according to the <hi>Iesuites</hi> in actions past, 'tis certain, at least, that they are not in those which are to come. For never did <hi>Prince</hi> gain so many, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Victor in more then 50 pitch'd Battels, and having at the very first slain the person whom his Holiness had design'd to make <hi>Emperor</hi> in his place.</p>
            <p>I could recount a number more of Passages relating to the same <hi>Pope,</hi> where he argues for the same <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as visibly founded in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and annex'd to the <hi>Papal</hi> dignity. For 'tis not imaginable that he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend onely this right over <hi>Emperors,</hi> because the <hi>Popes</hi> had so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the re-establishment of the <hi>Western Empire.</hi> On the contrary, 'tis perspicuous that his pretence was over all <hi>Kings,</hi> and that it was built on that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94639:30"/>
Supposition of his, <hi>viz.</hi> that the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> contain'd in it the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Superiority, which made him set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Crown</hi> he sent to <hi>Rodulphus,</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper of the <hi>Empire,</hi> this Latin Verse, <hi>Petra dedit Petro, Petrus Diadema Rodulpho.</hi> To shew that he believ'd he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to dispose of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> by a right pretended to be given S. <hi>Peter</hi> by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> himself. 'Tis likewise on the same <hi>basis</hi> he threatned <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> to stir up his Subjects against him, if he gave him not speedy satisfaction concerning a certain affair: As, according to Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he brav'd <hi>Philip</hi> the I<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 
               <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> to shew that he exempted none.</p>
            <p>But nothing does so evidently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that one cannot acknowledge the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>infallible,</hi> but that at the same moment we must acknowledge him likewise above <hi>Kings</hi> in <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> as that famous Decision of <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> has done in the Bull <hi>Unam Sanctam,</hi> approv'd by <hi>Leo</hi> the X<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi>; and the use which the favourers of the <hi>Roman
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94639:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Court</hi> make of this <hi>Bull</hi> to establish its pretensions.</p>
            <p>There this <hi>Pope</hi> defines, <hi>That both the one and the other Sword appertains to the Church, and to the Pope: That the Temporal Sword is subordinate to the Spiritual, and the Temporal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Authority Spiritual: That if this Spiritual power deviate from the right, it must be judg'd by the Spiritual authority: That this power was bestow'd on S.</hi> Peter <hi>and his Successors: and That whoever resists this Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Power, resists Order, in establishing two Principles like the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees. <hi>Whence he concludes, that it is necessary to Salvation, that every humane power should submit it self to the Bishop of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> in his Book against <hi>Barclay</hi> concerning the Power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> proves by this <hi>Bull,</hi> that <hi>Kings</hi> are subject to the <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Temporals</hi>; and this Doctrine is certain and most indubitable. <hi>Now that it is</hi> (saies he) <hi>a thing constant and evident, that the Sovereign Bishop may
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94639:31"/>
for just causes be Iudge of Temporals, and sometimes depose Temporal Princes, we prove by the Extravagant</hi> Unam Sanctam de majoritate &amp; obedientia, <hi>which shews us that Sword is subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Sword; that is, that the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authority is below the Spiritual: and that if the Temporal neglect his duty, it shall be judged by the Spiritual.</hi> And for fear it should be objected, that <hi>Clement</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> seems to have revok'd this <hi>Bull</hi> by the Extravagant <hi>Meruit de privilegiis</hi>; he prevents the <hi>Objection</hi> by saying, <hi>that</hi> Clement <hi>the V•h</hi> 
               <hi>did not revoke the</hi> Bull <hi>of Pope</hi> Boniface, <hi>but advertis'd onely that this Bull of</hi> Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face <hi>had defin'd nothing new, and had onely reviv'd the ancient obligation which men have to obey and submit themselves to the Apostolicall See,</hi> in the manner he had before declar'd, and which this <hi>Bull</hi> does observe; that is to say, as well in <hi>Temporal</hi> things as <hi>Spiritual.</hi>

Bishop against the impious Politicians,</hi> (which is the name he gives to the <hi>French,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>) proves by the same <hi>Bull,</hi> that the Superiority over <hi>Kings</hi> in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals is an Article of <hi>Faith. This Power of the Pope</hi> (saies he) <hi>over the Temporals of Kings is confirm'd by the testimony</hi> of Jeremiah;<note place="margin">Jer. 1.10.</note> See I have this day set thee over the Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to pull down and to destroy, <hi>&amp;c. as 'tis also decided by the Extravagant</hi> Unam Sanctam; <hi>where 'tis said, that if the Temporal power deviate from the right, it shall be judged by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, declaring that every humane creature is subject to the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and that this is necessary to Salvation. Therefore</hi> Boniface <hi>writ to</hi> Philip <hi>King of</hi> France <hi>in these terms: Know that you are subordinate to us both in the Temporal and Spiritual; and we do hold and declare them Hereticks who maintain the contrary. For there are three marks whereby to distinguish matters of Faith. The first is, When the Decrees of a Synod are couched in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94639:32"/>
these terms, If any one affirm such or such a thing, let him be</hi> accursed. <hi>The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, when it saies that those who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the contrary shall be Excommunicate</hi> ipso facto. <hi>And the third, when those of the contrary opinion are reputed and held for Hereticks.</hi>

            <p>In fine, Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> having in a certain place mentioned the very <hi>Bull,</hi> concludes, that none do deny this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of <hi>Boniface,</hi> unless such as are excluded from the Church: <hi>Haec Bonifacius,</hi> saies he, <hi>cui assentiuntur omnes nisi qui ab Ecclesia excidit.</hi> And very well argu'd it were, if to be a member of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> it were necessary to believe the <hi>Pope</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; since there is nothing more trifling and absurd then those <hi>Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges</hi> which some Authors retire to, to put themselves under covert from this <hi>Bull,</hi> because they would fain sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Infallibility, but dare not maintain his Temporal Sovereignty in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief of these is <hi>Doctour Duval,</hi> who, in his Treatise of the Power of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94639:33"/>
the <hi>Pope,</hi> avows that <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth did establish his Superiority over the <hi>Temporalty</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> through the whole body of his <hi>Bull</hi>; but saies, that in all the <hi>Bulls</hi> there is nothing save the <hi>Conclusion</hi> which is of <hi>Faith,</hi> and that the Conclusion of <hi>this</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar imports onely, that every creature is subject to the <hi>Pope: which is true</hi> (saies he) <hi>as it relates to Spirituals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, if the Authority of <hi>Kings</hi> had need of so pitiful a Reply, one would conclude it built on a very weak foundation,
<q>
                  <l>Nullas habet spes Troja, si tales habet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For what appearance of Reason is there in this learned <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Solution?</p>
            <p n="1">1. How does he pretend we should believe that a <hi>Pope,</hi> who makes a <hi>Bull</hi> onely to establish his Superiority over <hi>Temporals,</hi> (which is the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested, and not over the <hi>Spirituals,</hi> which no body does dispute) and that he who speaks throughout his whole <hi>Bull</hi> of this Superiority in <hi>Temporals,</hi> should in the last line form a <hi>Conclusion</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the <hi>Principles</hi> which he has
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94639:33"/>
establish'd, and that we are onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard this <hi>last</hi> line?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The word <hi>subesse</hi> indifferently signifying a <hi>subjection</hi> in <hi>Temporals</hi> as well as in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> is it not clearly express'd and determin'd to <hi>Temporals</hi> by all that precedes it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. How shall we ever comprehend what a <hi>Bull</hi> means but by the way it was then understood when it was made, as well by those who oppos'd it, as those who defended it? and do not we know the troubles which then disturb'd all <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> caus'd by this pretence of the <hi>Pope,</hi> maintain'd by his <hi>Partisans,</hi> and contested by all the <hi>French</hi>?</p>
            <p n="4">4. In fine, has not <hi>Boniface</hi> himself explain'd his own words by another <hi>Bull</hi> shorter then this, which he sent to <hi>King Philip</hi> in these terms, <hi>Scire te volumus, quòd in Spiritualibus &amp; in Temporalibus nobis subes; aliud cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, Haereticos deputamus?</hi> Whence <hi>Carrerius,</hi> as we have already seen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes well, (supposing the <hi>Pope</hi> infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) that those who disagree concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94639:34"/>
the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Superiority over the Temporals of <hi>Kings</hi> are <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>French</hi> of those times, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amusing themselves with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Duval</hi>'s Sophistry, answered after another manner, and sufficiently testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the opinion of <hi>Infallibility</hi> was not so much as known in <hi>France.</hi> See an <hi>Act</hi> of the whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> against these <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, as 'tis inserted in the first <hi>Tome</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Gallican Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of You, Sir, our most Noble Lord, by the Grace of God King of</hi> France, <hi>the people of Your Kingdom supplicate and desire, (because it behoves them so to doe) that You preserve the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Freedom of your Kingdom, which is, that You own and acknowledge no Sovereign on the Earth over Your Temporals, but God alone; and that You give all the World to understand, that Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>does manifestly erre, and commit a most notorious mortal sin, in sending You word by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Bulls, that himself was Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of Your Temporals, &amp;c. and those
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94639:34"/>
who should believe the contrary, he esteem'd as Hereticks. Also that You cause to be declared, that we are bound to hold the Pope himself an Heretick, and not You, good King, and all the liege people of Your Kingdom, who have ever believed and do believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Protestation is to be seen in several <hi>Acts</hi> inserted in that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection which Mons. <hi>du Puy</hi> has made of the difference between King <hi>Philip the Fair</hi> and Pope <hi>Boniface</hi>; where you'l see how Pope <hi>Boniface</hi>'s Bulls were then explain'd, and what was the opinion of <hi>France</hi> touching Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</p>
            <p>'Tis in vain to strive to make any other replies to these kind of <hi>Popes</hi> Decrees, then such as the <hi>French</hi> of that Age did before us. For as there's nothing to which the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> aspires with greater passion then to this Temporal Empire; so neither is there any thing which the <hi>Popes</hi> have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd with so much industry.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> summs up no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94639:35"/>
less then 18 since <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to our times, who manifestly attributed to themselves this right (as they call'd it) of deposing <hi>Kings,</hi> and chastising them temporally, even to the privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their States; viz. <hi>Victor</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Urban</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Paschal</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Calixtus</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Innocentius</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Gregory</hi> the IX<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Clement</hi> the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Paul</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Iulius</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Paeul</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>Pius</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and <hi>Sixtus</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
            <p>He counts to 16 or 17 <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours</hi> against whom <hi>Popes</hi> have pretended this right of Sovereignty as a debt due to them; amongst which there are 5 <hi>French Kings, Philip</hi> the I<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, <hi>Philip the Fair, Lewis</hi> the XII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Henry</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and <hi>Henry</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baronius</hi> mentions also the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of a world of <hi>Germans,</hi> who are not yet well agreed concerning the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power: by which it appears that they alwaies pretended to make it an Heresie when at any time they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94639:35"/>
were the strongest party.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any thing more frequent in these <hi>Bulls</hi> then their menacing <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> to deprive them of their States, in case of Disobedience. Which universally betraies that Passion which the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> has to infuse this belief into the minds of the People.</p>
            <p>But if one could forget those other enterprises of <hi>Rome</hi> against our <hi>Kings,</hi> which are founded upon this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Superiority,</hi> as this <hi>Superiority</hi> is upon <hi>Infallibility,</hi> since <hi>France</hi> has so universally hindred their effects; yet we cannot but remember that which made us lose <hi>Navarre,</hi> because the wound is yet bleeding. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had no other pretext to swallow it up from <hi>Iohn d' Albret,</hi> Great-Grandfather to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> besides a <hi>Bull</hi> which he obtain'd of <hi>Iulius</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Privation of their <hi>Kingdom</hi> for having assisted <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, whom it call'd Schismatick, and as having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied passage to the Army which <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:94639:36"/>
King of <hi>Arragon</hi> would have sent into <hi>France</hi> to assist the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the conquest of <hi>Guienne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well that Cardinal <hi>du Perron,</hi> to render this Doctrine of the Power of <hi>Popes</hi> over the Temporals of <hi>Kings</hi> less odious to the <hi>French,</hi> tells us, that the real cause of the loss of the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> was the breach of the Alliance which the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> pretended to have been establish'd on condition, that if the Kings of <hi>Navarre</hi> should violate it, the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> should again revert to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it by deed in Writing to the race of <hi>Albret</hi>; and that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication was neither the true Cause, nor real Pretence, but a certain tail of a Pretence, which though <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> had made no use of, he had not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding pretended that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Navarre</hi> appertain'd to him, and consequently possess'd it.</p>
            <p>But I know as well too, that there is nothing worse founded then this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94639:36"/>
answer, as Mons. <hi>du Puy</hi> has made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by most invincible proofs in his Treatise of the <hi>Right of the King to the Kingdom of Navarre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For he does there prove by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Historians</hi> themselves, that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> during the Usurpation, and whiles he liv'd, had onely the Title by the <hi>Pope's Excommunication</hi> to justifie his Arms. He shews how <hi>Ferdinand</hi> having swallow'd up this Kingdom 1512, and being press'd by the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> 1513 to doe him reason, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his possession by no other right but by that of the <hi>Excommunication</hi>; and that in the two most authentick <hi>Acts</hi> on this subject, one whereof is the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by which he bequeaths the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> to his Daughter <hi>Iane</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile,</hi> and the other of the Union of that Kingdom to that of <hi>Castile,</hi> it is expresly signified, that <hi>Iohn d' Albret</hi> and <hi>Catharine</hi> his Wife had been depriv'd of it by the <hi>Pope,</hi> for having adher'd to the <hi>Schism</hi> of the <hi>French Kings</hi> against Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94639:37"/>
II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; and that the <hi>Pope</hi> had given him this <hi>Kingdom</hi> to dispose of as he pleas'd. I omit the other proofs. Which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently shews that the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Bull was no tail of Pretext, but indeed the onely and sole Pretence of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Usurpation which continues to this very day.</p>
            <p>In the second place, there is nothing more absurd then to say that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had never rendred the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Navarre</hi> to the race of <hi>Albret,</hi> but with this <hi>written Caution,</hi> That if their Successors should violate the Alliance, the Kingdom should revert to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For <hi>Iean d' Albret</hi> (on whom was the Usurpation) was the first of <hi>Albret</hi>'s race who possess'd the Kingdom. How then could it be said that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had render'd it to <hi>Albret</hi>'s race, who before never enjoy'd it? And supposing we did take the word <hi>render'd</hi> for <hi>given</hi>; it is no less false that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (were they of <hi>Arragon,</hi> or <hi>Castile</hi>) gave this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the race of <hi>Albret,</hi> who in no sort held it of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> but by the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94639:37"/>
Marriage of <hi>Catharine,</hi> who succeeded King <hi>Francis Phoebus</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Francis Phoebus</hi> to <hi>Elianor</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, wife of <hi>Gastion de Foix,</hi> and sole superviving Daughter of <hi>Blanch</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which Lady had espous'd <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> the Father of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who being born of another <hi>Venter</hi> had nothing to doe with <hi>Navarre</hi>: So as this pretended <hi>Caution</hi> can be no other then a mere impertinent Fable without any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther render'd nor given the Kingdom of <hi>Navarre</hi> to the race of <hi>Albret,</hi> they could never appose any caution or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition either in rendring or bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves could never yet produce any Treaty of Alliance between the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> and those of <hi>Navarre</hi> where this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was appos'd: though, besides all this, it be beyond the power of Kings to annex any such Condition, since they are not so Masters of their <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> as to transfer them to any others then
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94639:38"/>
those who are their legitimate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In fine, 'tis plainly false that ever <hi>Iohn d' Albret</hi> broke any Alliance with <hi>Ferdinand</hi>; but, on the contrary, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> it was who inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Navarre</hi> in the month of <hi>Iuly Anno</hi> 1512, and who made himself master of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> the capital City of that <hi>State,</hi> before there were any <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Navarre</hi>; which compell'd <hi>Iohn d' Albret</hi> to throw himself into the arms of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, with whom he was before but in ill intelligence, to endeavour to maintain himself against this unjust Usurper, who four months before this Treaty of <hi>Iohn d' Albret</hi> with <hi>Lewis</hi> had obtain'd a Bull of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of the <hi>Pope</hi> against the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as falsly represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that being joyn'd with the King of <hi>France</hi> excommunicated by the holy <hi>See,</hi> he deny'd the <hi>English</hi> free passage to enter into <hi>Guienne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore evident that it is onely this pretended Power which the Flatterers of the <hi>Pope</hi> have of late Ages
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94639:38"/>
attributed to him, to dispossess <hi>Kings,</hi> and make Donations of their <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> to him that can obtain them, which has cost our <hi>Kings</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi>; since <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had but <hi>this</hi> pretence onely to invade it; and all that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would add to it since, was never so much as in their heads, because it was out of all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. And it is still true, that this <hi>right</hi> is annex'd (by all those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it) to this <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We see likewise that ever since this, <hi>Popes</hi> have alwaies favour'd the Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as a mark of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which they pretend to have for the deposing of <hi>Kings.</hi> This is evident by their shunning as much as possible the qualifying our King with the <hi>Title</hi> of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>; as in the <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Cardinal Barberin</hi>'s Legation 1625, wherein the <hi>King</hi> being but simply styl'd <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> it was ordain'd by <hi>Parliament,</hi> that it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd by the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the quality of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> had been omitted by inadvertency in the said <hi>Bulls,</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94639:39"/>
that till that were rectified the <hi>Arrest</hi> of <hi>Verification</hi> should not be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the <hi>Bulls</hi> continue without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what they could not then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the wise resistence of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> they have now found an Expedient to obtain by the credit which the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have at <hi>Court:</hi> for finding they had <hi>there</hi> wrought so great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version against the <hi>Iansenists,</hi> that there was nothing more desir'd then their condemnation; they believ'd they could make it be purchased with the loss of the Quality of <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi>: nor were they at all mistaken in their expectation. For <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the X<hi rend="sup">th</hi> address'd his <hi>Bull</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> by a <hi>Breve,</hi> wherein he onely styles him <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; and all who lov'd the State saw with grief that they receiv'd this <hi>Breve</hi> so injurious to the <hi>King</hi> with open arms. You see how well the <hi>Roman Court</hi> knows how to profit on occasions and take her advantage, she never lets any escape which she does not manage with a singular address.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94639:39"/>
But this <hi>Breve</hi> will one day prove one of its most memorable examples: since under colour of ruining the poor <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senists,</hi> she has open'd a gap to establish two of the most considerable points of her Grandeur, and which have indeed been the most contested in <hi>France:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> is, That the <hi>Pope</hi> alone may decide Poins of <hi>Faith</hi> with an infallible Authority; the <hi>other,</hi> That he may give <hi>Kingdoms</hi> away at pleasure, as <hi>Iulius</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> gave that of <hi>Navarre</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all these proofs 'tis evident that the Superiority of <hi>Popes</hi> above <hi>Kings</hi> in Temporals is an inseparable Position of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of all those <hi>Theologues</hi> who are married to the Interest of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially the <hi>Iesuites</hi>: 'Tis also clear that the subtilty of those who have made as if they would separate them hath so little <hi>basis,</hi> that it were an unworthy and dangerous prevarication in those who are oblig'd to maintain the Supreme Authority of their <hi>Prince,</hi> but to reduce the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> which is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94639:40"/>
certain and indubitable, to so shallow and trifling a defence.</p>
            <p>So as the onely means of hindring the establishment of this pernicious Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, to stop <hi>that</hi> so dangerous a <hi>Principle</hi>; and above all, not to permit the <hi>Iesuites</hi> the impudence of making it an Article of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the carrying it even beyond all sorts of bounds, and to an Infallibility in Questions <hi>de facto</hi>; which is, in summe, to have given the fatal blow to the ruine of the <hi>Royal</hi> Throne.</p>
            <p>This is easie to prove. For <hi>Popes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once establish'd superiour to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral <hi>Princes</hi> in Temporals, as we have shew'd they cannot fail of obtaining, if once we allow them <hi>infallible</hi> in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>de jure</hi>; what defence remains there to a <hi>Prince</hi> against the stratagems of this Power, but the pretence of its being possibly miss-inform'd, and that it was mistaken in the grounds on which it proceeded to despoil him of his State?</p>
            <p>But what means is there of opposing that pretence against a person who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94639:40"/>
shall be in possession of the same <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> with <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in matter of <hi>Fact</hi>? What <hi>Christian</hi> is there who should dare oppose to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> that he is mistaken? and what were there more easie for a <hi>Pope</hi> then to ruine this defence; since for that he had onely to declare by a <hi>Bull</hi> that he has well examin'd the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Cause, and that he deserves to be <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>Depos'd,</hi> to oblige all the World to believe that he did merit it indeed?</p>
            <p>Nor let any pretend that 'tis not in these kinds of <hi>Facts</hi> that <hi>Popes</hi> are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible:</hi> For both the Principles and Reasons of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> tend to it: And the benefit of the <hi>Church</hi> (which is the sole foundation of this Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) will rather incline to believe, that <hi>God</hi> is bound to make the <hi>Popes</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in affairs so important as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> the consequences whereof are so terrible to <hi>Religion</hi> it self; as in the judgments which they make, whether there are or are not <hi>Errours</hi> in a particular Book, which is

of it self but of very little conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> without any reason, and from an humane apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and fear, should except these <hi>Facts,</hi> they would not in the least diminish of the pernicious subjects of their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>; because the spirits of those who are once imbu'd with their Opinions would easily break through these weak restraints, in which they made believe they would keep them, and maugre these groundless exceptions carry their corrupt principles to all their natural consequences. So as there is nothing able to oppose the funest effects of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which subjects <hi>Kings</hi> to a forein Power, whiles they permit this double <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> to subsist, from which 'tis impossible to divorce it.</p>
            <p>I very well know that there are some who seek several pretexts to charm the vigilance of <hi>Kings</hi> and their <hi>Ministers,</hi> that so they may not perceive how this Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility</hi> is prejudicial to <hi>States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:94639:41"/>One of these Pretences is, the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that this <hi>Infallibility</hi> relates to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> onely, which are things <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and that have nothing of common with the Temporals of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the rights of their <hi>Crowns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is nothing more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable then this adulterate Colour. For 'tis true, that indeed this <hi>temporal</hi> is not of <hi>Faith</hi> it self, nor is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> the immediate Object of <hi>Infallibility</hi>: But one cannot without <hi>Heresie</hi> deny that it may not be the subject and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Faith</hi>; since 'tis an Article of <hi>Faith</hi> establish'd both by <hi>Gospel</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that we ought to pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> which is a <hi>temporal</hi> thing; and that we owe Obedience to Temporal <hi>Princes,</hi> not onely to escape the punishment which they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on us if we transgress, but because we are in <hi>Conscience</hi> also oblig'd to it. <hi>Non solùm propter iram, sed etiam prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conscientiam.</hi> So as to persuade <hi>Kings</hi> that their Temporal is so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>Faith,</hi> that it can be no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Faith,</hi> is to dissolve and break
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94639:42"/>
the most sacred bond which unites their <hi>Subjects</hi> to their <hi>Empire,</hi> to wit, that of <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Religion. Faith</hi> is in it self a thing intirely <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>divine</hi>; but that does no way hinder things humane and temporal from being very often both the <hi>subject</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> of it. <hi>Warre</hi> is a secular thing; yet 'tis matter of <hi>Faith</hi> to know whether a Christian <hi>Prince</hi> may make warre: And the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> erre in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> when they maintain that it is unlawful. The power which <hi>Magistrates</hi> have to put <hi>Malefactors</hi> to death is a temporal thing; and yet it belongs to <hi>Faith</hi> to decide whether <hi>Iesus Chirst</hi> has left this power to <hi>Christians</hi> or no: and the same <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who deny it, are esteem'd Hereticks by the <hi>Church. Usury</hi> is a temporal thing; yet is it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Faith</hi> to resolve whether or no it be a sin. In like manner the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> is temporal; but it concerns <hi>Faith</hi> to determine whether the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> has given to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> does extend to the breaking of that Obligation and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94639:42"/>
Tie which <hi>Subjects</hi> have to their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi> by absolving them from their <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> It concerns the interpretation of the words of <hi>I. Christ,</hi> and by consequent has relation to <hi>Faith</hi>: It imports the extent of the power that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> has given the <hi>Pope,</hi> as his <hi>Vicar</hi>; which we can know nothing of, but by divine revelation preserv'd in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>; and by consequence it is matter of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no way then to be doubted, but the Question whether the <hi>Pope</hi> have any right to punish <hi>Princes</hi> with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pains, and to devest them of their <hi>States,</hi> by virtue of that Authority pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be given to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> is no concernment of <hi>Faith</hi>; and therefore 'tis in earnest a mere mockery, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade <hi>Kings,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does not extend to them, whenas in truth there are none whom it so near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns as they; since <hi>Popes</hi> having so often decided this <hi>Right</hi> to be <hi>theirs,</hi> if once the people be suffered to hold them infallible as to what they determin
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94639:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
touching <hi>Faith,</hi> none can hinder them from acknowledging also that they do not <hi>erre</hi> in their explication of the words of the <hi>Gospel</hi> touching the <hi>Primacy</hi> of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as of an <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> which extends it self even over the Temporals of <hi>Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, besides this, the question is not of what the thing is in truth, but what 'tis in the opinion of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and that the strive to infuse into the World; seeing from thence it is the ill effects proceed which this unlucky Doctrine may produce: Errour and Superstition being infinitely more capable then either <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> to engage an abus'd people to Insurrections and disorders more nefarious. Now the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> as we have already seen, maintain that this <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> reaches even to the making their Sovereignty over Princes an Article of Faith. <hi>It is of Faith</hi> (say <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Lessius</hi>) <hi>that the Pope may depose Kings, because</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory the</hi> VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>has decided it, and that the Decision of a Pope is a point of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:94639:43"/>It were to take away all humane Reason, to hinder men from thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing; and by consequent to sleep on the point of a Precipice, to suffer the Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility</hi> to creep into a <hi>State,</hi> from whence it is impossible but the other must needs spring.</p>
            <p>For having once permitted the <hi>people</hi> to be season'd with this Opinion, and that they are but accustom'd to receive all that <hi>Popes</hi> pretend in their <hi>Bulls,</hi> as well concerning matters of <hi>Right</hi> as of <hi>Fact,</hi> as if <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himself had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd it; if a <hi>Pope</hi> please to apply the <hi>Infallibility</hi> acknowledg'd to be in him, for the determining (as they have frequently done) that by virtue of the power which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> has given him to <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>loose</hi> whatsoever is on Earth, he has power to depose <hi>Kings</hi> and absolve their <hi>Subjects</hi> from their Fidelity, and that <hi>such</hi> a <hi>King</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be depos'd; it is not to be thought 'twill prove so easie a matter to defend ones self from these Fulminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by altering the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a moment, and persuading them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94639:44"/>
that <hi>he</hi> whom they took to be then so <hi>infallible,</hi> is now no such thing, or is not at least in that matter; that is to say, that he is <hi>infallible</hi> when what he affirms does not concern us, but ceases to be so when it imports us he should not be so. This were to make an ill estimate of the mindes of men, and of the force which custome has over them, to suffer one's self to be dazzled with these vain confidences.</p>
            <p>Those Opinions which do by little and little establish their authority in the minds of men, are weak and tender in their infancy and beginning; nor is it <hi>then</hi> so difficult a matter to extirpate them: but when once time has rooted and confirm'd them, they get dominion of Reason, and discover a tyrannous look against which it dares not so much as lift up its eyes. Capable they are to precipitate it into all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and make men violate the rules of very Nature, and the most sacred obligations of civil Society; especially when they happen to be <hi>Opinions</hi> which possess the spirit by the way of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94639:44"/>
For men being once persuaded, (and with reason) that they ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Religion</hi> before their lives, their goods, and whatever else they injoy, if in that they chance to be prepossess'd by an errour of dangerous consequence to the Civil state, they maintain and defend it to the utmost. <hi>Nulla res multitudinem efficaciùs regit quàm Superstitio.</hi> The <hi>League,</hi> the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibelines</hi> are sanguinary examples of it: so as there is not a more mistaken and wicked policy, then that of those who, minding onely the present Age and their own interest, suffer these Opinions to root them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; without considering that it is infinitely more easie to hinder their establishment, then to stop their accurs'd effects when once they are confirm'd.</p>
            <p>The next Pretence is, to make the world believe that there is no such great reason to apprehend even the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion it self of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Sovereignty over the Temporals of <hi>Kings</hi>; because, say they, <hi>Popes</hi> can exercise in so few Instances, that they seldom happen; as in case a <hi>Prince</hi> fall into a formal <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94639:45"/>
from the <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> to embrace a false <hi>Religion.</hi> But 'tis in vain these Authors endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse this pernicious Doctrine by this false Colour; since those whom they would defend loudly disavow them, as not induring that any should prescribe such narrow bounds to this Temporal <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, there is nothing (with these <hi>Divines</hi>) so ordinary, as the <hi>Occasions</hi> for which they give the <hi>Pope</hi> this right to depose <hi>Kings</hi>; so as there is not <hi>one</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> whom they may not justly depose, according to their <hi>Maximes,</hi> had they but as much power in <hi>effect</hi> as they conceive themselves to have in <hi>right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there any thing more frequent then not to pursue the <hi>Pope's</hi> intentions in making Warre or Peace? It suffices the <hi>Pope</hi> (according to the <hi>Iesuites</hi>) to dispossess a King, whenever he shall conceive <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Warre</hi> necessary for <hi>Religion.</hi> This is what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in express terms, in his Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Barclay, cap.</hi> 19. <hi>And what</hi>

(saies <hi>Barclay</hi>) <hi>if the Emperour refuse to draw his sword at the command of the Pope, or draw it against his will? I answer,</hi> (saies <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) <hi>that if the Emperour will not draw his sword at the command of the Pope, or draw it against his will, and it shall be requisite for the Spiritual weal, he shall force him to doe it by the spiritual Sword; that is, by his Censures, to draw the material Sword, or to sheath it again: and if the Emperour be not concern'd with these Censures, he shall absolve his Subjects from their obedience, the necessity of the Church so requiring, and even take away his Empire from him. 'Tis thus he shall make him know that the Sword is subordinate to the Sword, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the</hi> Bull Unam sanctam; <hi>and that they both belong to the Church, though not after the same manner.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The interpretation of the words of S.</hi> Gregory (saies <hi>Bellarmine</hi> de Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. Roman. Pontif. in Temp. c. 40.) <hi>is not mine, but of another</hi> Gregory, <hi>equal in Dignity, and not much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for Sanctity. For S.</hi> Gregory <hi>VIIth</hi>, <hi>in his</hi> Epistle <hi>to the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Mets, <hi>which is the</hi> 21 <hi>of the</hi> 8 Book, <hi>cites this place of S.</hi> Gregory, <hi>to shew that the Emperour</hi> Henry <hi>was justly depos'd. S.</hi> Gregory (saies he) <hi>declares that</hi> Kings <hi>are fallen from their dignity, when they have the boldness to violate the Decrees of the</hi> Apostolical See, <hi>writing in these terms to an</hi> Abbot <hi>nam'd</hi> Senator; Si quis verò Regum, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So although one may, and with great reason, destroy that foundation which is alledg'd from S. <hi>Gregory</hi>; yet one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94639:47"/>
cannot doe it against the testimony of <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, who was no whit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>less <hi>infallible</hi> then <hi>he,</hi> if all <hi>Popes</hi> be <hi>infallible</hi>; and, by consequent, it must be acknowledg'd, that by the Doctrine of Infallibility <hi>Popes</hi> have right to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Kings</hi> to be fallen from their Dignity, as often as they molest <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Religious men</hi> in the injoyment of the Privileges that have been given them by the holy See: <hi>à fortiori</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may it suffice to dispossess <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Presidents, Councellors</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Magistrates,</hi> when they have given any judgment or sentence prejudicial to their Privileges.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Innocent</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, in the chapter <hi>Novit. de judiciis,</hi> has open'd a door that leaves no considerable errour of <hi>Princes,</hi> for which the <hi>Pope</hi> may not depose them, at least if they persist in them. For he pretends, that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he had no right to meddle in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affairs, yet he was to judge of all such wherein there might be any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sin; <hi>Ratione peccati, cujus ad nos pertinet</hi> (saies this <hi>Pope</hi>) <hi>sine dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94639:48"/>
censura, quam in quemlibet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercere possumus &amp; debemus.</hi> And as in all contests there is commonly some sin on the one side or the other, especially when there is Warre, there being none of either part just, according to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>; so by this means the <hi>Pope</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes sovereign <hi>Arbiter</hi> of all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular differences of <hi>Christian Princes.</hi> Now menaces of <hi>Deposition</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of all Dignity alwaies march with the <hi>judiciary</hi> Sentences of <hi>Popes</hi> against those who do not obey them; and so, unless <hi>Kings</hi> were impeccable, or blindly resolv'd to obey whatever the <hi>Roman Court</hi> shall ordain them, it is hard if they ever want a pretext to depose a <hi>King</hi> when they have a mind to undertake, and have strength enough to execute it.</p>
            <p>It must then be acknowledg'd, that if once <hi>Infallibility</hi> be establish'd, the <hi>Pope</hi> will alwaies find reasons enough to dispossess a <hi>Prince,</hi> which if he do not put in practice, it must be when he wants either will or power.

establish'd by <hi>God,</hi> should suffer <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes</hi> to be introduced, according to which the acknowledgment of them for <hi>Kings</hi> by their subjects should depend upon the will of another? Does not Christian Prudence and Policy oblige them to banish from their States all the seeds of Division and trouble, and not onely to consider the present, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their vigilance for the time to come? It is true, that by the Grace of God, he who now sits on S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair is so wise and moderate, that we can expect from him nothing save acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of goodness and sweetness towards all <hi>Christian Princes</hi>; but we have no assurance that it will alwaies be so; and the past examples shew us suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently how easily things change at the Courts of <hi>Princes</hi> in a little time, which changeing so often their <hi>Princes,</hi> change also their Interests with them. I will onely recite what I find recorded in the History of <hi>King Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> so judiciously written by my Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rhodes.</hi>

            <p>These Examples produc'd by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Bishop,</hi> and one whom we cannot doubt to have been most affectionate to the holy <hi>See,</hi> makes us judge, that a Wise <hi>Politician</hi> will never neglect betimes to suppress these strange Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94639:50"/>
which both the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Sorbon</hi> have so often pronounc'd <hi>so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to</hi> States, <hi>as tending to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of Sovereign Powers ordain'd and establish'd by God, and to the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of Subjects against their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> under pretext that the present state of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very far from such like enterprises. It belongs also to the wisedom of a <hi>King</hi> so illuminated as ours is, and affection'd to the prosperity of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> not to confine his cares within such narrow limits as the present Age. His own so wonderful Birth, and that of a <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has so early bless'd his Marriage with, should make him hope that his Race (which is that of S. <hi>Lewis</hi>) shall reign to the end of the World o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this great <hi>Monarchy:</hi> 'tis this which yet obliges him farther to extend the thoughts of his Royal providence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of common prudence, to prevent the source of those evils which may possibly happen in the Ages long to come, and to permit nothing which may one day shake a <hi>Throne</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which all his Descendents ought to sit hereafter.</p>
            <p>And truely it were highly necessary that great <hi>Kings</hi> should labour for themselves and their Successors to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish their Authority, since they have to doe with the most crafty and able <hi>Politicians</hi> in the world, who perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch all occasions of more and more amplifying that of their <hi>Master</hi>; who with infinite diligence manage the least occasions of advancing them; who take for well-grounded all that escapes and is let pass, changing as soon Favours into Right; who are not repuls'd at every resistence which sometimes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses their undertakings, but, giving place for a while, are by the next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ready to make fresh assaults; which often succeeds, either by change of some <hi>Minister</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> or the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of our <hi>Nation,</hi> whose vigour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of a short continuance, yields that with the greatest facility to day, which she never resolv'd to agree to yesterday.</p>

possession which the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuntio's</hi> have gotten, of receiving the Attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Life and manners of those persons who are nominated by the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Bishopricks</hi> and <hi>Abbies.</hi> The late Mons. <hi>du Puy</hi> has compil'd a <hi>Treatise</hi> concerning this subject, where he shews, That by the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Blois, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1576, by advice of the <hi>States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> conven'd at <hi>Paris</hi> 1615, and by the Assembly of the <hi>Notables An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1627, this information ought to be made by the <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> as conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> Sess. 22. ch. 2. and Sess. 24. ch. 1.

            <p>Well known is that famous <hi>Arrest</hi> given <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. upon the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances</hi> of the late Advocate-general Mons. <hi>Talon</hi> against those who would have valid in <hi>France</hi> the Censures of

the <hi>Inquisition</hi> and <hi>Index</hi>; in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim they were never more in reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then since that time: and it is hard to comprehend how the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> (which has ever been so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) could endure it, without once complaining, that the <hi>Episcopal Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Prelates</hi> of <hi>France</hi> have been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> with so much indignity; that they have rang'd them amongst the <hi>damned Books</hi> which they esteem so disgraceful, without vouchsafing either to clear it with the <hi>Bishops</hi> before Censure, or to render them any account of what they found amiss therein afterwards.</p>
            <p>See but how they bear all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them with a perseverance indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable; and by degrees how the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the <hi>Roman Court</hi> (which have formerly been so odious among us) esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish themselves in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the ancient Maxims that our Fathers have conserv'd with so much zeal and jealousie are chang'd and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 'Tis not alwaies done at once, but sometimes by degrees and insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94639:53"/>
and to give an <hi>Instance</hi> of it, we need goe no farther then to that of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> onely.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that in the time of the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> and of <hi>Basil</hi> they acknowledg'd no other <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> then that of the <hi>Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,</hi> and the <hi>General Council</hi> which represented it, and that it went for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among all learned men, that the <hi>Pope</hi> might <hi>erre</hi> in point of <hi>Faith.</hi> It is what may be seen not onely in the Works of the greatest persons of those times, as of <hi>Gerson, Peter d' Ailly Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> of <hi>Cambray,</hi> the holy and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Carthusian Dionysius Rikel, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Cusa,</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Palermo,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Florence, Iohn Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch, Alphonsus Tostatus</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd the Prodigy of the world, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes de Parifiis,</hi> and of many more; but likewise by the contest which sprung up in those times, Whither a <hi>Council</hi> were above a <hi>Pope,</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> above the <hi>Council</hi>; which was decided in favour of the <hi>Council</hi> by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:94639:53"/>
who maintaining the Preeminence of the <hi>Council,</hi> made use of this <hi>Principle</hi> as certain and indisputable, That a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council</hi> could not erre in Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which regard <hi>Faith</hi> and good <hi>Manners,</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> therein might erre.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil,</hi> minding to establish this Preeminence of <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Councils</hi> in its Synodal Letter published after the third <hi>Session,</hi> speaks in this manner. <hi>This holy Church has receiv'd so great a Privilege of</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>our Saviour, which he has foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Bloud, that we most firmly believe she cannot erre. This is what is agreeable to God alone by nature, and to the Church by privilege. Nor was this gift imparted to the Sovereign Bishop, of some of whom we reade that they fell into Heresie. 'Tis the Church alone which is without spot or wrinkle, which cannot erre in things necessary to Salvation.</hi> And afterwards, <hi>If the</hi> Council <hi>might erre (it being certain that</hi> Popes <hi>may erre) all the whole</hi> Church <hi>would be in an Errour: Si er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare

posset Concilium, cùm certum sit Papam errare posse, tota erraret Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi> See the Voice of the whole <hi>Church</hi> legitimately assembled by the <hi>H. Spirit</hi> in <hi>General Council</hi>: For 'tis not to be doubted but that <hi>then</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> was <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> since <hi>Pope Eugenius</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> acknowledged by an Authentick <hi>Bull</hi> (recited in the 16 <hi>Session,</hi>) that the <hi>Council</hi> was legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and General from the beginning of it to that very moment.</p>
            <p>But what clearly testifies that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in those times doubted of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of a <hi>Council</hi> above a <hi>Pope</hi> in things concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> which cannot be establish'd but on this of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>'s not erring and that the <hi>Pope</hi> may, is what <hi>Pope Eugenius</hi> (what time he chiefly strove to set himself above a <hi>Council</hi>) was notwithstanding oblig'd to acknowledge, That in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> the opinion of the Council ought to be preferr'd before that of a <hi>Pope.</hi> This we see in the last of the 3 <hi>Bulls,</hi> which he revok'd when he rejoyn'd himself to the <hi>Council,</hi> 1434. in these terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:94639:54"/>
               <hi>Suppose a</hi> Pope <hi>or his</hi> Legate <hi>would doe one thing, and that a</hi> Council <hi>would doe the contrary; we ought to follow not the Sentence of the</hi> Council, <hi>but the opinion of the</hi> Pope, <hi>or his</hi> Legate <hi>who represents him, because the</hi> Pope<hi>'s Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction is above that of all</hi> Councils; <hi>unless it happen that the things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie concern'd the</hi> Catholick Faith, <hi>or that they were such as without the determination thereof the whole</hi> State <hi>of the</hi> Universal Church <hi>would be in disorder. In such a case there must be had more regard to the opinion of a</hi> Council <hi>then to that of</hi> Popes. <hi>Nisi fortè quae statuenda forent Catholicam Fidem respicerent, vel si non fierent, statum universalis Ecclesiae principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perturbarent; quia tunc Concilii Sententia esset potiùs attendenda.</hi>

            <p>This <hi>Pope</hi> you see acknowledg'd that in things concerning the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> being of one opinion, and the <hi>Council</hi> of another, <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> was to be chosen.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94639:55"/>
since there is no opinion which we ought to prefer before a man that is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi> And therefore <hi>Pope Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> what-ever he pretended to place himself above all <hi>Councils,</hi> durst never arrogate <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Infallibility.</hi>

               <hi>Dionysius Rikel Carthusian,</hi> (term'd the <hi>Extatick</hi> or <hi>Illuminated Doctor,</hi> as having through all his Works joyn'd an illuminated and inflamed <hi>Piety</hi> with his profound skill in <hi>Divinity</hi>) in his Treatise of the Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> having in several passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges spoken highly of that of the <hi>Pope,</hi> does notwithstanding acknowledge that in <hi>Council</hi> one cannot dispute the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this advantage above the <hi>Pope,</hi> That a <hi>Council</hi> cannot erre in matters which pertain to <hi>Faith</hi> and good <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> may erre there. The power of a <hi>Council</hi> (saies he) is in this greater then the <hi>Pope</hi>'s, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> has promis'd to his Church, or the <hi>Council</hi> (which is her Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,) an infallible direction and divine assistance which shall never fail. So as a <hi>Council</hi> can neither erre in matters of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94639:55"/>
               <hi>Faith,</hi> nor in what regards good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; forasmuch as it is immediately led by the Holy Spirit in the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of these things. And therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> himself is in these things to adhere to the <hi>Churche</hi>'s Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, to the Decrees of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> as to an <hi>Oracle,</hi> and regulation of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; whereas the <hi>Pope</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obnoxious to erre in points of <hi>Faith,</hi> good manners, and other matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation, methinks men should not acquiesce in his judgement as the onely certain opinion, because he is not an <hi>infallible</hi> rule, nor yet a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation so establish'd, but that it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from the Truth.</p>
            <p>This holy Monk saies the same thing in a <hi>Sermon</hi> upon S. <hi>Hilarie</hi>; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting onely those Authors who are notoriously ingag'd in the Interests of the <hi>Roman Court,</hi> all the knowing <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> of that Age spake the same Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I observe onely <hi>Pope Adrian</hi> the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, who having taught the same Doctrine before he was exalted to the <hi>Pontificate,</hi> did not onely not retract it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94639:56"/>
afterwards, but caus'd his Works to be printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> in which we may yet reade these words, namely in his fourth Book of Sentences: <hi>If by the</hi> Roman Church (saies he) <hi>you understand him who is the Head of it, 'tis certain</hi> (pray mark the term) <hi>that this Head of the</hi> Roman Church, <hi>viz. the</hi> Pope, <hi>may erre even in things appertaining to</hi> Faith, <hi>by defending an Heresie by his Determination or Decretal.

            </p>
            <p>See what this holy and knowing man has written, being then a private person; and what it was he so approv'd when he was <hi>Pope</hi>: so little did his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement blind him, as it has done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, or make him forget what he ow'd to <hi>Truth,</hi> to gratifie his new Dignity with advantages which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> never imparted to him.</p>

               <hi>Parisian Doctors</hi> opinions, so well known to the World, and to the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> themselves, who term the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion against Infallibility <hi>Sententia Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risiensium</hi>: but we must not omit the sense of the whole <hi>Faculty</hi> in a Body, in this celebrious Declaration of the <hi>Faith</hi> which she made by order of <hi>Francis</hi> the I<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, and which was afterwards ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in Parliament; so as in <hi>France</hi> it held a particular force of a <hi>Law</hi> and a publick <hi>Ordinance</hi>: Having therefore receiv'd a command of the <hi>King</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into <hi>Articles</hi> the principal Points of <hi>Faith</hi> attacqu'd by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> she declares, <hi>That</hi> General Councils <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre</hi> in Points of <hi>Faith</hi> and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good manners. <hi>Certum est Concilium Generale legitimè congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum, universalem Ecclesiam reprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentans, in Fide &amp; morum determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus errare non posse.</hi> But for the <hi>Pope,</hi> see what she saies of it all; <hi>It is no less certain, that there is one Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bishop by divine right in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church, to which all</hi> Christians <hi>ought to submit, and who has likewise
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94639:57"/>
power to conferre Indulgences: Nec minùs certum est, unum esse jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino Pontificem in Ecclesia Militante, cui omnes Christiani parere tenentur, qui quidem potestatem habet Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias conferendi.</hi>

            <p>This different manner of speaking of <hi>Councils</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> in two Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which immediately follow, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting <hi>Infallibility</hi> to the <hi>Council,</hi> and none to the <hi>Pope,</hi> sufficiently states the different sentiments which these <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> had both of <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this subject. For I think not my self oblig'd to refute the extravagancies of a certain Writer of these times, who pretends to prove by the Obedience which these <hi>Doctors</hi> teach is due to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as if by that we acknowledg'd his <hi>Infallibility.</hi> By the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he may prove, that not onely all <hi>Bishops</hi> in particular, but that all <hi>Abbots,</hi> and <hi>Abbesses, Priors</hi> &amp; <hi>Prioresses</hi> are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> because they are promis'd obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But he should have learn'd that in promising obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> men are so far from acknowledging an entire
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94639:57"/>
submission of belief to his <hi>Decisions,</hi> that the <hi>Divines</hi> say expresly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others Mons. <hi>Duval, Summo Pontifici parendum esse, sive errare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, sive non</hi>: Which signifies but this, That men should not <hi>Dogmatize</hi> the contrary to what he has decided, and with this caution yet, <hi>nisi Error sit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerabilis,</hi> as <hi>Gerson</hi> affirms.</p>
            <p>Such as has been the common sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of our <hi>Parisian Divines,</hi> till Mons. <hi>Duval,</hi> who would have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Opinions into the <hi>Sorbon</hi> total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to these ancient <hi>Maxims</hi>: But, as 'tis customary with those who engage in quarrells against what is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally receiv'd, it has hitherto been with much wariness;<note place="margin">Duvallius <hi>de supr. aut. Rom. Pontif.</hi> l. 2. c. 1.</note> For he did in that manner assert the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> that in the same breath he likewise taught, 'twas no matter of <hi>Faith</hi> to believe it: <hi>Non est de fide Summum Pontificem esse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He holds moreover, that the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his not being <hi>infallible</hi> is neither rash nor erroneous. <hi>Non est erroneum,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94639:58"/>
neque temerarium temeritate opinionis, dicere, Summum Pontificem in decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendo errare posse.</hi> And speaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Decision of a <hi>Pope</hi> against a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> he saies, <hi>That this Definition of</hi> Sixtus <hi>the IVth</hi> 
               <hi>is not of</hi> Faith, <hi>but onely very certain; because,</hi> saies he, <hi>the Definitions of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bishops have not the certitude of the Catholick Faith, till they be first received by the Universal Church, or a General Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, whatever the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s design be and those of his gang to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> they have been yet oblig'd to acknowledge, that a <hi>Divine</hi> who should doubt, or not believe what has not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided but by a <hi>Pope,</hi> should neither be accus'd of Errour or Temerity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he did not contradict the <hi>Pope</hi> publickly and with Scandal.</p>
            <p>Behold here the very first breach which has been made, at least in the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> against its ancient <hi>Doctrine.</hi> But in the mean time this has not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd those very Persons who incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94639:58"/>
this <hi>Doctor,</hi> and that were ingag'd by Interest with the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to reject this personal <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> whenever they had any regard of their reputation amongst learned men. This is evident by Cardinal <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> who in his Reply to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> l. 6. p. 1083. expresly acknowledges, that the onely expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to determine Disputes of <hi>Religion</hi> with a certainty of <hi>Faith</hi> is by a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Were the Service</hi> (saies he) <hi>taken away from the Original Tongue, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd into another, all means of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating universal Councils, and having any certitude or assurance of matters of</hi> Faith, <hi>would cease. For there being no certitude of the genuine sense of Scripture by our particular Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since no Interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of private inspiration, and we having no way left us of resolution with certitude of</hi> Faith <hi>in debates which rise about</hi> Religion <hi>upon the meaning of Scripture, besides the voice of the</hi> Church <hi>speaking in</hi> General Councils;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94639:59"/>
               <hi>evident it is that whatever it be which takes away from the</hi> Church <hi>the means of holding</hi> General Councils, <hi>takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it all means of deciding the Disputes of</hi> Christian Religion <hi>with certitude of</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cardinal de Richelieu,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Controversies,</hi> which has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the late Mons. <hi>Lescot</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and divers other <hi>Divines</hi> exceedingly devoted to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledges the same thing, Lib. 3. c. 5. p. 424. <hi>Since there is</hi> (saies he) <hi>no</hi> Oecumenical Council <hi>which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the use of the</hi> Images <hi>of the</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons; <hi>it is evident that 'tis no Article of Faith</hi>: supposing that for the Principle, That onely <hi>General Councils</hi> can frame Articles of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see that the Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which had been promoted by Mons. <hi>Duval</hi> with some kind of fear and reserve, was abandon'd by the most knowing persons of the <hi>Church,</hi> and chiefly by those who defended it against the <hi>Hereticks</hi>; because they would not engage the cause of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94639:59"/>
Religion</hi> in defence of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion so insupportable: and therefore the Favourites of the <hi>Roman Court</hi> were then contented that this <hi>Opinion</hi> should pass for <hi>problematick</hi> onely. Whence it came to pass that Mons. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> (who had but just propos'd it in this manner) was all his life in so great esteem at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there as <hi>the</hi> person in the world who had render'd the greatest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the holy <hi>See</hi>; and that all the <hi>Nuns</hi> had order not to doe any thing here without his advice. But finding this tentative succeed so happily, and that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> (having gain'd the <hi>Catholick Universities</hi>) had fill'd all mens thoughts with this infinite power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which was highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to them for the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> they no longer remain'd in this moderation. They pretended that it was not enough for the <hi>French</hi> to permit them to <hi>say</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>infallible</hi>; but so order'd the matter, that no man was suffered to acknowledge him for <hi>less.</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:94639:60"/>
They were contented that Mons. <hi>Duval</hi> should say that it was no matter of <hi>Faith</hi> to believe the <hi>Pope infallible,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this reserve was necessary at that point of time, for the currenter passage of the <hi>Doctrine</hi>; but having first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to distribute it in this manner, they did not long rest there; the design is to make men believe that the Doctrine of the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> (opposite to this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which in Mons. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>'s daies was neither an Errour, nor any rash Opinion) is since that time (though the <hi>Church</hi> never thought of any change) become a manifest <hi>Heresie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what the <hi>Iesuites</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly farther'd: For 'tis about 5 or 6 years past that Father <hi>Theophile Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud,</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> publish'd a Book with this Title, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> to shew not onely that the <hi>Pope is infallible,</hi> but that it is matter of <hi>Faith</hi> that he is so, and, by consequent, those that doubt of it <hi>Hereticks</hi>; and he treats Mons. <hi>Duval</hi> very ill in his Book, whom in contempt he calls <hi>a certain Doctor,</hi> for his caution in not so openly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94639:60"/>
venting this false Doctrine as a new <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> And because they saw this enterprise of theirs was not punished as it deserv'd, growing daily more insolent, they proceeded to that extravagant impiety of their <hi>Theses</hi> of the <hi>College de Clermont,</hi> which is now the object of the indignation of all <hi>France,</hi> daring publickly to maintain, (even in the midst of <hi>Paris</hi> it self, and in face of the <hi>Parliament</hi>) That the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Truth</hi> which opposes the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> concerning the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Primacy</hi> is, <hi>That</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all</hi> Popes <hi>the very same</hi> Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>which himself had, not onely in Questions</hi> de Jure, <hi>but in those also</hi> de Facto.</p>
            <p>By this 'tis visible to what their boldness may aspire, if not timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and repress'd, and what progress these monstrous Opinions are like to make, to the total destruction of the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican Church</hi> so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to our <hi>Ancestors,</hi> unless we be more vigilant in stopping its carreer.</p>
            <p>And in earnest it is very hard it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94639:61"/>
should not be so, if we but consider a little those <hi>three Expedients</hi> which the abettors of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> make use of to establish their <hi>Maxims.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First is, the <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Iesuites</hi> spread over the face of the <hi>Universe,</hi> and got to be <hi>Masters</hi> of the greatest part of the <hi>Colleges</hi>; so as all the World being imbu'd with these <hi>Principles</hi> from their infancie, as 'twere, Opinions not advantageous to the <hi>Church,</hi> but the <hi>Court Politick</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are receiv'd with respect, as if they consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a part of our <hi>Religion</hi>; so as it is quite against the hair of any other, because the <hi>Iesuites</hi> accustom those who have once plac'd their belief in them, to look upon men as persons sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of their <hi>Faith,</hi> who in <hi>this</hi> are not of their <hi>opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is the hands of many persons a Treatise of the late Father <hi>Eustachius Gault,</hi> a very knowing and pious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>de l' Oratoire,</hi> nominated by the late King for <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> wherein he mentions how dangerous it is for this very reason, lest all the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:94639:61"/>
should in time, and by degrees, fall into the hands of the <hi>Iesuites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second means is, the care they take concerning Books; blasting all that they find containing any thing of the ancient <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> suppressing them all that they can; or at least so ordering the matter, as to retrench whatever is not in their favour: as they have done by a large Discourse of <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> treating of the politick Incroachment of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is no more to be found in the late <hi>Italian</hi> Editions, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in the old ones, as may yet be seen in an ancient <hi>French</hi> Translation of that famous <hi>Historian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while they give all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of liberty to such Books as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own pretensions, and that establish the <hi>Opinions</hi> on which they are supported. It must be acknowledg'd that there's nothing has more advanc'd their Interest: for 'tis almost impossible but the minds and spirits of <hi>Students</hi> should be fill'd with the sentiments of those <hi>Authors</hi> which they reade most.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94639:62"/>
Now without speaking of the less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable <hi>Authors,</hi> who are infinite, those who would more deeply apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Science</hi> do commonly addict themselves to <hi>Church-History</hi> and the <hi>Councils</hi>; and for the first, they goe to seek it in <hi>Baronius</hi> and his Continuators. This person had doubtless very many excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and deserves great commendations for having by his indefatigable labour disintangled an infinite many of things which before lay in a strange confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But withall it must not be deny'd that the Zeal which transported him for the Grandeur of the <hi>H. See</hi> made him commit very many excesses, which might be pardon'd in a person so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable on some other occasions, but by no means be defended: For how can we possibly excuse him all those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous imaginations of his, where he engages himself to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Pope Honorius</hi> was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Council</hi>; but that what we see of his Condemnation in the <hi>Acts</hi> of that <hi>Council</hi> has been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94639:62"/>
inserted by the order of a most pious <hi>Emperour,</hi> whom he affirms to have consented to the Falsification of the <hi>Originals</hi> which he had in his hands?</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, because F. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befis</hi> (a very learned <hi>Dominican</hi>) thought himself oblig'd, for the honour of <hi>Truth</hi> and of the <hi>Church,</hi> to refute this Fiction, which is of most pernicious consequence, (since there is not an Act of <hi>General Council</hi> which one may not with as much likelihood say to be forg'd) it has pleas'd F. <hi>Theophile Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud,</hi> a <hi>Iesuite</hi> forsooth, in a Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>An Cyriaci immunes à Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>? a most bloudy <hi>Satyre</hi> against the whole <hi>Dominican Order,</hi> most outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously to rend and tear this learned <hi>Frier,</hi> as if he had perpetrated the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousest sin in the world, for having shew'n that <hi>Baronius</hi> engag'd himself into very great Absurdities, in not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that a <hi>Pope</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd as an <hi>Heretick</hi> in a <hi>General Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A strange piece of tyranny it would
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94639:63"/>
be, to take away all liberty from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> that love the <hi>Truth,</hi> to defend it against whomsoever when 'tis thus wrong'd, and to interpret it a Crime to take notice of the excesses of <hi>Baronius,</hi> when he endeavors to advance the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Holy <hi>See.</hi> He is not <hi>then</hi> himself, and he sometimes saies such things seriously on this subject, that 'tis hard to reconcile them to sense; as when he attributes a kind of <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which is not well applicable to <hi>God</hi> himself, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> can make new <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and change them again when they are made. <hi>Ut planè appareat,</hi> saies he on the business of the <hi>Apollinarists, An.</hi> 373. <hi>n.</hi> 22. <hi>ex arbitrio pependisse Romani Pontificis Decreta sancire, &amp; sancita mutare.</hi> This is prodigiously strange; and yet we find something like this of <hi>Baronius</hi> in the <hi>Preface</hi> of F. <hi>Sirmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> upon <hi>Facundus:</hi> For (saies he) this <hi>Bishop</hi> is not to be blam'd for having maintain'd the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> since <hi>Pope Vigilius</hi> was ever more dispos'd to defend them, as it was in truth reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

be acknowledg'd that his <hi>Annals</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in other places fill'd with many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good things for the confirmation of <hi>Catholick Verities,</hi> and the purity of <hi>Discipline,</hi> contain also very many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious <hi>Maxims,</hi> and false Reflexions as to what concerns the pretences of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>: and 'tis that which makes these last to be receiv'd and swallowed, because they are mingled with the first.</p>

            <p>But be it what it will, we may judge from hence that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> design is in this new <hi>Edition</hi> of the <hi>Councils</hi> to favour the pretences of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in all that possibly they can; there being nothing she so much desires as to hinder the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputed <hi>General</hi>; insomuch as those of the <hi>party</hi> have presum'd to falsifie a <hi>List</hi> of the <hi>General Councils</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Epitome</hi> of <hi>Antonius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus</hi>'s <hi>Canon Law,</hi> leaving out that of <hi>Basil,</hi> which this learned <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> had set down, as may be seen, where, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these words, <hi>Constantiense sub Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino

            </p>
            <p>There are a world of other things in this draught of Father <hi>L' Abbé,</hi> which ought not to be suffered in <hi>France</hi>; but above all, 'tis a thing insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that these Disciples of <hi>Santarel</hi> should dare to treat as <hi>Hereticks</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons suspected for their Faith both <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> better <hi>Catholicks</hi> then themselves, for defending onely the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> establish'd by <hi>God,</hi> against those who would subject them to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> power. Thus this <hi>Iesuite</hi> injures <hi>Roger Widdrington,</hi> an <hi>English Priest,</hi> whom we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a very firm <hi>Catholick,</hi> since some temporal Interests might have else been able to make him quit his <hi>Religion,</hi> had he not held it by a divine obligation. But because he had several contestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94639:70"/>
with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in favour of <hi>Kings, L' Abbé</hi> is pleas'd to rank him in the same design with <hi>Blondel,</hi> and to speak of him in these terms; <hi>Non ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noro Davidem Blondellum, Rogerum Widdringtonum, &amp; quosdam alios aut Haereticos, aut de Fide saltem suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Third means which the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> makes use of to establish her <hi>Pretensions</hi> is, to <hi>defend</hi> and <hi>gratifie</hi> all those who <hi>favour</hi> her, and to <hi>decry,</hi> yea <hi>persecute</hi> upon all occasions, those that are any waies averse and contrary. 'Tis so meritorious an action in their judgment to maintain <hi>that</hi> which they call the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Holy <hi>See,</hi> that even <hi>those</hi> whom otherwise they have no esteem of for any sense of Piety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come recommendable; and 'tis on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side so great a sin to prescribe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> for a limit of this <hi>infinite power,</hi> that whatever <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Piety</hi> one might be acknowledg'd to have had before, he becomes <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> upon an instant.</p>
            <p>I find two memorable <hi>examples</hi> of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94639:70"/>
both in the 18 <hi>Tome</hi> of <hi>Raynaldus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one is of <hi>Laurentius Valla,</hi> whom he affirms in a certain place to have been an <hi>impious fellow,</hi> and whom in <hi>another</hi> place he extolls for having exceedingly praised <hi>Eugenius</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, who is one of those <hi>Popes</hi> that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to advance his Authority to the utmost.</p>
            <p>The other is of an <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of <hi>Mentz,</hi> a person of great worth and Piety, that had some contest with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi> touching <hi>Canonical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.</hi> This <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> complains that the <hi>Pope</hi> did not observe the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordate</hi> which <hi>Eugenius</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and <hi>Nicolas</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his Successor had made on this subject with the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>; and <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> who was then <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and who writ about it to this <hi>Arch-bishop</hi>'s <hi>Chancellor,</hi> was not able to deny it, since what he saies is, that <hi>if the Elections were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, they ought to be confirm'd in virtue of the Concordate, and that they were not to be rejected; unless</hi> (saies he) <hi>the Pope in Council with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94639:71"/>
the Cardinals conceive it fit to put in a Person more advantagious to the Church:</hi> as if this last Clause were not a visible <hi>infraction</hi> of the <hi>Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,</hi> which this <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> had great reason to complain of; since the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Elections</hi> had no more any thing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, if the <hi>Pope</hi> refusing to confirm them had been acquitted, by saying, he onely did it to constitute a more <hi>fitting person</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> in place.

in his Gospel, without arrogating to themselves a magisterial, temporal or worldly Dominion; so long they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved universal reverence and sincere obedience from all men: But no sooner did they or any of them exalt themselves by assuming an Authority not onely as Peers, but Superiours to Kings, but they became in danger of losing their own Authority, and that too which they would have usurped from others, and have created trouble both to the Kingdom of God and of his Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly those <hi>Popes</hi> who shall but consider these <hi>Christian</hi> and pious <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> will never suffer themselves to be surpris'd with the <hi>Flatteries</hi> of those about them; and will understand that 'tis not the <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Holy See</hi> which these <hi>Sycophants</hi> look after, but their particular profit.

which we disagree; and on the <hi>other,</hi> that by <hi>this</hi> Doctrine they make the <hi>Pope</hi> in danger to deceive <hi>himself,</hi> and expose the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.</hi> For 'tis this pretence of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> which may induce <hi>Popes</hi> to neglect to take the <hi>legitimate</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> waies of <hi>deciding</hi> Points of <hi>Faith,</hi> who, by the consent even of <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> himself, ought to assemble <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> onely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly</hi> examine <hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; which they will hardly ever be brought to doe, so long as they are persuaded that they are <hi>Infallible,</hi> without obligation to any other <hi>forms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let them alledge how great an <hi>advantage</hi> it is, the having an <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Authority in the <hi>Church,</hi> to which there is so easie an <hi>access</hi>; as if the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of things depended upon their <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiousness.</hi> Were this so, we must also conclude that <hi>Popes</hi> are <hi>impecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> too, at least in the Government of the <hi>Church</hi>; for who would question but that were likewise very <hi>commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> for hindring the Damnation of so

many persons by these unlawful <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations,</hi> which persuade them that what-ever the <hi>Pope</hi> permits is as truely <hi>lawful</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> himself had said it? whereas really there is nothing more <hi>true</hi> then what an <hi>Ancient</hi> has affirm'd, namely, That the greatest part of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations</hi> are nothing else but a more easie <hi>descent</hi> into <hi>Hell</hi> with the <hi>Pope</hi>'s permission: <hi>Facilis descensus ad inferos cum bona venia Papae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as this <hi>Impeccability</hi> would be exceedingly <hi>advantagious</hi> if indeed <hi>God</hi> had bestow'd it upon <hi>Popes</hi>; so, on the contrary there can nothing be more <hi>pernicious</hi> then the Flattery of those who goe about to attribute <hi>it</hi> to him, since it the more imboldens them <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to pursue their own <hi>Passions,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fearing to offend <hi>God.</hi> And this is what those <hi>Cardinals</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> (chosen by <hi>Paul</hi> the III<hi rend="sup">d</hi> for the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>) affirm'd really to have succeeded by means of <note n="*" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>'Tis well known that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Superiority</hi> of a <hi>Council</hi> above the <hi>Pope</hi> does necessarily destroy his pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi>; because all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is inferiour, seeing it may be <hi>corrected,</hi> 'tis impossible it should be <hi>infallible</hi>; since an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that is <hi>infallible</hi> cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94639:80"/>
It follows then of necessity, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> be inferiour to a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> he is not <hi>infallible.</hi> All <hi>Divines</hi> are agreed upon this consequence; and there is none who maintain the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but they likewise maintain that he is <hi>superiour</hi> to a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, if <hi>Popes</hi> be inferiour to <hi>Councils,</hi> it follows clearly that they are not onely <hi>fallible,</hi> but it is also as evident that they have actually <hi>erred:</hi> seeing <hi>Leo</hi> the X<hi rend="sup">th</hi> has defin'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran.</hi> It is therefore certain, that the <hi>Superiority</hi> of a <hi>Council</hi> above a <hi>Pope</hi> does by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequence involve his <hi>Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> Now this <hi>Superiority</hi> was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decided in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Session</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> where the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> declares, <hi>Concilium Generale habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re à Christo immediatam Authoritatem, cui omnes obedire tenentur, etiam si Papalis dignitatis existat.</hi> And thus the <hi>Fallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> was defin'd by this <hi>Decree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The novel defenders of the <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:94639:81"/>
of <hi>Popes</hi> above <hi>Councils</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly torture themselves about this <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance.</hi> For they cannot deny but that Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> (elected by this <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>) did confirm it in all things which had relation to <hi>Faith:</hi> Now the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of General <hi>Councils</hi> is matter of <hi>Faith</hi>; which forces them thus to precipitate themselves upon <hi>Solutions</hi> so ridiculously weak, that it is strange any <hi>Divines</hi> should be found who durst propose them.</p>
            <p>In the first place they affirm, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> is approv'd by <hi>Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>in his quae Concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ariter gesta sunt</hi>; but that this <hi>Decree</hi> was not made <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> because (say they) it was made without <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and therefore was not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>'Tis easie to see how dangerous an Answer this is: since if men be once permitted to distinguish in <hi>Councils</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner between <hi>Decrees exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd</hi> and <hi>not examin'd,</hi> the way is open to weaken all their Authority.

For how many matters are there which, having been very well examin'd before <hi>Councils</hi> have been call'd, have no need of being re-examin'd for a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whilst all <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> remain agreed concerning them?</p>
            <p>But there is no necessity of insisting upon <hi>this,</hi> since this Solution is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely upon manifest <hi>Falsities</hi>; there being in the world nothing more untrue then the pretence of those <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> that the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Session</hi> about the <hi>Superiority</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> were not of the number of those things which were decreed <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliariter.</hi> For 'tis remarkable that the order of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> was, first to <hi>propose</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the particular <hi>Congregations</hi> of the principal Nations of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and then they were said to have been decreed <hi>Nationaliter.</hi> After that they were <hi>propos'd</hi> again in the publick <hi>Sessions</hi>; and when they were conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>there,</hi> then they were pronounc'd to have been determined <hi>Conciliariter.</hi> Whereas that which had onely been <hi>decreed</hi> by the <hi>Nations,</hi> and not in the

publick and general <hi>Session</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> was never said to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> but <hi>Nationaliter</hi> onely.

Council, <hi>and by the</hi> College <hi>of</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals: <hi>That unless this were consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, they did protest denial of Iustice in the name of their</hi> Masters, <hi>and would appeal to the next</hi> Council. <hi>Which being done,</hi> (the <hi>Acts</hi> added) <hi>Our holy Father the</hi> Pope <hi>replying, said, That he would inviolably hold and observe all and every the things which had been determin'd, concluded and decreed in matters of</hi> Faith <hi>by the present</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Conciliarly, <hi>and that he would never in any kind contradict it: That so he approved and did ratifie all that had thus</hi> Conciliarly <hi>been done, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise whatsoever.

            </p>
            <p>See here the onely foundation of <hi>Cardinal Cajetan</hi>'s distinction, and the sole reason which he alledges to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that <hi>Pope Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> did not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94639:83"/>
approve the <hi>Decrees</hi> touching the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> as not done <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliariter.</hi> But by the very same he evidently <hi>approves</hi> that he has approv'd them: since the <hi>Pope</hi> includes in his <hi>Approbation</hi> whatsoever had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> and excludes but what having been concluded by the <hi>Nations,</hi> had onely been determin'd <hi>Nationaliter,</hi> and not <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> forasmuch as it was not propos'd in the publick and general <hi>Sessions</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>; so as had been the condemnation of <hi>Iohn Falkenberg</hi>'s Book, which he refus'd to ratifie for reasons not known to us. Now it is evident, and no waies doubtful, but the <hi>Decrees</hi> touching a <hi>Council</hi>'s <hi>Superiority</hi> were first examin'd and concluded by the <hi>Nations,</hi> and afterwards <hi>establish'd</hi> and <hi>determin'd</hi> in two publick and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Sessions</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> that is to say, in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, where 'tis noted, that these <hi>Decrees</hi> were first of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated and concluded by all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>Certa Capitula per modum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutionum priùs per singulas quatuor Nationes conclusa &amp; deliberata legit

            <p>In like manner we see that the two latter <hi>Annalists</hi> of the Church, <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> and <hi>Raynaldus,</hi> to give some <hi>colour</hi> to this <hi>Cheat,</hi> change either in the <hi>whole</hi> or in <hi>part</hi> the subject and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion which caus'd <hi>Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to say, that he onely approv'd that which had been done <hi>Conciliariter.</hi> For <hi>Raynaldus Anno</hi> 1418. n. 2. falsly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that <hi>Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> speaks these words upon the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> demanding a confirmation of the Acts: <hi>Cùm veteri more</hi> (saies he) <hi>à Patribus

Which is a notorious <hi>Forgery,</hi> since one need onely reade the <hi>Acts</hi> to see, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> did not ask for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and that it was not to answer this demand that he saies what is reported by <hi>Raynaldus</hi>; but that he might not consent to what was requir'd by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi>'s <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> concerning the condemnation of <hi>Falkenberg</hi>'s Book: so as it is not to be deny'd but this <hi>Historian</hi> has committed a shameful <hi>Falsification,</hi> in feigning the <hi>Pope</hi> to answer what was never demanded of him, and in adding those two words, <hi>nimirum postulata,</hi> in <hi>Italick Characters,</hi> to the word <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta,</hi> to make that agree to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> which has relation onely to the words of the <hi>Polonian Embassadors.</hi>

words of <hi>Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to have been spoken upon occasion of the <hi>Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s demand: But he suppresses the protestation of <hi>Appealing</hi> to the future <hi>Council</hi>; because that had too evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew'd how false that which he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines is, <hi>That it was on design, and in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion with</hi> Martin <hi>the V•h</hi>, <hi>that these</hi> Embassadors <hi>deferr'd their demand till this last</hi> Session, <hi>that so they might have an opportunity to observe what</hi> Decrees <hi>of the</hi> Council <hi>he did approve by his</hi> Apostolical <hi>Authority, and what he did not approve; lest if they had mov'd it before, they might have excited some murmure and trouble among the</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>by reason of that which had been decided after an ambiguous manner touching the Authority of a</hi> Council <hi>above a</hi> Pope, <hi>and their power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the</hi> Church <hi>both as to its</hi> Head <hi>and</hi> Members, <hi>which</hi> Pope Martin <hi>would not receive nor approve by taking these Decisions absolutely, and in the precise significations of terms.</hi> All which is but a pure <hi>imagination,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of ground: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that the <hi>Polonians,</hi> who appeal'd
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94639:85"/>
from the <hi>Pope</hi> to the <hi>Council,</hi> could not be suspected to have conspired with him, since there is nothing which <hi>Popes</hi> more abhorre then these <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Councils</hi>; the answer of <hi>Pope Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> puts no distinction between the <hi>Decrees</hi> which are found amongst the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> as if he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the <hi>one</hi> without the <hi>other,</hi> but shews on the contrary, that he approv'd all these <hi>Decrees,</hi> and that he did not deny his <hi>Approbation,</hi> but as to what did not appear in these <hi>Acts</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>Council,</hi> for having been determin'd onely by the <hi>Nations</hi>; such as was the condemnation of <hi>this</hi> Book of <hi>Falkenberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot therefore be maintain'd with the least pretence of likelihood, that <hi>Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> did not approve the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Superiority</hi> of General <hi>Councils.</hi> And that which makes it yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is, that <hi>Pope Eugenius</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, though he continually strove to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre himself above <hi>Councils,</hi> durst not yet openly oppose those <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> nor reject them as not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94639:85"/>
by <hi>Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his <hi>Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>; but pretends onely that the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> had abus'd them by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to an ill sense, <hi>Quòd Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Constantiense in malignum sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum pertraxerint</hi>; because it had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken occasion upon this <hi>Definition</hi> to <hi>depose</hi> him, and to <hi>create</hi> another <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But towards the latter end of his life the <hi>Emperour Frederick</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> who kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a <hi>Neutrality</hi> between the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> and this <hi>Pope,</hi> being willing to come to an agreement with him, one of the Conditions of the Accord was, That <hi>Eugenius</hi> should by a <hi>Bull</hi> make the same profession which had already been made in <hi>Germany</hi> by his <hi>Legates,</hi> concerning <hi>the Power, Authority</hi> and <hi>Preeminence of</hi> General Councils, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the</hi> Catholick Church <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</hi> These are the very terms of the <hi>Harangue</hi> which was made by <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> in the name of these Princes. <hi>Alterum est, ut professio Potestatis, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatis &amp; Praeeminentiae Generalium Conciliorum, Catholicam Militantem

            </p>
            <p>But the reflection which <hi>Raynaldus</hi> makes upon these words of <hi>Eugenius</hi> shews us what the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>candor</hi> of those persons is: <hi>'Tis a thing</hi> (saies he) <hi>that deserves observation, that</hi> Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius <hi>by those Letters gives no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Decree of the Council of</hi> Constance, <hi>beginning with the word</hi> Frequens, <hi>but what</hi> Martin <hi>the</hi> V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>had done before.</hi> Now <hi>this</hi> very <hi>Author</hi> pretends, <hi>An.</hi> 1433. that <hi>Martin</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had not approv'd the <hi>Chapter</hi> FRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUENS of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi>; but that on the contrary he had abridg'd it by the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Siena:</hi> so as according to this <hi>Author</hi> the sense of the words of <hi>Eugenius</hi> were, That he receives, embraces and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <hi>Decree</hi> FREQUENS, as far as his <hi>Predecessors</hi>; and that his <hi>Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> having neither receiv'd, embrac'd nor reverenc'd it, neither did he receive, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, or reverence it. Could one offer a greater injury to <hi>Pope Eugenius,</hi> then to take the words of his <hi>Bull</hi> in a sense so estranged from <hi>Christian</hi> sincerity,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94639:87"/>
and think that he would <hi>juggle</hi> with the whole <hi>German Church</hi> by so gross a Delusion?</p>
            <p>But that which does yet farther ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine all these <hi>Sophisms</hi> is, that <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, in the same <hi>Bull</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts that which he had written for the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> against <hi>Pope Eugenius,</hi> formally approves the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> and in particular that <hi>Decree</hi> touching the Authority of General <hi>Councils.

But it is enough to refute this false <hi>Distinction,</hi> that he not onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> in general, but particularly in that which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94639:87"/>
it has <hi>defin'd</hi> concerning the Authority of <hi>Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Reply</hi> whereof these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Authors</hi> make use is, That the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> does not <hi>define</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of all <hi>General Councils,</hi> but that onely which it has during a <hi>Schism,</hi> when there is no lawful <hi>Pope</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> But this <hi>Solution</hi> (as <hi>novel</hi> as the former) is manifestly ruined by the same words of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> which expressly <hi>particularize</hi> that it <hi>defines</hi> the Authority of all <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils,</hi> and not onely its <hi>own</hi> in particular. <hi>Item declarat,</hi> (saies the <hi>Council</hi> in the <hi>Article</hi> immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after what I have cited) <hi>quò qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque, cujuscunque statûs &amp; dignitatis, etiam Papalis, existat, qui Mandatis, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis, seu Ordinationibus aut Praeceptis hujus Sacrae Synodi, &amp; cujuscunque al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius Concilii legitimè congregati, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per praemissis seu ad ea pertinentibus factis vel faciendis, obedire contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer contempserit, nisi resipuerit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignae poenitentiae subjiciatur, &amp; debitè puniatur.</hi>

            <p>There can be nothing then imagin'd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94639:88"/>
more <hi>frivolous</hi> then such an <hi>imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> spake onely of its <hi>own</hi> Authority, and not of <hi>that</hi> of other <hi>Councils</hi>; since it clearly decides, that the <hi>Popes</hi> who despis'd the <hi>Determinations</hi> of any <hi>General Councils</hi> whatsoever are worthy to be punish'd.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, in the fore-alledg'd <hi>passage,</hi> formally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that this <hi>Council</hi> has determin'd the Authority of <hi>Councils</hi> in general, and not its <hi>own</hi> in particular: <hi>Generalis Concilii Authoritatem &amp; Potestatem complectimur, quemadmodum &amp; aevo nostro</hi> Constantiae, <hi>dum ibi fuit Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Universalis, declaratum definitúm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner the whole <hi>Church</hi> in receiving the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> has uniformly understood, that it has <hi>defin'd</hi> the <hi>Superiority</hi> of a <hi>Council</hi> above the <hi>Pope.</hi> Therefore <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> of the <hi>Parisian Divines,</hi> which have particularly adher'd to this <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> have likewise alwaies embrac'd this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> nor have ever admitted any <hi>other,</hi> as <hi>Major</hi> affirms in <hi>c.</hi> 18. <hi>Matt.

               <hi>Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> swore to maintain the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Superiority</hi> of a <hi>Council,</hi> which were yet farther renew'd in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
