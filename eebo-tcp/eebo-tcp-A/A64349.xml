            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis is an Age of Wonders. Just before you left me, Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s <hi>Half-sheet Friend</hi> found out the <hi>Substance</hi> of an <hi>Author</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Species</hi> of a <hi>Publisher;</hi> and, more than that, he crouded <hi>Six Conferences</hi> (and those no very <hi>loose</hi> ones) into his own <hi>Nutshell.</hi> Now, in your Absence, the Author of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Prospective-glass</hi> has wrapt up your <hi>Speculum Examin'd</hi> in a little bit of course Paper; and, then, another <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Gentleman,</hi> (who <hi>advises Pulpits</hi> in Matters where his <hi>Own Party</hi> transgress) has, in a few Lines,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55374:3"/>
confuted D. <hi>T's printed Sermon of Discretion in giving Alms,</hi> without regard to the <hi>First part</hi> of that <hi>Title.</hi> In your absence, I take upon me to wait on these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; and my first Visit shall be to the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Soldier.</hi> But why the <hi>Catholick Soldier?</hi> as if any Christian Soldier, as such, was not <hi>Catholic.</hi> For every Christian is, as Christian, <hi>Catholic,</hi> or <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> and a Member of that <hi>Church,</hi> which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Catholic,</hi> or <hi>Universal,</hi> not because, in every Age, 'tis all over the World, (for some <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors say it may subsist in one Woman) but because it is not limited, as the <hi>Jewish Synagogue,</hi> to One People, but admits <hi>Men of all Nations</hi> and Conditions, upon the Terms of Baptism, into its <hi>Communion.</hi> And that is true Catholic Communion.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman has (I perceive) a Talent in <hi>giving Names,</hi> he is Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s Common-place-Man, and he gives his Book the pretty Name of <hi>Prospective-glass;</hi> and that you may purchase it, as of the choicer kind, he calls it <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi> Nay, that he may shew himself an Extraordinary Man in this way of <hi>giving Names,</hi> he has Christened his own <hi>Father,</hi> and his Christian Name is <hi>Calvinist,</hi> and his Sire-name <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> His first is a little unlucky; for whilst he throws at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the <hi>black Decree,</hi> some imagine, that he hits S. <hi>Austin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seing now he is so very bold with his Father, D. <hi>T.</hi> (they say) do's not take it amiss that he is bold with him. Yet, as Familiar as he is, 'tis well he speaks not in commendation of him; for some must be ill Men, before others will praise them. But let us see what
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55374:3"/>
Name he gives D. <hi>T.</hi> and how well he has hit the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Why, as Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> borrowed from his <hi>Speculum,</hi> so now he borrows from Mr. <hi>Pulton's Remarks,</hi> and <hi>D. T. is Titus,</hi> and a Bar or two beyond him; For what Reason I pray? For these <hi>Evidencing Words,</hi> [The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>(they say) was in the way of being bred a Scholar in</hi> Cambridge, <hi>but he is now a Military Man.</hi>] Now this (he thinks) is a scandalous Untruth, and he thus confutes it.</p>
            <p>1. He turns D. <hi>T's Words into other Words,</hi> and then makes his own Sense out of them. <q>[You write an Epistle to your <hi>A. B.</hi> in which you tell him and the World, That <hi>I was a Cambridge-Scholar.</hi>]</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to say, <hi>It is a Report,</hi> is not to say, <hi>The thing is so;</hi> and, <hi>to be in the way of being so,</hi> is not <hi>actually to be so:</hi> And many a <hi>Boy,</hi> that is in the way at <hi>Sedburgh,</hi> or elsewhere, is dropped before ever he gets to S. <hi>John's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is a notable <hi>Turner</hi> already; what would he be, if, in stead of a <hi>Catholic Soldier,</hi> he should one day become a <hi>Catholic Priest?</hi> He that can already turn a <hi>Looking-glass</hi> into a <hi>Prospective-glass,</hi> would then turn a <hi>late Author</hi> into <hi>S. Cyprian:</hi> For he has still a mighty mind to put the Book <hi>de Coenâ Domini</hi> upon S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and to make the Men of the Third Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to live with those after the Twelfth: All this <hi>for the <hi>due joining.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh but, secondly, 'tis plainly said, not only that he was <hi>not in the way os being bred a Scholar,</hi> but that he was <hi>turn'd from Black to Red.</hi> He has consulted some infallible Interpreter, and these Words must needs sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55374:4"/>
he who now wears a Soldier's Coat, <hi>wore a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man's black Coat before.</hi> Here is Wonder again. <hi>D. T.</hi> has admitted him, and put him into Orders by virtue of a Phrase. But has not Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> heard a <hi>Roman</hi> call'd a <hi>Red-letter'd Man,</hi> as well as a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic?</hi> And is it not proper to say of such a one who leaves either Common-Prayer or Directory, That he is <hi>turn'd from Black to Red,</hi> without converting the Colour of a Calendar into that of a Coat? If it be, let him that observes such Decency in his Words, be a Censor of Phrases. Tho' the Doctor meant as I have said, (for that was the Account he gave of the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the Soldier oblig'd him with his Letter) yet there is another Account which may be given out of the <hi>Sage Author</hi> of <hi>Hudibras,</hi> which I produce without the least Reflexion upon either of the Professions, for I heartily honour them. Now their Honour being left untouch'd, let this little Author make what Application he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>Thus, then, that <hi>Sage</hi> Author, somewhere in his Poem:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>And like to Lobster boil'd the Morn,</l>
               <l>From Black to Red began to turn.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Now, according to Mr. <hi>Ward's no-Protestant Logic,</hi> the Inference should be this; <hi>The Morning was a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and wore a black Coat; and by and by turn'd Soldier,</hi> and wore <hi>a Red one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>second Argument</hi> is as convincing. He could not be a <hi>Scholar,</hi> because he turn'd <hi>Roman</hi> before he was Nineteen Years old. As if they could not be design'd in the <hi>least thought</hi> of their <hi>Father</hi> for Scholars, before the Clock struck the third Quarter before Nineteen.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55374:4"/>
Ay, but in <hi>his third Argument,</hi> he says, his <hi>Father</hi> had never the <hi>least thought of sending him to Cambridge, or any other Protestant University;</hi> and here's your <hi>Catholic</hi> indeed. He is already like a <hi>Saint,</hi> or an <hi>Angel;</hi> for he can know his <hi>Fathers</hi> thoughts, his <hi>least thoughts,</hi> tho' as little as F. <hi>D's Mustard seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it was not in his <hi>Fathers thoughts,</hi> I wish it had; for then he might have learn'd better <hi>Divinity,</hi> than in his <hi>Speculum,</hi> and better <hi>Manners,</hi> than in his <hi>Duel</hi> and <hi>Letter.</hi> He would have been taught not to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd his <hi>Father</hi> publickly, for <hi>withdrawing</hi> his kindness, because he embrac'd the <hi>Catholic Faith.</hi> Nor revil'd him as a <hi>Calvinist</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> which Names, whatsoever they signisy, are us'd by him as terms of <hi>dishonour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>his last Argument</hi> will do the business effectually; he is musing about Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s way of <hi>Certificates,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> took his way of <hi>Quotations.</hi> If he had (he says) <hi>but time to write into Yorkshire</hi> [to send Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the <hi>North,</hi> as Mr. <hi>P.</hi> says, Dr. <hi>T's</hi> Party did] he could prove by <hi>hundreds</hi> of <hi>Witnesses, that he was a Catholic before he was Nineteen Years of Age, and has remain'd a Catholic other Nineteen Years.</hi> He has here obliged us with an Account of his Age, and we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe him than trouble him to send into <hi>Yorkshire</hi> for a Certificate out of the <hi>Register.</hi> But for his <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds there,</hi> how can they certifie, what he has always been in their absence? for Men <hi>are given to change.</hi> They must have had some better <hi>Prospective-glass</hi> than he has made, to discern him always so clearly at such a distance. And, for his <hi>Certificates,</hi> if he be not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at them than Mr. <hi>P. whose 22, or 23 Witnesses,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55374:5"/>
prove him to have come but with <hi>One</hi> to the Conference (whilst that <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>He</hi> came in with many) he may save the charge of the Postage. There is (they say) a Book in the Press, in which 'tis shown, that Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s <hi>Certificates</hi> stand in need of being Certified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>But why is all this stir made by Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> to prove he was not <hi>in the way of being bred a Scholar?</hi> Let a Man but read his <hi>Letter,</hi> his <hi>Duel,</hi> his <hi>Speculum,</hi> and he will need no further proof: Nay, let him read but the first half line <q>[You and your <hi>A. B. <hi>ha's</hi>
                  </hi>]</q> and he will be convinc'd, that he is no better at <hi>English</hi> than at turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Latin</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> as in his <hi>Title?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, it seems, he is a Man of <hi>Note,</hi> and great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry has been made after him. There came no less than <hi>Two at one time,</hi> who ask'd, What he did? What he writ? Whether he had been an <hi>Oxford Scholar or no?</hi> A most material Man; there is mighty seeking after <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Works.</hi> Where dwells the Maker of <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glasses? Ecclesiastical Looking glasses?</hi> otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Prospective-glasses?</hi> The Man who can furnish a <hi>Material Jesuit</hi> with Accoutrements for a <hi>Conference?</hi> 'Tis now most certain, they were of D. <hi>T's</hi> sending, because they ask'd, whether he were not of <hi>Oxford,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause D. <hi>T.</hi> had heard a report, that his <hi>Father had a design to prepare him for Cambridge.</hi> To that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, as likewise to that of <hi>Oxford, Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> have sent their Children, before and since the Kings Return; and they have proved very eminent Men both for Learning and Piety in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55374:5"/>That which remains, concerns your <hi>Writing,</hi> of which he will make <hi>D. T.</hi> to be the Author, tho he wrote only a Letter to you. These <hi>Prospective glass-men</hi> have a marvellous Art; They can see one person, and make him another: He loves you dearly because you write your self <hi>A.

P.</hi> of <hi>Peterhouse.</hi> He quarrels with you, because you will not call <hi>Apostrophes, Prayers;</hi> he is angry again, because you quote not the places of your Authors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' you do it; for Example sake, to go no further than Councils, [<hi>Speculum Ecclesiasticum Considered,</hi>] pag. 11. <hi>Concil.

The denyal of this is so palpable a falshood, that if he persists in it, he wants <hi>two Virtues,</hi> which I wish him.</p>
            <p>Again, he is offended, that <hi>you have not taken the least notice of the Testimonies of Holy Scripture, and would not confute them;</hi> tho you told him (<hi>p.</hi> 48.) <q>[The proofs of Scripture I shall not consider, because they are either wholly impertinent, or have been often An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by the Writers of our Church.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, when a reason is given him, he has the dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of taking no notice of it, and then of making a great Complaint about it: But his great grievance, and that which he opens first, is, the Confutation of his Mannerly and Learned Pamphlet called the <hi>Duell;</hi> (for he is all for Metaphors in <hi>Titles:</hi>) The Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it <hi>before he had Published it.</hi> He was doing it, and may go on when he pleases; but that it was not done, till an account was given of it to <hi>A.

by him, was not from his want of will, who had <hi>Scor'd</hi> it for the Press, and had it Cross'd and Corrected with puttings out and puttings in, and then met with a most unexpected delay. But Sir, if a man has his Sword ready to hurt you, and Malice in his heart, and you break it before he can draw, I am <hi>Casuist</hi> enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that you are upon just Self-defence.</p>
            <p>Thus I have thrown away an hour upon him, and when you have nothing at all to do, you may spend your time this way, if you please, which is next to that in the expedient in <hi>Ovid,</hi>

            <head>THE Roman Catholick Souldier's LETTER TO Dr. THO. TENISON.</head>
            <p>You and your <hi>A. B.</hi> has publish'd a <hi>Reply</hi> to my <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Speculum,</hi> before I either Printed or Published any such thing. This is not to stay till all the Muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Roll be call'd over before you answer to your Name, as you say Mr. <hi>P.</hi> would have had you to have done; but 'tis every whit as absurd; for 'tis to cry <hi>I am here, I am here,</hi> before ever you be call'd. This is a strange and unheard of way of proceeding.</p>
            <p>You write an Epistle to your <hi>A.</hi> B. in which you tell him and the World, that I was a <hi>Cambridge</hi> Scholar, and has chang'd my Black Coat for a Red one; I am sorry you have gotten no better Information from your Enquiries after me at my Lodging, there having been no less than Two Men at one time, and Four at another (whether sent by you or no, I will not say) making <hi>Enquiries</hi> of me at my Quarters, what I was? whether I had been an <hi>Oxford</hi> Scholar or no? was I no more than a Souldier? what I did? what I writ? with such like <hi>Queries,</hi> to which the good people of the House could give them little or no Answer, (as they told me) other than this, that they told some of them I was writing something concerning your Reverence, but they knew not what. Indeed Dr. your Oracles has deceiv'd you, and you have abus'd me by writing such palpable and false untruths of me. For so far off was my thoughts from ever being either a <hi>Cambridge</hi> Scholar, or wearing a Clergy-Mans Black Coat, that on the contrary, I was a <hi>Catholick</hi> before I was 19 years of Age, and (God Almighty be prais'd) have remain'd a <hi>Catholick</hi> ever since, which is now other 19 years, which if I had but time to write into <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> I could prove by hundreds of Witnesses; nor had my Father (being a <hi>Calvinist</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi>) ever the least
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55374:7"/>
thought of sending me to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> or any other <hi>Protestant</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, but rather of putting me to an Attorney, or some such like Employ, till I lost his kindness by Embracing the Holy <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you have mist the mark exceedingly, by saying I was, or ever was intended for a <hi>Cambridge</hi> Scholar, or had a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mans Black Coat to change for a Military Red one. This story's just like your Jesuits with yellow Peruicks and little Bands, and the sholes of Men that throng'd in with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, when he has prov'd by 22 or 23 Witnesses, that he brought but one Man with him, and he was neither a Priest, nor came to Dispute, but only to be a Witness of what passed. If you go on at this rate, 'twill be time for Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> to look about him, you'd darken his lusture quite. What can we expect from the rest of your Pamphlet, (call'd your <hi>Considerations on the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Ecclesiasticum</hi>) when you entertain us with such a Whisker at the first? may we not guess what you have in your Shop, by what you hang out of the Window? If you would have had us given credit to your following Consideration, (<hi>as you term it</hi>) you should not have begun with so gross an untruth. Therefore whatever we find in your Pamphlet deliver'd from your own word, without sufficient proof, you must excuse us if we do not nor cannot believe it.</p>
            <p>I had not time to take much notice of your Pamphlet, only this I observ'd that you have found out a ready way to Confute the Fathers: That is, either by calling their Works Spurious and suppositious, making a great shew with the Names of your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but taking care not to Cite the places where any of their words may be found: Or else, reckoning the Fathers words no other than <hi>Historical Apostrophes,</hi> p. 69. <hi>Complements to the Pope, meer Complements,</hi> p. 52. <hi>meer Rhetorical Flights, Rhetorical Apostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi> p. 62. presuming to tell us, that <hi>Orators</hi> (meaning the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> for of them you are speaking) <hi>seldom contains themselves within the severe bounds of Truths,</hi> p. 63. [well said Doctor!] nor have you taken the least notice of the Testimonies of Holy Scripture; why did you not Confute them also?</p>
            <p>What I have to say more Dr. is to advise you to wrap up your next of this nature a little closer than you have done this, or those against Mr. <hi>P.</hi>
