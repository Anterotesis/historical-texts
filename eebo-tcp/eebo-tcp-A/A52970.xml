         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At the Kings Royall Court at Holm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
betwixt the Kings most Excellent Majesty,
and Mr. Marshall, and Mr. Caryll.</head>
            <p>THe Parliament of Scotland have sate
very close, about the disposall of His
Majesties Royall Person, and his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Reigne and Government of himselfe
and his Royall Posterity, which indeed is a
thing of high concernment and very much
desired, by his Majesties Subjects within the
Kingdome of England: their hearts relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
untill the time of expitation, of the
great businesse now in dispence, betweene
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60058:3"/>
the Soveraigne and the Subject; their eyes
being fully fixed upon this State-Object,
longing to see that happy day of the joyfull
returne of their Gracious Soveraigne, to his
Tribunall Throne at London.</p>
            <p>For, the accomplishing of these their long-wished
desires, His Majesties loyall Subjects, (the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of both Kingdomes) doe likewise endeavour
to bring to a speedy period, and instant of time; if so
be, his gracious Majesty would be pleased, to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the faithfull advice of His two great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
by signing the Propositions, and taking the
Covenant, that so the distractions of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> may be fully composed, and the purity of
Religion firmely established, within His Majesties
Realmes and Dominions.</p>
            <p>And to this end, the Estates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> do freely
and unanimously concurre with the Parliament of
<hi>England,</hi> for the humble advising of his Majesty to
condiscend to these their Propositions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That his Majesty would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
(no longer to continue in this adverse
way) but to unite himselfe with them,
and to give his Royall assent for the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Propositions; that so, all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences

Realmes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That his Majestie would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
pleased to unite his Royall heart
with his Subjects of both Kingdomes, by
taking that blessed Covenant, first drawn
up, by the divine will and pleasure of the
great Iehovah, in the highest Throne,
and here confirmed upon Earth, (by his
omnipotent power) for the finishing of his
great Worke; that so the purity and light
of his Gospell, might spring and grow up,
both in the hearts of Prince and People,
and shine in all lustre, throughout the
Realmes of England and Scotland.</p>
            <p>3. That his Majesty would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to embrace these their humble and
loyall Desires, by signing the Propositions
and taking the Covenant, His Subjects
of Scotland do declare, that his gracious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60058:4"/>
Majesty and his Royall Posterity, should
not suffer in the least, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And for the further effecting of this gallant worke,
no meanes and waies is unsought by the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

to heare that tryumphant sound, and melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Eccho, of his Majesties concurrence with his
great Councells, by setting his Royall hand to signe
