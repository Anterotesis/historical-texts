            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

In these difficulties, your case is the more lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ye are drawn under the displeasure of high authoritye, which, next to God ye would fainest please, &amp; under the dislike of some Peers, and Iudges of the land, hauing such particular care to their owne charges, giuing them small leasure to sound the depth of ecclesiastical contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, &amp; only for a matter of conformitie, that known enemy to the vnitie and peace of the kirks
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16810:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Christ in all the world, where it hath found credit. And surely your griefe must be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that in the day of your sorrow the wise men of your own mind are silent and slack for your help, and your great opposites in this distressed cause, your neerest friends, and old acquaintance, but without equall reason on their part, or iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert on yours. Who would not be pierced in heart with the pittifull lookes of your wearied counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as at the last gaspe of your wonted since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and chearfull constancie. In this againe, if you be left to your selfe, affliction is added to the afflicted, and our mother the Kirke, and her mother the Truth are forsaken. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this strait, if any friends of a willing minde shall timously contribute to your comfort, some <hi>Doeg,</hi> or some <hi>Amazia</hi> is euer ready with their biting censure, and check of high presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But praised be the Lord, there is no small number of religious and honest men in the kirke and common-weale, and the hearts of all are in the hands of the Lord, who may at his pleasure moue any that hath the tongue of the learned to speake a word in season to you that are wearie, also dispose your friends and brethren of their old ingenuitie, and tender compassion of your blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heart, by their holy wisedome to remoue your doubts, confirme your faith, and helpe you to be perswaded in your owne minde, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise

you rather now to hold fast that which you haue heard and receiued, then afterward with vntimous repentance to change their tune, and stile, as if you were not a brother, but an aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and Apostate, if it shall happen, as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that you be driven from the bright candle of your knowne profession to the deepe darknesse of an unknowne way, and by that unhappy change so much the more blinded, as your light hath been greater, and with the purest Ivorie turned with fire into saddest black, or shal be mis-shapen in a new face, stained with the contempt of your first puritie, and blushing at the disparagement of your new forme. A vile confusion that cannot bee eschewed if you shall suffer your selfe to bee drawne back againe to the deformities for iust causes casten out of the kirk, and from that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reformation, which you haue before held, and with ioy so long professed, and vpon no better warrant then a bare example, and very authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mens names, although for the time fathers and favourers of your profession, but after long standing now suddenly moved, and so taken with the novelties of the time, that for ioyning with them, they dare not onely separate from their old masters and fellow brethren, but from themselues, in respect of that which they were. And yet in this maine current some way to be excused by their embarking like simple men in a warre ship,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16810:4"/>
and miserable mistaking of these base additions, to be layd downe againe when it should please them like good schollers to returne to their owne masters, the standard-bearers in our faith, with imagined liberty, not onely to concurre, but to confirme and encourage their owne brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh for the advancement of the interrupted worke of the ministry and edification of the body of Christ, as they are bound in conscience and calling.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Resolution to suffer required</note>But howsoever men haue been inclined to giue place to the streame of the time, yet from the day that the kirk hath been crossed, and many of all sorts grievously afflicted with the perturbations daily arising about the violent inbringing of these intrused alterations: neverthelesse you haue found some sweet refreshment under the shadow of a heavenly dispensation so ruling the pathes of these proceedings, that you haue kept the truth, suffered reproches and discredit with patience in standing against these misliked novelties so long as they remained without the compasse of your owne practise, esteeming your particular losses contented gain, and your iniuries excusable for keeping the liberties of Gods service, and the secret ioy of your owne conscience to be brooked by your quiet carriage, and sober conversation. But now if the day of that poore ease be passed, and patient walking can haue no further fauour,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16810:4"/>
and if you shall be drawen out to a publick stage before the Lord, who would keepe you to be his witnesse, and in the eyes of men, who would gain you to be their disciples, you must needs by your owne practise either shamefully recant, or honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesse the religion wherein you haue stood. Choose you this day whether with humbled <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her</hi> you will wisely resolue to proue constant, and glad the hearts of many people, by cleaving to that way wherein you haue found the Saviour with his blessings and benefits of all sorts; or if you will against your owne experience of Gods favour to you, and hard successe seene upon these novations, where they haue beene most greedily embraced, hazard by your vnseasonable example to giue occasion of stumbling to many, and to loose the patience and labours of your former constancie, and now like <hi>Peter</hi> overwhelmed with feare, adventure to seek your comfort, and quietnesse in the sway of time, as though the Lord could be syled, as <hi>Absolom</hi> was with <hi>Chusayes</hi> policie. If you dare suffer committing your soule to the will of God, as vnto a faithfull Creator, it is his place to temper the cuppe of all your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and when he shall be pleased to try and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine your matter before the highest barre. But if you shall deny before men the Lord, and his truth once received, he will deny you before his heavenly father, and will not deliver you from

the houre of temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Impediments arising from other mens persons remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note>It may be that you find not such throng in the narrow way of suffering, as in the broad way of common profession, when religion dwelt in the pleasant land of peace in Halcyone dayes like the Spouse of Christ commanding all, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to none. For you must thinke, that many looke well in their owne climate, that haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head nor health to crosse the line, and many goe brauely with guilded swords about their owne doores, who flye the campe, and dare not face the Cannon. To beleeue in Christ is a great gift, not common to all, but to suffer for his sake is a greater, and given to few. Perhaps it may be, that many living by gesse, and more ready upon their own respects to professe, then carefull to be informed in a truth, and no small number of silly spirits by giuing credit to others, and misled in the by-paths of errour, &amp; some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Camelion-like hypocrites inclined to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the colour of every occasionall profession, when they shall see the world to frowne, may take another way. But pitie them, &amp; spare them, praise God for his favour to you, and increase of faith, and patience, and let no gall, and bitternes of speech, scarcely becomming the witnesse of a truth, make any of whatsoever sort lesse inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to returne to you, and your way, who by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of their former proceedings, in a different
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16810:5"/>
course, may be recalled to loue and honor both you and your way. The Apostles traine may suffice you. <hi>If Christ be on your side, who can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you?</hi> You are debter to him that hath guided the steps of your soule, &amp; all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you to praise him, because in these contentions you haue done what you could in defense of the truth, and haue kept it, and never wronged any man in any matter; so that if it be the pleasure of God you shall suffer, it is because you dare not forsake a knowne truth, whereby you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many rich comforts, and looketh for to reape endlesse ioy, esteeming it your dutie to cleaue to that which is called in question, as well as to the rest, which seem to be spared: for your encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you haue a worthy cause to honor you, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reasons to defend you, and the experience of your owne conscience to uphold you.</p>

               <note place="margin">Impediments arising from the qualitie of the cause removed.</note>It is true that your large course is so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered, that nothing is permitted to appeare at this time, but a smal point, the gesture of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the communion, and receving out of the ministers hand with such as shall bee at table, vpon the festivall day appointed. Yet you must thinke of these particulars, as of members of the grosse bodie of conformitie, obscuring the frame of Reformation delivered vnto you by the Fathers, who begat you in the Lord, to bee kept in integritie for your owne use,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16810:6"/>
and for the instruction and comfort of your suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. For you cannot deny, but you haue seene your mother the kirk in her gayest dresse, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly setled vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, and strongly fortified with faire confessions, her badges famous in the world, and most meet for keeping vnity among her members in doctrine, sacraments, kirke-service, discipline, and in the holy ministrie, and for abiuring of all poysonable superstition, and damnable confusion. And with no small joy haue you beheld her watchmen assembled in her sacred meetings for managing her affairs, according to the will of her Lord, and for that effect strongly fenced with liberties &amp; privileges, the royal testimonies of his Maiesties loue for strengthening her jurisdiction, and furtherance of all her causes. How happy were these dayes, when her painfull Shepheards were knit together in one minde and judgement with mutuall encouragements, all feeding their flockes, and pleasantly marching against all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without exception, as an army with banners. How bright were then the starres, and how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull the candlestickes? But now alas you are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to behold bold mints to draw her off the old foundation to the sandy heapes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wisedome, her renowned confessions of faith, the strong barres of her vnitie aforenamed without just cause reproved, and layd aside, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16810:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doctrine distempered with the vnsavorie mixture of mans learning, and presented to the people without relish of the Word and Spirit, like an egge without salt to a man of a sound taste, yea of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with spleene so misapplied against Christians for furthering of mens particulars, and worldly projects, that hearing bringeth no lesse griefe then edification. By new additions &amp; mutations both the sacraments are made vncouth, and distastfull to many a poore Christian fearing to offend God by passing beyond the measure of their own faith, if they should receiue any thing in the sacraments not delivered by the Lord. The necessarie disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and necessarie vse of the same for purging &amp; preservation, as behoveful for the kirk as phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick for a mans body, diseased, weakned, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most rejected. The holy ministry transformed, rent, and divided by a swelling humour over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running that somtime solid body, and restraining the members thereof from their proper functions; the kirke-service, prayers, and other exercises, atled to a new mould, and as farre from former edification, as pitifully diseased with the daily fits of restlesse change; the prerogatiue of the Lords day, and due sanctification thereof misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly brought low by setting vp of other dayes of extraordinary respect to be observed with festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall solemnities, the jurisdiction, liberties, and priviledges of the kirke her comfortable, and

awfull assemblies, with the whole pretious sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance so wounded and made pale, for setting vp of some silly circumstances, and that with great losse of concord and quietnesse among all the members of the kirke, and no small gaine to superstition, confusion and prophannesse. And this is the cause moving you to like the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the kirke, and to refuse the novations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, as they are prejudiciall in part or in whole to the religion and order formerlie esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16810:10"/>
dissention betwixt you and them, ariseth from the fifth article, anent a Table, and the necessarie vse of it. For the sacrament, yee holding that it is necessarie for the eating and drinking the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall elements, both for the exercise of your faith toward God, &amp; charitie among your selues, is necessarily required in that sacramentall and heavenly banquet, and they thinking it onely commodious for the people to kneele at in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the sacrament, and others neither neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nor commodious, but a meere Metaphore. But you doe well, that beleeue, that there was a Table at Christs supper, as certainly as the hand of him that betrayed him was with him at the Table, and as truly for vse as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tearmeth the sacrament by the name of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord,</hi> which Table by some Fathers is called the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> and by others the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> a fit meane to represent our vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with Christ, and among our selues in this life. <hi>Thou doest prepare a Table before me in the sight of my adversaries:</hi> and in the life to come, <hi>I haue appointed to you a kingdome, that ye may eate and drink at my table in my kingdome;</hi> which mysterie of spirituall fellowship can no wise be so well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrate, nor so sensibly perceiued of any belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Christian by a common Table in any mans house whosoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:16810:10"/>
               <note place="margin">The second difference.</note>The second controversie betwixt you &amp; them ariseth from the sixth Article; yee holding that Christ and his disciples sate at Table, and they obscuring that assertion by alledging of a forme of sitting used by Christ different from your forme, and by their law of indifferent things rejecting all forme of sitting, and bringing in kneeling as a more humble and convenient gesture for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, then Christ vsed. By vertue of the first Article, binding you to Christs patterne, as you are bound by the Prophet to bee taught of God, and consequently not to teach God, so by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles precept, you should be a follower of Christ, and not a reformer either of his practise, or insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution conforme thereto. And, as for the diversity of formes of sitting, neither kneeling nor stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being opposite gestures to sitting, can haue the name of sitting, and consequently Christs sitting was no sort of kneeling. As for the alledged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie, it is taken away by Christs free choyce of sitting expressed in his owne practise, when he was neither straited by any occasion, compulsion, or other inclining cause, but at his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie might haue kneeled, it pleased him in his owne wisedome to choose sitting, as the meetest gesture for his communicants. As for the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of kneeling aboue your humility of sitting, we haue no great warrant in the word: for there, sitting is vsed in preaching, in praying, &amp; in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16810:11"/>
sacrament, but kneeling onely in prayer. And yet Christ in his agonie vsed for a more humble forme, falling on the ground upon his face. Of the three gestures used by the Christian world in religious worship, sitting, standing, and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Christ did choose sitting. And if a choyce were to be made of any of the three, kneeling for us is most dangerous, being the outward badge of their confession, who contrary to our faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Christ to be bodily present, either by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, consubstantiation, or some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne maner, as also it being the formall adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a person, and not a signe of reverence to be giuen to the sacramentall elements, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing which moved the Schoolemen to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that if there remained the substance of bread after the consecration, the people would therefore take occasion of Idolatry, and in stead of Christs body would giue godly worship to the bread, and for avoiding of that idolatry, they thought best to remoue away the bread, and bring in transubstantiation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third difference.</note>Thirdly, ye differ from them about the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the bread, you holding that Christ gaue it to them that were next him, and the disciples divided it among themselues; and they holding that it should be given by the minister his hand delivering it immediatly into the hand of every single person there present to receiue the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16810:11"/>
Your practise, as it is conforme to the order of the sacrament, observed in this kirk since refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation began, so it is most conform to the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order of Christs actions and forme of words, as they are set down in the eight article. But their assertion &amp; practise anent distribution, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agree with the order of Christs actions, the forme of his words, nor the practise of this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med kirk. As for the order of Christs actions, for preparation of the bread, he doth three things, he took it, he blessed it, he brake it, which of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must be understood to be a mystical fraction. And being thus prepared, as he took the bread for them, he exhibiteth, and giveth it to them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be assured to haue good right to that bread, and being thus prepared, and made theirs, he giveth a generall commandement to them all to take it, and for the particular form of their tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they should divide it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ng themselues, according to the direction set downe in <hi>Luke</hi> for the right vse of the cup, <hi>Divide it among your selues;</hi> which forme of distribution for exercise of brotherly loue, is as necessarie to be vsed upon the bread, as upon the cup. And if by the act of giving the distribuoion of the cup were perfected by Christ, giving <hi>sigillatim</hi> to every single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and their sole receiving of it immediatly out of his hand, what could be the use of the generall commandement, <hi>Divide it among you?</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:16810:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And to ascribe one sence to the act of giving the Cuppe, and another of the bread, and to thinke that the Apostles could boldly take the one or the other, not knowing what right they had to it, or what it was, it were amisse to think. And if the practise of kirkes were a sufficicient rule, in sundry kirkes, in sundry ages, the Deacon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the sacrament to the people.</p>

By that sort of rusticitie, and want of devotion, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion table that in primitiue times stood in the middest of the kirke, was separate from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation by a Chancellarie, since from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the kirke to the east end, which was called the Quier, then the minister and table both was separate from the people, the table turned into an altar, the sacrament into a sacrifice, the cup sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply removed from the people, and the bread also by transubstantiation, or some other way.
