         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER,</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>Williams,</hi> Lord Arch-bishop of
<hi>York</hi> made an accurate Speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to defend the rights of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
and the learned Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> made
an abstract of his reasons, against which
Doctor <hi>Burgesse</hi> published an Examination,
wherein there is little material, if once the
principal doubt be cleared, whether Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
had anciently Votes in Parliament,
and were Barons, or that which is equal, or
superiour unto Barons, being accounted
<hi>Thanes,</hi> in the times of the Saxons, before
the Conquest: which I hope is so fully
cleared in this following discourse, as there
will be little question remaining. Though
Parliaments began, as our Histories shew,
long after the Conquest, in this manner
as now they are held, yet they had Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<hi>(Gemots)</hi> of the Estates and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
nobility, whereof the Bishops and
Clergy were alwayes an eminent party, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws and Custome of those
times, and equivalent in authority to our
<pb facs="tcp:66402:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Parliament. They had several <hi>Gemots,</hi> as
the first was.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning Government Ecclesiastical and Civil in the
State of Nature, from Adam till Moses, which
was about 2500 years. The same person was both
cheif Magistrate and also Priest unto God.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD had a Priesthood alwayes from
the Beginning of the World, to

a Priest unto God, to offer Sacrifice,
and to execute such duties as God
required in his Service: But <hi>Adam</hi>
was also a King or Chief Ruler, over
all his Children and Posterity. So
after <hi>Adam, Seth,</hi> and the tighteous Patriarchs, <hi>Enoch</hi>
and others, were Priests unto God, as well as Princes, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66402:6"/>
Magistrates, and they taught <hi>Noah</hi> how to call upon God,
and how to serve him.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Noah</hi> was also a Prince, and also a Preacher of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
as the Apostle saith of him, so that it was not
incompatible, or inconsistent for the same man to be a
Magistrate, Prince, or Governour, and also a Priest.
<hi>Melchisedech,</hi> after the Flood, was the first that was
called a King and a Priest: and so Christ is a King and a
Priest after his order. So that under the Law of Nature,
Kings were invested with a power Ecclesiasticall; both of
Order and Jurisdiction: Therefore these things are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
by Nature; and thus it continued for the space
of 2500. years from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Princes and Priests were formerly the same, both Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

               <p>The Priviledges which in the Law of Nature followed
the Birth-right, were these three. First, the Government
or Principality. Secondly, the Priesthood. Thirdly, a
Portion answerable to maintain these dignities.</p>
               <p>The same light may appear, though much darkned in
the ancient Government of the Heathen; for Heathen
Kings are witnessed in old times, to have been Priests of such
Gods as they served, which ancient combining of these two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66402:6"/>
offices, in one person, came from the ancien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> practise in
the time of the Law of Nature, and from the light of
Nature was received among the Heathens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Priest in his own Family, and in several
places of his Peregrination, he built Altars, and places,
where he did call upon God, and perform all duties of Gods
Worship then requisite. <hi>Abraham</hi> did offer Sacrifice, as
appears <hi>Gen. 15, 9. &amp; 22, 7. 2, 7, 8. Abraham</hi> was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 7. and received many promises from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
especially concerning Christ to descend of him; and God
gave him the Sacrament of Circumcision, and established
his Covenant with him. God saith of him, <hi>Gen 18. 19.
I know him, that he will command his Children, and his Houshold
after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice
and judgement,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, so likewise did <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, who built Altars unto God, which was as much then
as to build a Church in these dayes, and to provide a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to preach, and pray, and administer the Sacraments,
and perform all other duties of a Pastor.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears fully, that in the time of Nature, there
was not two several jurisdictions, one Ecclesiastical, the
other Civil, as is now among us. But the same persons,
discharged both Offices, and all Duties belonging to them.</p>
               <p>And further it appears, that the priests being the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
and chief men, had such honourable respect and
maintenance, that they were not reckoned among the
lowest of the people, and made the off-scowring of all
things as now they are.</p>
               <p>If the Clergy may not enjoy any temporal office, or
dignity, they will be crushed down, and oppressed in all
publick occasions, as they find it manifestly in these trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
times, when the neighbours of every parish do impose
all Taxes, Burdens, and Charges upon Ministers, more then
they formerly used to do, or in reason can be allowed. But
the Clergy have no means to help themselves, having none
of their own tribe in authority, power, or place of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
as formerly they had, whereby they could help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and restrain the Lay-men from imposing Burdens,
<pb facs="tcp:66402:7"/>
and charges upon them in excessive manner. It is easie to
shew particular instances, and one of many shall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>When all the Judges of the Land, about 20. years agoe,
had given their opinions and directions in writing, upon
particular doubts to Justices of peace, incident to their
offices; one doubt was, how much, and in what proportion
a Minister should be charged for Levies to the poor. The
Justices in the Country, and the Neighbours of the parish,
would taxe the Glebes severally from the Tithes, and so
augment the Levy to a great proportion, both for Glebe and
Tythes: But the Judges appointed in their answer, that Glebe
and Tithes should be both taxed together, at a tenth part of
the Levy, in regard Tythes are abated much by small rares,
and much Land is discharged of Tythes in kind. But now in
these troubles, the Committee-men, and such like, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Taxes, upon the Glebes severally, and Tythes also,
imposing a sixth, or seventh part of the Taxe upon the
Tithes, which is contrary to the resolution of the Judges.
But Ministers have no remedy to help themselves, there
being none of the Clergy upon the Bench in any authority.</p>

about 1500 years. That there were not two several

Whatsoever Lawes he gave, either moral, ceremonial

<hi>Moses,</hi> and no man could better understand them then the
Priests and Levites. For <hi>God made his Covenant with</hi> Levy,

Law at his Mouth.</hi> Mal. 2. 5, 6, 7. and so <hi>Ezekiel 44. 23.
They shall teach my people the difference between the Holy and

shall judge according to my Iudgements, and they shall keep my
Lawes, and my Statutes, in all mine Assemblies.</hi> They being
the principal Judges and Lawyers in that Common-wealth,
of Gods own Constitution. And whereas it is now gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on all hands, that there were three Courts of Justice
in that Kingdome. 1. The great Council of the 70. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
2. The Court of Judgement, which was in in every
good Town where there were many families. 3. The
Court of three, or some few more. The Priests and Levites,
were principal men, both Judges and Officers in all
Courts, <hi>Scophtim &amp; Scoterim,</hi> as 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 4. both to
give sentence and judgement, and also to execute the same:
So the Divines do affirm in their late Annotations upon
1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30. &amp; 2. Chron. 19. 8. 11. They did study the

to order divine and humane affairs. And they held also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
honourable offices, for we read that <hi>Zechariah</hi> a Levite,

and the half Tribe of <hi>Manasses, for every matter pertaining
to God and affairs of the King.</hi> v. 31. 32. Whereby it manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears, that the same Judges, and Officers, being
Priests and Levites, most of them did hear and determine
all sorts of causes, pertaining to God and affairs of the
King, both Ecclesiastical and Temporal; so that there was
not several Courts, the one Ecclesiastical, and the other
Civil, as in these times, some do affirm too peremptorily,
according to the Common practise, and usage of these days,
as <hi>Godwin</hi> in his <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron lib. 5. Beza, Iunius,</hi> and
divers others, with the Kirkmen of <hi>Scotland</hi> lately, <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Gillespie, Baily,</hi> and others. So also the <hi>Papists</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
who that they may establish the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy,
above Kings and their Common-laws, do affirm, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen
Ecclesiasticum est distinctum a politico.</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine de
Romano pontifice lib.</hi> 1. cap. 5. so our zealous party for the like
ends and reasons, would maintain a Government in the
Clergy, seperate from, and independent upon the Civill
Magistrate, and such as ought to be directed and ruled only
by the word of God, and his Spirit, ruling (as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
in their classical Assemblies; where they think the
Throne of Christ is only to be advanced, and all his holy
Ordinances put in execution.</p>
               <p>Whereas the King is <hi>Custos utriusqne tabulae,</hi> and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
in causes Ecclesiastical, as well as Temporal, is
acknowledged by our Statutes, and annexed to the Crown.
For Execution thereof, an Act was made 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But if the Statute had not been made to annexe the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
to the Crown, yet as the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> saith, 4. <hi>Instit.

him, as great and ample Supremacy and Jurisdiction Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,

that had justly and rightly pertained to them by divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66402:8"/>
Acts, and by the ancient Law of <hi>England,</hi> if the said
clause of annexation in the said Statute 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> had never
been inserted.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Iohn Pym</hi> in his Speech in Parliament 4. <hi>Caroli,</hi> as
<hi>Rushworth</hi> hath it in his late Collections, saith, that the
high Commission was derived from the <hi>Parliament.</hi>]<note place="margin">Pag. 659.</note> As
if the Parliament gave the King the Supremacy as a gift of
their own, and that it was not vested in the Crown; but as
they gave it, so they may take it away when they please,
and suppresse the Court of high Commission, as they have
done; The duty of the Court was, <hi>to reform and correct all
Heresies, Schismes, Abuses, Offences, Contempts, and Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi>
But now upon Suppression of the Court, all Heresies
and Schismes in the world are broke out, and such abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
abuses, offences, and enormities, as never were known
in this Kingdome, with allowance and toleration.</p>
               <p>This follow's upon the new light and doctrine of <hi>Iohn
Pym,</hi> and all the rest of the Presbyterians who have stirred
up all these troubles, and of late they called the House of

                  <hi>It was a great Error of</hi> Calvin <hi>and</hi> Beza, <hi>and many others

I will take off the Spirit that is upon thee, and put it on him, <hi>as

               <p>So upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8. 9. 10. Where the Priests and Levites
were appointed Judges in great matters, <hi>between blood and
blood, between Plea and Plea,</hi> and <hi>between stroke and stroke,
being matters of Controversie within thy gates:] Calvin</hi> doth so
interpret, as if the Priests and Levites were only to expound
the Law to the Temporal Judges, but not to sit as Judges
upon the bench themselves with especial authority, as
the other Elders and Judges did. Wherein he was much
mistaken. For the Priests and Levites were principal Judges
in all matters, and causes whatsoever, not only Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

of great authority in our Kingdome, especially for making
of Laws and Constitutions of all kinds, and executing of
them, which is manifest by all the Laws themselves of the

This Court consisteth of the Kings Majesty,
sitting there, as in his Royal politick capacity,
and of the three estates of the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Are the Lords Spiritual, Arch-bishops
and Bishops, being in number 26. who sit there
by Succession, in respect of their Counties or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies,
parcel of their Bishopricks, which they
hold also in their politick Capacity. And every
one of these, when any Parliament is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
ought <hi>ex debito justitiae</hi> to have a Writ of
Summons.</p>
               <p>2. The Lords Temporal, Dukes, Marques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Earls, Uiscounts, and Barons, who sit
there by reason of their dignities, which they hold
by Descent, or Creation, in number at this time
106. and likewise every one of these, being of
full age, ought to have a Writ of Summons,
<hi>ex debito justitiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The third estate is the Commons of the
Realm, whereof there be Knights of Shires
or Counties, Citizens of Cities, and Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Burroughs; All which are respectively
elected by the Shires, or Counties, Cities and
Burroughs, by force of the Kings Writ, <hi>ex debito
justitiae.</hi> And none of them ought to be omitted,
and these represent all the Commons of the whole
Realm, and trusted for them, and are in number
at this day, 493.</p>
               <p>In the beginning, <hi>Romulus</hi> ordained a hundred
Senators for the good Government of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
afterwards they grew to 300. and
so many were of the House of Commons in <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescues</hi>

How the number of the Commons is increased to 500.
or more, let them inquire that please, perhaps the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Burgesses of Corporation, and some Towns which
the Kings have lately allowed to come unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
may be a reason of their great increase.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith,<note place="margin">4. Instit.</note> that anciently when the Parliaments
were holden at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Commons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Temple of God.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Montague</hi> against <hi>Selden cap. 1. pag.</hi> 290 saith,
that <hi>Sedet in Templo Dei,</hi> may be understood either <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter</hi>
as the great <hi>Turk</hi> doth, whose palace is that which
sometimes was the chief patriarchal Church, built by <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
the Emperor, the Church of <hi>sancta Sophia;</hi> or <hi>spiritualiter,</hi>
taking it for <hi>contra Ecclesiam Dei,</hi> by persecuting Christians <hi>in
quantum</hi> Christians, (for that they profess the name of
Christ Jesus) who are the living Temples of the Holy
Ghost,—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</p>
               <p>The Bishops presence and voting in the Parliaments,
may well seem necessary in these times, when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth undertake to determine Controversies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the greatest difficulty, as of <hi>predestination, absolute
Reprobation, universal Grace, Free-will,</hi> and <hi>final perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Eliott,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Pym,</hi> zealous men in Religion,
would not yield to the King (40 <hi>Caroli)</hi> Tunnage and
Poundage till they had first setled Religion, touching the
points of <hi>Ariminianisme;</hi> they accounting that <hi>Arminius</hi> was
an upstart Heretick, very dangerous to the truth; as <hi>Rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
relateth in his Collections. <hi>p.</hi> 659.</p>
               <p>Now if Parliaments will undertake to dispute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
such great and difficult points of Religion, as of
<hi>Predestination, absolute Reprobation, universal Grace, Free-will,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:66402:13"/>
and <hi>final perseverance;</hi> It is fit that the learned Bishops
should have power to vote in such difficult matters, of so
great Concernment, as well as any Members of the House
of Lords or Commons: for it is well known that many of
the Bishops are men of excellent Learning, judgement and
abilities, as being long trained up in the Universities, and
some of them publick professors, reading Lectures in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity
and Heads of Colledges, that they might be well
informed concerning these points, or any other better then
Sir <hi>Iohn Eliott,</hi> or <hi>Iohn Pym,</hi> or any other Member of the
House of Commons, whosoever he be, or of the House of
Lords, whereof very few are learned or expert in the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
points of Gods Decrees. And whosoever is wise and
sober, will be willing to refer these matters to the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
who are a part of the Parliament, and have the same
priviledges as other Parliament men have, as Lord <hi>Cook</hi>
sheweth, 4. <hi>Instit. cap. 74. pap. 322. &amp;c.—</hi>And their
proper office and duty is to debate of matters of Religion,
of Heresies, Schismes, and other like matters as Lord <hi>Cook</hi>
sheweth very fully. The Bishops being the principal men,
that Reformed our Religion, made the 39 Articles, both
the lesser and greater Catechism, Common Prayer
Book, and the Book of Ordination, the Homilies, and
whatsoever else hath been setled in Religion, so that they
are most necessary and fit to be present in all Parliaments.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Burgesse</hi> having written an examination of the reasons,
asserted by Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> and Archbishop <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>York.</hi>
And this Author having written against his examination of
the reasons, the Doctor made a further Reply. Wherein he
saith <hi>pag.</hi> 5. that if it can be made good, that in the * <hi>Wetten-Gem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the Bishops exercised a legislative
power in voting of laws, as our Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hops have done in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
the Examiner must provide him another Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;
for my part I must yeild the cause.</p>
               <p>I hope it appears clearly, by that is here alledged out of
good Authority,—that the Bishop had a legislative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in voting, and therefore by his own confession he must
yeild the cause, and contend no farther about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:66402:14"/>
There is one reason further to be considered, why the
Bishops might well be of great Authority in all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and publick Assemblies, and that is by reason of their
Learning and Knowledge in languages, and matters of Law
and policy, which they got by travail into forraign parts;
for most of them in their youth, were bred in the <hi>English
Colledge</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which was built and endowed by the
Kings of <hi>England. Ina,</hi> and many others after him, for the
education of Learned Scholars, sent thither out of <hi>England,</hi>
there being then no Universities, neither <hi>Paris,</hi> nor <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,</hi>
nor <hi>Oxon,</hi> nor <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Only <hi>Rome</hi> was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
place for Learning in these Western parts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings built the Colledge there for <hi>English</hi>
Scholars, and purchased Lands in <hi>Italy</hi> for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
thereof; and also gave the <hi>Peter-pence</hi> for their
better allowance and encouragement, which as Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi>
accounteth in his late History,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. p. 197.</note> 
                  <hi>was the sum of seven thousand
and Five hundred pounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Peter-pence was given, not as a Tribute to the
Pope, as our Common-Chronicles do grant it, and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
Virgilius,</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> but as a stipend to maintain the
<hi>English</hi> Colledge. As <hi>Spelman</hi> sheweth clearly, upon the
word <hi>Denarius St. Petri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Britanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</note> which Doctor <hi>Burgesse</hi> might have
observed better, and not have yeilded it to the Tribute
paid to the Pope, as he doth grant it. <hi>pag.</hi> 18. of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and those about him had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
the true use of them, and therefore in the Tempest
of his Indignation, swept them away among other super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
things in a Statute, but it might have been justly
continued for the first intention and purpose, to educate
learned men beyond Seas, to learn the Civil and Common
Law and forraign languages, also matters of State, who upon
their return home after some seven or eight years, would
deserve best to be preferred to publick places in Church
or State: The Kings of <hi>England</hi> well knowing the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of such learned men, did anciently, and of late, send
some choice Scholars, out of either Universities to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Countries, (as <hi>Cambden</hi> observeth, speaking of Sir
<hi>Thomas Smith, Anno 1577.) Annis maturior selectus ut in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66402:14"/>
Italiam Regiis impensis mitteretur, ad nostra enim tempora non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulli
adolescentes optimae spei, ex utraque Academia, ad uberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem
ingenii cultum Regum sumptibus, in exteris Regionibus
alebantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So was Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> in his younger years, sent abroad
by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, Sir <hi>William Paget,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi>
Sir <hi>William Peters,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Mason,</hi> these two having been
fellows of <hi>All-Souls</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon,</hi> but being further
bred abroad in forraign Countries, they gained great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and wisdome, and were made either principal
Officers or Secretaries of State at their return home,
and were principal men about the King for Counsel and
disputes of businesse, and guided the Kings Counsels in
affairs of most importance. Education in our own Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
at home, is not sufficient to enable men for all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places and offices under a King. It is well known,
that learned young men of the best sort in the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
being sent abroad to travail, when they come home
are commonly men of far better abilities then such as have
only stayed at home, as of late years Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> Sir
<hi>Isaac Wake,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Digby,</hi> Sir <hi>Clement Edmond;</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Bryan Duppa,</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> both these having
been fellows of <hi>All-Souls</hi> Colledge, and Docter <hi>Duppa</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
chosen to be the Princes Tutor, having been bred a
Civilian in his Colledge, and eminent besides for all polite
Literature, and proctor of the University, and afterwards
travailing into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> upon his return home,
it was not long before King <hi>Charles</hi> took special notice,
and made choice of him for the instruction of his three
Sons, who are now the most accomplished Princes in
Christendome, notwithstanding the late disturbance and
Rebellion of these present times, and are likely to prove
the most renowned, when the present troubles shall be
composed. Education goes beyond nature, as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
sheweth, 1. <hi>Ethic.</hi> Good instruction, and learned Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
doth add those perfections which cannot be obtained
with ordinary helps, and by such men as know only their
own native Country and Climat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66402:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The opposition that some men make against the Votes
and presence of the Bishops in Parliaments, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Office and imployment under the King, doth arise
from that false principle; that jurisdiction Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and civil, ought to be distinct and separate both for
persons and their imployments. Which is already here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
it being one grand error of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> with
divers others that follow them too closely in all opinions,
as if they had been men free from error.</p>
               <p>Our Bishops in ancient times were most part Lawyers;
learned in the Civil and Canon Laws, and thereby also know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much in the Canon Law, and therefore they were the
chiefest Judges of the Land in all Courts of Justice, as
<hi>Spelman</hi> sheweth in his learned Glossary for 200 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Conquest, reckoning the Catalogue of the great
Lord cheif Justices, being most part men of the Church, <hi>pag.
409. 410, &amp;c.—</hi> and so <hi>pag. 131. Fungebantur antique

               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Eliott</hi> in his Speech in Parliament, confesseth
that there are among our Bishops (whose profession I honour
(saith he) such as are fit to be made example for all ages, who
shine in vertue, and are firm for our Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—as
<hi>Rushworth</hi> relateth in his Collections <hi>pag.</hi> 661. If Bishops
be so eminent that they shine in vertue, certainly they are
fit men to be present in Parliaments: for Parliaments ought
to consist of such men, as shine in vertue, as are firm for
Religion.</p>
               <p>A Learned Knight and Courtier, writing an answer to
Sir <hi>Anth. Welden</hi> his Pamphlet, entituled the Court and
Character of King <hi>Iames pag.</hi> 178. where he speaketh of the
preferment of Doctor <hi>Williams</hi> to be Lord Keeper of the
great Seal, sheweth, That former ages held it more consonant
to reason, to trust the Conscience of the Clergy with the
case of the Lay-men, they best knowing a case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And anciently the civil Law was always judged
by the Ministers of the Church, and the Chancery, and Courts
of Equity, in charge of a Divine <hi>Minister.</hi> So ran that
Channel, till Sir <hi>Francis Bacons</hi> Father had it from a
Bishop; and now a Bishop had it again from <hi>Bacon.</hi> And
had King <hi>Iames</hi> lived to have effected his desires, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
had fixed firm footing in Courts of Judicature out of
the road of Common Law, and this was the true cause of
<hi>Williams</hi> Invitation thither.</p>
               <p>To prevent many Complaints and Mischiefs, there can
be no better way then to follow the Example of Gods
own chosen people of <hi>Israel,</hi> where the chief fathers of
the priests and Levites were Judges in all Courts, both high
and low, sitting together with some chief men of the other
Tribes of the Laity, as they are now called. And though
our Law be otherwise of late years, and the jurisdiction of
Courts divided, yet it was not so anciently, and the King
may put some of the Clergy in some places and Courts (at
least of Equity) as King <hi>Iames</hi> did design, if he had lived
longer, and that without any prejudice to the Law or Courts
of Justice.</p>

and all the rest, which me thinks should be enough to

poor pittances that are left unto them, being but small
fragments, in comparison of their ancient patrimony,
which the liberality and piety of the primitive times ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

conferred on them, when Charity and Piety was fervent,
and abounded with good works of all kinds; insomuch that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66402:17"/>
they thought no honour or respect too much to be given to
the Clergy, especially to the reverend Fathers and Bishops
of the prime order.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said, it is manifest that the Bishops
were equal to the greatest persons and estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and had their votes and suffrages, for making laws
and Constitutions for the first 500. years before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
Whereby it appears, that it is a very rash and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
assertion of the Examiner Dr. <hi>Burgesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Bishops at first were but casually mounted to that height of
extent and power,<note place="margin">pag. 42.</note> by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
and oblige them.</p>
               <p>And that it is onely of Grace that Bishops were first allowed
place in Parliament.<note place="margin">pag. 43.</note> And that they crept in by favour to serve a

now they do) in the House of Peers, then an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
if so high.</p>
               <p>Whereby it is manifest by all the Laws of the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Kings, both in the edition of <hi>Lambard</hi> and of the <hi>English</hi>
Councels by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> that the Bishops were the
principal men in all ages for ordaining of Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then in use.</p>
               <p>And when matters in question, were only Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

sate by themselves, but when there was any thing to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Nobles did afford their presence and assistance, as appears
by divers Councils.</p>

               <p>Now the Bishops may be reckoned both as Feudal Barons

Bishopricks: and also they are <hi>Evocati</hi> summoned by Writ
as Barons, and principal persons by the Kings to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

is presented to the Arch-bishop at their consecration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all the Feudal Barons were not summoned to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>

all men of estates to hold by one Tenure or other; and
having made 30 thousand to hold by Barony, yet he never
called so many to a Parliament; seeing no Houses could
hold so many: and as not all the Feudal Barons were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
so not all the Abbots or Priors, though they had great
estates, but a convenient number, sometimes more and
sometimes lesse, as in 49. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. Which is the first Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament

                  <hi>Cambden,</hi> writing of the Degrees of States in <hi>England,
pag.</hi> 170. speaking of the Bishops—by right and custome
it appertained to them, as to Peers of the Kingdome, to
be with the rest of the Peers personally present at all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
whatsoever, there to consult, to handle, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
decree, and determine in regard of the Baronies,
which they hold of the King.</p>
               <p>For <hi>William</hi> the first (a thing which the Church-men of
that time complained of, but these in the age ensuing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their greatest honour) ordained Bishopricks and Abbeys,
which held Baronies in pure and perpetual almes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
that time were free from all secular service, to be under
Military or Knights Service, enrolling every Bishoprick
and Abbey at his will and pleasure, and appointed how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Soldiers he would have every of them to find for him and
his Successours, in the time of Hostility and War. Thus
<hi>William</hi> the Conquerour being very rigorous, imposed upon
the Bishops and Abbots that held their estates by Barony,
great impositions to maintain arms, horses, and furniture
for War, enrolling them as he thought them able: but it
seems the lesser Abbeys, that did not hold by that Tenure of
Barony, and Parish priests, were not taxed as now they are.</p>
               <p>But under the <hi>Saxons,</hi> when the grievous imposition of
<hi>Dangelt</hi> was imposed and raised from ten thousand pounds
yearly to thirty thousand pounds, and in the year 1012.
to forty eight thousand pounds, which was a great sum for
that age, when mony did not abound as it doth now, yet
the Church was then free.</p>

this happily may be meant rather of the honour affixed to
their places, which works it up into a dignity, then of the
Land pertaining to them.] This is but fustian nonsence, and
gross ignorance; for like Feudal Barons, <hi>suas sortiuntur Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronias
sola fundorum investitura.]</hi> In like manner I take it, as
the Earls of <hi>Arundel,</hi> both formerly and of late, being
possessed of the Castle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> Honour and Signory,
without other consideration or creation to be an Earl,
became Earls of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and the name, State, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> peaceably enjoyed, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by a definitive judgement given in Parliament, as
<hi>Cambden</hi> relateth out of the Parliament Rolls of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">in Sussex p. 309.</note>
out of which <hi>Cambden</hi> copied out what he saith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further Dr.</hi> Burgesse <hi>saith,</hi> That the Bishops ought not to

these are for their Sons and Heirs, and the others for their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
only.</p>
               <p>This Objection is frivolous, because the Bishops being
men of great Integrity and Learning, are as careful for the
preservation of the publick, wherein standeth the Safety of
themselves and their Successors, as any Temporal Lords

                  </gap>an be; and perhaps the more, because Temporal Lords do
often fall into great want and poverty, selling sometimes
the very head of their Baronies, and so oftentimes become
very obnoxious; and some of them growing poor have
been degraded of their Titles and Honour; Whereof Lord
<hi>Cook</hi> giveth an instance 4. <hi>Instit. pag.</hi> 355. How <hi>Nevil</hi> (both

openly known, that <hi>George Nevil</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> hath
not, nor by Inheritance may have, any livelyhood to support
the said Name, Estate and Dignity, or any name of estate,
as oftentimes it is seen, that when any Lord is called to
high estate, and have not Livelyhood convenient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the same dignity, it induceth great poverty and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and causeth oftentimes great Extortion, Imbrole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and maintenance to be had, to the great trouble of all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66402:21"/>
such Countries where such estate shall happen to be inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
wherefore the King by the advice of his Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
assembled, and by the authority of the same, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth,

Names of dignity to the said <hi>George</hi> or to <hi>Iohn Nevil,</hi> befor

               <p>And much more the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> addeth to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

               <p>The late Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> who was slain at <hi>Lichfield</hi> when he
was ready to batter the Cathedral Church, in his book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Bishops, speaking much against them, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Temporal Barons, saith, that though their Honours
are derived from the King, yet being once made Lord their
Honour is vested in their blood and cannot be taken away;
but his Lordship was not learned in Law or Herauldry: He
might have taken notice what Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> saith in his Apop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegmes;
That blood is no better then the blood of a black
Pudding that wants Fat and Suet: Honour is vested in the
lands, Mannors, and Revenues, which when they are lost

                  <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> (Grandchild to him that spoyl'd

               </p>
               <p>Many more might be alleadged, but these are enough to
shew, that when Lords have lost their Lands and Revenues,
then they are not fit men to fit and vote in Parliament, and
many there are who though no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>It is manifest hereby, that by the ancient Laws of this
Kingdome, what trust, care, and charge is reposed in the
Bishops; not only to direct matters Ecclesiastical; but also
to assist, rule, and guide Temporal Affairs; to preserve
peace, Justice, and upright dealing, just and true admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of several offices and duties, whereby Religion is
much advanced and adorned; when men are honest and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in their Actions, Contracts, Bargains and civil deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
among themselves. So that they may not clash or
oppose Religion: For all publick Statutes, Acts, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66402:23"/>
for the most part do in some degree, more or
lesse, trench upon Religion, and the furtherance or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
thereof: So that they can hardly be duly and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enacted and framed, without the advice, counsel, and
assistance of Bishops and the Clergy.</p>
               <p>Whereas Dr. <hi>Burgesse</hi> replieth that the Bishops were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
but did not Vote; It is a very simple and frivolous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
For the manner was not then in the time of the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> to vote to and fro as they do now: but at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
and end of every Council, Publick-meeting or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
when their Acts or Constitutions were written;
all the Lords present did subscribe their names, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
thereby their Votes and Consents, and approbation of
all that was done. Whereas the Custome is now, in most
businesses, to vote and declare themselves by word of
mouth, which is more uncertain; and many may be absent,
especially some dayes, or out of the way at the time of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
but by staying till the end of a Session or Parliament,
and then subscribing their names, it was a more certain
way to testifie who were present, and consented to all laws,
that are made: and posterity may know whom to thank,
if the Statutes be good, or whom to blame, if they be
unjust or unreasonable.</p>
               <p>As that Act 11. <hi>H. 7. c.</hi> 3. which gave power to <hi>Empson</hi>
and <hi>Dudley,</hi> those two infamous Committee-men, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon information without Indictment by their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and not <hi>secundum Legem &amp; Consuetudinem Angliae,</hi>
as all proceedings ought to be. By virtue of this Statute
(which <hi>Cook</hi> hath printed, 4. <hi>Instit. pag. 40. 41.) Empson</hi>
and <hi>Dudley</hi> did commit upon the Subject unsufferable pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and oppressions. A good Caveat to Parliaments, to
leave all causes to be measured by the golden and streight
metwand of the law, and not to the uncertain and crooked
cord of Discretion. And much more, to admonish Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
<hi>Cook</hi> doth there add in very earnest manner: but
our late long Parliament hath highly offended against all his
severe admonitions, and have far exceeded any ill doings of
<hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hist. H. 7.</note> For as Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> saith of
them, They kept the half face of Justice in putting up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66402:23"/>
against many men, but they would not suffer any
man to traverse them; and they had Jurors ready that would
find any thing for fact or valuation: But now in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
against the Clergy especially, there is not the
half face of Justice observed, nor the outside: But only
voting upon any information: and upon the Votes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,
or Sub-committees, and such like (not of either
House) men are cast out, by Sequestration, of their Livings
and Freeholds, especially the Clergy are oppressed beyond
example of any former age.</p>
               <p>All which unjust and horrible proceedings would not have
been suffered, if the Bishops had been permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their ancients rights, places, and power in Parliament;
they would have protested against it, and declared their
dissent, and found means to have hindered such detestable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
far beyond the wickednesse of <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> did not cast men out of their Houses,
Lands, and Estates as is now done by voting: Only they
did tamper and trouble men till they could get some mony
or fines upon the breach of some obsolete Statutes, which
they called mitigations, saith <hi>Bacon:</hi> But now mens free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
and Estates are taken away upon pretences only, and
bare informations, without Jurors for Trial or witnesses up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Oath, or any legal proceeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> though they offended highly against
Law, for which they were severely punished; yet there
came some good to the publick by their doing, for they
filled the Kings Exchequer with great sums of money, some
millions of pounds, as Lord <hi>Cook</hi> sheweth, 4. <hi>Instit. pag.</hi> 198.
And Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> in his History <hi>pag.</hi> 9. Greater sums
doubtlesse then any King of this Realm before had in his
Coffers, and such as may be thought effectively quadruple
to so much in our age.</p>
               <p>But our Long Parliament and Committee-men have
spent many more millions of money, then can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
more then ever <hi>David</hi> left for the building of the
Temple, <hi>viz,</hi> twenty and three Millions of our money,
and a thousand pound: A matter, but for the testimony of

Scripture, exceeding all beliefe, saith Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi>

spent more to pull down Temples; and have raised such

               <p>
                  <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> brought so much money to the Kings

               <p>Now though some Canons may seem to forbid the
Bishops and Clergy to intermeddle with secular affairs,

as in the famous Council of <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus much might serve for Reply to the Examiner Dr.
<hi>Burgesse,</hi> especially upon the fifth reason, which I hold to
be the only thing material in the whole Discourse; for the
rest will appear to be needlesse if this be clear'd. But if he
would look back to former times, he shall find that our
Kingdome and Government, followed the ancient manner
of Gods own people of <hi>Israel,</hi> whose Ceremonies and
Rituals, though they be now abolished, yet the general
rules of Justice, Equity, Government and Order, do still
remain. And as God made the priesthood then honourable
in the Kingdome of <hi>Israel,</hi> and committed a great part of
the Government unto them; so doubtlesse now under the
Gospel, the priesthood ought to be Honourable, and to
have a principal part in the ruling and governing of the
Kingdome: To be a <hi>Priest in Israel, was to be a cheif man,
Levit,</hi> 21. 4. and therefore in all their Courts of Justice the
priests and Levites were cheif men in authority for deciding
all causes, both in the great Court of <hi>Sanedrim</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
(which was a Continuation of the 70. Elders, appointed
by God himself <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. and was answerable in authority

of Peace to be of the Clergy, whereas we have the
example of <hi>David,</hi> guided and directed by the Spirit of
God, as the Text saith, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28, 12, 13, 19. So dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
and ordering the Levites, that he appointed some
for the outward businesse over <hi>Israel,</hi> for Officers and Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
a thousand and seven hundred were Officers of <hi>Israel,</hi>
on this side <hi>Iordan, in all businesses of the Lord, and in the
service of the King.</hi> This Text is very plain to prove that
the same man, may be employed in Ecclesiastical matters
of the Church, as also in the Kings Service. So <hi>pag. 32.
David</hi> appointed two thousand and seven hundred cheif Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>to be Rulers over the Reubenites, Gadites, and the

But that now any of the Clergy should be Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours,
Judges, or Officers, unto Princes, is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some an unlawful thing, or at least not very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable:
Whereas we see by this very law and direction
of King <hi>David,</hi> that the Levites might attend businesse,
belonging to the worship and service of God, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the people, as also of the publick service and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of King and State: So the Divines in their late An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations
on the Bible, do acknowledge that the Levites
did study the Judicial and politick Laws, and had power to
see the law of God, and injunctions of the King to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and to order divine and humane affairs, 1 <hi>Chron.

Neither will it hinder the study of Divinity, or care of
preaching the Gospel, if some fit men be imployed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Government of the publick (as to be Justices
of the peace) for the well ordering of the publick; and
preservation of Peace and Justice will more advance the
Gospel, and abundantly countervail some intermission of

Suits, Arrests, Executions, Imprisonments, Impositions,

and fair carriage shewed to them: <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>lib.

a Kingdome, meaning properly Citizens, and of the better
sort, (not Labourers, Porters, Scavengers) they ought
to have voice and suffrage, and to be capable of Magistracy

parts of Learning, Knowledge, and Wisdome: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Clergy have some opportunity to excel others, and
often go beyond the ordinary sort of men, that are not bred
up in Learning, Arts, and Sciences.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> observeth out of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi>
Law, that there belongs to every Subject, certain common

Concessimus Deo, quod Ecclesia Anglicana libera sit, &amp; habeat

that Ecclesiastical persons have more and greater Liberties,
then any other of the Kings Subjects; wherein to set down
all, would take up a whole Volume of it self, and to set
no examples, agreeth ill with the office of an expositor:
therefore some few examples shall be here expressed. There
he putteth down many particulars which are very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and I refer the Reader to him. But in the end he
concludeth, that all the liberties of the Clergy are lost or not
enjoyed. But why should the Clergy be deprived of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
liberties, rights, and priviledges, being so fully setled
upon them, by the fundamental Laws of the Land. We
may thank such unworthy fellows, as to please the vulgar
people, will be content to see the Clergy stripped of all
their rights and liberties, from the first to the last, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in these troublesome times. But the true reason is,
because that Dr. <hi>Burgesse,</hi> and such as he is could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               <p>Doctor <hi>Twist</hi> was an earnest Suiter for the Deanry of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury;</hi>
which because he could not obtain, nor a Prebend

               </p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Burgesse,</hi> was one of the same shape, he never
had a fellowship, or any like place of Continuance in any

the cheif Leader of the rascal rabble out of <hi>London,</hi> to

               <p>The like is known concerning Mr. <hi>Henry Burton,</hi> The

Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and so losing his hopes of further prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was inraged with envy and revenge against the
Bishops, and all Church Government, and at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded
and punished according to his demerits. Thus Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and Covetousnesse, was the true motive of all the
Presbyterian fury and rage against the Bishops and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
laws and Courts.</p>
               <p>But to return to our former purpose and discourse, why
it is fit and reasonable, that some principal men of the
Clergy should be in power and some places of Judicature,
to preserve the inferiour Clergy from oppression and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
whereunto they are now ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oxious. Whereas if
the Clergy might now enjoy those ancient priviledges,
which are mentioned in Scripture, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. of King
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who in the time of Famine and great extremity,
<hi>spared the Priests Lands, and allowed them their portion, so
that they sold not their Lands:</hi> Then men might better talk of
applying their studies, and medling with no common or
worldly businesse. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> King <hi>(Ezra 7.
24.)</hi> commanded that <hi>for all the Priests and Levites, and
Ministers of the House of God, it should not be lawful to impose
Toll, Tribute, or Custome upon them:</hi> Whereas now the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
being made subject to the most sort of payments, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and impositions, in a greater proportion commonly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66402:28"/>
then other men, it is but requisite that some principal men
of the Clergy should have voyce and suffrage in making the
Laws, that are enacted for their Government and Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</p>
               <p>Besides the course of Laws and Government is now much
altered from what it was in former times, when Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
spake of wholly applying themselves to prayers and
sacred studies, and diligent preaching of the Gospel, as if
they were to do nothing else, not so much as to provide
bread and necessaries for their Families, for then they lived
most part single in Colledges, and Monasteries, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
under the Bishops, where all necessary provisions
were made by Stewards and Officers, appointed for the
purpose; so that their cares in all those respects, were lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and abated much; that they might apply their studies
only, and forsake all worldly businesse, which now they
cannot foregoe, being secular and parochial Ministers,
married men, and thereby charged with Children and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and also made obnoxious to all Laws, Suits, and
Impositions, without any exemptions or priviledges. So
that it is but a Monastical, and in part a Popish fancy, to
talk so much of applying their studies, and only preaching
in the Gospel; for by many a writ and warrant from seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Courts of justice, and Constables, they shall be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and commanded to attend secular and litigious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and answer to all Bills of Complaint, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and vexations, that shall hinder their preaching and
studies, more then a voluntary imployment at fit seasons,
in some publick office.</p>
               <p>Further it is but a Popish opinion, that <hi>Regimen Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticum
est distinctum a politico.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Rom. Pontifice. l. 1. cap. 5.</note> Which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maintains

But under Correction, I take it to be a great Errour, though
now it is the Common Idol of every mans fancy: because
that in our Kingdome since the Conquest, but not formerly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66402:28"/>
as hath been already declared, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. the Courts of justice
are divided, the Temporal from the Ecclesiastical, and so
in most other Kingdomes: Which yet I do not think to be
the ancient manner, not to be the best course, though
things being setled as now they are, at this present, it is
not safe to change much; for in a Kingdome, the Courts of
justice which have been long setled, cannot easily be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
without danger and ill consequences. But yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any alteration of Laws or Courts, the Courts may be
furnished with judges of all sorts, some Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as well as any others, for it is against humane nature,
and Society to debat the Clergy, and shut them out of all
publick places of Trust and judicature: The Issue and event
whereof can be no lesse then the disgrace and reproach of
the Clergy, and to make them as the <hi>filth of the World, and
offscouring of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas it is well known, that many Doctors of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
are as fit to be justices of peace as any Knights, or
Esquires; The Doctors being learned in many kinds, but
very few of the Gentlemen eminent for Learning: or if they
be, they are such as will be glad to have the Society and
Company of Learned Doctors, who are oftentimes skilful
in Civil and Common Law, and other parts of good
Learning, which do enable them for publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>There is a Discourse about <hi>Puritans,</hi> lately published by
a Lawyer, one Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> wherein the excepts against <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>
and I think not amisse, in that he doth according to
the Popish grounds maintain, that Spiritual jurisdiction
differs from Temporal, because it proposeth not the same
ends, but several, which by several means may be better
compassed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But saith</hi> Parker, The Spiritual Magistrate (as I conceive)
can purpose no other end, then which the secular ought to aim at;
for either the Prince ought to have no care at all of the honour
of God or of the good of men, and that which is the prime end of
both, true Religion; or else his ends must be the same which the
Prelate aims at, viz. to vindicate Religion by removing or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
scandalous Offendors: Secondly to preserve the innocent
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66402:29"/>
from contagion by the separation of open Offenders: Thirdly,
To prevent further obduration, or to procure the amendment of
such as have transgressed, by wholsome Chastisement. <hi>Thus
he, and I think not much amisse; the scope and end of both
is the same, and as he saith in his Discourse;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Clergy men being as well Citizens of the Common-wealth, as
Sons of the Church, and their cases importing as well perturbance
of the State, as Annoyance to the Church, there can be but one
head which ought to have command over both, and in both. It is
manifest also that many cases are partly Temporal and partly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
that scarce any is so Temporal, but that it relates in some
order to Spiritual things: Or any so Spiritual, but that it hath
some relation to Temporal things, so that the true Subject of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
and civil Iustice cannot rightly be divided.</p>
               <p>I demand then why should the Courts be divided? which
was done first among us by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour: And
why should there not be judges partly Spiritual, as well as
Temporal in all Courts? As it was anciently among our
Ancestors the <hi>Saxons;</hi> or at least why should not the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Court of justice, which is to give Law to all other
inferiour Courts, be well tempered and mingled with all
sorts of men, Ecclesiastical and Civil, the most learned,
wise and choicest that can be found in the whole Kingdom:
Why not Priests and Levites admitted into the number, as
well as in the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which was equal to
our Parliament, and was first instituted by God himself?
And I take it there can be no just exception, but that our
Christian Kingdomes may most safely follow the general
Rules of Policy and Government, which God ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his own chosen people, without any imputation of
judaism.</p>
               <p>Now among them some cheif Fathers of the Priests and
Levites, were not only judges and elders in their own
Cities, which were allowed them, to the Number of forty
eight in the whole, but sate with the Elders of other
Cities, <hi>and were Iudges and Officers over Israel.</hi> Yea many
things by Gods law, were wholly and cheifly reserved to
the Knowledge and Sentence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Besides in every City there were private and peculiar
Rulers, (21. in number as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith) and also to every
Magistracy in those Cities, there was allotted two of the
Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> for assistance, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> witnesseth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
if those could not determine the bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the great Council. And so <hi>Grotius</hi> sheweth most
accurately, upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 21. Now God appointed these
offices and dignities and power of Judicature to the
Priests and Levites, besides their attendance upon Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and the Course of every Priest and Levite, was but
one Week in half a year, to attend at the Temple, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Selianus</hi> doth shew, with other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Chronologers; so that beside their attendance upon
Gods Service, they had time and leisure enough to be
helpful in the Government of the Kingdome. Yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the principal Judges were chosen out of the Tribe of
<hi>Levi,</hi> as at the beginning of their Common-wealth, <hi>Moses</hi>
himself of that Tribe the greatest prophet &amp; prince that ever
was among them. So after in succeeding times, <hi>Ely</hi> the high
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66402:31"/>
Priest, was made Judge in his time: So also <hi>Samuel</hi> a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
was cheif Judge in <hi>Israel,</hi> as 1, <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 15. who judged
<hi>Israel</hi> all the dayes of his life: And he went <hi>from year to
year in circuit to Bethell, and Gilgal, and Mispeh,</hi> and <hi>judged
Israel in all those places,</hi> much alike as our judges do go their
Circuits every year throughout the Land. <hi>p. 17. And his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
was to Ramah, for there was his House and there he judged</hi>
Israel, <hi>and there he built an Altar to the Lord.</hi> And his three
Sons after him, <hi>Samuel</hi> made them (being Levites) <hi>Iudges
over Israel, though they did not walk in their Fathers ways, but
turned aside after lucre, and took bribes and perverted judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for some 500, years till
the coming of Christ, the Priesthood had the greatest stroke
in the Government: As <hi>Ezra</hi> the Priest and brother to
<hi>Iesus</hi> the high priest that returned from the Captivity,
whose memory is honourable among the righteous, as
learned <hi>Montague</hi> sheweth against <hi>Selden. pag.</hi> 377. He had
Commission from the Persian Emperor <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
and order the Controversie, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7. 12, 25. and gave
him authority to set Magistrates and judges, which might
judge the people, and power to execute the laws of God
and the King. <hi>pag.</hi> 26. and to inflict punishments unto death,
or banishment, or to confiscation of goods or imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So that <hi>Ezra</hi> had great authority and full power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, and his worthy Acts are there recorded.</p>
               <p>So afterwards under the <hi>Maehabees,</hi> who were priests,
the Common-wealth was governed, and it pleased God to
make that Family victorious as any other almost that ever
governed that Common-wealth, as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
<hi>lib. 2. cap.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>If thus it were anciently among the chosen people of
God, why then should any in these dayes be so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased,
that a Bishop or a Clergy man, should have
any part in the Government of the Common-wealth,
or assistance of Government, for the better Ordering and
Directing of judgment, or to be Counsellor to a Prince;
as <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Levite was a wise Counsellor, <hi>1 Chron. 26.
14. Benajah</hi> a Priest, son of <hi>Iehojadah,</hi> was one of <hi>David</hi>'s
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66402:31"/>
twelve Captaines:<note place="margin">1 Chron. 27. 5.</note> being the third Captain of the host
for a moneth, and in his Course consisting of 2400, was

                  <hi>Benajah</hi> also was of <hi>David</hi>'s principal
Worthies, having the name among the three Mighties.
He was also Captain of the guard to <hi>David,</hi> and after
the death of <hi>Ioab,</hi> he was made Lord General of the
Host, by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> in <hi>Ioabs</hi> room. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 35.</p>
               <p>So, and much rather may a Clergy men now be an
Officer, in great place, or a Justice of Peace in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who handles Matters of Equity and good Conscience,
for preserving of publick peace, order and quietness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
neighbours, wherein happen many businesses that
depend much upon the Conscience of a Justice, and the
Equitable rules of Scripture, whereof Clergy men are
the most competent interpreters: As also many Causes
happen touching the Estates and persons of the Clergy, who
have little reason to be subject onely to secular Judges,
without some of their own tribe on the bench to see fair
carriage and indifferent dealing.</p>
               <p>But for matters of Religion, concerning God and his
Worship, and difficult points of Divinity, the Clergy
then were, and so ought now to be the principal men to
be imployed; as may clearly appear by the doings of K.
<hi>David,</hi> about removing of the Ark to the place that
he had provided for it: upon which text, King <hi>Iames</hi> hath
written a very pious and excellent Meditation, <hi>Pag.</hi> 81.
upon the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. some of those words are fit to be
here recited.</p>
               <p>When the Ark of God, (whereunto they sought not
in the dayes of <hi>Saul)</hi> had continued long at <hi>Kiriah-jearim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.</note>
                  <hi>David</hi> out of his Zeal and Piety was moved to prepare a
Tent for it, in the City of <hi>David;</hi> and when he began to
remove it, he called a great assembly of principal Men,
but did not make that use of <hi>the Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> as he
ought to have done, and therefore the Action prospered
not; but there happened a terrible judgment upon <hi>Uzzah,</hi>
which hindered the progresse of the good work, and
<hi>David</hi> was afraid of God that day, saying: <hi>How shall I
bring the Ark of God home to me?</hi> so the Ark rested in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66402:32"/>
House of <hi>Obed-Edom.</hi> But afterwards upon better advice,
<hi>David</hi> perceived his Errour, and confesseth it. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.
12, 13. Speaking to the Chief of the Priests and <hi>Levites:
Sanctify your selves, both ye, and your brethren, that you
may bring up the Ark of the Lord God. For because you did
it not at the first, the Lord God made a breach upon us, for
we sought him not after the due order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a great and a godly work that was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and therefore King <hi>David</hi> called a great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
about it. 1. Of the Elders of <hi>Israel.</hi> 2. Of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of thousands, and hundreds, whose Names and
Praises are recorded.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 11. 26.</note> 3. The Priests and Levites, <hi>Who did it
not at the first.</hi> But now upon better advice, King <hi>David</hi>
assembled at first <hi>the Children of Aaron and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.
v.</hi> 4. So that men of all Estates, were now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in this godly work: This is to be marked well of
Princes, and of all those of any high Calling or Degree
that have to do in Gods Cause: <hi>David</hi> doth nothing in
matters pertaining to God without the presence and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall
Concurrence of Gods Ministers, appointed to be
spiritual rulers in Gods Church: And at the first meant to
convay the same Ark to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> finding their absence and
want of their Counsel hurtful; therefore he saith to them,
<hi>Ye are the Chief Fathers of the Levites, because ye did it not
at the first.</hi> Thus saith King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory:
but now there is a generation of men, who do not think
the Clergy necessary Men to be consulted: that will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
Scriptures, remove the Ark of God (as it were)
and do things without the presence, vote, and suffrage of

               <p>THe first frame of our English Common-wealth was so
setled and ordered by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, when once
they became Christians, That the Bishop of the Diocess,
together with the Aldermen of the County (and so their
Deputies in-inferior Courts under them) should be equal
Judges, together upon the same Bench, in the same Courts,
and there determine all Causes: in the forenoon Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters,
and in the afternoon secular business: as <hi>Selden</hi>
sheweth in his notes upon <hi>Eadner. p.</hi> 166. and Bishop
<hi>Iewel</hi> in part observes in his Defence of the Apology,
<hi>Part 6. p.</hi> 522. This Course continued till <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
and perhaps it had been very happy for our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
if the frame of our Laws and Courts had so still
continued joyned together: for many reasons that I will
not now further insist upon.</p>

to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> And though it be
sent in the direction by name to them only, yet it seems,
it grew after to be a general law, no otherwise then the
Statute of <hi>Circumspecte agatis,</hi> that hath a special reference
onely to the Bishop of <hi>Norwich:</hi> as Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith, <hi>2 Instit.</hi>
487. The Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> is there put but for example,

(saith</hi> Selden) <hi>because also it seems to give the Original of
the Bishops consistory, as it sits with us divided from the
Hundred or County Court, wherewith in the Saxon times,
it was joyned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the same Law it is added further,</p>
               <p>Hoc etiam defendo, ut nullus laicus homo de legibus, quae ad
Episcopum pertinent, se intromittat. <hi>Thus</hi> Selden: <hi>Only the
words of the Charter are more fully recited out of the
Records by another Learned Author.—</hi> Si vero aliquis
per superbiam elatus, ad justitiam Episcopalem venire noluerit,
vocetur semel, &amp; secundo &amp; tertio. Quod si nec ad emendatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
venerit, excommunicetur. Et si opus fuerit, ad hoc vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandum,

Ille autem qui vocatus ad justitiam Episcopi veniro no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerit,
pro unaquaque vocatione legem Episcopalem emendabit.
Hoc etiam defendo, &amp; mea authoritate interdico, ne ullus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeomes
aut praepositus, aut minister Regis, nec aliquis laicus
homo de legibus quae ad Episcopum pertinent, se intromittat: nec
aliquis laicus homo alium hominem sine justitia Episcopi ad ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium
adducat. Iudicium vero in nullum locum portetur nisi in
Episcopali sede, aut in illo loco, quem ad hoc Episcopus constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit.</p>
               <p>And the punishment for disobedience to the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Judges, was much alike as formerly was enacted under
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, as by King <hi>Alured; Si quis Dei rectitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Anglis:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. p. 568. c. 17.</note> And the same Law is afterwards confirmed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
by King <hi>Canutus,</hi> and by other Kings: Whereby it
appeareth how before the Conquest, and likewise after,
for a long time, the authority and jurisdiction of the
Church was maintained and upheld by the setled Laws of
the Kingdome. How they had power in their Courts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate,
and further by the help of the King and the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66402:34"/>
Sheriffe, to proceed against stubborn offenders, and such
as opposed or contemned their authority; so that here is
the present practise and Law confirmed, by the continual
practise of many hundred years.</p>
               <p>The Law being thus made by the Conquerour, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Ecclesiastical Court from the Temporal, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
after in succeeding times Statutes to direct and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
what causes shall belong to the Bishops Jurisdiction:
As the Statute called <hi>Circumspecte agatis</hi> made 13. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.
and <hi>Articuli Cleri 9. Edw.</hi> 2. which besides others, <hi>Coke</hi> doth
expound in the <hi>2. Instit.</hi> at large <hi>pag.</hi> 489. 599. So that
the Ecclesiastical Laws and Courts being thus setled by
ancient Statutes and <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and besides long
use and Custome, the Laws are Fundamental and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
as well as any part of the Common-law, and cannot
be wholly taken away without great injustice, confusion,
and great disorder in the Kingdome and Church, as it
happen'd most pitifully in these troublesome times: But Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
are obliged to maintain the Fundamental Laws of
the Land, as they have often professed solemnly in many of
their Declarations, Protestations and Remonstrances:
But in conclusion they have overthrown all Ecclesiastical
Courts and Laws, though never so ancient and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and now they would pretend to set up new laws and
orders, which they call Presbyterian Government by Lay
Elders in every Parish, a fond and foolish project (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws of God and Man) such as they have heard
to be at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and some other places beyond Sea, where
there are no Lords, Knights, Esquires, or Gentlemen, as
with us in <hi>England:</hi> But their new States are popular, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
degrees of Honour and distinction of Gentry: They
do as their Neighbours at <hi>Strasborough,</hi> and the <hi>Switzers,</hi>
of whom <hi>Bodin</hi> saith, <hi>lib. 6. c. 4. Argentinenses, Caesa &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strata

ac tueri vellent, cives omnes, quantum quidem fieri posset,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66402:34"/>
opibus, honoribus, imperiis, ac vitae conditione exaequarent: ac si
quis prudentia, justitia, fortitudine, aut ulla virtute caeteris
praeluceret ac emineret, hunc ostracismo exterminabant; aut ne
virtutitam aperte bellum indicere viderentur, accusationibus &amp;
calumniis opprimebant, atque id unum efficere conabantur, ut
singuli Cives, non magis sui similes essent, quam omnes om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They either banished or put to death all their Nobility,
and so made themselves a popular state, and further made
a law, that no man should bear any publick office among
them, but such as would derive their Discent and Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
from some base Trade, a Cobler, or Carrior, or such
like.</p>
               <p>Among such people, Presbyterian Government may be
better allowed then in a Kingdome flourishing with all
degrees of Honour, <hi>Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Barons,
Knights, &amp;c.—.</hi> But where only Tradesmen are, chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

any government in the Church may better be tolerated
then in a Monarchy: The Glossary sheweth to that purpose
that Tradesmen are base fellows in Herauldry,<note place="margin">pag. 110.</note> and among
base fellows any base government may serve the turn. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses

experirentur:</hi> and so also the Civil law saith, <hi>patritii cum
Plebeis conjugia ne contrahunto.</hi> And in our law it is reputed
a disparagement for a Ward in Chivalry (which in old
time was as much as to say a Gentleman) to be married to
the Daughter of one that dwelt in a Burrough; as <hi>Lambard</hi>
sheweth in his perambulation of <hi>Kent, pag.</hi> 504. So the old
Statute of <hi>Merton Anno Dom. 1235. cap. 7. De Dominis qui

sicut Burgensibus, ubi disparagentur, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Coke</hi> sheweth what causes belong to the Court
Christian, <hi>viz.</hi> Probate of Wills and Testaments, Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Reparation of Churches, and Church-yards, Tyths,
Oblations, Mortuaries, and such like duties; Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66402:35"/>
causes, degrees of Affinity, or Consanguinity Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces,
and what else belongeth thereunto. And divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars, as appears in divers statutes, and the
Books of the Civil Lawyers, as punishment of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Fornication, and Incontinency, Incest, with many
other the like, as Heresies, Schismes, Errors, Abuses,
Offences, Contempts, and enormities, as Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith,
4. <hi>Instit. pag.</hi> 325. and so also the excellently learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
Dr. <hi>Cosin,</hi> Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> in his Apology for Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Courts and their proceedings against Simony,
Usury, Defamation, Sacriledge, Disapidations,—
<hi>&amp;c.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the Presbyterians neglect, and cast off most of
these particulars, that there is no punishment for those gross
offences and sins, which are not fit to be mentioned among
Christians saith the Apostle. There is of late an infinite
number of bastards gotten, and the Justices of peace only
take care for keeping the Bastard: But there is no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or correction for the scandal to Religion; and the
vulgar people, go together like Dogs and Bitches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
licence or publication of banes in any parish. The
Holy Communion is cast aside and neglected in most pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
most shamefully: The Common-people in most pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
will rather be without the Sacrament, then give one
penny to buy Bread and Wine for it, that they are become
Atheists in most places; and many Sectaries professe publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they will not have Churches or Stone-houses, nor
Ministers or Magistrates: And yet the Parliament pretended
to reform all according to the word of God in all things;
to advance the Throne of Christ, and the Tribunal of Christ,
with all his holy ordinances in full force and power, as the
Language is of the Presbyterian Ministers.</p>

Most of these great Justices were Bishops, as appears
by the Catalogue of them, they being the principal men
for Knowledge and Learning in those dayes, and had, no
doubt, power of voting in all Parliaments, Councils,
and assemblies of State.</p>
               <p>And so in these later times, Lord <hi>Coke</hi> sheweth their
abilities, and rights. 4. <hi>Instit. pag.</hi> 321. The King is well
apprised of all his Judges, which he hath within his
realm, as well spiritual as temporal, as Arch-bishops,
Bishops, and their officers, Deanes and other Ministers,
who have spiritual jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>It is declared by the King, the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, and the Commons in full Parliament. That
the spiritualty (now being called the English Church)
always hath been reputed, and also found of that sort,
that both for knowledge,<note place="margin">If so then, much more at this day, saith <hi>Coke.</hi>
                  </note> integrity, and sufficiency of
number, it hath been alwayes thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is also at
this hour sufficient and meet of it self, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling
of any exterior person, or persons, to declare
and determine of such doubts, and to administer all such
offices and duties, as to their rooms spiritual doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain.</p>
               <p>The Adversaries have made divers objections against
our Arch-bishops and Bishops—Ever since saith <hi>Coke.—</hi>
But these pretences being (in truth) but meer Cavils,
tending to the scandal of the Clergy <hi>(being one of the greatest
States of the realm,</hi> as it is said in the Statute of 8. <hi>Eliz.
cap. 1.)</hi> are fully answered by the said Statute, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
made by authority of that Parliament for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of the Arch-bishops and Bishops both <hi>in praesenti,
&amp; in futuro,</hi> in their Bishopricks.</p>
               <p>By the Statute also of 39 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 8. the Arch-bishops
and Bishops, are adjudged lawful, as by the said Act ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.
And by these two Statutes, these and all other
objections against our Bishops, one hath answered,
which we have thought good to remember, seeing we
are to treat of their jurisdiction, <hi>Ut obstruatur os iniquae
loquentium,</hi> saith Lord <hi>Coke:</hi> Yet the fury and rage of
these times have stirred up more anger, which in the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66402:37"/>
issue will turn to the Confusion and Dishonour of them
that began these wars and broyles against the Church,
and Bishops, and fundamental Laws and Statutes, which
have so fully asserted their rights and authority.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> premiseth, being to treat of the
Ecclesiastical Courts and all the jurisdiction belonging to
the Clergy, and established by the fundamental Laws of
the Land against both Papists and Puritans: and first he
beginneth with the Court of Convocation, and of the high
Commission in Causes Ecclesiastical, which is absolutely
necessary for the suppression of all manner of Errots, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
Schismes, abuses, offences, Contempts, and enormities.</p>
               <p>But upon suppression of this Court, by the late long
Parliament, there hath broken forth such an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of heresies, schismes, sectaries, and a rascal rabble
of factions, as is prodigious to relate, and intolerable
to be suffered: For as it is in the Common Law, if
there were not Assises and Sessions, to punish Malefactors,
Theeves, Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>purses, Offenders, and Rogues of all sorts, the
Land would be so Oppressed with the Multitudes of them
no man could enjoy his house, or goods, freehold, or
life: therefore in <hi>London</hi> they have every moneth a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
sessions to punish, Condemn, and Execute all sorts
of Malefactors.</p>
               <p>And Corporations in principal Cities have the like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by Commission, and Patent from the King.</p>
               <p>But for the high Commission to punish Offenders against
Religion, and the Church, Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 331.
That the Kings Majesty hath, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had
before him, as great and ample Supremacy and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Ecclesiastical, as ever King of <hi>England</hi> had before
them, and that had justly and rightly pertained to them,
by divers other Acts; and by the ancient Laws of <hi>England,</hi>
if the said clause of annexation in the said Statute of 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi>
had never been inserted. That it was a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>osse Error, and a
notorious offence of <hi>I. Pym,</hi> to affirm as he did in his Speech
in Parliament; 4. <hi>Caroli. That the high Commission was
derived from the Parliament.</hi> An impudent, ignorant,
and seditious speech; which if it had been spoken in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66402:37"/>
time of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, when he recovered his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
from the Pope, the King would quickly have
hanged, or burnt him, as he did many in his Reign,
upon that point of his Supremacy: For though Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may submit and acknowledge the Kings Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
yet they are not the Donors or Authors of it, it
is originally vested in the Crown, and is a principal
Flower thereof; that cannot be denyed ot taken away
from the King by any of their Votings or Ordinances.
And the King may again restore the Court of High
Commission, without the help of a Parliament, and
appoint such Judges and Commissioners as he shall think
fit, without direction or assistance from the House of
Commons, as the King doth appoint Judges in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Courts without their consent, and so may doe
still in this Court: Which is absolutely necessary to be
done, to suppresse the abominable and detestable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Sectaries, and Schismaticks, that are now
risen up in this <hi>Inter-Regnum</hi> of the Kings Authority.</p>

               <p>TO return again to our former matter of the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Courts, it is to be considered that the
Courts being now divided in the Kingdome, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66402:38"/>
years since, the ancient manner of their union is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten

scars of the Norman Conquest are so overgrown, that few
men are sensible, what reliques of Slavery do still remain
upon us, by changing the order of the Courts, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Law, in great part, with other things that I
will not now mention. But being so setled by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
and continued by his Successors, the Temporal
Courts in process of time grew too powerful for the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
and by their injunctions and prohibitions, stopt
many proceedings, especially after the Councel of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
under <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. Wherein the power of the Clergy was
much abated, and all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction so crushed,
that it continued lame ever after. Though the Clergy by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to <hi>Rome,,</hi> and the Popes Legats that were often
sent hither, did oftentimes help themselves, and much
molest their Adversaries. At length under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. upon
his breach with the Pope, the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
was much abridged and restrained in many particulars, and
reduced to a narrow compass, becoming much more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and obnoxious to the Injunctions, Orders, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
of all the Temporal Courts, that now I mervail
that any should complain and envy at their power and
greatness, there being no cause of any value or moment
but by one order or other, is drawn from them to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Courts. And now at last, there want not some that
would have all Ecclesiastical authority and jurisdiction, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly suppressed from the first Court to the last, or at
least so abated, mingled, or changed, that what form or
force of Government shall be left remaining, seems very
uncertain.</p>
               <p>But if Presbyteries and such like Consistories of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and new fangled devising were erected, there will
follow great confusion and disorder to the infinite distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of peace and quietnesse in the Kingdome, by altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so many laws and customes, and of the Common
Law it self, whereby the Kingdome hath been governed
so many years, and setled in peace, and all mens estates
and Lands held in certain possession. For such great and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66402:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
universal changes, as will follow upon the dissolution of
the Hierarchy; and taking away the Votes of Bishops in
Parliament, and other eminent parts of Government,
will produce such ill events and troublesome distractions
as will not be pacified and composed within the compass of
any mans life now living: And what further mischeif may
follow is uncertain, but surely great troubles are like to
ensue, as indeed it hath happened in a most lamentable
manner.</p>
               <p>But if our Nation could have taken warning by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the late wars that happened these last 40. years, in
<hi>France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> they might have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
much evil: for there the Wars began by men of the
same spirit and humours, as our Presbyterians are among
us, and had the same ends and purposes as ours had, which
is to take away the Honours, Lands and Revenues of Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,
and all that belonged to them: The ill s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hideous manner: And in the end all the zealous party
were utterly undone and confounded, that began the war
against the Emperor, to take away the lands of all the

not <hi>Physice,</hi> but <hi>Mystice,</hi> saith <hi>Pareus</hi> in his Commentary:
For otherwise to eat the flesh of the Pope naturally, being

be no good meat or pleasing Diet: But <hi>mystically</hi> to eat him,
that is, to take away the lands, revenues, and riches of

               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:66402:39"/>
This Sacrilegious appetite and outragious covetousness,
to get the lands of the Church and Bishops proved very
tragical to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and most parts of <hi>Germany:</hi> And to
shew a little their manner of proceeding, I will digresse
a little, because it is so remarkable and fresh a Case within
these last 40. years. First therefore, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> in the year
1619. assembled a Parliament without the Emperors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
They raised a great army, and put Garrisons also in all
the best Towns and Castles: They made a Godly Covenant
consisting of an 100, articles just the same in Substance with
our late <hi>Scottish</hi> Covenant; they raised great Taxes, and excise
to maintain their armies and garrisons. For two years they
prevailed much, and brought in a new King, the Palsgrave;
but at the end of two years, the Emperors great armies
came upon them, and fought the great Battle of <hi>Prague 8.
Novemb.</hi> 1620. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> came with twelve
thousand men, and other great Commanders joyned, as the
Count of <hi>Bucquoy,</hi> the Count of <hi>Tilly,</hi> the Count of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim,</hi>
the Count of <hi>Maradas.</hi> Besides other great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of note, having an Army of 40. thousand men, and
fought the great Battle neer <hi>Prague,</hi> and prevailed power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
Next day the City of <hi>Prague</hi> was surrendered, the
Palsgrave fled away, and of 30. Committee-men in <hi>Prague,</hi>
which directed all businesse, twenty seven were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and the next year after they had been tryed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Common-law of the land, for rebellion and
raising armies, and Committees, they were put to death
upon one stage the same day. Not long after, ten thousand
protestant Ministers and Churches were suppressed, and the
Ministers banished out of the Kingdome and the provinces
annexed, of <hi>Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia,</hi> and other Countties
of the Emperor. The Covenanters who had seised on the
Lands and Revenues of the Bishops and Deans aud other
societies, by way of Sequestration first (which word they
used in one article of their Covenant) were forced to yield
up those lands, and to restore them to the former owners:
and so also in many other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> Lands and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Clergy, which were taken away an hundred years
before, were restored to the right owners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:66402:39"/>
And for the Godly Covenant they renounced it,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d would have been glad to have enjoyed the favours,
which the Emperors formerly permitted them out of his
Clemency: But since they raised such a bloody War, he
would not suffer them longer to enjoy his former favours.
So that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> and most parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
peace and great happinesse in all respects, lost all by
striving to overthrow the Bishops, and the Ecclesiastical
Laws, and to take their Lands.</p>
               <p>This miserable event might well have forewarned us in
<hi>England,</hi> not to offend in the same kind, as they did, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
Bishops, and all the preferments of the Church,

a godly Covenant, wich was indeed a wicked combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Conspiracy, far worse then the Covenant of the
low Countries, or that of <hi>France</hi> against <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Hen.</hi>
4. which had almost confounded all <hi>France,</hi> and was at
length the destruction of those two great Kings who were
both miserably murdered, and put to death; as our King
<hi>Charles</hi> was in most abominable manner, and in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
more horribly then those two Kings: for they were
stabbed on a suddain by two villaines and without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the people, and severe punishments were inflicted
upon them speedily: But King <hi>Charles</hi> in a deliberate
manner, by men that pretended Justice and upright deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who called an high Court of Justice never heard of
before, no Judges of the Land consenting, or approving,
and so openly in the face of the sun and of all the world,
with an high hand, and professed malice, and outragious
fiery zeal, that the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> did justly say,
that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were Kings of Devils. And
though the Presbyterians would excuse themselves, that
they never intended the Kings destruction, yet that is a
frivolous and foolish excuse: for as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> saith
truely: Our law doth Construe all levying of war without

Lord <hi>Coke. 3. Instit. pag.</hi> 12. speaking fully of all kinds and
degrees of treason: saith—Preparation by some overt
Act, to depose the King, or take the King by force, and
strong hand, and to imprison him, until he hath yeilded
to certain demands: this is a sufficient overt Act, to prove
the compassing and imagination of the death of the King:
for this upon the matter is to make the King a subject, and
to despoile him of his kingly office, of royal government.
And so it was resolved by all the Judges of <hi>England, Hill.
1. Iac. Regis,</hi> in the Case of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi>
and <hi>Watson,</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> seminary Priests: and so it had
been resolved by the Justices, <hi>Hill. 43. Eliz.</hi> in the Case of
the Earls of <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> who intended to go to
the Court where the Queen was, and to have taken her
into their power, and to have removed divers of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
and for that end did assemble a multitude of people;
this being raised to the end aforesaid, was a sufficient overt
Act, for compassing the death of the Queen, and so
by woful experience in former times it hath fallen out,
in the Cases of King <hi>E. 2. H.</hi> 6. &amp; <hi>E.</hi> 5. that were taken
and imprisoned by their subjects.</p>
               <p>The Presbyterians did offend in this kind notoriously,
and therefore committed Treason manifesty: for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
the King in divers places, and at length in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
place, in the Ifle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and what followed after
is well known. And all this done by them, that were
for the most part Presbyterians, out of their design to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the King to yeild to their projects, to overthrow the
Bishops, and to take their Lands and Revenues, which they
account to be the flesh and bones of the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
which they must devour, and make the old whore, naked,
bare, and desolate.</p>
               <p>The excellently learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> who did perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,

they may pull down the Bishops, and seise upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
and lands, as they have done notoriously of late,

but they were inforced to regorge, and restore them, as
appears fully in the late Histories, which might have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
our Puritans—<hi>Si mens non laeva fuisset.</hi> The

all the Lands and Estates of the Bishops and Clergy,
which the puritans there had seised on of late years, but
those also which were taken away an 100 years ago, as in

Kings to reform Religion. Whereof not only the Papists

               <p>The Puritans in <hi>England</hi> could be content to second King
<hi>Iames</hi> writing against the Pope and Papists for deposing
and murthering of Kings: But for their own parts, they
account Parliaments to be superiour to all Kings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
maintain that Doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that the <hi>tres ordines

But his books were burned for it at <hi>London</hi> and both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities.
But of late, not only the three estates of the
Kingdome, but the third estate, the Commons, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
of the peopledome may correct and punish
Kings: For they have styled themselves <hi>The Supream autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Nation,</hi> without the House of Lords, whom
they voted to be uselesse and cast them out, and make Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
(which they call Acts of Parliament) without the
House of Lords, or the Royal assent. Contrary to all the
statutes recorded in the Book of Statutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bancroft</hi> in the very end of his Book of dangerous posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
doth plainly foretell, that the Puritans would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
give over their Clamour for Reformation, till they
had utterly ruined the whole Kingdome and Church, as now
it appears manifestly they have effected their desires in
great part. But saith <hi>Bancroft,</hi> there are divers-men that
will needs hood-wink themselves and stop their Ears, with
the Serpent in the Psalm, of purpose, because they would
gladly have these things smothered up: He meaneth men in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66402:42"/>
great place, that were willing to think, that the Puritans
were no such dangerous men, as he and others did take
them to be, only scrupulous and peevish perhaps about
Ceremonies, and therefore were willing to forbear them,
and not to censure them sharply: But <hi>Bancroft</hi> doth wisely
tell them, that if any such mischeifs (which God forbid)
shall happen hereafter, they were sufficiently warned, that
both should and might (in good time) have prevented
them, and withall it would then be found true, which <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
saith,—<hi>Urgentibus Republicam fatis Dei &amp; hominum

               <p>When the Lord for the sins of the people, is purposed

               <p>The principal end and project of the Presbyterians was,
not only to reform some things amisse, but to pluck up both
root and branch of Episcopacy, and all Ecclesiastical laws
and Courts, though never so ancient and Fundamental,
setled by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and many other Fundamental sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
as <hi>Circumspecte agatis, 13. Edw, 1. Articuli Cleri. 9.
Ed.</hi> 2. as Lord <hi>Coke</hi> doth expound them at large 2. <hi>Institut.</hi> and
for payment of Tythes and all Duties belonging to the
Church, there is both Common Law and Statute Law, as
Lord <hi>Coke</hi> sheweth fully, 2. <hi>Instit. pag.</hi> 693. upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 18. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and 2, <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and if the Presbyterians
would not loose and foregoe Tythes, they must maintain
and uphold those statutes: for better Laws for the true pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tythes and all Duties cannot be made.</p>
               <p>But the Presbyterians account all humane laws but trash
of humane Iuvention; They will reform all according to
the word of God in all points. Their position is, <hi>We must
do nothing, not so much as take up a rush or a straw,</hi> without
warrant from the Word of God. As <hi>Cartwright</hi> affirmed,
and <hi>Hooker</hi> confuteth him accurately, <hi>lib. 2. &amp; lib. 3. 8.
2. 3. &amp;c.</hi> He sheweth that in Scripture there is not a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66402:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
form of Church Government contained. So the learned
<hi>Francis Mason</hi> in his Sermon upon 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. Also the
Learned Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> in the Preface to his 14. Sermons,
and in his 4. Sermon <hi>ad Clerum,</hi> upon <hi>Rom</hi> 14. besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others. But though <hi>Hooker</hi> hath written with singular
Wisdome, Learning, Godlinesse, and Moderation, yet
the Puritans will not read him, as Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of them.</p>
               <p>But what <hi>Bancroft</hi> did foresee, and foretel so fully, is now
come to pass in our times, to the great ruin and desolation of
the Church: King <hi>Iames</hi> in the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi>
Court, did something to pacifie the Puritans: But in the
conclusion he passed them over only with admonitions to
be quiet, and accepted their promise to be obedient for the
time to come, not to oppose the Bishops nor the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Laws, but to behave themselves as dutiful Subjects.
And the King with the Lords of his Council, appointed
<hi>Bancroft</hi> to write unto all the Bishops to deal moderately
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h the Puritans, which Letter is extant in print, as full
of moderation, and gentle cautions, as possibly could be
expected. But that mild proceeding of <hi>Bancroft</hi> and the
Bishops, and forbearing to bring them to obedience and
submission by Ecclesiastical censures and other courses,
which might have been taken, to put a final end to their
wrangling humours, gave the Puritans hope to find the like
favour always, in succeeding times, as they did under
Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> which Levity and forbearance, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the present troubles of these times, in great part.</p>
               <p>But the Puritans are an implacable generation, who did
only forbear till they had a further opportunity to promote
their designs. Which now they have in great part effected
and verified the praediction of <hi>Bancroft</hi> and <hi>Hooker.</hi> Who
did foresee plainly their restless disposition, and endlesse
contentions, not caring to set fire on the whole Kingdome,
as they have done these last 40. years, in <hi>Germany, Bohemia,</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> upon the same grounds and principles as our
Puritans have done among us.</p>
               <p>Being indeed secretly displeased, because the Puritans
were not preferred to the best offices and dignities in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66402:43"/>
Church, and Common-wealth, which now they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
by open force and violence, in most outragious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
especially the Puritan Ministers without any regard
to the Laws of God or man, thrusting themselves into the
best preferments, by way of Sequestration; and then get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Acts and Orders to be continued in for their lives,
without any respect to the Title of the lawful patrons, whose
rights they set aside and suspend as well as the Incumbents,
most unjustly. Whereas they are neither by desert for
Learning nor education in the Universities, capable of the
best preferments, they being only such as have been only
poor Lecturers, poor Vicars, poor Schoolmasters, and
poor new lights, such as are not qualified as the Statute
requires, to enjoy the best Livings of Value. 13. <hi>Elizab.

by authority, rather then by reason and argument; they
being so impious, insolent and blasphemous; so after his

being two Courts, where did arise many differences and

<hi>Similes praefectis praetorio,</hi> who were <hi>Illustres Iudices,</hi> and so

and made the Bishops the Judges in the Church, as the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecti

whom we now call Chancellors (as a learned <hi>Civilian</hi>

for it; as if no calling, government, or subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of officers in the Church were lawful, but what
is expressely and fully set down in the Scriptures, and no

For the law parallels them in the Church with
the Chief Judges in the Empire, as well in this, as in
the rests of the Parts of their Honour, wherewith the
Emperour had honoured them and the Laws honour
them at this day. <hi>Iustinians</hi> Code hath sundry lawes, some
of his own, some of the Emperours before him, even
from the dayes of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great: which shew that
Bishops in their Episcopal audience, sate not without
their Chancellors; although their Chancellors sate often
without the Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose higher charge in <hi>Christs Church</hi>
permitted not the Bishops presence in Court-Causes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily.
And though not under the name and title of

offices. <hi>Ecclesiastic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

officers and office, that the Bishops vicar-generals then
were, and now are, who together with the Bishops then
made and do now make, but one and the same Tribunal and
Consistory: their Commissions they held from the Bishops,
but their Jurisdiction from the Law. And the Cause why
the Imperial power furnished the Bishops with these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
was the multitude and variety of Ecclesiastical Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
more in that age then now, the decision whereof in
their Consistories being left to the Bishops, the Emperor
doubted might have drawn them from prayers and divine
exercises. And a second reason was, that the cause of the
cognisance of their Courts, were more likely to have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a more speedy, ready, and Judicious trial, before Judges
of the same learning, which require a whole man, then
before Judges of another, then an higher, requiring (as
the Bishops pastoral office doth) a whole man too. And
a third reason also may be added, because the Clerks suites
and quarrels, should not be divulged, and spread abroad
amongst the secular sort, which trenched many times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole profession, especially in capital matters,
wherein Princes anciently so much tendered the Clergy,
that if a Clerk had committed an offence worthy of death
or open shame, whereby he became perpetually infamous,
he was not first executed or put to open shame, before he
was degraded by the Bishop and his Clergy, and so was
executed and put to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hame, not as a Clerk, but as a lay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,
for the Honour and Dignity of <hi>Priesthood.</hi> It
were to be wished this Order were retained still, that
Clerks should not passe immediately, when they fall into
such excesses, from the Altar to the Halter: but hang or
suffer other shame without their <hi>Priesthood;</hi> which Order
if it were retained still, or might be restored, would much
honour the Church, and no whit derogate from the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Crown.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is by the warrant of Christ himself
that the Church doth claim and execute a
Spiritual Jurisdiction in punishing the
offences of her Children: For it can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an accusation against the inordinate
courses of any Christian, and hath power
to chastise him, being by sufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
convicted, either by denying him the Sacraments, or
if he continue obstinate in his wickednesse, by an utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of him from the fellowship and Communion of
other Christians. I know none so malignant or unskilful in
Ecclesiastical affairs, that will deny this authority, which
indeed goes not beyond excommunication, to have been
conferred upon Churchmen from the beginning by Divine
Institution: But in this our Church, Christian princes
have further allowed the Clergy authority, by virtue
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66402:46"/>
whereof they inflict civil punishments, on Hereticks, Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
and other despisers of the Church. As also many
sage and grave Divines are in divers places, endowed with
the publick power of Justices of peace: Concerning this
jurisdiction, let us inquire, whether it may lawfully be
granted to Churchmen, which that it may lawfully be done,
these following reasons have induced me to beleive.</p>
            <p>It is first to be considered,<note place="margin">Argum. 1,</note> that both these jurisdictions,
tend to the same end of promoting justice, and brideling
Vice; but with this difference: That that power, which
is meerly Spiritual makes use only of Spiritual means,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6,</note>
whereas the weapons of Civil authority be coactive and
external, as Imprisonment, Fines, and corporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Here therefore would I know, why it should be
esteemed a wicked and unlawful Act, not suiting to the
holy function of a priest, to correct Hereticks, Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and other like and notorious disturbers of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Common-wealths peace, as well with civil and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Chastisements, as those of the Spirit, where power
is given so to do, to resist and pull down Vices,—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</p>
            <p>To resist and pul down Vices by either way is a good and
plausible action, and of it self misbeseeming no person,
though never so holy.<note place="margin">Act. 12. 23.</note> The blessed Angels of heaven, deem
it a thing in no wise contrary to their Sanctity, in the name
and command of God, to smite the prophane with corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
punishments; why then should the Angels of the Church
think it not lawful, to adjudge the same Delinquents to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deserved punishments,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 1.</note> when by the Decree of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Gods Vicegerent here upon earth, it is so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined?
For the execution of Civil authority is not of it
self repugnant to any person how holy soever, nor disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
to the office of priesthood.</p>
            <p>Again the high and absolute power of the giver, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
me that Church-men do by good right exercise this
Jurisdiction.<note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> For the King being by Gods appointment,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.</note>
the Fountain of all Civil authority, may without offence
derive some rivolets thereof to what persons he shall think
fit, whether Lay or Ecclesiastical; I said but some rivolets,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66402:46"/>
because (though no Temporal office by Gods Laws are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
the Clergy) Wisdome and Equity permit not
Kings so far to burthen with State affairs, as wholly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3, 4.</note> from their spiritual function. This power
therefore is so to be intrusted to them, as it may be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
or furtherance to the Church-Government, no
hinderance or obstacle thereunto. But it is not for every
vulgar judgement, or envious piece to determine how far,
this Jurisdiction is to be granted to the Clergy, so that it
may help and not trouble them in their Ministry. But
what <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Life of Philosophers said, concerning
the mean in virtues, that it is to be ordered <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>as the wise man shall think fit,</hi> may be applied to this
Temporal Jurisdiction, that it is so far to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to Churchmen, as a judicious and wise prince shall
think convenient.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that it hath pleased christian Kings to arm the
Clergy with some civil jurisdiction, and ordain,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 2.</note> that to the
greater improvement of Christianity, and casting down
of wickednesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 3, 4.</note> they should exercise both Ecclesiastical
and civil jurisdiction, it is most apparently lawful and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and plainly necessary by the aid of both Jurisdictions,
as with a two-edged sword, to preserve piety and the peace
of the Church, and cut off its opposers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> because to many it seems unfitting, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
of the Apostles should exercise an authority which
the Apostles themselves had nothing to do with: Let us
observe the difference of times, and thence gather that
this civil Jurisdiction is as expedient and necessary to the
Divines of our time, as it was altogether unnecessary and
unprofitable to the Apostles. Civil Jurisdiction is by the
cheif Magistrate to be conferred on those that are subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,
and according to his Laws to be administred. As
long therefore as the Rulers of the earth waged war against
the truth of the Gospel, neither could they assign, nor
the Apostles without scandal to Christ and the downfall
of Religion, have received any temporal power from their
hands. But since Kings and their Laws began to subject
themselves to Christ, civil Authority by them given to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66402:47"/>
the Ministers of Christ, might have been a great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the advancement of the Gospel, and more happy
Government of the Church. Furthermore the Apostles
and Fathers of the primitive Church were from heaven en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with an extraordinary and miraculous power, which
did more avail to the confirmation of Christians in faith
and obedience, then any civil authority: But now the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church is in the hands of ordinary mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
who being disarmed of that divine and miraculous
power, are conveniently guarded with this Temporal and
ordinary Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Lastly, When the Christian Church was in her infancy,
piety was more deeply rooted in the breasts of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and if they would have resisted the Discipline of the
Church, their rebellious minds were soon quelled by the
cruelty of persecution, and hourly imminent danger of
violent death: But now the Christian world wholly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
and carried away with pride and Luxury, hath so clean
layed aside all respects of piety and modesty, that all the
spiritual power of the Clergy and Church-discipline, if
not seconded by civil jurisdiction, breeds rather scorn and
contempt, then amendment in the malicious remorse of this
present age.</p>
            <p>Think then what rash and incompetent Judges they are,
who from the Apostles, and their days conclude, temporal
Authority not requisite to our ordinary ministers.</p>
            <p>A fourth argument may be drawn from Gods own insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,<note place="margin">Argum. 4.</note>
and the most ancient practise of the Church: God
himself did annex civil jurisdiction to the office of <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
it is therefore no strange thing, nor against the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law, that a Clergy-man should bear sway in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affairs. <hi>[As appears fully in the former Treatise here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cap. 1. and 2. Where it is shewed, that in all Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in Israel, the priests and Levites were the principal Iudges,
both in the great Councel sitting in the Temple at Ierusalem, and
in the second Court of Iudgement residing in principal Cities.]
Eli, Samuel,</hi> the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> together with all the High-priests
in the Old Testament, did exercise this kind of
authority: But why it continued not for some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66402:47"/>
years after the Gospel, is made evident by reasons
above alleadged. But since <hi>Constantine</hi> the great submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Imperial Scepter to Christ, you shall in all ages
find the godly Bishops and Fathers of the Church admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
Civil Jurisdiction by Religious Emperours to them
imparted; which if time would serve might be clearly
testified, out of Ecclesiastical Histories and Councels, and
out of the Emperours own laws; but these are so sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to the learned, that the citation thereof would
prove an unnecessary trouble.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Argum. 5.</note> let us out of our adversaries own grants and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
prove what themselves deny. They grant the Clergy
a jurisdiction whereby they can cite before their Courts,
Hereticks, Drunkards, Adulterers, and such like infamous
persons; admit accusations against them, hear and examine
witnesses, and give sentence of excommunication on those
that are lawfully convicted. If by vertue of spiritual ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
from Christ received, they can do these things,
why shall they not by the accession of secular jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by the King conferred, imprison the same male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
or by such like civil punishments restrain their
base incontinencies? This Act of correction is no
less warrantable in its own nature then that of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication:
both being put in execution by just and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
authority, niether do corporal punishments, lesse
conduce to the Reformation of delinquents, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
good, then those meerly spiritual. Therefore by the
allowance of superiour authority, it is no less expedient,
that Clergy-men should inflict one kind of chastisement,
rather then another. In a word learned M. <hi>Calvin</hi> doth grant
that what Controversies soever happened between Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to avoid strife and division they were wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
them to their Bishops by their judgment to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.<note place="margin">De opere Monach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r. 28.</note>
And St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, that he dayly spent some
time in secular affairs, either by his sentence determining
and setling them, or cutting them off by his interposition.
Furthermore he records that St. <hi>Paul</hi> employed Church-men
in such troublesome matters: If private Christians do
lawfully commit their civil Controversies to the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66402:48"/>
of Bishops, surely Christian Kings may to the same
Bishops lawfully commit the judgment of the like Causes:
if at the request of private men, it be nor unlawful for
Church-men to intermedle with secular businesses, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unlawful to do the same by the appointment of the
King. For as the matter stands, he doth no less interest
himself in state affaires, who decides controversies as an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Arbitrator,</hi> then he who decides the same as a <hi>Iudge or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by the Prince.</hi> Let us conclude, that ambitiously to
hunt after, or with prejudice to the Function of <hi>Priesthood,</hi>
to exercise Civil Jurisdiction from the hand of a King,
and to administer the same to the better establishing of the
peace and discipline of the Church, is an Act lawful and
praise-worthy, most agreeable to the ancient practice of
the Church, and no wayes repugnant to the Divine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p>To this Determination of the learned Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi>
there is nothing replied by Dr. <hi>Burgesse,</hi> but in an insolent
manner, he terms him onely a speculative Divine, as if
such a famous professor in the university, and a most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Bishop for twenty years together, who was highly
reputed for learning and piety, should be so scornfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by one that never spent seven years in the university,
nor ever enjoyed any fellowship, a place of continuance
in any Colledge, to gain more then common learning in
a trivial way; as appeared fully when he came back to the
University to go out Doctor, and would needs take upon
him to answer the Divinity Act, which he performed so
contemptibly, that he was hissed and scorned publickly
by all the Auditors, and accordingly censured by Doctor
<hi>Prideaux,</hi> who reprehended him sharply in publick for his
ignorance and insuffiency: and some Papists, who are
commonly present at such publick Acts among the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
hearing him to be so destitute of Latine, Logick,
and distinctions upon the state of his questions, publickly
were heard to say,—<hi>Alass poor black sheep, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
thee here?</hi> Whereof I was both an eye, and ear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>But as is formerly affirmed, if some principal men of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66402:48"/>
the Clergy be not in places of Authority, and Judicature,
and some be not Justices of the Peace in every Shire, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Clergy will be trampled on by the vulgar people
in most vile manner, taxed, and assessed unreasonably by
Constables, and Committee-men, and all such officers, as is
well-known by many instances, which might be alledged
and are commonly known: to say nothing of the insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Souldiers, and Quarter-masters, who will be sure
when they come to any parish to set first upon the Ministers
house, and furnish him with company enough to consume all
that he hath in barnes, or buttery, without any mercy, or
compassion, which may be easily proved, but that it is a
thing notoriously known, past denial; so that the Clergy may
complain with the Apostle, <hi>that they are made the fisth of the
world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and are the off scouring of all things to this day.</hi> And all
this done by the Parliament-members and officers, who
pretended to advance religion, to maintain and uphold
Ministery, as well as Magistracy. But the Laws being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, or suspended, whereby Ministers should be
preserved and maintained, there is risen up such a swarm
of Sectaries, Anabaptists, Quakers, and a rascal rabble of
others who deny the calling of ministers, and are as ready
to oppress them in as violent manner, as those Rebels that
did rise in the 5. <hi>Rich. 2. Wat Tyler, Iack Straw, Iack
Shepherd, Tom Millar, Hob. Carter.</hi> and such like fellows,
as <hi>Cowper</hi> relateth them in his <hi>Epitome of Chronicles:</hi> and
as <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> reporteth in the Confession of <hi>Iack Straw</hi> at his
death, They would <hi>have destroyed all Bishops, Monks, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and Parsons, and would have dispatched them all: Only
begging Friers should have lived, that might have sufficed for
ministring the Sacraments in the whole Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor begging Friers having no good Lands or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
were not the object of the peoples malice; but all rich
men, Lords, and Gentlemen, especially Clergy men, should
have been made a prey: And so, or worse is the Case of
the Clergy in these times: All principal al learned Divines,
if they have any Estates, are miserably cast out of their
houses and livings, <hi>Bishops, Deanes,</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of any eminent note are shamefully persecuted: Only
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66402:49"/>
               <hi>poor Curats, poor Lecturers, poor New-lights, poor School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,</hi>
who are like the begging Friers, are suffered to
continue, and yet the Anabaptists, and Quakers, and
such like are ready to cashier them, to pull down Churches
Steeple-houses and Stone-houses, as they call Churches
in derision: but as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>there is no new thing under
the Sun:</hi> from the beginning of the world to the end it is
so, that necessitous men, theeves, and beggars will seise
upon the estates of rich men, if they have once power in
their hands, and can but lay hold on them.</p>

            <p>I Shall desire as much water or time, of your Honorable
Lordships, as your Lordships can well afford in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
because all that I intend to speak in this business,
must be to your Lordships onely, as Resolved for mine
own part, to make hereafter no Remonstrance at all to
his most excellent Majesty for these several reasons.</p>
            <p>1. That I have had occasion of late to know, that our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
(whom God bless and preserve) is, I will not say
above other Princes, but above all Christian men, that
ever I knew or heard of, a man of most upright, dainty
and scrupulous Conscience, and afraid to look upon some
actions, which other Princes abroad do usually swallow up
and devour: I know (for I have the Monuments in my
own Custody) what Oath, or rather oaths, his Majesty
hath taken at his Coronation, to preserve all the rights and
Liberties of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And you know very
well, that Church-men are never sparing in their Rituals or
Ceremonials, to amplifie and swell out the Oaths of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66402:49"/>
in that kind: Your Lordships then know right well,
that he is sworn at that time to observe punctually the laws
of K. <hi>Edward.</hi> The first Law whereof, as you may see in
<hi>Lambards Saxon</hi> Laws, is to preserve entirely the peace,
the possessions, and the rights and priviledges of the Church;
And truly I shall never put my Masters Conscience that I
find resenting and punctillious, when it is not bound up
with oaths and protestations, to swallow such Gudgeons,
as to fil it self with these doubts and scruples.</p>
            <p>2. My second Reason is, that if his Majesty were free
from all these Oaths and Protestations, I durst not without
some fair invitation from himself, advise his Majesty to
run shocks and oppositions against the Votes of both these
great Houses of Parliament.</p>
            <p>3. And lastly, if I were secretly invi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mine own heart and sense, and not binding any of
my brethren in this opinion, if I found the major part of
this House, to pass this bill without much qualification,
I should never have the boldnesse, nor desire to sit any

House.</p>
            <p>And therefore my Honourable Lords, here I have fixt my
<hi>Areopagus,</hi> and dernier resort, beign not like to make any
further appeal: Which makes me humbly desire your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to speak for some longer time, then I have accustomed
in a Committee: In which length I hope notwithstanding to
use a great deal of brevity; Some length in the whole, and
much shortnesse in every particular head, which I mean so
to distinguish and beat out, that not only your Lordships,
but the Lords my brethren may enlarge themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the particulars, which neither my abilities of body
can perform, nor doth my intention nor purpose aim at
at this time. I will therefore cast this whole bill into six
several heads, wherein I hope to comprehend all that I
shall say, or any man else can materially touch upon in
this bill.</p>
            <p>The first is the Rise or Motive of this Bill,<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> which is
the duty of men in holy orders: For the words are persons
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66402:50"/>
in holy Orders o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght not to intermeddle,—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And
this duty of ministers may be taken in this place two
several wayes, either for their duty in point of Divinity:
or for their duty in point of Convenience, which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call policy. In regard of either of these duties,
it may be conceived that men in holy orders, ought not to
intermeddle in secular affairs,—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And
this is the Motive, Rise and Ground of this bill.</p>
            <p>The second point are the persons concerned in this bill,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note>
which are Arch-bishops, Bishops, Parsons, Vicars, and
all other in holy orders.</p>
            <p>The third point contains the things inhibited from this
time forward to such persons by this Bill,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> and they are of
several sorts and natures.</p>
            <p>First, Freeholds and Rights of such persons, as their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages,
votes, and legislative power in parliament.</p>
            <p>Secondly matters of princely favours, as to Sit in Star-chamber,
to be called to the Council-board, to be Justice
of peace,—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Thirdly, matters of a mixt or concrete nature, that
seem to be both Freeholds, and favours of former princes,
as the Charters of some of the Bishops, and some of the
ancient Cathedrals are conceived to be. And these are all
the matters, or things inhibited from those persons in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
orders, by this present bill.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> the manner of this Inhibition, which is of
a double nature first under a high and severe penalty; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
under a <hi>Cains</hi> mark, an eternal kind of disability or
incapacity laid upon them from enjoying hereafter any
of these Freeholds, rights, favours, or Charters of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
princes; and that which is the heaviest point of all,
without killing of <hi>Abel,</hi> or any Crime laid to their charge
more then that in the beginning of the bill it is said,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oundly, and in the style of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> that they ought not
to intermeddle in secular affairs.</p>
            <p>The fifth point is a <hi>Salvo</hi> for the two Universities,<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> but
none for the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> nor for the Bishop of

hope in God, will prove not only a <hi>salvo</hi> to those honourable
persons, (whereof if we of the Clergy were but so happy,
as to have any competent number of our Coat.—<hi>quot
Thebarum portae, vel divitis ostia Nili,</hi> This bill surely had
perisht in the womb, and never come to the birth) yet I
hope that this clause will prove to this bill, a <hi>felo de se,</hi> and
a murtherer of it self, and intended for a <hi>Salvo</hi> for noble
ministers only, prove a <hi>Salvo</hi> for all other ministers, that be
not so happy as to be nobly born; because the very poor
minister, for ought we find in Script<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re or Common reason,
is no more tyed to serve God in his Vocation, then these
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and nobly born ministers are. And therefore I hope
these noble ministers will deal so nobly, as to pull their
brethren the poor ministers out of the thorns and briers of
this bill. And these are all the true heads and contents of
this bill. And amongst these six heads, Your Lordships shall
be sure to find me; and I shall expect to find your Lordships
in the whole tract of this Committee. And now with your
Lordships honourable leave and patience, I will run them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
almost as breifly as I have pointed &amp; pricked them down.</p>
            <p>For the first,<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> the rise and motive of this bill, which is
the duty of men in holy orders not to intermeddle with
secular affairs, must arise either from a point of divinity,
or from point of conveniency or policy: And I hope in
God it will not appear to your Lordships that there is any
ground either of divinity or policy, to inhibit men in orders
so modestly to intermeddle with secular affairs, as that the
measure of intermedling in such affairs, shall not hinder
and obstruct the duties of their calling. They ought not so
to intermeddle in secular affairs, as to neglect their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
no more ought Lay-men neither; for they have a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Vocation, wherein they are to walk, as ministers
have, they have wise and children and families to care for,
and they are not to neglect these to live upon Warrants and
Recognizances, to become a kind of Sir <hi>Francis Michel,</hi> or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66402:51"/>
an <hi>Ignotus nimis</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> calls it; That place 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 4.
No man that wars, entangles himself with the affairs of this life,</hi>
will be found to be applied by all good Interpreters, to
Laymen as well as Church-men, and under favour nothing
at all to this pupose: Besides that the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
doth point at a man that is so wholly taken up with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of this life, that he utterly neglects the offices and
duties of a Christian man; and so I leave that place as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of any other exposition nor ever otherwise inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
but by Popes, Legars, and Canonists, that make a
Nose of Waxe, of every place of Scripture they touch
upon.</p>
            <p>But that men in holy orders ought not in a moderate
manner, together with the duties of their calling, to help
and assist in the Government of the Common-wealth if
they be thereunto lawfully called by the Soveraign prince,
can never be proved by any good divinity: For in the law
of nature, before the Deluge, and a long time after, it is
a point that no man will deny me, that the eldest of the
Family was both the priest and the magistrate.</p>
            <p>Then the people were taken out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron: Moses and Aaron amongst his Priests,</hi> as it
is in the psalm; Then there was a form of a Common-wealth,
fetcht from heaven indeed, and planted upon the
earth, and Iudiciary laws dictated for the reiglement
of the same. Nor do I much care, though some men shall
say, that persons in holy orders ought not to intermed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le
in secular affairs, when that great God of heaven and earth
doth appoint them to intermeddle with all the principal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of that estate, witnesse the exorbitant power of the
High priest in secular matters, the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> the 23. the
Judges of the Gate, which were the most of them Priests
and Levites. And the Church-men of that estate were not
all Butchers and Slaughter-men: For they had their Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
their Synagogues, their Prayers, Preaching, and
other exercises of piety: In a word we have <hi>Divinius,</hi> but
they had <hi>operosius ministerium,</hi> as St, <hi>Augustin</hi> speaketh. Our
Ministry takes up more of our thoughts, but theirs took
up more of their Labours and Industry: Nor is it any matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:66402:51"/>
that this Common-wealth is no more in being<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in sufficeth
it hath been once, and that planted by God himself, who
would never have appointed persons in holy orders, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
with things they ought not to intermedle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
I will go on with my Chronology of persons in holy
orders, and only put you in mind of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Judges of <hi>Sadocks</hi> imployment under King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
of <hi>Iehojadas</hi> under his Nephew King <hi>Ioash,</hi> and would
fain know what hurt those men in holy orders did, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling
in secular affairs of that time, Now we are
returned from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I desire you to
look upon the whole race of the Macchabees, even to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi>
the last of them all, taken prisoner by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
crucified afterwards by <hi>Mark Anthony.</hi> And shew me any
one of those Princes (a woman or two excepted) that was
not a Priest and a Magistrate.</p>
            <p>We are now come to Christs time, when me thinks I
hear St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 23. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> excuse himself,
for reviling of the high priest: <hi>I wist not Brethren that he
was the high priest,</hi> for it is written, <hi>Thou shalt not speak evil
of the Ruler of thy people,</hi> Where observe, that the word
Ruler in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the very same word that is
used by St. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 13. 3. where this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
by <hi>Peza, Magistrates.</hi> Then you must be pleased to
imagine the Church asleep or almost dead under rersecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for almost 300. years, until the happy days of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Constantine,</hi> and not expect to find many Magistrates
among the Christians: Yet shall you find St. <hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi> 6.
5. offend against this Bill, and intermeddle knuckle-deep,
with secular affairs, by inhibiting the <hi>Corintbians</hi> very sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for their Chicanery, their petty-foggery, and Common
battery, in going to Law one with another. Besides that
as all learned men agree, both the Apostles and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
men that lived presently after them had a miraculous
power of punishing exorbitant crimes, which supplied
the power of the ordinary Magistrate; as appears in <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
and <hi>Saphyra,</hi> the incestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But then from <hi>Constantines</hi> age, till the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> Church-men were so usually imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66402:52"/>
in managing of secular affairs that I shall confesse inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously,
that it was too much, there lying an appeal from
the Courts of the Empire to the Bishops judicatory, as
you shall find it every where in the <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Iustinian.</hi> So was
it under <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> and all the Carolovingian Line
of our neighbour Country of <hi>France.</hi> So and somewhat
more it was with us, in the Saxon Heptarchy, the Bishop
and the Sheriffe sitting together cheek by joule in their
Towns and Courts: But these exorbitant and vast imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in secular affairs I stand not up to defend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will hasten to the Reformation: Whereas Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
in the Fourth Book of his Institutions, and eleventh Dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inction,
doth confesse that the holy men heretofore did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their Controversies to the Bishop to avoid troubles
in Law: you shall find that from <hi>Luther</hi> to this present day
in all the Fluxe of time, in all Nations, in all manner of
Reformations, persons in holy orders were thought fit
to intermeddle with secular affairs: <hi>Brentius</hi> was a privy
Counsellour to his Duke and Prince. <hi>Functius</hi> was a Privy
Counsellour to the great Duke of <hi>Borussia,</hi> as it is too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
known to those that are vers'd in Histories. <hi>Calvin</hi>
and <hi>Beza</hi> whilst they lived, carried all the Council of the
State of <hi>Geneva,</hi> under their own Gowns. <hi>Bancroft</hi> in his
Survey <hi>cap.</hi> 26. observeth, that they were of the Councel
of State there, which consisteth of threescore. And I
have my self known <hi>Abraham Sculteius,</hi> a privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
to the Prince Palatine: Reverend <hi>Mousieur du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
for many years together a Councellour to the Princesse
of <hi>Sedan:</hi> His Brother in Law <hi>Mounsieur Rivel,</hi> a great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
personage now in <hi>England,</hi> of the Privy Councel of
the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> You all hear, and I know much
good by his former writings of a learned man called Mr.
<hi>Henderson,</hi> and most of your Lordships understand better
then I, what imployment he hath at this time in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And truly I do beleive, that there is no reformed
Church in the World, setled and constituted by the State,
wherein it is held for a point in divinity, that persons in
holy orders, ought not to intermeddle with secular affairs:
which is all I shall say of the duty of ministers in point of
divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:66402:52"/>
Now I come to the second duty of men in holy orders,<note place="margin">Sect. 2,</note>
in point of conveniency or policy; and am clearly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that even in this regard and reflexion, they ought
not to be debarred from modestly intermedling in secular
affairs. For if there be any such inconveniency, it must
needs arise from this, that to exercise some secular juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
must be evil in it self, or evil to a person in holy
orders: Which is neither so nor so. For the whole office
of a subordinate civil Magistrate is most exactly described
in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4. and no man can add or detract from
the same. The civil power is a divine ordinance, set up to
be a Terror to the evil, and an incouragement to good
works: This is the whole compass of the civil power. And
therefore I do here demand with that most learned Bishop
<hi>Davenant,</hi> that within a few dayes did sit by my side, in
the eleventh Question of his Determinations: What is
there of impiety, what of unlawfulnesse, what unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
either the holynesse or calling of a priest, in terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bad, or comforting the good Subject, in repressing
of sin, and punishing of sinners. For this is the whole and
intire Act of civil jurisdiction: It is in its own nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to no person, to no function, to no sort or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, let them hold themselves never so holy,
never so seraphical, it becomes them very well to repress
sin and punish sinners; that is to say, to exercise in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
manner civil jurisdiction, if the Soveraign shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it. And you shall find that this doctrine of debarring
persons in holy orders from secular imployments, is no
doctrine of the Reformed, but the Popish Church, and first
brought into this Kingdome by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<hi>Lambiths, Lanfranc, Anselme, Stephen Langton,</hi> and the
test, together with <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Othobon,</hi> and to this only end;
that the man of <hi>Rome,</hi> might withdraw all the Clergy of
this Kingdome, from their obligations to the King and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
who were most of them great Princes in those times,
and thereby might establish and create (as in a great part he
did) <hi>regnum in regno,</hi> a Kingdome of Sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elings in the midst
of this Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> And hence came those Canons
of mighty consequence, able to shoot up a priest at one
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66402:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shot into heaven: as that he must not meddle with matters
of blood; that he must not exercise civil jurisdiction, not
be a Steward to a Noble man in his house, and all the rest
of this <hi>Palea</hi> and Garbage: That is, in plain English, the
Priest must no longer receive obligations from either King
or Lords, but wholly depend upon his holy Fathers, the
Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Pope of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> or at least wise
pay him soundly for their Dis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ensations and Absolutions,
when they presume to do the contrary. In the mean time,
here is not one word or shew of Reason, to inform an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
man, that persons in holy orders ought not
to terrifie the bad, and comfort the good, to repress sin,
and chastise sinners; which is the <hi>summa totalis</hi> of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistracy, and consequently so fat forth at the least
to intermeddle with secular affairs, And this is all that I
shall say, touching the motive and ground of this Bill, and
that persons in holy orders ought not to be inhibited from
intermedling in secular affairs, either in point of divinity,
or in point of conveniency and policy.</p>
            <p>The second point consists of the persons reflected upon
in this Bill, which are Archbishops, Bishops, Parsons,
Vicars, and all others in holy orders: of which point I
shall say little; only finding these names hudled up in
an heap, made me conceive at first, that it might have some
relation to Mr. <hi>Bagshawes</hi> reading in the middle Temple,
which I ever esteemed to have been very inoffensively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by that learned Gentleman, and with little discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
questioned by a great Ecclesiastick then in place. For
all that he said was this, That when the Temporal Lords,
are more in voices then the Spiritual, they may passe a Bill
without consent of the Bishops, which is an assertion so
clear in reason, and so often practised, upon the Records
and Rolls of Parliament, that no man any way vers'd in
either of these, can make any doubt of it, nor do I:
Though I humbly conceive no President will be ever found
that the Prelates were ever excluded, otherwise then by
their own folly, fear or headinesse; For the point of being
Justices of peace the Gentleman confesseth he never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Arch-bishops, nor Bishops, nor with any Clergy
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66402:53"/>
man made a Justice by his Majesties Commission. In the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
made 34. <hi>Ed. 3. c.</hi> 1. He finds assignees for the keeping of
the Peace one Lord, and with him 3. or 4. of the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
men of the County, the troublesome times did then
so require it, and if God do not bless us with the riddance
of these two armies, the like provision will be now as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
He finds these men included, but doth not find
Church-men excluded; no not in the Statute 13. <hi>Rich. 2.
cap.</hi> 7. that requires Justices of peace to be made of Knights,
Esquires, and Gentlemen of the Law, of the most suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
of each County: In which words the Gentleman
thinks Clerks were not included, and I clearly say by his
favour, they are not excluded: Nor do the learned Sages
of the Law, conceive them to be excluded by that Statute.
If the King shall command the Lord Keeper to fill up the
Commissions of each County, with the most sufficient
Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen of the Law, shall the
Lord Keeper thereupon exclude the Noble-men and the
Prelates? I have often in my dayes received this Command
but never heard of this interpretation before this time: So
that I cannot conceive from what ground this general
sweep-stake of Arch-bishops, Bishops, Parsons, Vicars
and all others in holy orders should proceed. I have heard
since the beginning of my sicknesse, that it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
in this House, that the Clergy in the sixth of <hi>Edw.</hi>
the third, did disavow that the custody of the peace did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them at all, and I beleive that such a thing is to be
found amongst the Notes of the priviledges of this House:
But first you must remember, that it was in a great storm,
and when the waters were much troubled, and the wild
people unapt to be kept in orders by Miters and Crosiers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staves:
But yet if that noble Lord, shall be pleased to
cast his eye upon the Roll it self, he shall find that this
poor excuse did not serve the Prelates turns: Fot they were
compelled with a witnesse, to defend their parts of the
preservation of the peace of the Kingdome, as well as the
Noble men and Gentry: And you shall find the ordinance
to this effect set down upon that Roll. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with that Noble Lords favour, that the sweeping of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66402:54"/>
all the Clergy out of Temporal offices, is a motion of the
first impression; and was never heard of in the English
Common-wealth before this Bill.</p>
            <p>I come in the third place to the main part of this cause,
the things to be severed from all men in holy orders: which
are as I told you of three kinds. First, matters of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
as the Bishops votes in parliament and Legislative
power. Secondly, matters of favour as to be a Judge in
Star-chamber, to be a privy Counsellour, to be a Justice
of peace, or a Commissioner in any Temporal affairs.
Thirdly, and mixt matters of Freehold and Favour too,
as the Charters of some Bishops: and many of the ancient
Cathedrals of this Kingdome, who allow them a Justice or
two within themselves, or their Close as they call it, and
exempt those grave and learned men from the rudenesse and
insolency of Tapsters, Brewers, Inn-keepers, Tailours,
and Shoomakers, which do integrate and make up the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of our Country Cities, and Incorporations. And now
is the Axe laid to the very root of the Ecclesiastical tree,
and without your Lordships justice and favour, all the
branches are to be lopt off quite, with those later clauses,
and the Stock and root it self, to be quite gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bb'd and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
up, by that first point of abolishing all Vote and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
power in all Clergy men, leaving them to be no
longer any part of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> but meer Slaves
and Bondmen to all intents and purposes: And the priests
of <hi>England</hi> one degree inferiour to the priests of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi>
being to be accounted worse then the Tayle of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Now I hope no <hi>English</hi> man will doubt, but this Vote
and Representation in Parliament, is not only a freehold,
but the greatest freehold that any Subject in <hi>England,</hi> or
in all the Christian world, can brag of at this day, that we
live under a King, and are to be governed by his Laws,
that is, not by his arbitrary Edicts or Rescripts, but by
such Laws confirmed by him, and assented to by us, either in
our proper persons, or in our Assignees, and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:66402:54"/>
This is the very Soul and Genius of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and
without this one spirit, that great Statute is little lesse,
then <hi>Littera occidens,</hi> a dead and uselesse peice of paper.
You heard it most truly opened unto you, by a wise and
judicious Peer of this House, that <hi>legem patere quam ipse
tuleris,</hi> was a Motto wherein <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> had not
more interest, then every true born <hi>English</hi> man: No for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shillings man in <hi>England,</hi> but doth in person or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
enjoy his freedome and liberty: The prelates of
this Kingdome, as a Looking-glass and Representation of
the Clergy, have been in possession hereof these thousand
years and upwards. The princes of the <hi>Norman</hi> race, for
their own ends, and to strengthen themselves with men
and money, erected the Bishopricks soon after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
into Baronies, and left them to sit in that House with
their double capacities about them; the later invented
for the profit of the prince, not excluding the former,
remaining always from the beginning for the profit and
concernment of the poor Clergy: Which appears not only
by the Saxon Laws set forth by Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry
Spelman,</hi> but also by the Bishops Writs and Summons to
parliament, in use to this very day. We have many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedents,
upon the Rolls, that in Vacancy of Episcopal
Seas, the Guardian of the Spirituals, though but a simple
priest, hath been called to sit in this Honourable House,
by reason of that former Representation: and such an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
I was my self over that Sea (whereof I am Bishop) some
25, years agoe, and might then have been summoned by
Writ unto this Honourable House, at that very time by
reason of the Spiritualty of that Diocesse, which then as
a simple priest, I did by virtue of the aforesaid office repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
And therefore most noble Lords, look upon the
Ark of God representative, that in this time floates in great
danger, in this deluge of waters: If there be any <hi>Cham,</hi>
or unclean Creature therein; out with him, and let every
man bear his own Burthen, but save the Ark, for God and
Christ Jesus his sake, who hath built it in this Kingdome,
for saving of people; and your Lordships are too wise to
conceive that the Word and Sacraments, the means of our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66402:55"/>
Salvation, will be ever effectually received from those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
whose persons shall be so vilified and dejected, as
to be made no parcels or fragments of this Commonwealth:

               </gap> he could not bring the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into disgrace by errors, and Heretical opinions, he
invented this project, (and much applanded his wit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
by casting slight and contempt upon the preachers and
ministers. And my Noble Lords, you are too wise to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
what the Common people talk, that we have a vote
in the election of Knights and Burgesses, and consequently
some Figure and Representation in the Noble House of
Commons: They of the Ministry have no vote in these ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
they have no Representation in that Honourable
House, and these contrary assertions are so slight and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
as I will not offer to give them any answer. And
therefore right Honourable Lords, have a special care of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> your Mother in this point; and as
God hath made you the most noble of all the peers of the
Christian World, so do not you give way, that our Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
shall be taught henceforth, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were, in the
time of the first and second Punick wars, by their Slaves
and Bond-men only, and that the Church of God in this
Island, may come to be served by the most ignoble Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that ever have been seen in the Christian Church,
since the passion of our Saviour. And so much for the first
thing, which this Bill intends to sever from persons in holy
orders, <hi>viz.</hi> votes &amp; representations in parliament. The next
thing to be severed from them by this Bill, is of a much ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
mettal and alloy, sittings in Star Chamber, sittings at
Councel-Table, sitting in Commissions of the peace and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commissions of secular affairs, which are such favours
and graces of Christian princes, as the Church may have a
being and subsistence without them: The Fortunes of our
<hi>Greece,</hi> do not depend upon these Spangles; and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
prince hath imparted and withdrawn these kind of
favours without the envy or regret of any wise Ecclesiastical
persons. But my Noble Lords this is the Case. Our King
hath by the Statute restored unto him the Head-ship of the

as I.</p>
            <p>The last robe that some persons, in holy orders, are
to be stript of, hath a kind of mixture of Freehold and
favour, of the proper right, and the graces of the King,
which are certain old Charters, that some few Bishops,
and many ancient and Cathedral Churches have purchased
&amp; procured from the ancient Kings before &amp; since the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
to inable them to live quiet in their own pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cincts and
close (as they call it) under a Justice or two, of their
own body, without being abandoned upon every slight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the injuries and vexations of Mechanical Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
of which your Lordships best know, these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Incorporations do most consist: Now whether these
few Charters have their foundation by favour, or by right,
I should conceive under your Lordships favour it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
favour nor right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o take them away, without some
just crime objected and proved; for if they be abused in
any particular, Mr. Attorney General can find an ordinary
remedy to repair the same by a Writ of <hi>Ad quod damnum,</hi>
without troubling of the two Houses of Parliament, and
this is all I shall speak to this point.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the fourth part of this bill,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> which
is the manner of Inhibition, heavy every way, heavy in
the penalty, heavier a great deal in the incapacity, the
weighing of penalty: will you consider I beseech you,
the small wyers, that is, poor Causes, that are to induce
the same, and then the heavy lead that hangs upon these
wyers. It is thus, if a natural subject of <hi>England</hi> in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and petition of Right, as well, as
any other; yet being a person in holy orders, shall happen
unfortunately to vote in Parliament, to obey his Prince
by way of Councel, or by way of a Commissioner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
thereunto; then is he presently to loose and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
for his first offence all his Means and Livelyhood
for one year, and for the second to forfeit his Freehold in
that kind for ever, and ever. And I do not believe that
your Lordships ever saw such an heavy weight of censure,
hang upon such thin wyers of reasons, in any Act of
Parliament made heretofore. This peradventure may
move others most, but it does not me; it is not the penalty,
but the incapacity, and as the Philosophers would call it,
the natural impotency, imposed by this Bill on men, in
holy orders to serve the King, or the State in this kind,
be they otherwise never so able, never so willing, not
never so vertuous; which makes me draw a kind of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthes</hi>
vail over this point, and leave it without any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification
at all, unto your Lordships wise and inward
thoughts, and considerations.</p>
            <p>The fifth point is the <hi>Salvo</hi> made for the two Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">Sect. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>
to have Justices of the peace amongst them of their
own heads of Houses, which I confess to be done upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and iust consideration, for otherwise the Scholers must
have gone for Justice, to those parties to whom they go for
their Mustard and Vinegar: but yet under favour the reasons
and inducements cannot be stronger, then may be found out
for other Ecclesiastical persons, as the Bishop of <hi>Durhans,</hi>
who was ever since the dayes of <hi>K. Iohn,</hi> suffered by the
Princes, and Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> to exercise justice upon
the parties in those parts, as being in truth the Kings
subjects, but the Bishops Tenents, and therefore not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have their Causes more duly weighed, then when the
ballance is left in the hand of their own proper Landlords.
The Case of the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> for some parts of that Isle,
is not much different, but if a little partiality doth not
herein cast some mist before mine eyes, the Case of the
Dean and, City of <hi>Westminster,</hi> wherein this Parliament is
now sitting, is far more considerable, both in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66402:56"/>
extent of Jurisdiction, and the warrants where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it is grounded, then any one of those places before
mentioned; for there is a clear Statute made <hi>27. Eliz.</hi> for
the drawing all <hi>Westminster,</hi> St. <hi>Clemenst,</hi> and St. <hi>Martins
le grand, London,</hi> into a Corporation, to be reigled, by a
Dean, a Steward, 12 Burgesses, and 12 Assistants. And
if some salve or plaister, shall not be applied unto <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
in this point, all that government and Corporation,
is at an end: But this I perceive since is taken into Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
by the Honorable House of Commons themselves.</p>
            <p>I come now to the last point,<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> and the second <hi>Salvo</hi> of
this Bill, which is for Dukes, Marquisses, Earls, Viscounts,
Barons, or Peers, of this Kingdome, which is a clause
that looks with a kind of contrary glance upon persons in
holy orders. It seems to favour some, but so that thereby,
and in that very Act, it casts an aspersion of baseness, and
ignobility upon all the rest of that holy profession; for if
no persons in holy orders ought to intermeddle in secular
affairs, how come these Nobles to be excepted out of
that universal negative? is it because they are nobly born?
then surely it must be granted that the rest must be excluded
as being made of a rough and base piece of clay: For the
second part of this reason in beginning of the Bill, can
never bear out this <hi>Salvo,</hi> that the office of the ministery
is of so great importance that it will take up the whole
man, and all his best endevours; Surely the office of the
ministry is of no greater importance in a poor man,
then in a noble man, nor doth it take away the whole man
in the one, and but a piece of him in the other; I cannot
give you many Instances herein out of Scripture, because
you know that in those dayes, <hi>not many mighty, not many
noble</hi> were called—&amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. but when any noble
were called, I do not find, but they did put more of the
whole man and their best endevours, upon the ministery,
then men in holy orders, are at the least in holy Scripture
noted to have done. I put your Lordships in mind of those
noblemen of <hi>Beraea,</hi> compared with those of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi>
in the 17. of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles: So that this <hi>Salvo</hi>
for the nobility must needs be (under your Lordships fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour)
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66402:57"/>
a secret wound unto the rest of the ministery, unlesse
your Lordships by your great wisdome will be willing to
change it into a <hi>Panacea</hi> &amp; commonplaister, both to the one,
and the other: and under your Lordships favour, I conceive
may be done upon a very forcing argument. The office of the
ministry is of equal importance &amp; takes up the whole man,
and all his best endevours in the noble born, as well as in the
mean born minister, but it is lawful all this notwithstanding,
for the noble born mininster to intermeddle with secular
affairs, and therefore it is likewise lawful for the mean
born so to do. And so in my Conscience I speak it, in the
presence of God, and great noble men; it is most lawful
for them to intermeddle with secular affairs, so as they
be not intangled, (as the Apostle calls it) with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling
as to slight and neglect the office of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which no minister noble or ignoble can do without
grievously sinning against God and his own Conscience:
It is lawful for persons in holy orders to intermeddle, it is
without question, or else they could not make provision
of meat and drink, as <hi>Beza</hi> interprets the place: It is
not lawful for them to be thus intangled and bound up
with secular affairs, which I humbly beseech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
to consider, not as a distinction invented by me, but
clearly expressed by the Apostle himself.</p>
            <p>And thus my noble Lords, I shall without any further
molestation, and with humble thanks for this great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
leave this great Cause of the Church to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
wise and gracious consideration: Here is my <hi>Mars-Hill,</hi>
and further I shall never appeal for justice. Some
assurance I have from the late solemn vote and protestation
of both Houses, for the maintaining and defending the
power, and priviledges of Parliament, that if this Bill
were now to be framed, in the one House, it would never
be offered without much qualification, as I perswade my
self it will not be approved in the other.</p>
            <p>Parliaments are indeed omnipotent, but no more omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
then God himself, who for all that cannot do every
thing. God cannot but perform his promise. A Parliament
(under favour) cannot unswear, what it hath already
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66402:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vowed. This is an old Maxime, which I have learned of
the Sages of the Law, a parliament cannot be <hi>felo de se,</hi> It
cannot destroy or undo it self.</p>
            <p>An Act of parliament (as that in the 11. and another in
the 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Rich. 2.)</hi> made to be unrepealable in any subsequent
parliament, was <hi>ipso facto,</hi> void in the constitution; why?
Because it took away the power and priviledges, that is,
not the plumes and feathers, the remote accidents, but the
very specifical forme, essence, and being of a parliament,
So if an Act should be made to take away the Votes of all
the Commons, or of all the Lords, it were absolutely a
void Act.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,
Cap</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. If the Foot shall say, because I am not the hand I

appears in Sir <hi>Henry Spelmans</hi> Edition of the Councells, at
the end of all such Assemblies and Councells, as were then
held. And whereas the Arch-bishop saith, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Norman race erected the Bishopricks into Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
it is very true, as <hi>Cambden</hi> sheweth in his <hi>Britannia,
pag.</hi> 170. And so the great Abbots also, heretofore by right
and custome were peers of the Kingdome, and did sit in
parliaments, to order, decree, and determine. But the
Conquerour ordained both Bishops and Abbots to be under
military Service, erecting every Bishop and Abbey at his
Will and pleasure, and appointing how many Soldiers he
would require of them to be furnished for him and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
in times of Hostility and War. So that the Tenure
and Title of Barons, being imposed on them, it was no
addition of honour to them, they being superiour to <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
or Barons though as <hi>Cambdon</hi> saith out of <hi>Mathew Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.
That which was then complained of by the Cleagy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

               <p>Whereas the Archbishop saith, That the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
the means of our Salvation, will not be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
received from those Ministers, whose persons shall be
so vilified and dejected as to be made no parcels or frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <p>This doth certainly prove too true, Religion it self is
vilified, and the Word of God and his Sacraments neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

perform the duties and offices, are become contemptible
for want of that Honour and Respect which they enjoyed

that there was three Courts of Justice in that Kingdome,

<hi>Iosephus, Philo,</hi> and other Monuments of the Jews, that
there was no distinction of Courts, the one Ecclesiastical,
the other Civil, (as <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and some others that
follow them would have it) but the Judges and Courts
were united, and the Priests and Levites the principal Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

               <p>The ancient frame of our Kingdome for 500. years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forre
the Conquest, was thus disposed and governed. As
<hi>Spelman</hi> sheweth fully in his learned Glossary and Councels:
and happy had it been if things had continued so still: But
now the Law being otherwise setled, and the Courts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
it is not safe, or easie to make alteration. Only
without change of Law or Courts, the Benches may
continue as they are, though some more Judges be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in most Courts, and some Eclesiastical persons among
them: as in the Saxon times. <hi>Comes praesidebat foro Comita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
non solus sed adjunctus Episcopo, hic ut jus divinum ille ut
hnmanum diceret; alterque alteri anxilio esset &amp; Consilio: Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertim

               <p>The Bishop and Earl of the County were joint Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
in every Shire, and did assist each other in all Causes
and Courts, and so Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his History <hi>cap. 14. Sect.</hi> 1.
By this means there was great union and harmony between
all judges and officers, whereas now there is great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for jurisdiction, and intollerable clashing in all Courts,
by Injunctions, prohibitions, Consultations, and crosse
orders, to the great Vexation of the Clients and Subjects.
And by multiplying several Courts, the number of Lawyers
is greatly increased, as Lord <hi>Cook</hi> sheweth, 4. <hi>Instit. p.</hi> 76.
Where he gives divers reasons of the increase of Suits in
Law, and in the same Book reckoneth up no lesse then 74.
Courts of Law and justice of all sorts in the Kingdome,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66402:67"/>
besides the Ecclesiastical Courts: Which are not many for
the number, and had little businesse to do, when they were
in greatest power. For commonly two or three proctors
were enough to dispatch the businesse of any Bishops Court,
without Advocates.</p>
               <p>But in the Courts of Common Law, there is a far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Martial and Legislative King. <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. When he distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

               </p>
               <p>But the Division and Separation of the Ecclesiastical
Courts from the Temporal, seems to have proceeded first
from Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the first, as is mentioned in <hi>Gratian.

<hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, whose Statute for that purpose is

also published by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and Lord <hi>Cook 4. Instit. c.</hi> 52.
So that as the Pope hath been the Authour of much evill in
the World oftentimes, so in this particular, when he came
to the height of his greatnesse, having <hi>(de facto)</hi> the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
in all Ecclesiastical matters, he made the Clergy
subject only to himself, and his Deputies and Legates and
such officers as he sent among us. But at length <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
Contested with the Pope, and recovered the Supremacy of
his Crown, though it cost much blood and opposition in his
time. But he having recovered it, and it being approved
by Parliament, it is fully setled upon the King, and vested
in his Crown.—And as Lord <hi>Cook</hi> saith, <hi>4. Instit.
pag. 331.—His Majesty hath, and Queen Elizabeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him had, as great and ample Supremacy and Iurisdiction
Ecclesiastical as ever King of</hi> England, <hi>had before them; and that
had justly and rightly pertained to them by divers other Acts, and
by the ancient Laws of</hi> England, <hi>if the Clause of annexation in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66402:68"/>
the said Statute of 1 Eliz. had never been inserted.</hi> Wherefore
the Speech of <hi>Iohn Pym</hi> (as in <hi>Rushworths</hi> Collections <hi>4. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roli)</hi>
That the Supremacy was given by parliament to the
Crown (and as he seemeth to understand it) may be taken
away by parliament, is a dangerous opinion not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
Lord <hi>Cook</hi> saith, 4. <hi>Instit. pag.</hi> 325. The Act <hi>1.
Eliz,</hi> is an <hi>Act of Restitution.]</hi> not a gift meerly given,
which was not formerly due, and belonging to the jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Crown: If therefore the King hath his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
vested in his Crown so firmly, and is <hi>Custos ntriusque
Tabulae</hi> by the Word of God, as the Arch-bishop sheweth;
Then this Ecclesiastical Head must be allowed to have some
Ecclesiastical Sences, to be consulted withal, excellently
learned and principal persons of the Clergy; And as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
truly; If <hi>Cranmer</hi> the Arch-bishop had been thus
dealt withal, and suppressed in the minority of our young
<hi>Iosias Ed.</hi> 6. What had become of the great work of our
Reformation: and also if <hi>Ridley, Latimer, Hooper,</hi> and
the rest of the protestant Bishops (Martyrs afterwards)
had been set aside and neglected, the Reformation could
not have been effected. Therefore unlesse the King have
good choice of Ecclesiastical persons, excellently Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Bishops both in the ancient Councels, Fathers, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Controversies, and in Canon and Civil Laws,
requisite to determine of great difficulties that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
happen in the Church, whereof the Conusance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the Spiritualty, as Lord <hi>Cook</hi> sheweth out of the
Statute 25. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 21. and commendeth them for their
Knowledge, Integrity and Sufficiency; and if so then,
much more at this day, I saith <hi>Coke.]</hi> When all kind of
Learning is eminently advanced to an higher degree then in
the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Pym,</hi> in another Speech <hi>4. Caroli</hi> would have the
<hi>Arminian</hi> points setled and determined in parliament,—
<hi>viz,</hi> Concerning <hi>Predestination, Absolute Reprobation, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Grace, Free-will,</hi> and <hi>Final perseverance,</hi> before the
King should have Subsidies granted, Tunnage or poundage.
But if they would give no money to the King, till those
difficult poins be cleared and resolved, the King must never
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66402:68"/>
have any Subsidies granted. For those Questions are so my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
and abstruse, that all the Divines in the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yet resolve fully upon them. But these and such like
difficult questions in Divinity belong to the Convocation
of the Clergy (as <hi>Cook</hi> sheweth <hi>Instit. pag. 322.)</hi> and they
are to be called in time of parliaments, by the Kings
Writ, and are to proceed <hi>juxta legem divinam &amp; Canones
sanctae Ecclesiae</hi> saith <hi>Cook. ibid.</hi> And they are divided into two
parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Upper House, where the Arch-bishops and
Bishops sit. and the lower House, where the rest do sit.
And they have two prolocutors, one of the Bishops of the
Higher House chosen by that House, another of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
house, and presented to the Bishops for their prolocutor.
<hi>Cook ibid.</hi> The Convocation of the Clergy made the
thirty nine Articles of Religion, the Common prayer
Book, and the Book of ordination of Bishops, priests,
and Deacons: and the Book of Canons: To all which
what subscription is required by Law, Lord <hi>Coke</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>pag.</hi> 323. But in the late long parliament all
these Books and good orders are cast aside and neglected,
and nothing established in stead thereof. But it is hoped
that the most excellent and gracious King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
will so confirrm the Truth of our Religion and all
good orders, Laws, Customes, and Rights as there shall be a
full and happy Conclusion of all differences, and the peace of
the Kingdome and Church established, to the advancement
of Gods glory, and the rejoycing of all that are truly wise
and religious.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Cook</hi> sheweth <hi>pag.</hi> 325. How the Commission
Court for causes Ecclesiastical was setled,</p>
               <p>That such Iurisdiction Spiritual or Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,
as by any Spiritual or Ecclesiastical
Power or Authority hath heretofore been, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
may be exercised or used for the Uisitation of
the Ecclesiastical State, and Persons: And for
Reformation, Order, and Correction of the same;
and of all manner of Errors, Heresies, Schisms,
Abuses, Offences, Contempts, and Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66402:69"/>
shall for ever be united and annexed to the
Imperial Crown of this Realm.</p>
               <p>But not to the House of Commons, or any others: but
by the dissolution of the high Commission, and all other
Courts Ecclesiastical, there is risen up such an infinite and
prodigious number of sectaries, factions, divisions in
Religion, enormities and disorders, as is lamentable to
behold, and all scandalous sins, as adultery, fornication,
incest, and such as ought not to be named among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
go unpunished dayly. If a bastard Child be gotten,
the Justices of the peace do only take care for keeping of
the bastard, but for the offence and scandal given to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
they do nothing; that belongeth to the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Court, to injoyn what pennance is fitting, according
to Ecclesiastical Laws, which have been neglected too
much of late, though they are ancient and fundamental,
as well as any Common Laws.</p>
               <p>But it is testified fully by the best learned Divines in
forraign Countries, that our Church of <hi>England</hi> was
the onely Church reformed, by peaceable means, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Princes; whereas others in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and
other places, were reformed most part by tumults, and
violent wars: <hi>Beza</hi> from <hi>Geneva,</hi> said of the Reformation
by Queen <hi>Elizabeth: Doctrinae puritas viget in Anglia pure
&amp; sincere:</hi> so said <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Zanchy,</hi> and <hi>Damens,</hi>
when they saw the Confession of our faith in the thirty
nine Articles, and others parts of our Reformation, so
excellently defended by the Renowned Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> in
his Apology and Defence thereof against <hi>Harding</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,

or any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> published: and of late times,
the learned <hi>Deodatus,</hi> professor at <hi>Geneva:</hi> doth magnifie
the Church of <hi>England</hi> as the most eminent of all the
Reformed Churches, stiling it—<hi>Florentissima An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia

before these troubles, and so it might have continued
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66402:69"/>
still, if the Clergy might have enjoyed those rights and
priviledges, which the priesthood of God, did anciently
enjoy in all ages; for in the Law of nature, before <hi>Moses,</hi>
the priesthood was honourable: Priests being then the first
born and eldest sons of the Family, not younger Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
or poor fellows of the bas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st of the people:
How honorable the Priesthood was in the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>
is well known. Sir <hi>Iames Sempill</hi> a learned Knight of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
doth shew it fully in his book of Sacriledge in many
places. <hi>Cap. 6. Sect.</hi> 4. speaking of the dignity of the
Church ministry of old: For tithes inheritance in the
person of one Royal <hi>Melchisedeck.</hi> Royal, I say, in
regard of the great odds between that, and this our age
now: For of old, (as writeth <hi>Iosephus)</hi> the true mark of
nobility was to derive a mans Pedigree from the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
so <hi>Iosephus</hi> was a Gentleman, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <hi>sanguine sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotali.</hi>
And in our time, the onely best <hi>Tenure</hi> and <hi>Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of Possessions, was to hold of the Church, but now
all to the contrary: For <hi>Rome</hi> hath frustrate her ministry
of Matrimony, and we at home, ours of their patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
She can bring forth no well begotten Children, and
we but few well beneficed Church men: No <hi>Iosephs</hi> in
her, and all <hi>Iobs</hi> with us: and instead to hold of the
Church, we hold all from the Church, both much amiss:
And as he saith in his preface to King <hi>Iames,</hi>—Truely
it never goeth better, then when the Church Courteth it,
and the Court Churcheth it, for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were
Brothers.] Well might the Learned and Religious Knight
complain that things are much amiss, when in the times
of the light of Learning, and Religion reformed hath in
great measure flourished among us, but of late been so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
and deformed, that it is lamentable to report more of
it; the Enormities being so great and scandalous, that unless
the Kings Majesty out of his singular piety and wisdome,
do resume the ancient Jurisdiction of his Crown—<hi>Who
onely hath the proper power, and authority to reform and correct
all manner of Heresies, Schismes, Abuses, Offences, Contempts,
and Enormitie</hi>—] as are the express words of the Statute,
1, <hi>Eliz.</hi> as they are recited and inforced, by Lord <hi>Coke</hi> 4. Instit.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66402:70"/>
Pag. 325. there can be little hope of Redress, but as the
Queen then, did assign and authorise Commissioners to
execute this Jurisdiction, so it may be now done; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
may be appointed by the King to perform and
execute his power in as full and ample manner, as Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> did, and as Lord <hi>Coke</hi> saith, it may be done
without the help of a Parliament, as the King appointeth
Judges, and great Officers in all the Courts in <hi>Westminster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
without consent of Parliaments. The Learned Lord
<hi>Herbert</hi> in his History of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. relating some passages
of the Kings Reformation of some abuses, affirmeth,
that the first fatal blow the English Church received, was,
when the Redress of her was referred to the House of
Commons: Complaint was made for probate of testaments,
and mortuaries, of pluralities, non-residence, and priests that
were farmers of Lands—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the King lost, or let go for the present, a principal
point of his Supremacy, whereby he might have reformed
what was fit to be done in these and many the like busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
without referring to the House of Commons, and
we find that they never left off reforming till they have
utterly deformed all, and wholly suppressed all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Law, Courts and Jurisdictions. The King by his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
might have reformed and prescribed Laws, for
probate of Wills, non-residence, pluralities, and many
more such matters; the Concurrence of the <hi>Metropolitan</hi>
had been sufficient to regulate such matters, according to
the Laws Ecclesiastical; for there are Laws Ecclesiastical in
this Kingdome as well as Temporal, and as ancient and
fundamental as any part of the Common Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fit to be duly kept and observed. <hi>Linwood</hi> doth gloss
upon the Constitutions made by the Archbishops of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
which are accepted for good Laws by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Lawyers in Ecclesiastical matters: and so there are
also Constitutions for the province of <hi>York,</hi> and the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern

in Antiquity, that is not well acquainted with that of
their sitting here, they have done thus and in this manner
almost since the conquest, and by the same power and the
same right as the other Peers did, and your Lordships now
do; and to be put from this their due, so much their due,
by so many hundred years strengthened and confirmed, and
that without any offence, nay, pretence of any, seems
to me to be very severe: if it be <hi>jus,</hi> I dare boldly
say it is <hi>summum.</hi> That this hinders their Ecclesiasticall

be a reason, sure I am, it might have been one six hundred
years ago.</p>
               <p>A Bishop, my Lords, is not so circumscribed within the
circumference of his Diocesse, that his sometimes absence
can be termed, no not in the most strict sense, a neglect
or hindrance of his duty, no more then that of a Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
from his County, they both have their subordinate
Ministers, upon which their influences fall, though the
distance be remote.</p>
               <p>Besides, my Lords, the lesser must yield to the greater
good; to make wholsome and good Laws for the happy
and well regulating of Church and Common-wealth, is
certainly more advantagious to both, then the want of the
personal execution of their office, and that but once in
three years, and then peradventure but a moneth or two,
can be prejudicial to either. I will go no further to prove
this, which so long experience hath done so fully, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively.</p>

was painted over with colour of the Law; what Bench is

House, when at one blow twenty six are cut off. It then
behoves the Neighbour to look about him <hi>cum proximus

               </p>
               <p>And for the Bishops, my Lords, in what condition will
you leave them? The House of Commons represents the
meanest person, so did the Master his Slave, but they have
none to do so much for them; and what justice can tie them
to the observation of those laws, to whose constitution
they give no consent, the wisdome of former times gave
proxies unto this House meerly upon this ground, that
every one might have a hand in the making of that which he
had an obligation to obey: This House could not represent,
therefore proxies in room of persons were most justly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>And now my Lords, before I conclude, I beseech your
Lordships to cast your eyes upon the Church, which I know
is most dear and tender to your Lordships, you will see her
suffer in her most principal members, and deprived of that
honour which here and throughout all the Christian world
ever since Christianity she constantly hath enjoyed; for
what Nation or Kingdome is there in whose great and
publick Assemblies, and that from her beginning, she had
not some of hers, if I may not say as essential, I am sure I
may say as integral parts thereof: And truly my Lords,
Christianity cannot alone boast of this, or challenge it

such persons as shall have honour descend upon them. And
your Lordships know, that circumstance and chance alter
not the nature and essence of a thing, nor can except any
particular from an universal proposition by God himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
I will therefore take these two as granted, first,
that they ought by our Law to intermeddle in temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
Secondly that from doing so they are not inhibited
by the Law of God, it leaves it at least as a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
And now my Lords, to apply my self to the business
of the day, I shall consider the conveniency and that in the
several habitudes thereof, but, very briefly; first in that which
it hath to them meerly as men, <hi>qua tales,</hi> then as parts of
the Common-wealth, Thirdly, from the best manner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
constituting Laws, and lastly from the practise of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

both Christian and Heathen.</p>

                  <hi>Homo sum, nihil humanum á me alienum puto,</hi> was indeed
the saying of the Comedian, but it might well have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd
the mouth of the greatest Philosopher. We allow
to sense all the works and operations of sense, and shall
we restrain reason? Must only man be hindered from his
proper actions? They are most fit to do reasonable things
that are most reasonable. For Science commonly is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with conscience; So is not ignorance: They seldome
or never meet. And why should we take that capacity from
them, which God and Nature have so liberally bestowed?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> My Lords, the politick body of the Common-wealth is
analogical to the body natural: Every Member in that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
something to the preservation of the whole, the
superfluity or defect which hinders the performance of
that duty, your Lordships know what the philosopher calls
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Natures sin. And truly my Lords, to
be part of the other body, and do nothing beneficial there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
cannot fall under a milder term. The Common-wealth
subsists by Laws and their Execution: and they that
have neither head in the making not hand in the executing
of them, confer not to any thing the being or well being
thereof. And can such be called Members unlesse most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
ones? onely <hi>fruges consumere nati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Me thinks it springs from Nature it self, or the very
depths of Justice, that none should be tyed by other laws
then himself makes; for what more natural or just, then
to be bound only by his own consent? to be ruled by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will, is meerly tyrannical. Nature there suffers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and man degenerates to beast. The most
flourishing estates were ever governed by Laws of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
constitution; witnesse this our Kingdome, witnesse
<hi>Senatus Populusque Romanus,</hi> the most glorious Common-wealth
that ever was, and those many others in <hi>Greece</hi> and
elsewhere of eternal memory.</p>
               <p>Some things, my Lords, are so evident in themselves
that they are difficult in their proofs. Amongst them I

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ckon this Conveniency I have spoken of: I will therefore

                  </gap> but a word or two more in this way. The long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

years, is certainly, <hi>argumentum ad hominem.</hi> Nay my Lords
I will go further (for the same reason runs through all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions)
never was there any Nation that employed not
their religious men in the greatest affairs. But to come to
the businesse that now lyes before your Lordships, Bishops
have voted here ever since Parliaments began, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were imployed in the publike. The good they have
done, your Lordships all well know, and at this day enjoy:
For this I hope yee will not put them out, nor for the evil
they may do, which yet your Lordships do not know, and
I am confident never shall suffer. A position ought not to
be destroyed by a supposition, <hi>&amp; à passe ad esse non valet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentia.</hi>
My Lords I have done with proving of this
positively, I shall now by your good favours do it nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
in answering some inconveniencies that may seem
to arise.</p>
               <p>For the Text,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> [No man that wars entangles himself with
the affairs of this life] which is the full sense of the word
both in Greek and Latine, it makes not at all against them,
except to intermeddle and intangle be tearms equivalent.
Besides my Lords, though this was directed to a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
yet it is of a general nature, and reaches to all,
Clergy and Laity, as the most learned and best expositors
unanimously do agree. To end this, <hi>Argumentum symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum
non est argumentativum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be said that it is inconsistent with a spiritual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note>
truly my Lords, <hi>Grace and Nature</hi> are in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
incompossible, but in some others most harmoniously
agree, it perfects nature and raiseth it to a height above the
common altitude, and makes it most fit for those great
works of God himself, to make laws, to do Justice. There
is then no inconsistency between themselves, it must arise
out of Scripture, I am confident it doth not formally out
of any place there, nor did I ever meet with any learned
Writer of these or other times that so expounded any Text.</p>
               <p>But though in strict terms this be not inconsistent, yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may peradventure hinder the duty of their other calli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g.
My Lords; there is not any that sits here, more for pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than I am. I know it is the ordinary means to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66402:73"/>
yet, I likewise know, there is not that full necessity of it as was in
the primitive times. God defend that 1600. years acquaintance should
make the Gospel of Christ no better known unto us. Neither, my Lords,
doth their office meerly and wholly consist in preaching, but partly in
that, partly in praying and administring the blessed Sacraments, in a
godly and exemplary life, in wholsome admonitions, in exhortations to
virtue, dehortations from vice, &amp; partly in easing the burdned conscience.
These my Lords, compleat the office of a Church man. Nor are they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
tied to time or place, though I confesse they are most properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
within their own verge, except upon good occasion, nor then
the omission of some can be termed the breach of them all. I must add
one more an essential one, the very form of Episcopacy that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
it from the inferiour Ministry, the orderly and good government
of the Church; and how many of these, I am sure not the last, My
Lords is interrupted by there sitting here, once in 3. years, and then
peradventure but a very short time: And can there be a greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
than the common good of the Church and State? I will tell your
Lordships what the great and good Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> did in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
against the Persians, he had his Bishops with him whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
about his military affairs, as <hi>

               <p>Reward and punishment are the greatest negotiators in all worldly

stream of their consciences, and may not the same be said of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Have these no operations, but only upon them? Has the King
neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rown, honour nor offices, but only for Bishops? Is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that answers their translations? Indeed my Lords, I must needs
say that in charity, it is a supposition not to be supposed; no, nor in
reason, that they will go against the light of their understanding. The
holinesse of their calling, their knowledge, their freedome from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and affections to which youth is very obnoxious, their vicini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y to
the Gates of death, which, though not shut to any, yet always stand
wide open to old age: these my Lords, will surely make them steer aright.</p>
               <p>But of matter of fact there is no disputation,<note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> some of them have
done ill, <hi>crimine ab uno discant omnes</hi> is a poetical not a logical argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Some of the Judges have done so, some of the Magistrates,
and Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers; and shall there be therefore neither Judge, Magistrate
nor officer more? A personal crime goes not beyond the person that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
it, nor can anothers fault be mine offence. If they have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
any fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cleanse and purge them throughly. But still remember the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

of your Triennial Bill which will save you this labour for the time to
