            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

could not this Law haue beene exactly kept? Surely <hi>Adam</hi> might haue kept it, if hee would: but as the caſe now ſtandeth, wee cannot but trangreſſe it: Neither yet is there iniuſtice in GOD: For by commanding things impoſſible Hee makes not men ſinners, but humble, that euery mouth ſhould bee ſtopped, and that all the world ſhould bee made ſubiect vnto GOD: becauſe by the workes of the Law no fleſh ſhal be iuſtified in his ſight. For when wee haue receiued a commandement, and perceiue what is wanting in vs, wee are put in minde to ſend vp our cries into heauen, and GOD will haue mercy vpon vs: and that ſo wee may know that wee are not ſaued by the workes of righteouſneſſe, which wee haue done, but by <hi>His</hi> owne free Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:

And One ſhee is, becauſe ſhee acknowledgeth but one GOD, confeſſeth one Faith, is ruled by one Head, animated of one SPIRIT, participateth of one Baptiſme, and is gouerned by one Law. This Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is the Sub-vrbes of the Church Triumphant: None muſt enter into This, but hee that hath firſt paſſed That: None ſhall triumph like a Victor, but hee, that hath fought like a Souldier: And hee that would weare a Crowne in This, muſt firſt take vp His Croſſe in That. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and eſſentiall Members of this Church are all of them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the imputation of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of CHRIST their Head,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5637:26"/>
and by the powerfull operation of the Spirit of CHRIST, which is within them: And all theſe are infallibly knowne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto GOD, who ſeeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the heart, and can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely iudge of inward vertues.

This Church Militant is in the world, but not of the world: All her Members are ſtrangers in the earth, but deſcended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; generated not of man, but regenerated by the Holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> not begotten of mortall bloud, by the appetite of the fleſh, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5637:27"/>
will of man, but of Immortall Seed, by the Word of GOD, according to His Will. The onely Husband of this Church is CHRIST IESVS: For Hee onely hath her, holds her, leads her: To Him alone ſhee owes her loue, her loyalty and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Friends, (not the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, for ſhee hath but One) of this Bride, and Bridegroome, are all true Chriſtians, ſpecially Paſtors, which heare the Voice of the Bridegroome, and take great delight therein, eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voice of ſtrangers. The common condition of this Church, and all her Members, is affliction and perſecution: But ſhee counteth nothing more glorious, then to beare the reproach of her Husband, who is troubled in all troubles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members all her ſighes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottles

her; and thoſe things doe make her floate aloft like corke, which make worldlings, like lead, ſinke downe vnto the bottome. This Church is the pillar and ground of the Truth, ſo termed of her ſeruice, becauſe ſhee doth by her Miniſtery Keepe, Confirme, and Preach the Truth; not that ſhee hath authority ouer the Truth, for the Truth is the ground and pillar of the Church: But ſhee hath authority ouer her children, and againſt all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, from the Truth, with which ſhee is betruſted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and Preach.

And though it bee his deſtiny for a time to liue in this world, yet his deſire, and endeuour ſhould bee euer to liue, and loue, as one not of this world, but redeemed from the world.

then a good Prieſt: But hee that is vicious, is like a peece of dung with a Diamond in it; and as the water in Baptiſme, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to others but periſhes it ſelfe: But yet GOD may worke effectually by the Miniſtery of wicked men; for their power and calling is His, and their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe is their owne; that is holy, though they bee vnholy: Their authority is not the better for their godlineſſe, nor the worſe for their vngodlineſſe. The light is not polluted, though it paſſe by polluted places, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, neither is the ſoule corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though it ſhould bee in a corrupted body: ſo neither is the power and authority of the Miniſter ſtained, though hee bee full of ſtaines himſelfe.

doth good vnto the ground: ſo the Word and Sacraments are auaileable to the Receiuers, whatſoeuer the Miniſter be that giues them.

Whom doth GOD admit into heauen, which is not admitted by the Miniſter into the Church? To whom will GOD giue His Sonne for

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5637:41"/>
worke within? What wonders wrought it in thee, what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, what goodneſſe, haſt thou receiued, or gained, by it? Bleſſe not thy ſelfe in commending the Preacher, reſt not in the naked commendations of his Sermon: Account that an excellent, a rare, and a good Sermon, which produceth rare effects in thee, makes thee better then thou waſt before, and ſtirres thee vp to excell in vertue. Account him admirable, and wonder then, when hee worketh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in thy ſoule. Thy Preacher cares not ſo much for thy verball commendations, as thy reall. Good conuerſation is his beſt commendation, his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtands in thine amending, and thy godly practiſe is his beſt praiſe. The Sheepe, that ſaith nothing, commends his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5637:42"/>
Sheepeheard, when her skin is whole, her fleece faire, and her ſelfe wel-liking, He heares well, that doth well; he learnes well, that liues well: and thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is praiſe-worthy accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy practiſe: And he onely doth proue a good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, which heares the truth in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, beleeues it in ſimplicity, and obeyes it with alacrity. The Word of GOD is our foode, our eares are our mouth: but this meate is not like bodily food turned into vs, but we by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing and obeying it are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into it. Now hee is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy hearer, that is tranſlated into the Word, ſo as that he may be able to ſay; I liue, but yet not I, but the Word of GOD doth liue within me. And this is, when a mans reaſon, will, &amp; affections; are brought vnder the Word,

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:5637:43"/>
inſtituted of GOD in His Church, doe binde our ſelues with the like Vow, that we will liue and die in his cauſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. And as they, at the taking of that Oath, gaue their names to their Emperour or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and were receiued into his protection: So wee, when wee receiue theſe Sacraments, doe likewiſe giue our names vnto CHRIST, and are receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his tuition, that vnder his banner wee might fight a good battell, keeping faith and a good conſcience. And as there wee doe yeeld ouer our ſelues vnto GOD; ſo GOD doth binde Himſelfe to vs by Pacts and Promiſes after a manner ſealed vp. Sacraments are ſignes of things, being one thing, and ſignifying another. Euery Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a Myſterie, but euery
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:5637:43"/>
Myſterie is not a Sacrament. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, are not <hi>Nata,</hi> but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi> Not Naturall, but by Diuine appointment: And their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depends vpon their Authour. They are not the better, becauſe the Miniſter is good, that doth deliuer them, nor the worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is euill. They are ſuch as hee is, in whoſe authority they are giuen, not as hee is, by whoſe Miniſtery they are diſpenſed: And though they bee hurtfull to them, that deliuer them, being wicked; yet they are profitable to them, that receiue them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prepared. And though the Receiuer haue a peruerſe faith, or come vnprepared, and in ſin, yet hee may pertake of a true and entire Sacrament, if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſignes, and not the things repreſented by the ſignes. In Sacraments there is a change,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5637:44"/>
not of Subſtance, but of vſe; not of Nature, but of condition. For by theſe elements conſecrated, there is a ſignification, obſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; exhibition of CHRIST and His benefits. Sacraments are neceſſary in reſpect of GODS Commandement, and as they bee meanes of receiuing CHRIST: yet ſimply, not the defect of Sacraments, but the contempt of them, doth damne a man: If a man would haue them, but cannot, and dies in the deſire of them, no doubt he may be ſaued: But indeed he that may, but cares not for them, and ſo departs, queſtionleſſe as he ſcorned the ſignes, ſo he ſhall be depriued of the grace. It is iuſt, that he ſhould miſſe of the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell that cared not for the Shell, that he ſhould looſe the Land, that contemned the Leaſe, or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5637:44"/>
Deed; that hee ſhould be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of CHRIST, the Bread, and Water, of Life, that regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not the Water and Bread of CHRIST. There are two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Baptiſme, and the LORDS Supper: By Baptiſme wee are admitted into the Church, receiued into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the bleſſed TRINITY, and haue our ſinne remitted, though not at firſt extirped. A man is borne a ſinner, but by Baptiſme hee is made a Saint. A man is, by birth, a limme of the diuell, but by Baptiſme hee is made the member of CHRIST: A man may bee new borne, and not Baptized; but hee is not ſo, if hee skorne to bee Baptized. There are ſome, that make ſmall account of Baptiſme; but for my ſelfe, I make more reckoning of my Baptiſme, then of all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5637:45"/>
in the world, as knowing that theſe can neither helpe, nor hurt ſo much, as the other: and that the comtempt of theſe may ſtand with a mans ſaluation, whereas the contempt of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is puniſhed with damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By the LORDS Supper wee are nouriſhed and preſerued in the Church: In thoſe hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſignes of Bread and Wine CHRIST IESVS and all his Merites are ſignified, ſealed vp, and exhibited vnto euery wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiuer: For as there is in an Obligation, or Legall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an aſſurance and conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made of mony, goods, or lands, from one to another: So in the Sacrament, vnder theſe elements, there is a moſt ſure conueyance and exhibition of CHRIST IESVS vnto euery prepared Communicant. And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:5637:45"/>
although wee take the Bread by it ſelfe, and the Wine by it ſelfe, yet wee muſt not imagine that CHRIST is giuen by peece-meale; but two ſignes were ordained to ſhew that wee haue perfect food in CHRIST. For it is but an hungry dinner, where there is no meate; and a dry feaſt where there is no drink: Now to ſignifie that CHRIST is Meate and Drinke vnto vs, and that in Him wee ſhall haue a full refection, therefore two ſignes, one of Bread, which ſtrengthens the heart, another of Wine which allaies the thirſt, and make it merry, were by CHRIST ordained.</p>

            <p>I Do much wonder at the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh auerſneſſe, and peruerſe folly of many men, that make ſo ſmall account of this Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that they muſt by feare of Lawes be driuen to it. They are out of charity, they want good cloathes, they are not yet at leaſure; they alledge I wot not what, their very excuſes doe accuſe them. Who bids thee be out of charity? Why art thou not reconciled? Who requires fine apparell at thy hands? It is a good heart, that is exacted of thee: Grace, not garments; thy ſoule within thee, not thy

cloathes about thee. And why wanteſt thou leaſure? Thou haſt leaſure to eate, to drinke, to play, to ſleepe, to be vaine and idle: Why haſt thou no leaſure to feede thy ſoule, to refreſh thy ſpirit, to receiue thy Sauiour? Thou haſt leaſure, but it is not thy pleaſure. Thou canſt not come; nay, thou wilt not come. Thou canſt not, becauſe thou liſts not. If thy profite call thee, thou goeſt; if thy pleaſures call thee, thou followeſt; if thy fleſh call thee, thou mak'ſt haſt; If thy companions whiſtle, thou trudgeſt: But CHRIST cals thee, thou tarrieſt, thou findſt excuſes; there is a bone in thy legge, thou canſt not come.

Yea, but thy doſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that thou canſt haue CHRIST without the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this is thy fanſie, but thy fanſie is no faith: If thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſt the Sacrament, thou contemneſt CHRIST: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Law doth argue contempt of the Law-maker: neglect of the ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes neglect of the Ordainer: And hee, that will not receiue CHRIST, as Hee doth offer Himſelfe to be receiued, is like to looſe Him, for ought that can bee knowne: And hee, that will not when hee may, it is very probable, when hee would,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:5637:47"/>
hee ſhall haue nay. But thou wilt hereafter put off excuſes: thou wilt bee wiſer, thou wilt not deferre to come. Come then, but come prepared: Come in charity; for he, that hateth a Chriſtian, ſhall neuer bee loued of CHRIST, neither ſhall any man enioy the LORD, but he, that is in charity with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.

Yet are they truely, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, the Body and Bloud of our LORD and SAVIOVR IESVS CHRIST: Euen as the Circumciſion was the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the Paschall Lamb was the Paſſeouer, As the Rocke was CHRIST.

For whereas they were no more then men, our IESVS is GOD and Man, in one and the ſelfe-ſame Perſon. They came into the world by an ordinary generation, as we do now: but Hee was borne of a Virgin pure, that knew no man. They had not their name giuen them expreſly by GOD, but by men: but Hee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5637:50"/>
had His name from GOD, by the mouth of an Angell, GODS Meſſenger. They all had need of this IESVS, that they might be ſaued by Him, otherwiſe they had periſhed all: They were the ſons of men; but Hee is the Son, the eternall Son of the eternall GOD. They might be meanes to ſaue others, eſpecially from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior dangers and enemies: but this IESVS, by His owne Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Power, and Merites hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all true beleeuers from their ſinnes: Hee hath deliuered them from ſathan, Hee hath redeemed their ſoules from death, and hath purchaſed for them the glory of the Kingdome of heauen. This Name He had from all eternity, as GOD, but Hee receiued it in the womb, as Man: and in, and at, His reſurrection Hee made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the truth therof moſt fully.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5637:51"/>
This name of a <hi>Sauiour</hi> (for ſo IESVS ſignifies) is a name aboue all names: For it is the name of GOD, <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and beſides Mee there is no Sauiour:</hi> None of all the Titles of GOD, are ſo precious with Him as this of <hi>Sauiour,</hi> in which, with his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is ioyned our ſaluation. Euen the very name of GOD, without this Name, hath no comfort in it. Shut out this IESVS, and GOD is a conſuming fire, and there is no dealing with Him: But in this IESVS, GOD hath reconciled the world to Himſelfe, who without Him is an enemy to it. The name CHRIST (which ſignifies <hi>Annointed)</hi> is not equall vnto the name IESVS, for the end is aboue the meanes: Now Hee was Annointed to be our Sauiour. Princes are called the LORDS Annointed, but ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5637:51"/>
is of the LORD; that is proper to Him: Hee, Hee is the Sauiour, and beſides Him there is no other. And indeed IESVS is the very name of GOD, but GOD cannot bee Annointed: Hee that giues all, can take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Hee is the Annointer, and is not, nor can poſſible be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. Therefore CHRIST cannot be the name of GOD: And yet euen our IESVS is our IESVS CHRIST, Our <hi>Annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sauiour;</hi> which Annointing is ſpoken of Him, and that true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Hee is Man, and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, betweene GOD and man. This IESVS is our LORD, Hee hath bought vs with His Owne Bloud, and Hee is farre aboue all other Lords in the world: For other Lords in caſe may bee diſobeyed; but This in no caſe: Other Lords are by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:5637:52"/>
Him, both as men and as Lords, and both they and their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips are ſubiect to change: but Hee is immortall, and of His Kingdome there ſhall bee none end. Other Lords are ſinners, and meere men: but Hee is GOD alſo, and the Sanctifier of ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men. They, if they will be ſaued, muſt ſerue this LORD, and throw downe their Crowns at His feete. Other Lords can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, what they do deſire, but CHRIST can.

Thirdly, he blaſphemes GOD, that ſaith the diuell can make a man, or raiſe a man, truely dead, to life.

So Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a man is not iuſtifyed by the workes, but by the Faith of IESVS CHRIST: <hi>Wee alſo (Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter) haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in</hi> IESVS CHRIST, <hi>that wee might bee iuſtified by the Faith of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and not by the workes of the Law: Becauſe by the workes of the Law no fleſh ſhall bee iuſtified.

We iudge, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> according to the Apoſtle, that a man is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by Faith, without the workes of the Law. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, thou knoweſt that thou, as the Gentiles, haſt found life in CHRIST, not by the workes of the Law, but by Faith alone. To omit many, heare onely now Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> a word, or two: When the Apoſtle ſaith, a man is iuſtified freely, without the workes of the Law, by Faith, it is not his drift, that when Faith is receiued and profeſſed, the workes of Iuſtice ſhould bee contemned; but that euery man may know it is poſſible for him to bee iuſtified, although the workes of the Law haue not gone before; for they follow
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:5637:58"/>
him, that is iuſtified, and go not before him, that is to bee iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. So then, wee for our parts are iuſtified before GOD one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Faith: but wee, and our faith alſo are iuſtified before men by good workes, as the goodneſſe of a Tree is ſhewed by the fruite, the goodneſſe of a roſe by her ſweete odors, the cunning of a workeman by his workes. And though Faith bee not alone, but very well atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet it iuſtifies alone: as the eye ſees alone, the eare heares alone, the mouth taſtes alone, the legges go alone, but yet are not alone, but are coupled to other parts of the body. Hee that hath this faith, hath all the vertues of a Chriſtian; hee that wants it, wants all: With it a man is ſomething, without it a man is worſe then nothing. A
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:5637:58"/>
man hath all that hath himſelfe; he hath nothing that wants him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but hee hath himſelfe that hath his <hi>Sauiour,</hi> and hee hath his <hi>Sauiour,</hi> that beleeueth in <hi>Him,</hi> and by the vertue of his faith doth ſeeke and ſerue <hi>Him.</hi> It it not faith, but faithleſneſſe; not truſt but diſtruſt, for a man to put affiance in himſelfe: I will therefore diſtruſt in my ſelfe, that I may beleeue in CHRIST: I will deſpaire of my ſelfe, that I may haue hope in <hi>Him;</hi> and I will looſe my ſelfe in my ſelfe, that I may finde my ſelfe in <hi>Him:</hi> I will not diſtruſt in <hi>His</hi> might, becauſe <hi>Hee</hi> is Almighty; nor in <hi>His</hi> good will, becauſe <hi>Hee</hi> is moſt mercifull, and cryeth; <hi>Come vnto mee</hi> (not yee that are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, but) <hi>yee that are weary, and heauy laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi>

Ioy is the motion of the heart vpon ſome preſent good, now enioyed: But <hi>Hope</hi> is the hearts expectation of ſome good to come: Which good the faithfull heart doth long and looke for; not led thereunto by the euidence of humane ſenſe or reaſon, but moued by the euidence of faith, which is the promiſe of GOD. The way to come to true <hi>Hope,</hi> is to haue no hope in our ſelues, but to receiue all our hope from faith in the Word of GOD. For to hope in the creature is to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of the Creator: Neither
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:5637:60"/>
doth hee truely hope in CHRIST, that doth fixe his hope on any thing out of CHRIST. To deſpaire is a grieuous ſinne, for a man thereby denies the Power of GOD, who is Omnipotent, or His good Will and Mercy, who will caſt away no humble Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, but knowes how to alter His Sentence, if thou canſt tell how to performe repentance. It is true, deſperation doth deſtroy thouſands, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption doth kill ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. There is no more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous preſumption, then for a man to expect ſaluation by his owne deſerts, or to ground his hope of eternity vpon his owne perfections. His waxen wings where-with hee ſoares on high, will not bee able to endure the heate of GODS

Iuſtice, but with <hi>Icarus</hi> hee ſhall moſt ſurely fall, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the gulfe of hell. So, it is very vanity for a man to hope for heauen, whiles hee is alwaies (like a Mole) roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and turning vp Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of enormities againſt the heauens, and laying ſinne vpon ſinne (as the Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did ſtone vpon ſtone) and ſo threatning heauen with their ſinnes, as they with their Tower. The ſinner may not hope for heauen, but the Saint onely; the humble, and not the proud; the penitent, not the man addicted to his owne luſts, and hating to bee reformed. For the promiſe of Eternall Life is made, not to Infidels, but to Beleeuers; not to the rebell, but to the penitent; not to the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,

but to the poore; not to the children of the world, but to the true ſpirituall, ſonnes, and daughters of the Church of GOD. Adulterers, Drunkards, worldlings, ſhall not inherite the Kingdome of GOD. They cannot be ſaued, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and when they do truely repent, then GOD accounts them no longer Adulterers, Drunkards, Worldlings, but doth forgiue them. And as without repentance they cannot be ſaued; ſo without repentance they cannot hope to bee ſaued. If they looke to be ſaued, and yet run on in their ſinnes, they looke in vaine: This their loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king being the preſumption of fancy, not the expectation of faith.

            <p>LOVE is an vniting affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which the heart is knit vnto the thing beloued, and by which the knot is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued knit, and not diſſolued. For as hatred looſeth, ſo loue bindeth: that diuideth, but this vniteth; that cauſeth abhomna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but this delectation; that contempt, but this contentment. Loue, that is good, hath for his obiect good. As euill, either true, or ſeeming, is the obiect of hatred; ſo a true, or ſeeming good, is the obiect of loue. A true loue is fixed on a thing,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:5637:62"/>
that is truely good. This is a rare and excellent vertue; that, which appeaſeth GOD to man, and reconcileth man to GOD; that which made the Sonne of GOD come downe to men, and the ſonnes of men go vp to GOD; that, which ties GOD to vs, and our hearts to Him. Knowledge is in the ſoule as a Candle in a darke roome: yet without Charity, the greateſt Clearke is but an empty blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; or like a vaſte houſe full of light, but voide of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; hee may haue Learning, but hee wanteth Grace. This holy affection, makes the poore man very rich, and the want thereof makes a rich man very poore.

You ſhall haue ſome rauiſhed with the admiration of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; they are the Mountaines, all others are but Mole-hils; all their Geeſe are Swans; all their vertues are ten-foote long, and all their actions are good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are theirs; all is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Print, that is ſpoke by them; they ſee not their wants, but imagine they haue, that they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5637:71"/>
haue not: So they ſwimme, they care not though all doe ſinke; ſo they may haue, they care not though all beſides doe want; they will forgiue and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues in moſt grieuous vices, excuſing themſelues, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating their faults, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all the admonitions of others. And finally, their praiſes of others is very ſparing, almoſt nothing, but they can ſpeake bigly of themſelues, and thinke nothing well done, but what they do themſelues. This is a pernicious and fearefull ſinne, the madneſſe of the minde, the impediment of all vertues, the ſhame of Religion, and the cauſe of all enormites: He that loues himſelfe aright, loues himſelfe <hi>Holily</hi> that is, in GOD, for GOD, and vnder GOD: and Iuſtly, that hee may bee
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:5637:72"/>
righteous, and that by ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue hee proues not himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: And Diſcreetely, not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening himſelfe, but with wiſedome be hauing himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, as is requiſite for him. The good man that loues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as hee ſhould, wiſheth well vnto himſelfe, doth good vnto himſelfe, agreeth with himſelfe, dwelleth with himſelfe with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe, reioyceth with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, where there is cauſe of ioy, and ſorroweth with himſelfe, when there is matter of ſorrow; and in briefe, doth earneſtly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet and labour his owne peace, inward, outward, and eternall. On the contrary, a wicked and profane Athieſt, Epicure, and Worldling doe not truely loue themſelues, but rather hate, and hurt themſelues with intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, worldly cares, and other
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:5637:72"/>
vices: they ſtudy not to garniſh their ſoules with ſpirituall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but follow riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and preferments, which to wicked men are neuer good, but euer hurtfull. Neither do they agree well together within themſelues, becauſe their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and ſenſuall part doth ſtriue againſt their reaſons, and either they euer labour of a ſtupifyed, or with a vexed and vnquiet ſpirit. And hence it is alſo, that ſenſuall and euill liuers, as drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, whoore-mongers, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftes, and ſuch like perſons, loue not to be alone, and like not priuacie, and retired thoughts, but frequent Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, Tauernes, Plaies, and ſeeke out voluptuous and boon companions, ſuch as themſelues, becauſe they loue not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, delight not in themſelues,

He that hates either Man or Chriſtian, is neither Chriſtian, nor Man, but a diuell incarnate. Some boaſt of their loue to GOD, which ſhew no loue to man for GOD: This boaſting is vaine and falſe, for he that loues GOD, will loue His Image: And certes he that loues not the childe, cares as little for the father. But our neighbour is vngodly, graceleſſe, roytous, and voruly; Yet muſt we loue him, if not becauſe he is good, yet that hee may be good; if not the man, yet the man-head; if not the manners, yet the man. Gold is good, though droſſe bee naught: Wheate may not be

Neither will all loue ſerue the turne; but we ought to loue our neighbour in truth, not falſely; in deed, not verbally; in the faith, not againſt it; in that, that is iuſt, and not vnrighteouſly; in iudgement, and not vndiſcreetely; in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, vnder GOD, and not aboue Him: and conſtantly, not for a ſtart, as if ſome ague-fit were on vs. There is very much loue in the world, ſuch as it is, but very little Chriſtian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For this ſeekes the good of her neighbour, and not his goods: This loues to giue, and not to pull away: This beareth much, for beareth much, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth in the truth: This loues a man, not for his greatneſſe, but

            <p>IT is better to loue, then to be loued: for Action is more excellent then Paſſion; and the praiſe of vertue conſiſts in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To giue, is more gracious then to take: Now in louing there is a gift, in being loued there is a taking. Honeſty is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Commodity: Now to loue is a point of Honeſty, to be beloued is a matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a man may bee loued of a man with Chriſtian loue, and yet be but an hypocrite; but a man cannot loue with Chriſtian loue, but he muſt needes be a Chriſtian. A man may be loued of his neighbour for GOD, and yet neither loue GOD, nor be loued of GOD: but a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loue his neighbour for GOD, but hee doth much more loue GOD, and is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely beloued of GOD. And finally, it is no paine, but rather pleaſure; a gaine, but no grace to be beloued: but to loue a good thing well is grace; yea, oftentimes a man muſt ſweate and ſtriue with great contention (ſo auerſe and tortuous are our

hearts by ſinne) before he can faſten his affections, and fixe his loue on ſpirituall things, which are moſt worthy of his loue, and remoue it from thoſe things, that are rather to be loathed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, as noyſome, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to him.</p>

            <p>But this, as touching loue, is worthy obſeruation: that thoſe that do good turnes vnto others, do more loue them, to whom they do them, then theſe, that do receiue them, do loue thoſe,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:5637:76"/>
that do them: Prouided that they do their good turnes out of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, not for by-reſpects. CHRIST loues vs better then we loue him: Parents loue their children more then their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren loue them. Tutors loue their Pupils more then they their Tutors. Hee that receiues a benefite is (as it were) the worke and creature of his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour: Now the worke-man loues the worke, more then the worke doth loue the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: The creature is deerer to the Creator, then Hee to it; and the cauſe loues the effect more then it the cauſe. The Vſurer is vnworthy the name of Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, becauſe he loues his Debtor for gaine, ſeeking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to benefite himſelfe in his Debtor, then his Debtor in him: And to ſpeake properly, as he is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:5637:77"/>
an Vſurer, he loues him not: for loue ſeekes not her owne good, but the good of him whom hee loues; Now the Vſurer ſeekes his owne good onely, and leaues his debtor to looke to himſelfe, ſhewing him onely a little out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward indulgence for a time, vntill hee may haue his debt paid him againe with vantage. But indeed to gaine loue, and to be counted a Benefactour, is not any way more eaſily attain'd to, then by doing good turnes vnto men freely, ſeaſonably, vnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and in ſecreſie: but ſome cannot do a man a good turne, but they muſt cackle ſo long and ſo loud, that all the world may take notice of it; which argues that they regard fame more then friendſhip, and to walke vpon the tongues of men, rather then to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p>FAITH, Hope, and Charity, are three notable giftes of GOD, without the which it is impoſſible for any man to bee ſaued, though no man ſhall bee ſaued for them. A man ſhall bee ſaued in them, but not for them; for that, which merites our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for vs, that is, redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all ſinne and ſorrow, and fruition of Eternall Glory; that (I ſay) is not any thing in vs, but ſomething without vs: It is not quality, gift, or grace infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:5637:78"/>
but the Iuſtice of CHRIST imputed. Faith beleeueth, Hope expecteth the thing beleeued, and Charity Ioues it, linkes the ſoule vnto it. Faith is as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hope, and Charity, are her two daughters: Becauſe I beleeue, therefore I hope, and as I beleeue, ſo I loue. Faith belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that GOD is true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in His Word: Hope waiteth whiles Hee ſhew Himſelfe to be ſo. Faith be getteth hope, hope being begotten preſerueth faith. Faith beholds, and holds faſt the Word of Promiſe: Hope lookes after the thing that is promiſed in that Word. Loue vnites the heart both to the Word, and to the thing that is promiſed in it: Hope is the waiting for a good to come, but Faith beleeueth things paſt, preſent, and to come. I beleeue that CHRIST
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:5637:78"/>
was borne of a Virgin, that Hee now ſitteth at the right Hand of His FATHER, and that Hee ſhall come hereafter to iudge the world: Faith taketh CHRIST, and worketh by Charity; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity worketh not by Faith, as an inſtrument, but ariſes from Faith, as from the fountaine, whereout it flowes. Chriſtian Faith behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth CHRIST in the Word and Sacraments: But Chriſtian Charity ties the ſoule, not onely vnto CHRIST, but alſo vnto all His Members, in and for His Name. Loue is not cauſed by hope, but hope rather cauſed by loue; for becauſe a man doth loue GOD, therefore hee doth expect and tarry, and that with deſire and longing, till he do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy Him to his fill. And if hee did not loue Him, he would not deſire and hope to ſee Him, but
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:5637:79"/>
rather feare, and grieue. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Faith, Hope, and Charity, are three excellent vertues, but Charity is, in two reſpects, the chiefeſt. Firſt, becauſe Charity is profitable to our Neighbours, whereas our Faith and Hope doth them no good at all, were it not for Charity. Secondly, the loue, whereby wee loue CHRIST and His Members now, ſhall be continued and perfited in the world to come: but whereas now we do by faith beleeue, and by hope expect and deſire to ſee the face of CHRIST hereafter: Then, when we do ſee and enioy Him, this faith, and this hope are at an end; and whereas heere in this life wee walke by faith, and not by ſight, and feeling, in the life to come wee ſhall ſee face to face, and know as wee are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:5637:79"/>
knowne, and want no fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nor ſight of that, that is pleaſing and ſolacious to the ſoule. And whereas men hope for that, they ſee not, how can they hope for that they ſee? But GOD ſhall bee ſeene of His Saints in the world to come, and their ſight ſhall rauiſh them with His loue, their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and intellectuall eyes, then glorifyed, being as doores or windowes to let in His Loue into their heartes, which will moſt willingly entertaine Him, and reſt vpon Him, as vpon their Center, and ſole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenter.</p>

Art thou a cold? It is fire to warme thee. Art thou droſſy? It is fire to purge thee. Art thou in darkeneſſe? It is a fire to enlighten thee. Is thine heart voide of zeale to GOD, or loue to Man? It is a fire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame thee? Art thou frozen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy dregs, or art thou ſo hardned that no impreſſion can be made vpon thee? It is a fire to thaw and melt thee. This Word ſhall be deſtruction to him, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:5637:80"/>
will receiue no inſtruction from It: It will proue his deſolation, that makes it not his conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It will condemne thee, if thou wilt not ſuffer It to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule thee: and if It ſhalt not helpe thee, It ſhall vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt thee. This Word is an Hammer, if It ſoften not a man, and make him tender, It will harden him and make him tough: If It beate not downe the ſinne, it will knocke downe the ſinner: And if the hereticke will not be beaten with It from his hereſies, It will beate him downe one day thither, from whence all hereſies ſpring. An hammer hurts not the aire or water, which yeelds vnto it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, but breakes and bruiſes that, that makes reſiſtance. Hee that reſiſts the Word ſhall bee broken; but hee, that yeelds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

it, ſhall receiue no hurt. Hee that would ſurely breake a thing with an hammer, muſt not onely moue the hammer to it with ſtrength; but hee muſt ſo lay the thing, that it ſlide, ſlip, or ſhrinke not from the blow: ſo they, that indeed would haue their hearts ſoftned, their proud hearts battered, or any luſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſed, let them apply the Word of GOD vnto them cloſely, and not leap or ſhrinke aſide, when it is miniſtred and fitted to them. And what Miniſter ſoeuer brings with him this Fire, this Hammer, entertaine It, vſe It, apply thy ſelfe vnto It. If the Fire, if the Hammer be the ſame, If it be GODs, receiue it with the ſame affection, though the men be not the ſame, that bring it. The Hammer is not the worſe for him that holds it,

nor the Fire for him that brings it. The Miniſter is to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and honoured for the Word, and not It for him. In briefe, the Smith can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without his Hammer and Fire.

            <p>SVCH are good workes, as are, and are done according to the will of GOD reuealed. For the rule of wel-doing is not our wils, who are but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; but the Will of GOD, who is our Maiſter, whoſe will is Iuſt, and the Rule of Iuſtice, GOD being able to will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but right and good, ſeeing Hee is Wiſedome, Truth, and Goodneſſe it ſelfe. And a thing may be according to His Will, and yet not be done of him that does it, according to it. A good deed is ill done, if it bee not done for maner as wel as for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:5637:82"/>
matter, according to the Will of GOD. For if a man do that that is good, and thinke it is euill, that man doth ſinne: Not onely becauſe hee thinkes that euill, which is not euill; but alſo, becauſe he iudging it to bee euill, yet doth it. Euen as a man may lye, when he ſpeakes the truth, if he thinke that is a lye, which hee ſpeaketh, when hee ſpeakes it. Againe, if a man do that whereof he doubteth, and is not perſwaded of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe thereof, hee ſinnes: For whatſoeuer is not of Faith is ſinne. And finally, though a man do a thing that is good, yet if hee do it not to GODS Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but for his owne, or for baſe reſpects, and not in way of obedience to GODS Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, hee queſtionleſſe commits a ſinne. A good man
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:5637:83"/>
onely can do a good deed: For an euill tree cannot bring forth good fruite, and a corrupt fountaine can ſend forth no wholeſome water. Good deeds are neceſſary to ſaluation, as the way to the Kingdome, but not as the cauſe of reigning. They are not the cauſes of ſaluation, but the workes and teſtimonies of them that are to bee ſaued. And they are not the matter nor forme of faith, but they are true effects, vndoubted tokens, and vnſeparable companions of true Faith and of true Charity, if well performed. For Faith and Charity are not idle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, but labourious and full of goodneſſe: And though our wel-doing be no cauſe of our Bleſſedneſſe, yet it ſhall not want a reward, but as wee doe abound therein in this world, ſo
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:5637:83"/>
ſhall we exceed in glory in the world to come: The more wee flouriſh in fruit in this life, the more wee ſhall flouriſh in feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the life to come. But ſome haue beene heard to ſay, they can do no good deeds, they haue no riches, they are but poore. Theſe are deceiued; thou haſt not a penny, haſt thou a prayer? Thou haſt no goods to giue, haſt thou good counſell? Thou canſt do no deeds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, haſt thou any words of comfort? Thou haſt no bread, haſt thou a bleſſing? Thy legs are lame, thou canſt not go well; thy hands are lame, thou canſt not worke well; haſt thou a good tongue, canſt thou ſpeake well? There is no man ſo poore, but he may benefite his neighbour one way, or an other: If any way it is a good deed, if hee do it
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:5637:84"/>
well. And GOD accepts any thing, a cup of cold water, if there be no better, the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes Mite, euen any thing, haire to the building of the Tabernacle, a pin to the dreſſing of his Bride. And ſuppoſe a man do a good deed to a wicked man, yet if hee do it not for his wickedneſſe, but either becauſe he is a man, or that hee may win him vnto goodneſſe, or ſhew himſelfe a follower of GOD, who is kind vnto His enemies, and doth good euen to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſurely hee doth a good, and ſhall not looſe his reward. And ſay that a man ſhould bee kinde vnto ſome hypocrite, thinking him to bee a Saint, becauſe hee could not diſcerne his ſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being ſo cunningly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, yet ſhall the benefactor bee rewarded of GOD, Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:5637:84"/>
his affection, and ſeeth his heart, and will recompenſe him according to his loue, and not according to the condition of the party, which did not deſerue it. If a mans beneſicence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of benevolence, and bee performed in the name of CHRIST to the glory of GOD, it ſhall neuer want a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. For GOD is not not iniuſt to forget the labour of our loue; and as men ſow, ſo ſhall they reape; as they brue, ſo ſhall they drinke.

            <p>THE Sower went out to ſow. Euery true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter of CHRIST IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS is a Sower, GODs Word is his Seed: Mans heart is the ground that ſhould receiue it. The Word is a very rare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Seed, altogether match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. For by it men are made Chriſtians, ſinners are made Saints, dead men are made aliue: From it all manner of vertues ſpring, and with it are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And were it not for it, the whole world, and euen the Church it ſelfe, would be worſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:5637:92"/>
then a wilderneſſe, and turned into <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> But as it is in vaine to ſow Seed in the fire, aire, or water, or any where, but in the earth, which is in the middle of the world: and that it may proſper well, the ground muſt be quiet, not troubled, or toſſed, nor continually troden on, and both it and the ſeed to be caſt into it muſt be pure and good, not mingled, or corrupt. So it is bootleſſe to ſow the Word in the eares onely, or in the eyes, or vnderſtanding, and memory, or indeed any where, if not in the heart, which is in the midſt of a man: And that it may thriue and flouriſh, the heart muſt be quiet, and not diſturbed or toſſed with the ſtormes and tempeſts of fleſhly paſſions: It muſt be cleanſed of noyſome and ſtinking weeds: It muſt not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:5637:92"/>
be troden vnder foote and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually walkt vpon by wordlly cares, carnall deſires, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fanſies, which keepe a great coile, and are alwaies trotting vp and downe in worldings, belly-gods, and naturall men: and the ſeed muſt be ſowne purely, and not mingled with the tares and darnell of hereſies and errours. A Ship cannot ſaile without <hi>Sea-roome,</hi> and ſeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thriue without <hi>Earth-roome;</hi> No more can the Word without <hi>Heart-roome.</hi> If the ground re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not the ſeed into it, and cheriſh it, and giue it ſcope to roote it ſelfe in it, the ſeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proſper, and come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. So the Word of GOD thriues not, except the heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it meekely, cheriſh it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly, and giue it roome to roote it ſelfe throughly. Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe

and gluttony doe drowne this Seed; couetouſneſſe and worldly cares do choke it; vnchaſte deſires do ſcortch and burne it; rage and contumacy repell it; hatred and malice pinch and bite it; hardneſſe of heart and double mindedneſſe will not ſuffer it to roote well. Euery man would haue his ground good; yea what is there that a man would not haue to be good? his wife, his childe, his ſeruant, his friend, his fellow, his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, his houſe, his horſe, his dogge, hee would haue all good, and ſhall himſelfe be naught? Shall the heart, which is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed-plot of the Word, which is able to ſaue his ſoule, ſhall it be euill, and ſuffred to be euill, and ouergrowne with euill weedes? Why is it that the raine falling, and the Sunne ſhining
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:5637:93"/>
vpon a well ordered Garden makes it ſweete and flouriſhing, but vpon ſome other peece of ground, and it brings out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Moſſe and Weedes? The fault is in the ground, not in the Sunne or Raine. So one man is benefited by the Word, it takes well, and bringeth forth fruites in him; and another doth not reap any good by it, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not in him by reaſon of his vncapableneſſe, and wicked luſts, that will not giue way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, but makes him to reſiſt it and rebell againſt it. A man may ſet or ſow in our fields, whiles wee ſleepe, or though wee would not: But the Miniſter cannot ſow the Word of GOD in our hearts, if wee ſnort in ſin, if wee bee regardleſſe of the Word, and will not receiue it. Seed may bee pickt out of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:5637:94"/>
ground, and eaten of birds, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man will, or no: his corne may bee burnt, his plants may be ſtollen, or puld vp, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe, though hee would not; But wee and the Word, that is ſowne or grafted in vs, cannot bee ſeparated againſt our wils (our Bibles may bee taken from vs by force, but the Word ingrafted in vs cannot bee taken from vs againſt our will) the birds of hell cannot ſteale it from vs and pick it out, except we our ſelues be willing: if euer wee and it do part, wee muſt thanke our ſelues. Seed ſowne in the ground after a time comes vp, and flouriſhes for a time, but at length it decayes and withers. For this is the nature of ſeed; it is partly turned into the ground, and turnes the ground partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: It turnes, and is turned; it
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:5637:94"/>
ſuckes, and drawes to it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nurriture out of the ground, at length ſhootes out, growes vp, and increaſeth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpace; then in proceſſe of time it decayeth, and at length dyeth. But the Word doth otherwiſe: For the Word being ſowne in the heart, that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it, taketh, thriueth, comes vp, and beareth fruite: It is not turned, but it turneth the heart; It is not corrupted, but rather corrupteth and killeth the euill qualities, that are within vs: It it is no whit turned into man, but it rather turnes a man into it, and workes him to it will; It ſuckes no nouriſhment from man, but it affoords ſtrength, and comfort vnto man; and it neuer decayeth of it ſelfe, It dies not, neither can it bee by any meanes rooted vp or taken from
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:5637:95"/>
vs, but by our wils. Wee yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſent thereto. If euer it faile and die, if it bee parched and dryed vp, it is long of vs, and not of it. There is no plant, which time killeth; Nature hath appointed it a time to liue, and a time to die; be the ground neuer ſo good, the yeares neuer ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, the heauens neuer ſo benigne, yet it muſt decay and die. But if the Word be planted in a good and honeſt heart, it cannot be rooted out, nor pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; except the ground proue barren and naught; except a man do waxe weary of the Plant, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man would be ridde of it, it will not away, but will grow vp with him, and will ſaue his ſoule by the bleſſing of GOD. This Seed is at this day ſcattered in all places amongſt vs, yet it takes but badly in the moſt: The
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:5637:95"/>
Seed is good, but the ground (as it ſeemes) is for the moſt part naught: That is the onely good ground, which receiues it glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, giues it free paſſage willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and brings ſorth the fruites thereof patiently. Men neuer more delighted in goodly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Orchards, in variety of fruites and flowers, then at this day: But without doubt there is none of all their Seedes or Sets comparable to this. For this brings fruites of all kindes, that are good; Fruits, of which a man cannot ſurfet; Fruits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which a man is more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than a very beaſt; Fruites, for the which a man ſhall bee crowned with life eternall; Fruites, which themſelues are fruitfull, one fruite bringeth forth another without the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, loſſe, or leſſening of it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:5637:96"/>
ſelfe. And whereas all their feedes, are not able to ſaue the body from death, this Seed is able to ſaue the ſoule from hell, and to giue a man aſſurance that his dead body alſo ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp from death to life. Their ſeeds, and their plants, and flowers, do repleniſh and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their grounds; but this Seed and the fruites there of doe fill and garniſh the ſoule. Thoſe, if they proſper, doe commend the ſoyle; but this, if it thriue, doth commend the ſoule: They may ſhew who is rich; but this, and the fruites thereof declare who is Religious: They may perhaps tell who is wealthy, great, and glorious in the world; but Theſe point out a man, that is wife and good, and indued with the Grace of GOD. Finally, a man may doe well enough, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:5637:96"/>
his ſoule, though hee ſhould want or refuſe other ſeeds: but the refuſall and lacke of this Seed is very dangerous. Hee that contemnes or puts away the Word of the LORD ſhall vndoubtly periſh, without repentance. Yea, and if we bee gotten by it, what ſhall become of him, that is without it?</p>

            <head>Of Repentance.</head>
            <p>TRVE and ſound repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a turning from vice to vertue, from euill to Good, from the diuell to GOD. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the change of the whole man, and not of halfe. The iudgement ſanctified by the SPIRIT muſt condemne the euill, the eyes of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being opened to diſcerne it, and approue the contrary good; the will muſt will the good, and nill the euill: The affections muſt hate, feare, and abhorre the euill, and loue, like, and delight in good; and the conuerſation muſt not bee an exerciſe of euill, but an open
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:5637:103"/>
forſaking of it, and a practiſe of the contrary good: Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a true Repenter muſt ſee and vnderſtand his ſinnes, by conſidering himſelfe and his wayes by the Law of GOD, which ſhewes both good and euill: For if a man ſee not his faults, how ſhall hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, confeſſe, and flye them? Or if hee view not himſelfe in a true glaſſe, how ſhall hee ſee his true complexion? And if hee try not his actions and cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by a true Rule or Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, how can hee truely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne their irrectitude, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſies? Yet becauſe after our examination ſinne may lie hid vnſeene in one corner, or other, therefore to ſhew our hatred of ſinne, and that wee thinke not wee haue all light in theſe too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darke houſes of mortality, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:5637:104"/>
vs to pray that GOD would forgiue vs our ſecret ſins: Hee wants light, that thinkes hee hath all light; and is in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that thinkes no darkeneſſe is in him; and no man further from perfection, then hee that thinkes hee ſees all his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Secondly, when a man ſees his ſinne to bee ſinne, hee muſt yeeld it is ſinne, hee muſt acknowledge it, and not deny, leſſen, nor defend it. Sinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended is encreaſed; The defenſe of ſinne ſeene is euen death to the ſinner that defends it. And how doth a man repent of that, which hee labours to maintaine? <hi>Si homo peccatum non agnoſcit, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us non ignoſcit:</hi> If a man, when hee ſees his ſinne prohibited, yet will not acknowledge and yeeld it is ſinne, but wil plead for it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and colour it, queſtionleſſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:5637:104"/>
hee will not leaue it, neither will GOD leaue him vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht. Thirdly, when a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes his ſinne, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the vileneſſe of it, let him enter into iudgement with it, and condemne it: For except hee doe condemne it, GOD will not pardon it. If hee condemne not it. it ſhall condemne him. Vnleſſe hee adiudge it vnto hell, it will debarre him of entrance into heauen. Fourthly, let a man finding himſelfe guilty of ſinne arreſt, arraigne, accuſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne himſelfe, confeſſing his ſinne freely vnto GOD, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt himſelfe vnto GOD, ſaying; I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned grieuouſly againſt thee. I deſerue nothing but confuſion, I am vnworthy of thy fauour, I am vnworthy to bee counted, or called thy
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:5637:105"/>
Sonne, Thy Seruant. Except a man will arraigne, indite, and condemne himſelfe, hee ſhall not bee able to ſtand vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded before his Iudge; either hee muſt condemne himſelfe, or hee ſhall bee condemned of GOD. Neither is a man in deed fit to deſire abſolution, that findes not himſelfe worthy of condemnation: Neither is hee prepared to ſue for grace, till hee haue condemned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a graceleſſe wretch. Fiftly, let him nill it, hate it, loath it, bee afrayd of it, and bee ſorry for committing it, euen becauſe it is an offence of GOD, his gracious and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Maiſter. For a man doth not indeed repent, except his ſinnes, which before were ſweete vnto him as hony, bee now in his taſte as bitter as gall:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:5637:105"/>
except hee loath them, as before hee loued them; except they bee now painefull, as before they were pleaſing; and affect him now as well with dolour, as they tickled him before with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Finally, let a man craue pardon of it of GOD, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it in his practiſe, and addict himſelfe to thoſe good duties, that GOD requires of him. For GOD grants his pardon to them that begge it: And though many men will ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put off a beggar, yet GOD giues his almes to none but beggars: But with what face dare a man begge pardon of a ſinne, hee meanes not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake? Therefore if hee will haue GOD forgiue it, hee muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it. Except hee let it goe, GOD will let him go; but let him giue ſinne his diſmiſſion,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:5637:106"/>
and GOD will grant him his remiſſion; ſpare not thy ſelfe, and GOD will ſpare thee. Ceaſe from thy ſinne, and do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that that is pleaſing in the ſight of GOD, and GOD will bee thy GOD, thy ſauing GOD for euermore. O repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, what ſhall I ſpeake of thee? By thee ſicke men are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wounded men are healed, dead men are raiſed, health is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, Grace is preſerued, the legs are ſtrengthened, the eyes are reſtored, ſinne is abandoned, vertues embraced, the minde illumined, the heart comforted, the conſcience quieted, and the life adorned. Wee ſinne daily, ſo wee ſhould repent daily; and as wee fall, ſo ſhould wee riſe. To ſinne is not ſo dangerous, as to liue in ſinne. If a breach in a ſea-wall bee not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:5637:106"/>
ſtopt in time, it will both waxe bigger, and indanger the dry Land. If a Ship continually let in water, and bee not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pumped out, it will ſinke her. If a Mole bee ſuffered to runne in a Medow, ſhee will ſpoyle it. If a ſword bee let ruſt in the ſcabberd, the ruſt will marre either one or both. So if wee ſtoppe not the breaches and holes made by ſinne in our ſoules, it will ſinke them: If wee kill not that Mole, it will waſte vs; If wee skoure not our ſelues from that ruſt by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it will conſume vs both ſoule and body. <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> made an act that none ſhould ſalute the Emperour, that knew himſelfe a Thiefe; ſo no man ſhould preſume to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, or ſpeake to CHRIST IESVS; no man ſhould dare to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:5637:107"/>
put vp his ſuits vnto GOD. that by ſinne robbes GOD of his glory, and continues in it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance. For GOD hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not ſinners: <hi>If I regard wickedneſſe in mine heart</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) GOD <hi>will not heare mee:</hi> But GOD heareth the deſire of the poore. <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cry, and the</hi> LORD <hi>heareth them.</hi> The LORD heareth them, that are of a contrite heart: His eye is vpon them, that feare him: Hee will alſo heare their cry, and ſaue them: And they feare Him, that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of ſinne, and turne vnto him. For the feare of the LORD is to hate euill, as pride, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, and the euill way, and by the feare of the LORD men depart from that, that is naught. Neither is it enough to forſake ſome notorious and grieuous
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:5637:107"/>
offence; but euen all, all without exception of any; all, all are ſerpents, poyſon, and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. One hole in a ſhip vnſtopt, one breach in a wall vnrepaired, one wing belimed, one claw ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſnare, may in danger and looſe all: ſo but one ſinne knowne and cheriſhed, diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and not diſſmiſſed, one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, one affection, but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped and captiuated of a ſinne eſpied, and yet beloued, euen but one is able to deſtroy the ſoule, to damne the whole man, both ſoule and body: Yet though ſinne bee very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and continuance in it more, yet how vſuall is it with vs to delay our repentance? To<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, next weeke, ere long, next yeere, or before I dye: Yet a little ſleepe, a little ſlumber, anon, one houre longer, one
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:5637:108"/>
halfe houre, a minute. O LORD, how vnwilling are wee to riſe, being once laid downe! Being once fallen a ſleepe how loath are wee to bee wakened! being ſicke with a pleaſant phrenſie, how, how diſpleaſing a thing is it to come into our wits againe! And to ſee our madneſſe, wee that know not whether wee ſhall liue an houre longer, no not a minute further, yet wee will promiſe to our ſelues a day, a weeke, a month, a yeere, olde age. Yea wee will liue in a ſtate, in which wee would bee loath to die. Away, away with theſe delayes, let vs redeeme the time, which taries no mans pleaſure. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent now, that wee may haue our pardon now, let vs liue like Saints, leaſt wee die like diuels: Let vs leaue our ſinnes now,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:5637:108"/>
now, whiles wee haue time to ſinne. For if a man will not leaue ſinne, till hee can ſinne no longer, ſinnes leaues him, and not hee them. Hee that will not part from his ſinne, till his ſoule bee ready to part from his body, it is to bee ſeared that hee parts not with ſinne, but his ſinne with him, and that hee is not willing to let go his ſinne, as long as hee is able to keepe himſelfe. O LORD preſerue mee from the deceipts of ſinne: Hide Thy face from my ſinnes, and put away all mine iniquities. Create in mee a cleane heart, ô GOD, and renew a right ſpirit within mee. Shew mee the way that I ſhould walke in, and ſtay my ſteps in thy pathes, that my feete do not ſlide.</p>

Take away perſeuerance, and ſortitude hath no praiſe, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing hath no reward, and a good beliefe no fauour. Not he that beganne well, but hee that holds out to the end, hee ſhall bee ſaued.

ſhall periſh: Thou deſtroyeſt all them (ô LORD) that go an whooring from thee. But what wilt thou do to perſeuere in the faith? Firſt, intend and purpoſe it. Secondly, pray earneſtly for it, and truſt not to thine owne ſtrength. What is man, if GOD forſake him? A Reede, a Ruſh, a Leafe, a Shadow, a Bubble, a Something Nothing. Thirdly, make nothing an Article of thy Faith, whereof there is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Word, and profeſſing that, which is indeed a truth, bee able to proue and ſhew it out of the Word. I ſuppoſe many would haue ſtood out for the truth in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, which did not, had they beene acquainted with the Scriptures, and ſeene them ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for it. But hee, that ſhall profeſſe Articles of the true
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:5637:110"/>
Faith, and be not certainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his heart by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Word, that they are true, doubtleſſe this man (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept greater grace befall him) will not bee able to endure the tyrants ſword. What? Shall a man caſt away his life, looſe his liberty, vndo wife and children, forſake all pleaſures, profites, and preferments, and that for a faith, which he can ſhew no ground for? Though there be a ground, yet if hee ſee it not, if hee bee not ſure of it, hee will forſake his ground, and for feare giue out. Finally, receiue the faith, for the faith ſake, euen becauſe it is the good Word of GOD, wholeſome, true, and ſauing: And embrace it not for any externall reſpects about it, as riches, honour, proſperity, liberty, or numeroſitie of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours.

For if we follow it for theſe things, then, when they are remoued, wee ſhall forſake it; euen as rauens doe a karcaſe, when the fleſh is eaten vp, and as falſe-hearted perſons do their friends, when their wealth is gone, and their ſtate ſubuerted. If a Maiſter take liking of a ſeruant, becauſe hee ſees him faithfull and quicke, then will hee like him ſtill, whiles hee perceiues thoſe vertues in him.

if wee receiue and follow it ſimply for it ſelfe, becauſe it is true, good, and needfull, then except wee ſtrangely change our ſelues, which GOD forbid, wee ſhall ſtill embrace and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: but if wee receiue it for the fauour of men, for honours, riches, credite, or becauſe wee would not bee out of the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then when theſe things ſhall bee ſeparated from the faith, and when the confeſſours of it ſhall bee diſhonoured, impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, diſgraced, impriſoned, Martyred, then, then wee ſhall renounce it, and giue it our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly fare-well. For our heart will cleaue to the things it takes delight in, and will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no thing longer, then thoſe things do follow, for which it followed it.

thirſting to be reputed hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contemning the world, becauſe he keeps not ſtate, as men commonly will. <hi>Antiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> may glory more in his worme coate, then a modeſt man will in coſtly garments: For pride lies in the heart, and can ſhew it ſelfe as well in ragges as in roabes. <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſeeing certaine yong men of <hi>Rhodes</hi> very richly clad, with laughter ſaid, this is nothing but pride: Afterwards ſeeing the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in ill apparell; This is (quoth hee) another kind of pride.

It is true, nature may be corrected, but that nature muſt be plaiſtered, that I finde not. The ſinnefull ſoule may be amended and refined, but that a new face ſhould be giuen it, when the old manners and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are retained, and that a man would make a glorious profeſſion, where he ſhakes not off his inward rebellions, this is nothing but hypocriſie and vaine glory: So a man hauing a bad complexion of body, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of face, may lawfully by Art, or Induſtry, alter it, if he can, and make it better; but to lay a plaiſter on his face, to lit

and paint his skin, or haire, that he may ſeeme better coloured, then he is indeed, his complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being nothing bettered, but rather waxing worſer, this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vanity, nothing but pride and couſenage. <hi>Phillip</hi> King of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedony had made one of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paters</hi> friends a Iudge: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding he did vſe to die his head and beard, hee diſplaced him againe; ſaying, there was no reaſon why he ſhould be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in an Office, ſeeing he was not truſty in his haire: It being likely that he that would vſe deceite in colouring his haire, where there was no great gaine to be gotten, would much more vſe deciept in his Office, where deceipt ſometimes brings great commodity. I haue heard a fellow ſay ſometimes, he cares not for any man, he feares no
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:5637:116"/>
mans diſpleaſure: What doth this diſcouer, but pride, and folly, fooliſh pride, and proud folly. There is no man almoſt, but he may do the beſt man good, or the greateſt harme. Hath not a flye choakt a man? was not a raskall the death of the great French King? And yet the fellow feares no body, cares for no body. When pride is in, the wit is out: They ſay, when they ſpleene ſwels, the body pines, and whiles a caske is full of winde, it is voide of wine: So we may truely ſay, the ſoule proſpers not, vertue is in truth a ſtranger, whiles the heart doth ſwell with pride, and abounds with arrogancy and ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedneſſe.

Some ſpeake very much, not becauſe they haue the Art of ſpeaking, but becauſe they want the skill to hold their peace: He, that knowes not how to hold his tongue, knowes not how to vſe his tongue: Hee is the onely skilfull man, that knowes when to ſpeake, and when to hold his peace. Either a man ſhould not ſpeake, or ſpeake to purpoſe: Either he ſhould be ſilent, or his words ſhould be better worth then ſilence.

Nothing is ours longer then wee vſe it well; Our tongues are not ours, if wee doe abuſe them, but our enemies, for whom wee vſe them, when wee do abuſe them. An euill tongue comes from an euill heart. For were the heart good, the tongue could not bee naught.

            <p>MAN, a little world, a Map of all the world, the Lord of all inferiour creatures, was created holy and happy, good, and glorious, but now by ſinne hee is become a world of miſery, an enſample of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility, the ſpoyle of time, the image of inconſtancy, the picture of vanity, and very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.

To be borne a beaſt is not a ſinne, but for wilfull ignorance and affected blindeneſſe to be compared to, or to be like a beaſt, when GOD hath endued a man with reaſon, and ſhewes him the meanes of light and vnderſtanding, this is a ſinne, a grieuous ſinne, a fault of the will, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a beaſt is better, then of this man. He was borne a man, and liues a beaſt; and this his ſinne deſerueth ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as neuer beaſt did, doth, ſhall, or can endure. Man was created to be a friend to man, but now (excepting deuils) men

It is true, Hee is an enemy to the wicked, but it is for their wickedneſſe, let them ceaſe from their wickedneſſe, &amp; bee friendly to themſelues, and Hee will not be their enemy, but their trueſt Friend. GOD made euery ſencible creature with ſome defence, Hee gaue ſome Wings, to ſome Talants, to ſome Tuſhes, to ſome Clawes, to other Hornes; but Hee hath made man Armeleſſe, to teach him to bee harmeleſſe, &amp; He gaue him witin ſteed of weapons, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering his owne weaknes, he might ſtill

in euery member, and therefore doth good vnto them all, and is affected with compaſſion, if euen the ſmalleſt of them bee wronged, or ill affected: So a King hath a certaine right in all his ſubiects, hee ſhould animate and rule them all with his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and by his Lawes: hee ſhould ſtudy the welfare of them all, and ſhould be affected true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all their wrongs and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. The head will yeeld to the cutting off an ill-affected member, chuſing rather that one ſhould periſh, then all; but it is not ſimply delighted in the death of any of the members. So a good King loues not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy any of his ſubiects, but had rather ſaue a thouſand, then kill one; yet hee doth, as it were, enforce himſelfe to draw his ſword, as knowing that it is
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:5637:144"/>
better to cut off one, then diſturbe or looſe all. But though the head may determine to cut away a member, yet doth it not by it ſelfe, but by ſome other member, or inſtrument: ſo though iudgement and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation belongs vnto the King, yet executions thereof are fitteſt by farre to bee performed of others. But al-be-it the head agree to the deſtruction of a member, yet no member is ſeene to lift it ſelfe vp againſt the head with violence (as it were) to ſtrike, or hurt it: So is it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſauage and vnnaturall for Subiects to lay violent hands vpon the ſacred bodies of their King, who is as Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which, was not to bee touched vnder paine of death. Mercy and Iuſtice are two ſaue-gards of a King, and moſt comely for
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:5637:145"/>
him. If nothing can be ſafe from him, there can be no ſafety for him: His ſafety and ſecurity ſtands in the ſafety and ſecurity of his Subiects, of whom it is ſafer for him to be loued, then to be feared: It is ſurer for him to tye them to him by Princely humanity, then to exaſperate and awe them with tyrannicall ſeuerity. The King of the Bees himſelfe is alone without a ſting; Nature would not that he ſhould be cruell, and hath left his anger without a weapon. Doubtleſſe Clemency is a Princely vertue. Herein a King may ſhew himſelfe like the KING of Kings, who though able eaſily to be reuenged of all, that doe offend him. yet is he ſo indulgent, that he pardons many, and ſometimes deferres the puniſhments of His verieſt
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:5637:145"/>
enemies, and ſtrikes not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, when cauſe is giuen Him. Euery King ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ſerue the KING of Kings, CHRIST IESVS, to whom all Kings are Vaſſals. It is iuſt that they ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with rebellious, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, vnfaithfull, and wicked Subiects, that themſelues neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Lawes of their SOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAIGNE, and are vnfaithfull to their GOD: And herein a King doth moſt of all ſerue CHRIST, to wit, in doing that good, and hindring that euill, which hee could neither do, nor hinder, but as he is a King. Some think a woman may not raigne. What did <hi>Debora</hi> among the If<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites? If woemen (as many Virgines, and Widdowes) may be Ladies and Miſtreſſes of ſeruants, euen Males, Why
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:5637:146"/>
may they not be Queenes, if the Prouidence of heauen bring them to it. The Regall power is neither Maſculine, nor Foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, but Diuine. Sonnes are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to honour their naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſurely without ſtaine vnto their ſexe, and what ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh or indignity can it bee to men to honour their Politicall Mother? Hee that honours an abſolute Potentate aright, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King or Queene, honours the power and authority, which is Diuine and not Humane, and honours the perſon for the Power, &amp; not the Power for the perſon: Bee the perſon good or bad, the Power is good, it is of GOD: And it may fall out that an euill man may bee a good Monarch: But whatſoeuer the Monarch is, the Monarchy, the Monarches power is euer good,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:5637:146"/>
and neuer bad: For there is no power, but of GOD; and the powers, that be, are ordained of GOD: Whoſoeuer therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the ordinance of GOD. And they that reſiſt ſhall receiue to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues condemnation.

It is poſſible that the ſould ſhould be deſtroyed, as it was for the Sunne to ſtand ſtill, for the ſea to ſtand diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the fire not to burne the three children, but this is not by the nature thereof, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the power of GOD,

who is able, if Hee pleaſed, to turne the whole world into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as Hee once made it of nothing. But indeed the ſoule of a man ſhall neuer die, ſhall neuer bee diſſolued as is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but continueth whole and firme for euer. For the proofe hereof I ſuppoſe it the ſureſt way for euery man to fortifie himſelfe with the vndoubted teſtimonies of holy Writ. <hi>The Spirit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſtes) returnes to</hi> GOD <hi>that gaue it.</hi> The ſoule of the poore beggar was in ioy, but the ſoule of the rich Epicure was in torment, after their bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death.

By which it is moſt certaine that the ſoule doth liue after the body is dead: But what though the ſoule ſhall liue for euer, if it liue in paine, as the ſoules of the damned do? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it were better not to be, then to be tormented and out of eaſe: Therefore let vs die before wee die, and leaue our ſinnes before wee leaue the world. If our ſoules do die to ſinne in this life, they ſhall not die by ſinne in the life to come: If they liue to GOD by grace in this world, they ſhall liue with GOD in glory in the world to come. The world is mortall, but the ſoule of man is immortall; Why

ſhould that, that is immortall, bee pind on that, that is mortall? Why ſhould the ſoule that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die, be buried in the loue of thoſe things that cannot but die, and come to nothing?
