            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Could not without injuſtice, have dedicated this Book to any but your Lordſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as there is no perſon to whom I am ſo much obliged, ſo there is no member of either Houſe of
<pb facs="tcp:59620:3"/>
Parliament that hath ſo freely and generouſly owned the Proteſtant intereſt. As for my obligations to your Lordſhip, becauſe they are too great to be expreſt, it is my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take all occaſions of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my thankfulneſs for them, and therefore I take this occaſion to proclaim my thankfulneſs to the World. As for your Lordſhips late owning the Proteſtant intereſt in the Houſe of Peers, it was ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and accompanied with ſuch zeal and courage, that (next under God, and the King) your Lordſhip may deſervedly be ſtiled the chief aſſerter and promoter of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the aſſerter and promoter of the intereſt of <hi>England.</hi> For the intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:59620:3"/>
and the intereſt of this Kingdom, are ſo interwoven, that the welfare or ruine of either, is the welfare or ruine of both. Now being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by your Lordſhip, both as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant, and alſo more particularly in my private capacity, I beſeech God to grant that your life may be long and proſperous, your memory and poſterity honourable, as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall endure, and your ſoul and body eternally happy, when time ſhall be no more. To this Prayer I ſhall only add, that I am unfeignedly,</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe Author of this Piece was one <hi>Mounſieur de Rodon,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy Profeſſor in the Royal Colledge at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> a City of <hi>Languedoc</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where it was written. But as ſoon as it was Printed, it was ſuppreſt by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Authority, prohibiting all perſons to keep any of them, upon I know not what ſevere penalties, and ſuch Copies as could be found, were publickly burnt by the Hang man, about 1660. Whereupon the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for fear of being condemned to keep company with his Books, was forced to fly to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he not long after died. Theſe ſeverities of our Adverſaries bring to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance what a learned and ingenious <hi>Frenchman</hi> once told me, <hi>viz.</hi> that this
<pb facs="tcp:59620:5"/>
ſmall Tract hath more netled their Party then any one Piece that ever was extant in <hi>France</hi> ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion there. Whether that be a miſtake, I know not, but this I dare affirm, that though many famous men of that Kingdom have, in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this Age, written very ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> hereſies, yet there is not one of them whoſe perſon and writings have had ſuch hard meaſure. Whence it appears that our Author (his very enemies being judges) hath made good what he undertook, <hi>viz.</hi> he hath deſtroyed that great <hi>Diana</hi> the Maſs, and hath alſo, by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, deſtroyed all the Arguments made uſe of by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors for the reſtoring and re-eſtabliſhing of her: which he hath ſo well performed, that to this very day, not one of them hath dared ſo much as to attempt to revive her, by anſwering his Book; ſo that here you may ſee her laid in her grave, without hope of reſurrection; and
<pb facs="tcp:59620:5"/>
therefore the Book may very fitly be termed, <hi>The Funeral of the Maſs;</hi> and conſequently the Funeral of <hi>Romiſh</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and idolatries, as the Author well obſerves. For the truth is the Maſs and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt convertible terms, ſo that if the former be deſtroyed, the latter muſt vaniſh into its firſt nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Author having deſtroyed the Maſs, hath deſtroyed the thing called Popery too. As for the monſtrous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities and blaſphemies which flow from this one <hi>Romiſh</hi> doctrine of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, they would fill whole volumes; but I ſhall content my ſelf to ſay that the Maſs conſiſts of more groſs and abominable Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, Phanaticiſms, and Idolatries, then ever have been believed or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the moſt ignorant Pagans. What the tenets of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are, and what their practices have been in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Proteſtant Magiſtrates and People, woful and ſad experience hath
<pb facs="tcp:59620:6"/>
ſufficiently taught the World. I ſhall only add, that they are as pernicious to our bodies, and eſtates as their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Doctrines, and idolatrous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are to our Souls. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to introduce Popery into this Kingdome would be an act as unpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick as Anti-chriſtian, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in that incomparable piece, entituled, <hi>The eſtabliſhed Religion in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Popery.</hi> But becauſe (I know not by what ſtrange infatuation or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, or rather by what wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgment of God) this monſtrous, abſurd, and deſtructive (ſhall I call it?) Religion prevails amongſt us, I thought good to Engliſh and Print this ſmall Treatiſe, as the beſt Antidote againſt Popery (the Holy Scripture excepted) that ever I read; and for ought I know, it is not inferior to the beſt of this kind, that ever was yet extant: to which opinion the harſh uſage it hath had from our Adverſaries, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, doth certainly give no ſmall
<pb facs="tcp:59620:6"/>
Teſtimony. But I know that the holy Scripture it ſelf cannot profit except God be pleaſed to give his bleſſing, much leſs can this Book; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I earneſtly beſeech him that he would make it proſperous and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the good of Souls; and if any ſhall receive benefit by it, I deſire them to give him all the glory, and then I ſhall think my ſelf infinitely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed for my pains in tranſlating it.</p>

            <p>THE Romaniſts are wont to tell us, that theſe words of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are ſo clear to prove the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts Body in the Hoſt, and conſequently to prove Tranſubſtantiation (or the ſubſtantial converſion of the Bread into Chriſts Body) that they are amazed we cannot perceive ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59620:9"/>
a truth. Againſt which I form this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He that ſpeaks contrary to the uſage of all the World, and takes words otherwiſe then all other men do, muſt without doubt, ſpeak very obſcure: But if Jeſus Chriſt by theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> had meant the real preſence of his Body in the Hoſt (as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Doctors aſſert) and conſequently had meant the ſubſtantial converſion of the Bread into his Body, he had ſpoken contrary to the common uſage of all the World, and had taken the words otherwiſe then all other men do, which I thus prove. There was never any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor either ſacred, or prophane, that made uſe of ſuch words as theſe, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſubſtantial converſion of one thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another; or to ſignifie the real preſence of a thing immediately after the pronouncing of them, and not before. On the contrary, there was never any man that did not uſe them to ſignifie, that the thing was already that which it was ſaid to be. For example; When God the Father, ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son</hi> it is certain that Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God before God ſaid it: and in common uſage it is never ſaid this is that, except the thing be ſo before it is ſaid to be ſo. For example; We do not ſay <hi>this is a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> before that, which we mean by the word
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59620:9"/>
               <hi>this,</hi> be a Table. Therefore it is contrary to the common ſtile of all Authors, as well ſacred as prophane, and contrary to the common uſage of all men, to make theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> to ſignifie the ſubſtantial converſion of the Bread into Chriſts Body, and the real preſence of his Body in the Hoſt immediately after the pronouncing of them by the Prieſt, and not before. Seeing then that Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> did not ſpeak contrary to the common uſage of all the World, and did not take the words other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then all other men do, it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> do not ſignifie the ſubſtantial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Bread into Chriſts Body, nor the real preſence of Chriſts Body in the Hoſt immediately after the Prieſt hath pronounced them, and not before. And this being ſo, the Romiſh Doctors muſt ſeek ſome other paſſages of Scripture, than this, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> to prove ſuch a converſion, and ſuch a preſence; and ſeeing they can find none, I conclude that ſuch a converſion and ſuch a preſence, have no foundation in holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That which I have ſaid concerning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage is founded on this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe things muſt be before there can be any Image, Picture, or Repreſentation of them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59620:10"/>
and conſequently Images are after the things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof they are Images: But words are the Images of conceptions, and conceptions the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of things: Therefore things are ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can really conceive them to be ſuch, and we conceive them to be ſuch, before we can ſay they are ſuch. Therefore that which Jeſus Chriſt held, and gave to his Diſciples, expreſſed by the word <hi>this,</hi> was his body, before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it was his body, and he conceived that it was his body, before he ſaid <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and conſequently it is not by vertue of theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that that which Jeſus Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, expreſſed by the word <hi>this,</hi> was his Body; but rather it is by bleſſing the bread, or thankſgiving that the bread was made the Body of Chriſt, becauſe it was made the Sacrament of it. Whence it follows that theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded thus, <hi>this bread is my body;</hi> and theſe words <hi>this bread is my body,</hi> muſt be expounded thus, <hi>this bread is the Sacrament of my body;</hi> which I prove thus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Propoſition muſt be expounded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the thing in queſtion; for example, If a man, pointing at the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhould ſay, <hi>this is the King,</hi> the Propoſition muſt be expounded thus, <hi>this is the Kings Perſon,</hi> becauſe the Kings Perſon is meant: But if a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59620:10"/>
man coming into a Painters Shop, and pointing at the Kings Picture, ſhould ſay, <hi>this is the King,</hi> the Propoſition muſt be expounded thus, <hi>this is the Kings Picture;</hi> becauſe here his Picture is meant. Even ſo if Jeſus Chriſt laying his hand on his Breaſt, had ſaid this is my Body, we muſt without doubt have underſtood the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition concerning his real Body, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sign, or Sacrament of it; becauſe his very Body had been then meant, and not the ſign or Sacrament of it: But Jeſus Chriſt, being about to inſtitute the Euchariſt, and to that end, having taken bread, bleſſed it, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it to his Diſciples with theſe words, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body,</hi> it is evident that they muſt be underſtood of the Sacrament of his Body, and the Propoſition muſt be expounded thus, <hi>this is the Sacrament of my Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> becauſe here the Sacrament of his Body is meant. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sacrament is a viſible ſign of an inviſible grace, as the Council of Trent ſaith, in its ſixth Seſſion, it is evident that this Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> being expounded by this, <hi>this is the Sacrament of my Body,</hi> may be expounded thus, <hi>this is the ſign of my Body;</hi> which I confirm thus.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>This is my body, This cup is the New Teſtament in my bloud,</hi> the word <hi>[is]</hi> muſt be taken in the ſame ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59620:11"/>
they are alike, having been pronounced upon the ſame matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the one upon one part of the Sacrament, and the other upon the other part of it; and becauſe of like things we muſt give a like judgment. But in this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>this cup is the New Teſtament,</hi> the word <hi>[is]</hi> is not taken for a real and tranſubſtantiated being; but for a ſacramental and ſignificative being: becauſe neither the cup, nor that which is in the cup, is changed into a Teſtament; neither is it really and properly a Teſtament, but the Sacrament of the New Teſtament. Therefore in this Propoſition likewiſe, <hi>this is my body,</hi> the word <hi>[is]</hi> is not taken for a real and tranſubſtantiated being; but for a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and ſignificative being: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as this Propoſition, <hi>this cup is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> muſt be expounded thus; the Wine that is in the cup is the ſign and Sacrament of the New Teſtament: So this Propoſition, <hi>this is my body,</hi> muſt be expounded thus, this Bread is the ſign and Sacrament of my Body. Whence it follows that in one ſingle Propoſition of Jeſus Chriſt in the inſtitution of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, <hi>viz. this cup is the New Teſtament,</hi> there are two figures, one in the word <hi>Cup,</hi> being taken for that which is in the cup; this is a figure called a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> whereby the thing containing is taken for the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59620:11"/>
The other Figure is, that the cup is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the New Teſtament: this is alſo a Figure called a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> whereby the ſign is called by the name of the thing ſignified. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors are miſtaken when they tell us that all that Jeſus Chriſt ſaid when he inſtituted the Euchariſt, muſt be taken literally, and without a figure. But withal we muſt not imagine that Jeſus Chriſt ſpake obſcurely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpake figuratively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe figures and manners of ſpeech, being commonly and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly uſed by all the World.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But when we ſay that theſe words, <hi>this is my body, this is my bloud,</hi> muſt be expounded thus, this Bread is the Sign and Sacrament of my Body, this Wine is the Sign and Sacrament of my Bloud, we do not mean that the Bread and Wine are barely and ſimply ſigns of Chriſts Body and Bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we believe that the Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt are ſigns that do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the body and bloud of Chriſt to Believers: For when they do, by the mouth of the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, they do at the ſame time, by the mouth of the ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith, receive the Body of Chriſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his Bloud ſhed for the remiſſion of their ſins, as will be proved in the next Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Add hereunto this one Argument: When
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59620:12"/>
a man ſaith that a thing is ſuch, if it be not ſuch, during the whole time, which he imploys in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſuch, he makes a falſe Propoſition. For example, When a man ſaith that a Wall is white, if it be not white, during the whole time he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys in ſaying it is white, he makes a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But (according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors) when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>this is my body,</hi> it was not his body during the whole time which he imployed in ſaying <hi>this is my body;</hi> for, they ſay, it was his body afterward only: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, Jeſus Chriſt uttered a falſe Propoſition: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blaſphemous to affirm, we muſt lay down this for a foundation, that that which Jeſus Chriſt gave his Diſciples when he ſaid, <hi>this is my body,</hi> was his body, not only after he had ſaid it, but alſo while he was ſaying it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid it. And here we have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth of theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>this is my body,</hi> much better then they do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe it at one time only, <hi>viz.</hi> after he had ſaid it: but we believe it at three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, <hi>viz.</hi> before he ſaid it, when he was ſaying it, and after he had ſaid it. But here ſome may object that we muſt not take the words of our Lord in too rigorous a ſenſe, and that in theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> we muſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59620:12"/>
take the Preſent tenſe for the next Future, and then the ſenſe will be this, this will immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be my body. To which I anſwer, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors will have us take theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> in the rigour of the literal ſenſe, and then the Propoſition is evidently falſe. I know that the Preſent tenſe may be taken for the next Future; as when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I go to my Father, and to your Father; I go to my God, and to your God:</hi> that is, I ſhall go ſpeedily. But who can be ſo bold and ignorant as to affirm that this ſpeech is without a Figure, ſeeing all Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians know that it is a Figure called <hi>Enallage</hi> of time? Therefore the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that by their own doctrine this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>this is my body,</hi> is either falſe or figurative; and that ſeeing it is not falſe, it muſt be figurative, and that the figure muſt be a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> whereby the ſign takes the name of the thing ſignified (as hath already been proved) and not an Enallage of time.</p>

            <head type="sub">Concerning the Expoſition of theſe words,</head>
            <head type="sub">He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud bath eternal life. My fleſh is meat indeed, &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IN this Chapter I ſhall prove that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks of a ſpiritual eating and drinking by Faith, and not of a corporal eating and drinking by the mouth of the body. My firſt Argument is this. When a man would ſatisfie his hunger, and quench his thirſt, he eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and drinketh that thing, which he hungers and thirſts after; becauſe eating ſatisfieth hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and drinking quencheth thirſt: But it is by Faith, that is, by believing in Jeſus Chriſt, that we ſatisfie the hunger, and quench the thirſt which we have after Chriſt; for it is in the ſixth of St. <hi>John, He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth in me ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirſt:</hi> Therefore it is by Faith or by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that we eat and drink Jeſus Chriſt; and conſequently the eating of Chriſt fleſh, and drinking his bloud is ſpiritual, and not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My ſecond Argument is this: Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59620:13"/>
ſaith, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood hath eternal life.</hi> And <hi>except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drink his bloud, ye have no life in you,</hi> John 6. But it is the ſpiritual eating and drinking by Faith that gives life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and not the corporal eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the mouth of the body; becauſe many Reprobates (according to the very doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf) do corporally eat the fleſh, and drink the bloud of Chriſt, and yet ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit eternal life.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. The third Argument is taken from S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, <hi>and Cardinal</hi> Cajetan, <hi>who expound the words of Jeſus Chriſt as we do. St.</hi> Auguſtin <hi>in Book 3. of</hi> Chriſtian Doctrine, <hi>ſpeaketh thus,</hi> To eat the fleſh of Chriſt is a figure, teaching us to partake of Chriſts Paſſion, and to imprint in our memories with delight and profit, that Chriſt was crucified for us. <hi>Card.</hi> Cajetan <hi>in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on St.</hi> John <hi>6. ſaith,</hi> To eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his bloud, is faith in Chriſts death; ſo that the ſenſe is this, if you uſe not the death of the Son of man as meat and drink, ye ſhall not have the life of the Spirit in you. <hi>And having ſufficiently proved his Expoſition, he adds:</hi> To eat and drink the Sacrament is a thing common, as well to thoſe that eat unworthily, as to thoſe that eat worthily, but that which Jeſus Chriſt here ſpeaks of, is not common to both, for he ſaith, he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59620:14"/>
that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, hath eternal life; he ſaith not he that eateth worthily and drinketh worthily, but he that eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. <hi>Whence it clearly appears, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Letter, he ſpeaks not of eating, and drinking the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, but of eating and drinking the death of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Now that we may clearly underſtand this doctrine, we muſt conſider, wherein the life which Jeſus Chriſt gives us, doth conſiſt; for ſeeing the fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt is meat to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it gives us life; it is evident that if we know what life what life that is which Jeſus Chriſt gives us, we muſt know likewiſe how Jeſus Chriſt is meat to us, and conſequently how we eat him. But to know what that life is which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt gives us, we muſt conſider what that death is in which we were involved, which is expreſſed by St. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 2. in theſe words: <hi>When we were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes God hath quickned us together with Chriſt: by grace ye are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> and conſequently the death in which we were involved, conſiſts in two things, firſt in the curſe of the Law, which imports the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of felicity, and the ſuffering of temporal and eternal puniſhment for our ſins: Secondly it conſiſts in an habitual corruption, whereby ſin raigns in us; and therefore it is ſaid 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59620:14"/>
               <hi>The widow that lives in pleaſure is dead while ſhe liveth.</hi> Alſo ſins are called <hi>dead works, Heb.</hi> 10. So that the life which Jeſus Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us, conſiſts in two things. Firſt, In deliverance from the curſe of the Law by the pardon of our ſins, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Colloſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>God hath quickned you together with Chriſt, having forgiven you all treſpaſſes, blotting out the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was againſt us;</hi> which obligation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Law, becauſe it did oblige all the tranſgreſſors of it to a curſe. Secondly, It conſiſts in regeneration, or ſanctification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaking in <hi>John</hi> 3. ſaith, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> and S. <hi>Paul Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the life which Jeſus Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us, conſiſts in the pardon of our ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in our regeneration, and ſanctification, which ends in glorification; and that Jeſus Chriſt is called meat in reference to this life, we muſt conſider the means, whereby Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed theſe things for us; and ſeeing it is certain, that his death is the means by which he hath purchaſed pardon of ſins, and regeneration, we muſt conclude that Jeſus Chriſt is the food and nouriſhment of our ſouls in regard of the merit of his death. But that Jeſus Chriſt by his death hath purchaſed life for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59620:15"/>
us, (that is juſtification, which conſiſts in the pardon of our ſins, and regeneration, which conſiſts in holineſs of life) appears by theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture <hi>viz. We are juſtified by the bloud of Chriſt, and reconciled to God by his death,</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>We have redemption by his bloud, even the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Epheſ. 1. <hi>He hath reconciled us in the body of his fleſh by his death, that he may preſent us holy, without ſpot, and blameleſs in his ſight.</hi> Coll. 1. <hi>We are ſanctified by the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> Heb. 10. <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word, that he might preſent it unto himſelf a glorious Church, &amp;c. Eph.</hi> 5. Therefore ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed life for us by his death, and that his fleſh and bloud are our meat and drink (becauſe they purchaſed life eternal for us on the Croſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the remiſſion of our ſins, and ſanctification, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in glorification) it follows that the action whereby Jeſus Chriſt is applied to us for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſanctification, is the ſame by which we eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his bloud. But this action is nothing elſe but Faith, as the Scripture tells us: <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God.</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>God purifies our hearts by faith.</hi> Act. 15. <hi>He that believeth hath eternal life.</hi> Joh. 6. From what hath been ſaid I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59620:15"/>
form this Argument. That Action whereby we obtain remiſſion of ſins, and ſanctification, ending in glorification, is the ſame, whereby we have that life, which Jeſus Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us by his death; becauſe that life principally conſiſts in the remiſſion of ſins, and ſanctification, as we have proved. But the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eating, and drinking by faith, and not the corporal by the mouth, is that action, whereby we obtain remiſſion of ſins, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, as we have alſo proved. Therefore the ſpiritual eating and drinking by faith is the action, whereby we have that life, which Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for us by his death, and not the corporal eating and drinking by the mouth. And conſequently ſeeing in St. <hi>John</hi> 6. a certain eating and drinking is ſpoken of, whereby we have that life which Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for us by his death; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that a ſpiritual eating and drinking is there ſpoken of, and not a corporal.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From what hath been ſaid it appears, that when Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>my fleſh is meat indeed,</hi> &amp;c. the figure falls upon the word <hi>meat,</hi> which is taken not for corporal but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meat. The reaſon whereof is, that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral food is that which is appointed for the nouriſhment of the body, as ſpiritual food is that which is appointed for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59620:16"/>
of the ſoul; ſo that although corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral food be taken by the mouth of the body, yet that only doth not make it to be corporal food, except it be taken for the nouriſhment of the body; otherwiſe poiſon, medicine, a bullet, &amp;c. which a man ſhould ſwallow would be corporal food; which is abſurd to affirm. But the fleſh of Chriſt, which is pretended to be eaten in the Euchariſt by the mouth of the body, is not appointed for the nouriſhment of the body; becauſe that food which is appointed for the nouriſhment of the body is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſtance of the body: but the body of Chriſt is not changed into the ſubſtance of our bodies: Therefore the fleſh of Chriſt is not a corporal food, but his fleſh broken, and his bloud ſhed on the croſs is a ſpiritual food, which nouriſheth the ſouls of thoſe, who by a true and lively faith, do embrace this fleſh broken, and this bloud ſhed; that is, who do wholy reſt and rely on the merit of his death and paſſion for obtaining mercy from God. And certainly, ſeeing that the life which Jeſus Chriſt gives us by his death, is ſpiritual, that the nouriſhment is ſpiritual, that the eating his body and drinking his bloud, is ſpiritual (as hath been proved) it follows that his fleſh muſt be ſpiritual meat, and his bloud ſpiritual drink. And this fleſh of Chriſt is incomparably better, and more truly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59620:16"/>
meat indeed in regard of its effects, than cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral food can be; becauſe it doth better, and more perfectly nouriſh the ſouls of Believers then corporal food doth their bodies; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruptible food which gives temporal life only; but that ſpiritual and incorruptible food which gives life eternal.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I conclude this Chapter with this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. When a doctrine is propoſed which is pretended to be divine, and that paſſages of holy Scripture are alledged for the proof of it, if it oppoſeth, or ſeems to oppoſe ſenſe and reaſon, and to include contradictions; and that a more ſuitable and rational ſenſe can be found out for thoſe paſſages, ſo that all theſe inconveniences and contradictions may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; there is nothing more juſt than that we ſhould embrace that probable and rational ſenſe, and reject that doctrine which oppoſeth ſenſe and reaſon and ſeems to imply contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: But the doctrine of the real preſence of the Manhood of Jeſus Chriſt in the Hoſt, and the tranſubſtantiation of the Bread into his Body, is repugnant to ſenſe and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>reaſon, and ſeems to include divers contradictions; <hi>(viz.</hi> that a humane body is in a point without any local extenſion, that a body may be in divers places at one and the ſame time, that the Bread and Wine are changed into the Body and Blood
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59620:17"/>
of Chriſt, which were before; that accidents may be without a ſubject, &amp;c.) And the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are impertinently alledged to prove ſuch a preſence, and ſuch a change, have a ſenſe very commodious and rational, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe contradictions, as appears in this and the former Chapter, where I have very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally expounded thoſe two paſſages which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors impertinently make uſe of for this ſubject. Therefore they ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that commodious and rational ſenſe which we have given them; and to reject the doctrine of the real preſence of the body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Hoſt, and the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

            <p>In every ſubſtantial converſion, that thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which another thing is converted, is always newly produced. For example, when ſeed is converted into an animal, that animal is newly produced; when Jeſus Chriſt turned the water into wine, the wine was newly produced, &amp;c. But the Body and Bloud of Chriſt cannot be newly produced in the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt: Therefore the Bread and Wine are not ſubſtantially converted into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. The ſecond Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Body and Bloud of Chriſt cannot be newly produced, I prove thus: That which is newly produced re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a new being; becauſe to produce a thing, and to give it a being is one and the ſame: But the Body and Bloud of Chriſt cannot receive a new being, which I prove thus: A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59620:18"/>
receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>t which he hath, while he hath it, and therefore he cannot receive a being while he hath a being; for as it is impoſſible to take away a being from that which hath no being; ſo it is impoſſible to give a being to that which hath a being already: and as you cannot kill a dead man, ſo you cannot give life to one that is living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Body and Bloud of Chriſt have, and always will have a being: Therefore they cannot receive one, and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reproduced in the Euchariſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My ſecond Argument is this. In every ſubſtantial converſion, that thing which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into another is deſtroyed. For example, When the water was turned into wine, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was deſtroyed: But in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt the Bread and Wine are not deſtroyed by the conſecration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I prove thus: In the celebration of the Euchariſt there is break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, giving, eating and drinking after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, as appears by the very practice of our Adverſaries, who after conſecration, break the Hoſt, and divide it into three parts, give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Communicants but conſecrated Hoſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eat and drink nothing but what was conſecrated: But the Scripture ſaith, that in the celebration of the Euchariſt, Bread is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that Bread and Wine are given, and that Bread is eaten and Wine drunk, as appears by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59620:18"/>
theſe following paſſages. St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ſaith, <hi>The bread which we break is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> and 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. St. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. and St. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. it is ſaid that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt took bread, brake it and gave it;</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. and St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. Jeſus Chriſt after he had participated of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt, ſaith, <hi>I will drink no more of this fruit of the Vine:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup. Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Secondly, When Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. that is, drink ye all of this cup, either he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to drink of a cup of Wine or of a cup of Bloud: if he commanded them to drink of a cup of Wine, then it follows that they drank nothing but Wine, becauſe it is certain that they obeyed Jeſus Chriſt; for it is ſaid St. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. that <hi>they all drank <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f it.</hi> Or if he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to drink of a cup of Bloud, then it follows that the Wine was already changed into his Bloud, becauſe it is not probable that Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to them Drink ye all of this cup of Bloud, and yet that it was not a cup of Bloud, but a cup of Wine. But when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> he did not ſpeak to them of a cup of Bloud for the Wine was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59620:19"/>
not then converted into Chriſts Bloud, becauſe (according to our Adverſaries) it was not changed until Jeſus Chriſt had made an end of uttering theſe following words, <hi>for this is my bloud.</hi> But he uttered theſe words, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> before he uttered thoſe, <hi>for this is my bloud;</hi> becauſe a man muſt utter a Propoſition before he can give the reaſon of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thirdly, When a thing is converted into another, we cannot ſee the effects and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the thing converted, but only of that into which it is converted. For example, When the ſeed is changed into an animal, we can ſee no more the effects and properties of the ſeed, but of the animal only; and when Jeſus Chriſt turned the Water into Wine, the effects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and accidents of the Water were no more ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of the Wine only, &amp;c. But in the Euchariſt we cannot, after the conſecration, perceive the effects, properties, accidents, or parts of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; but we ſee there all the effects, properties, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Bread and Wine: Therefore in the Euchariſt, the Bread and Wine are not converted into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt. And the truth is, if that which appears to be Bread, and hath all the effects, accidents, and properties of Bread, be not Bread, but Chriſts Body cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the accidents of Bread; then it may
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59620:19"/>
likewiſe be ſaid that they that appear to be men, and have all the effects, properties, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of men are not men, but horſes cloathed with the accidents of men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fourth Argument is this. In every ſubſtantial converſion there muſt be a ſubject to paſs from one ſubſtance to another; for then it would be a Creation, which is the ſole action that doth not preſuppoſe a ſubject. But in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, after the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is no ſubject; becauſe, according to our Adverſaries, there remains no ſubject; for, as they aſſert, the accidents of Bread and Wine remain without any ſubject at all: Therefore in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt there is no ſubſtantial converſion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The fifth Argument is drawn from hence, That Tranſubſtantiation deſtroys the nature of accidents, thus. That doctrine which aſſerts that accidents are not accidents but ſubſtances, deſtroys the nature and eſſence of accidents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible that an accident can be a ſubſtance. But the doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation aſſerts that accidents are not accidents, but that they are ſubſtances, which I prove thus. That doctrine which aſſerts that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are not inherent, but that they ſubſiſt of themſelves, doth aſſert that accidents are not accidents, but that they are ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59620:20"/>
becauſe inherence is the eſſential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of an accident, and ſubſiſtence the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential difference of a ſubſtance. But the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation aſſerts that accidents are not inherent, but that they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, which I prove thus. That doctrine which aſſerts that accidents may be without a ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> the accidents of Bread and Wine without any ſubſtance, and without any ſubject to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain them; for by Tranſubſtantiation the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread and Wine is gone, and their accidents remain: Therefore the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation aſſerts that accidents are not inherent, but do ſubſiſt by themſelves, and conſequently aſſerts that accidents are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, but ſubſtances, and ſo deſtroys the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eſſence of accidents. But here it may be ſaid that actual inherence doth not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an accident, but aptitudinal only. Againſt which I form this Argument. Whatſoever doth exiſt actually, either it exiſts in ſomething elſe actually ſo, that it cannot be without it, which Philoſophers call actual inherence, as walking: or elſe it exiſts in and by it ſelf actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſo that it may be alone by it ſelf, which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59620:20"/>
Philoſophers term <hi>actual exiſtence;</hi> the former of theſe conſtitutes an accident, and the latter conſtitutes a ſubſtance. But the accidents of the Bread and Wine, after conſecration, do exiſt actually: Therefore they muſt exiſt either in ſomething elſe actually, or in themſelves actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. But they do not exiſt in and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves actually, for then they would ſubſiſt by themſelves, and be real ſubſtances, which is impoſſible: Therefore they exiſt in ſomething elſe actually, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine, and conſequently the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine remains after the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and ſo there can be no Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſixth Argument is drawn from this, That Tranſubſtantiation deſtroys the nature of Sacraments, becauſe every Sacrament is a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign of an inviſible grace, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith in <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 6. and every ſign relates to the thing ſignified, ſo that we muſt ſpeak of ſigns and Sacraments, as of things relating to ſomething elſe. But all relative things have, as it were, a double being, <hi>viz.</hi> an abſolute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is the natural being of the thing, and a relative being whereby it relates to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. For example, In a man that hath begotten a child, we conſider his abſolute and natural being as he is a man as others are, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59620:21"/>
his relative being, whereby he is a Father, and is diſtinguiſhed from other men that have no children, and ſo are not Fathers. So in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm, the ſign, <hi>viz.</hi> the Water, hath an abſolute and natural being, <hi>viz.</hi> its cold and moiſt ſubſtance, whereby it is water as other waters are; and a relative, ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and ſignificative being, whereby it is the ſign and Sacrament of Chriſts Bloud, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from other waters that are not imployed for this ſacred uſe. Even ſo in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, the Bread and Wine, which are the ſigns, have their natural and abſolute being, <hi>viz.</hi> their ſubſtance whereby they are Bread and Wine, as other Bread and Wine, which we commonly uſe; and their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſacramental, and ſignificative being, whereby they are the Sacrament and ſigns of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and differ from all other Bread and Wine that is not thus imployed. To this I add, That it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a relative being ſhould be without an abſolute, becauſe a relative cannot be without its foundation. For example, It is impoſſible to be a Father without being a Man; to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual without quantity, &amp;c. And this being granted, I form my Argument thus, That which takes away the natural being from ſigns and Sacraments, deſtroys their nature and eſſence;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59620:21"/>
becauſe the relative and ſacramental being can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without the abſolute and natural, as hath been proved. But the doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation deſtroys the natural being of the Bread and Wine, which are ſigns and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſts Body and Bloud; for by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, the whole ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine is deſtroyed: Therefore the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation deſtroys the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eſſence of Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To this Argument our Adverſaries an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That in the Euchariſt the Bread and Wine are not ſigns, becauſe by the conſecration they are deſtroyed as to their ſubſtance. But ſome of them ſay that the ſigns are the accidents of the Bread and Wine; others ſay that the Body and Bloud of Chriſt contained under the accidents of the Bread and Wine, are the ſigns of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt crucified; Laſtly, others ſay, that neither the accidents of the Bread and Wine only, nor the Body and Bloud of Chriſt only, but the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, together with the accidents of the Bread and Wine, are the ſigns of the Body and Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt crucified: Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation doth not deſtroy the natural being of Chriſts Body and Bloud, nor the natural being of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Bread and Wine, they maintain
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59620:22"/>
that the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation doth not deſtroy the nature and eſſence of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To this I reply, That neither the accidents of the Bread and Wine only, nor the Body and Bloud of Chriſt only, nor the Body and Bloud of Chriſt together with the accidents of the Bread and Wine, are the true ſigns of Jeſus Chriſt crucified; but the Bread and Wine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which I prove thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, In Sacraments there ought to be an analogy and ſimilitude between the ſign, and the thing ſignified, as our Adverſaries confeſs, and particularly Card. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> Book 1. of the <hi>Sacrament, chap.</hi> 9. in theſe words. <hi>The fourth thing required in a Sacrament, is that the ſign ſhould have ſome ſimilitude and analogy with the thing ſignified.</hi> And he quotes St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 23. to <hi>Boniface,</hi> ſpeaking thus: <hi>If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments had not ſome ſimilitude of the things whereof they are Sacraments they could be no Sacraments:</hi> But in the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, neither the accidents of the Bread and Wine, nor the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther jointly or ſeverally, have that ſimilitude and analogy to the thing ſignified which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but only the Bread and Wine in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; becauſe that which is principally ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and repreſented by the ſigns in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59620:22"/>
of the Euchariſt, is the nouriſhment of our ſouls in the hope of eternal life: for as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm is the Sacrament of our Regeneration and ſpiritual birth; ſo the Euchariſt is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſpiritual nouriſhment, as Card. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth in <hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>of the Euchariſt, chap.</hi> 9. and in <hi>Book</hi> 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaith <hi>that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt was ordained to preſerve ſpiritual life,</hi> which cannot be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and ſignified, but by ſigns which can nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh our bodies; for the analogy and ſimilitude conſiſts in this, that as the ſigns have vertue to nouriſh our bodies for the preſervation of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life; ſo the things ſignified have a vertue to nouriſh our ſouls in the hope of eternal life. But neither the accidents of the Bread and Wine, nor the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeverally, or jointly with the accidents, can nouriſh our bodies, (nouriſhment being eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the converſion of aliment into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a living body,) and it is certain that neither the accidents of Bread and Wine, nor the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, whether ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, or jointly with them, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into our ſubſtance, but only the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread and Wine, and other ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we take: Therefore neither the accidents of the Bread and Wine, nor the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, whether ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59620:23"/>
or jointly with them, are the true ſigns; but the Bread and Wine only, which being the ordinary nouriſhment of our bodies, do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us the ſpiritual nouriſhment of our ſouls by the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, received by Faith.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Secondly, The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>Seſſion</hi> 13. commands that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt ſhall be adored with <hi>Latrie,</hi> which according to our Adverſaries, is the ſovereign worſhip due to God only. But the accidents of the Bread and Wine ought not to be adored, becauſe they are creatures, and that God only muſt be adored: Therefore the accidents of the Bread and Wine are not the Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A Sacrament is a viſible ſign of an inviſible grace, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> defines it in <hi>Seſſions</hi> 6, and 13. But in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the Body and Bloud of Chriſt are not viſible: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Euchariſt the body and bloud of Chriſt, are not the ſigns.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I ſay, that in every Sacrament the ſign relates to the thing ſignified; and Relation is always between two different things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing relates to it ſelf, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing can be both the ſign and thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But the Body and Bloud of Chriſt are the things ſignified: Therefore the Body and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59620:23"/>
Bloud of Chriſt are not the ſigns. And it is to no purpoſe to ſay that Jeſus Chriſt in the Maſs is the ſign and figure of himſelf on the Croſs; for Jeſus Chriſt whereſoever he is, is one and the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever. And therefore Jeſus Chriſt not being different from himſelf, cannot be relative to himſelf, nor the ſign of himſelf.</p>

            <head type="sub">Againſt the real preſence of Chriſts Body in the Hoſt, or conſecrated Wafer.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors affirm, That imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Prieſt in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Maſs, hath pronounced theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> the body of Chriſt is really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Hoſt, and that it is whole and entire in every part and point of the Hoſt; which doctrine I deſtroy by theſe following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the firſt whreof is this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If a thing be created in a place, either it muſt be produced there, or it muſt come, or be brought thither from ſome other place; for it is impoſſible to find out a third way of putting any thing in a place. And the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors have hitherto been able to invent but one of theſe two ways of putting Chriſts Body in the Hoſt, the <hi>Jacobins</hi> telling us that it is brought thither from ſome other place, and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> that it is produced there. But the body of Chriſt can neither come, nor be brought thither into the Hoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can it be produced there: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the body of Chriſt is not in the Hoſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Firſt, The body of Chriſt cannot come,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59620:24"/>
or be brought into the Hoſt from any other place, becauſe it can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come from no place but Heaven, being no where but in Heaven. But Chriſts body neither comes, nor is brought from Heaven into the Hoſt; which I prove thus: When a body comes, or is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> carried from one place to another, it muſt leave its firſt place. For example, if a man would go from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt leave <hi>Paris:</hi> But the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt never leaves Heaven; for <hi>the heavens muſt contain him until the time of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things. Acts</hi> 3. Therefore Chriſts body neither comes, nor is brought from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Hoſt. Beſides, it is impoſſible that Chriſts body ſhould come or be brought into the hoſt without paſſing through the ſpace that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth where the conſecrated Hoſts are; becauſe a man cannot paſs from one extream to another without paſſing through the ſpace that is between them. But the ſpace between Heaven and Earth is too vaſt to be paſſed through in a moment (for theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors will have it, that immediately after the pronouncing of theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> the body of Chriſt is brought into the Hoſt.) Moreover it muſt in a moment be in all the Heavens, and in all the Airs between the higheſt Heaven, and this Earth where the Hoſts are, (becauſe a man cannot paſs through a place
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59620:25"/>
without being there) and then it would have three ſorts of exiſtences at once, <hi>viz.</hi> one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and glorious exiſtence in Heaven, one ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental exiſtence in the Hoſt, and one airy exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence in the Air. But ſeeing all theſe things are abſurd, we muſt conclude that Chriſts body neither comes, nor is brought into the Hoſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Secondly, Chriſts body cannot be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the conſecrated Hoſt, becauſe a thing that is produced already, cannot be produced again, without a preceding deſtruction; for as a dead man cannot be killed, nor that be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, which is annihilated already; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can that be produced which is produced already, nor that receive a being which hath one already. This common conception of all men is founded upon this principle, That every action, whether it produceth or deſtroyeth a thing, muſt neceſſarily have two diſtinct terms, the one called in the Schools, <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> that is, the term from which the thing comes; and the other <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> that is, the term to which it comes. But according to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that cannot be annihilated which is ſo already, nor that receive a being which hath one already; becauſe the term from which it ſhould come, and the term to which it ſhould come, would be one and the ſame thing; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Maxime already laid down, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:59620:25"/>
that the terms of action muſt neceſſarily be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and that one of them muſt be the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or privation of the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Here perhaps it may be objected, That by Tranſubſtantiation the ſubſtance of Chriſts body is not newly produced, but only a new preſence of him in the place where the ſubſtance of the bread was. But to this I anſwer, That in all ſubſtantial converſions and actions, a new ſubſtance muſt be produced, as in acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, a new accident muſt be produced. But Tranſubſtantiation (according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors) is a ſubſtantial converſion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Tranſubſtantiation a new ſubſtance muſt be produced. And ſeeing that the new preſence of Chriſts body in the place where the ſubſtance of the bread was, is not a ſubſtance, but an accident of the <hi>Catagorie</hi> which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers call <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> it is evident that by Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation the preſence of Chriſts body only is not produced in the place where the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread was; and ſeeing that the ſubſtance of Chriſts body is not produced there (as hath been proved in the preceding num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) we muſt conclude that there is no Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation nor real preſence of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Hoſt. This inſtance doth alſo deſtroy the adduction of Chriſts body into the Hoſt, which hath been already refuted in number 3.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59620:26"/>
6. My ſecond Argument is this. In a true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body ſuch as Chriſts body is, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above, and ſomething under, right and left, before and behind; for the head is above the neck, and the neck above the ſhoulders, the ſhoulders above the breaſt, the breaſt above the ſtomach, the ſtomach above the belly, the belly above the thighs, the thighs above the legs, &amp;c. But all the World knows that in a point there is nothing above or under, right or left, before or behind: Therefore Chriſts body is not in a point, and conſequently it is not in every point, or part of the Hoſt. To this I add, that the quantity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and greatneſs of Chriſts body is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but its length, breadth, and thickneſs, which cannot be in a point. Laſtly, The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Chriſts body is nothing elſe but its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as we all know; and a body is extended when it hath its parts one without another; that is, they are not one within another, as all the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> expound it. But the doctrine of the preſence of Chriſts body in the Hoſt, puts all its parts one within another, becauſe it puts them all in a point: Therefore ſuch a doctrine takes away its extent, and conſequently its quantity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. My third Argument is this. To move and not to move at the ſame time, to be eaten and not to be eaten at the ſame time, to be in a point and not in a point at the ſame time, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59620:26"/>
occupy a place and not to occupy it at the ſame time, are contradictory things. But if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt were in divers conſecrated Hoſts, it would move and not move at the ſame time. For example, When a Prieſt carries a conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hoſt to a ſick perſon, the body of Chriſt which is pretended to be in it, moves with the Hoſt; for it leaves the Altar, and goes with the Prieſt toward the ſick perſons houſe, and at the ſame time the body of Chriſt, which is pretended to be in the other Hoſts that remain on the Altar, moves not; and ſo the ſame body of Chriſt at the ſame time moves and moves not, which is a contradiction. Seeing then it is impoſſible that one and the ſame body at one and the ſame time ſhould move and not move, it is likewiſe impoſſible that Chriſts body ſhould be in divers Hoſts at the ſame time. In like manner, if Chriſts body were at the ſame time in Heaven, and in the Hoſt it would be eaten and not eaten at the ſame time; for it would be eaten in the Hoſt by the Prieſt, and at the ſame time, it would not be eaten in Heaven. Alſo it would be in a point and not in a point at the ſame time; for in the Hoſt it would be in a point, and in Heaven it would not be in a point at the ſame time: Therefore ſeeing it is impoſſible that one and the ſame body at one and the ſame time ſhould be eaten and not eaten, ſhould
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59620:27"/>
be in a point and not in a point; it is alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that Chriſts body ſhould be both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in the Hoſt at the ſame time.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The fourth Argument is this: Two rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are always different, as the Father and Son, the Husband and the Wife, &amp;c. and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is always between two things that really differ; as the equality between two Ells, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between two Crows, &amp;c. In a word, nothing can have relation to it ſelf, but whatſoever hath relation muſt neceſſarily have it to ſomething elſe, as appears by the definition of Relation: But to be diſtant is a relative and not an abſolute term; for when we conceive an abſolute term we conceive but one thing, as when we conceive a Crow; but when we conceive a relative term, we neceſſarily conceive two things. For example, We cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Crow to be like, without conceiving ſomething elſe to which it is like. Seeing then we cannot conceive a thing to be diſtant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conceiving ſomething elſe from which it is diſtant, it is evident that to be diſtant is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive term, and that diſtant things are relatives, and conſequently are really different. Whence I form this Argument: Relative things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally different, as hath been proved: But the body that is at <hi>Rome</hi> is diſtant from that which is at <hi>Paris,</hi> by reaſon of the ſpace of about 300
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59620:27"/>
leagues that is between thoſe two Cities; and the body that is in the higheſt heavens is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from that which is upon earth, by reaſon of the many thouſands of leagues that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween heaven and earth: Therefore the body that is at <hi>Rome</hi> is different from that which is at <hi>Paris;</hi> and that which is in heaven, is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that which is upon earth; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently one and the ſame body cannot be at the ſame time at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Paris,</hi> in Heaven and upon Earth; elſe one and the ſame body might be diſtant and different from it ſelf, which is a contradiction: Therefore ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt is not diſtant, and different from himſelf, it follows that he cannot be at the ſame time in Heaven and in the Hoſt, nor at the ſame time in the conſecrated Hoſts at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. But perhaps it may be ſaid that a body being at the ſame time in two diſtant places is not diſtant from it ſelf, but that the places only are diſtant; and therefore that Chriſts body in heaven is not diſtant from it ſelf in the Hoſt, but it is the places only, <hi>viz.</hi> heaven and earth (where the Hoſt is) that are diſtant. To this I anſwer that it is only the diſtance of places that makes the diſtance of things exiſting in thoſe diſtant places. For example: The reaſon why <hi>Peter</hi> that is at <hi>Rome</hi> is diſtant from <hi>Paul</hi> that is at <hi>Paris,</hi> is not becauſe they are two
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59620:28"/>
things really different, elſe they would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſtant, even when they are in one Bed together, (for they are always really different) but all the reaſon of their diſtance is, becauſe they are in two diſtant places. Seeing then (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Adverſaries) that Chriſts body is in two diſtant places at once, <hi>viz.</hi> in Heaven and in the Hoſt, at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Paris</hi> in divers Hoſts, it follows that Chriſts body is diſtant, and different from it ſelf. And ſeeing it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that it ſhould be diſtant and different from it ſelf, it is evident that it cannot be in two diſtant places at once; and conſequently not in Heaven and in the Hoſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Beſides, Suppoſe that <hi>Peter</hi> could be at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Paris</hi> at once, and that <hi>Peter</hi> that is at <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have a mind to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſhould go accordingly; and that the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> that is at <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould have a mind to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhould go accordingly, it is certain that <hi>Peter</hi> would draw near to himſelf, and meet himſelf. But things that draw near to each other, muſt of neceſſity have been at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance before; and therefore if a body draws near to it ſelf, it is certain that it was diſtant from it ſelf before. And hereupon I would fain ask our Adverſaries, whether, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould meet himſelf, he would let himſelf paſs, or not? and if he ſhould let himſelf paſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59620:28"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> going to <hi>Rome,</hi> would ſtep aſide and give way to himſelf going to <hi>Paris,</hi> or elſe the contrary? But if he ſhould not ſtep aſide and give place to himſelf, I would ask whether he would hinder himſelf from paſſing, or not? and if he ſhould not hinder himſelf from paſſing; whether he would paſs thorow himſelf, and ſo make another <hi>Janus</hi> with two faces, &amp;c? Whatſoever anſwers they ſhall make to theſe Queſtions muſt (I am ſure) be very abſurd and ridiculous.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The fifth Argument is this: It is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect contradiction, that a body ſhould be one and not one: But if Chriſts body ſhould be at the ſame time in heaven, and upon earth in the hoſt, it would be one and not one; for it would be one by our Adverſaries own confeſſion, and it would not be one; which I prove thus: That a thing may be one, it muſt neither be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in it ſelf, nor from it ſelf, as appears by the definition of Unity; and it is certain that nothing is divided or ſeparated from it ſelf: But if Chriſts body be at the ſame time in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and upon earth in the hoſt, it will be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſeparated from it ſelf, that which is in heaven being divided and ſeparated from that which is upon earth, becauſe it is not in the ſpace between both.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Here again it may be objected, That a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59620:29"/>
body in divers places is divided from it ſelf lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, becauſe the places in which it is, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; but not entitatively, becauſe it is ſtill one and the ſame entity of body. To which I anſwer, 1. That entitative diviſion (which is nothing elſe but a plurality of beings, or a plurality of things really different) is no true diviſion, for then the three divine Perſons which are really different, would alſo be really divided; and the body and ſoul of a living man which do really differ, would alſo be really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. 2. I ſay, That if a body be divided and ſeparated from bodies which it toucheth, it is alſo divided and ſeparated from bodies which it doth not touch; and if a body be divided and ſeparated from bodies to which it is near, it is alſo divided and ſeparated from bodies that are far diſtant from it; but eſpecially the diviſion is true, when between two there be bodies of divers natures, to which there is no union. Therefore, ſeeing that between Chriſts body, which is really in heaven, and the ſame body which is pretendedly upon earth in the conſecrated Hoſts, there be divers bodies of divers natures, to which it is not united; it is evident by our Adverſaries own doctrine, that Chriſts body is really divided and ſeparated from it ſelf. And ſeeing it is impoſſible it ſhould be ſeparated from it ſelf, it is alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59620:29"/>
that it ſhould be in heaven and in the hoſt at the ſame time. 3. I ſay, That lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diviſion takes away entitative diviſion, and things that are divided locally, are alſo divided entitatively; that is, they are alſo really diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; elſe no reaſon can be given why two glaſſes of water taken from the ſame fountain, are really different, ſeeing theſe waters are like in all things, except in reference to place, and there can no reaſon be given why the Ocean is not one ſingle drop of water only, reproduced in all places occupied by the Ocean, except it be that one drop of water cannot be reprodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in all thoſe places; but if it be poſſible, then Reaſon obligeth us to believe that it is really ſo, becauſe God and Nature do nothing in vain; and it is in vain to do that by many things, which may be done by one thing: and if it be really ſo, then it follows, That all the Sea-bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles that ever have been, were fought in one drop of water, and many thouſands of men have been drowned in one drop of water, and all people ſince <hi>Adam</hi> have drunk but one drop of water, which things are abſurd and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The ſixth Argument is this: Jeſus Chriſt as he is man, cannot be in divers places at once, if another man cannot be ſo too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Jeſus Chriſt, as he is man, <hi>was made like</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59620:30"/>
               <hi>unto us in all things, ſin only excepted,</hi> as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> obſerves. But another man cannot be in divers places at once; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be at the ſame time at <hi>Paris</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> which I prove thus. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be a man and no man at the ſame time: But if <hi>Peter</hi> could at the ſame time be at <hi>Paris</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> he might at the ſame time be a man and no man, which I prove thus: He that may at the ſame time be both dead and alive, may at the ſame time be a man and no man; becauſe he that is alive is a real man, and he that is dead is no real man, but a carcaſs: But if <hi>Peter</hi> could at the ſame time be at <hi>Paris</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> he might be both alive and dead at the ſame time; for he might be mortally wounded at <hi>Paris</hi> and die there, and, at the ſame time not be hurt at <hi>Rome,</hi> but alive and making merry there. Beſides, <hi>Peter</hi> might be diviſibly at <hi>Paris,</hi> and indiviſibly at <hi>Rome;</hi> (as Chriſts body, according to our Adverſaries, is diviſibly in heaven, and indiviſibly in the hoſt:) But if at <hi>Paris</hi> (where he ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly) his head ſhould be cut off, he would die, and ceaſe to be a man; and at <hi>Rome</hi> (where he ſhould be indiviſibly and in a point) his head ſhould not be cut off, and ſo he ſhould remain at the ſame time a living and real man, which is a contradiction. In a word, <hi>Peter</hi> might be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59620:30"/>
at <hi>Paris</hi> in the midſt of flames, and be burnt and reduced to aſhes, and conſequently ſhould die, and be no man; whereas at the ſame time he might be at <hi>Rome</hi> in the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> ſound and brisk, and conſequently be a true living man: whence it follows that he might be a man, and no man, which is a contradiction.</p>
            <p n="14">14. To this may be added other abſurdities that would follow from this Poſition, that one body may be in divers places at once, <hi>viz.</hi> That one Candle lighted might give light to all the World, if it were reproduced in all places of the World: That a great Army might be made of one man, reproduced in a hundred thouſand adjoining places: That all the debts in the World might be paid with one Crown, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as many times as there be Crowns due: That all the people in the World might quench their thirſt with one Pottle of Wine, reprodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as many times as there be inhabitants in the World: That all the men in the World might drink in one and the ſame Glaſs, reproduced as many times as there be men in the World: (whereupon a man might be ſo curious as to ask, whether if this Glaſs ſhould be broken at <hi>Paris,</hi> it would alſo be broken at <hi>Rome, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and other places:) That one man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produced in an hundred thouſand places, might at the ſame time marry an hundred thouſand
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59620:31"/>
wives, and lie with them; whereupon a man might deſire to know whether theſe women might not conceive, and every one of them be delivered of a child at the end of nine months; and conſequently it may be ſaid that one man did in one night beget a hundred thouſand chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The ſeventh Argument is this: If Chriſts body were in the hoſt, it would be ſeen there; for being there in its glory (as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay it is) it would be there more viſibly then it was when he converſed amongſt men here below; becauſe the glory of Chriſts body doth principally conſiſt in the brightneſs and ſplendor of an extraordinary light, like to that which it had upon Mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> but who dares affirm that ſuch a glorious body is not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible whereſoever it is; and yet it is certain that Chriſts body is not to be ſeen in the hoſt, which is an evident ſign that it is not there. But it may be ſaid that Chriſts body is under the accident of the Bread, and that theſe accidents hide it from us. To this I anſwer, that (according to our Adverſaries) Chriſts body is in the place where the ſubſtance of the Bread was: But the ſubſtance of the Bread was not under the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and the accidents of the Bread were not upon their ſubſtance, for then the ſubſtance of the Bread and its accidents had been in two
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59620:31"/>
different places, above and under being two ſeveral differences of place, and that which is under is not above, &amp;c. Therefore Chriſts body cannot be under the accidents of the Bread, and conſequently the accidents do not hide it from us. And ſeeing (as our Adverſaries ſay) Chriſts body is in every part and point of the hoſt, it muſt needs be in the ſuperficies, and conſequently cannot be hid or covered by the accidents of the Bread. Here again it may be ſaid that Chriſts body is glorious, luminous, and viſible of it ſelf, but God hinders us from ſeeing it. To this I anſwer, That if God hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it is only becauſe he is pleaſed ſo to do; and conſequently if he were pleaſed not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he would not do it, but would permit it to be ſeen in the ſame poſture as it is in the hoſt. Whereupon I would ask our Adverſaries in what poſture it would be ſeen there, whether ſitting, ſtanding, lying, or in any other poſture, or whether it would be in any poſture at all? If it be in no poſture, it muſt be without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form, becauſe poſture or ſituation abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely depends upon external form, But how can a man be ſeen without an external form of a man, and without being in any poſture of a man? and how can Chriſts body be without poſture, and without external form; ſeeing (as our Adverſaries ſay) it is whole and entire in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59620:32"/>
the whole hoſt, and occupies the whole ſpace of a great hoſt? But if it be ſitting, or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in any other poſture, and with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form of a man, and if (as they ſay) it be whole, and entire in a point of the hoſt, then it will follow that a man may be ſeen ſitting, or ſtanding in a point; and ſeeing a man that is ſtanding hath his head above and his feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it will follow that Jeſus Chriſt will be ſeen in a point of the hoſt with his head above and his feet below, though in a point there be nothing above or below. To this I add, That if it could be ſeen in the hoſt it would appear as big as the hoſt, becauſe it would occupy the whole ſpace of the hoſt; and it would appear round, becauſe it would be bounded by the ſpace that the hoſt occupies, which is round. Beſides, if the hoſt ſhould be divided into two equal parts, it would appear leſs by one half, and in the form of a half circle, becauſe it would be whole and entire in the half of the hoſt, and occupy the ſpace of it. It would alſo appear a hundred thouſand times leſs, and in a hundred thouſand ſeveral forms; for, as they ſay, it is whole and entire in a hundred thouſand parts of the hoſt, and occupies the ſpaces of them. In a word, There was never ſuch a monſtrous thing ſeen in the World, as Chriſts body would be, if it were really in the hoſt in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59620:32"/>
as our Adverſaries affirm it to be.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The eighth Argument is this: Either the Manhood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is pretended to be in the hoſt, can act there, or it cannot: if it cannot act, then it follows that it cannot ſee, hear, know, or love, or exerciſe any other fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſenſitive or rational ſoul: But if the Manhood of Chriſt in the hoſt knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor loves nothing, then it follows that it will not be happy, becauſe happineſs chiefly conſiſts in the knowledge and love of God. Alſo the Manhood of Chriſt in the hoſt will be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from his Manhood in heaven; for it will know in heaven, and at the ſame time know nothing in the hoſt; it will love in heaven, and love nothing in the hoſt; it will ſee in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſee nothing in the hoſt. But if Chriſts Manhood can act in the hoſt as it doth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then it will follow that it will open its eyes, and move its feet in a point; becauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Adverſaries, it is whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in every point of the hoſt. And being, as they tell us, God can as eaſily put the whole World into a point, as he doth the whole Manhood of Chriſt into a point of the hoſt, it will follow that all the parts of the World exiſting in a point, may do in it all thoſe actions which they now do in a vaſt ſpace, as the parts of Chriſts Manhood exiſting in a point of the hoſt can do
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59620:33"/>
in it all thoſe actions which they do in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and ſo in a leſs ſpace then is occupied by a grain of Corn the Sun may move from Eaſt to Weſt, the Sea may have its flouds and ebbs, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may have a Sea-fight with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In a word, A Sparrow may eaſily ſwallow all the World, ſeeing the World will not occupy ſo much ſpace as a grain of Corn doth; and yet the World which it ſhall ſwallow, will be as great as it is at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>preſent; even as Chriſts body in the hoſt, is as big and as tall as it was on the Croſs, as our Adverſaries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The ninth Argument is this: As a body cannot be in a place, except it be produced there, or that it comes, or be brought thither from ſome other place; ſo a body cannot ceaſe to be in a place without being deſtroyed, or going to ſome other place; and conſequently if Chriſts body ceaſeth to be in the hoſt after the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the accidents, it muſt neceſſarily either periſh, or go to ſome other place: But Chriſts body cannot periſh, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt dieth no more, Rom.</hi> 6. And Chriſts body goes to no other place; for if it ſhould go to any other place, it would go to heaven: But it cannot go to heaven, becauſe it is there already, and a man cannot go to a place where he is already: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts body doth not ceaſe to be in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59620:33"/>
hoſt. Whence it follows, that either Chriſts body ſtill remains in the hoſt, and that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſhould be conſumed, or elſe that it never was in the hoſt: But every one knows by experience that the hoſts are eaten and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and that Chriſts body cannot be there after the conſumption of the accidents of the bread: Therefore it never was in the hoſt.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The tenth Argument is drawn from hence, That the pretended preſence of Chriſts body in the hoſt, deſtroys the nature of Chriſts body, thus: The properties of a Species are incommunicable to every other Species. For example: The properties of a man are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to a beaſt; for, ſeeing the properties flow from the eſſence, or are the very eſſence it ſelf, it is evident that if the eſſence of a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be incommunicable to another Species, then the properties of a Species are alſo incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to another: But the body and the Spirit are the two Species of ſubſtance: Therefore the properties of the Spirit cannot be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the body, as the properties of the body cannot be communicated to the ſpirit. But there are two principal properties which diſtinguiſh bodies from ſpirits: The firſt is, That ſpirits are ſubſtances that are penetrable amongſt themſelves, that is, may be together in one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59620:34"/>
and the ſame place, but bodies are impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſtances amongſt themſelves, that is, they cannot be together in one and the ſame place. The ſecond is, That bodies are in a place circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptively, that is, all the body is in all the place, but all the body is not in every part of the place, but the parts of the body are in the parts of the place; but ſpirits are in a place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitively, that is, all the ſpirit is in all the place, and all the ſpirit is in every part of the place; becauſe a ſpirit having no parts, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be all whereſoever it is. Whence I form my Argument thus: That doctrine which gives to a body the properties of a ſpirit, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the body into a ſpirit, and conſequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the nature of a body, ſeeing properties cannot be communicated without the eſſence: But the doctrine of the pretended preſence of Chriſts body in the hoſt, gives to a body the properties of a ſpirit, becauſe it affirms that the quantity of Chriſts body penetrates the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Bread, and is in the ſame place with it; that all the parts of Chriſts body are penetrated amongſt themſelves, and are all in one and the ſame place; and that Chriſts body is all in all the hoſt, and all in every part of the hoſt: Therefore the doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> touching the pretended preſence of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the hoſt, deſtroys the nature of Chriſts body.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59620:34"/>
19. The eleventh Argument is drawn from hence: That Jeſus Chriſt being ſate at Gods right hand is in a glorious eſtate: and yet the doctrine of the pretended preſence of Chriſts body in the hoſt ſubjects him to divers ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>viz.</hi> that his body goes into peoples bellies, and amongſt their excrement; that it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be eaten by his enemies, yea by Mice and other Beaſts. Hear what <hi>Claude de Xaintes,</hi> a famous <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctor ſaith of it, <hi>Repet.</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Of all theſe we exclude not one from the true and corporal receiving of the Lords fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſh in the Sacrament, let him be Turk, Atheiſt, Infidel, or Hypocrite; yea, though he ſhould be the Devil himſelf incarnate.</hi> It is alſo ſubject to be ſtoln, for about 25 years ſince a Thief was executed at <hi>Paris</hi> for ſtealing out of a Church the Chalice and this God in it; and the Prieſt went to the Priſon in his ſacerdotal Ornaments, and falling on his knees before the Thiefs poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, pulled his God out of it. And as it is a God that cannot keep himſelf from being ſtoln, ſo neither can he keep himſelf from being burnt, as it appeared when the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace-Hal</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> was burnt. In ſhort, The hoſt, or God of the Maſs, hath been ſeen in the hands of one poſſeſſed by the Devil, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Devils power; yea, there are charms made by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts to compel

the Devil to reſtore God to them. A horrible and prodigious thing to put God into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils power, and into a capacity of being eaten by the Devil incarnate, eſpecially, ſeeing he is now glorious in heaven.</p>
            <p n="20">20 The twelfth Argument is drawn from hence: That God doth no miracles without neceſſity: But what neceſſity is there that he ſhould do ſo many miracles in this Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> that accidents ſhould be without a ſubject? that the Bread ſhould be converted into Chriſts body, which is already? that Chriſts body ſhould be in a point, and in a hundred thouſand places at once? What neceſſity is there that it ſhould be eaten by wicked men, by Beaſts, and by Devils incarnate? What neceſſity is there that it ſhould be carried away by the Devil, that it ſhould be ſtoln, burnt, &amp;c. Can it be ſaid that it is for the ſalvation of the ſoul of him that eats it? But Reprobates, as our Adverſaries confeſs, eat it too; and the Faithful under the Old Teſtament did not eat it, nor do the little children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the New, and yet they are ſaved for all that. Can it be ſaid with <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> that the hoſt being eaten, ſerves as an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed for a glorious Reſurrection? But the Faithful of the Old Teſtament, and the little children of Believers under the New, will riſe again gloriouſly, though they never participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that this ſeed of the reſurrection of our Bodies is not Chriſts fleſh, but his Spirit, in theſe words, <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you, he ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you.</hi>

            <p n="21">21.

            <head>CHAP. V.</head>
            <head type="sub">Againſt the adoration or worſhiping of the Hoſt.</head>
            <p n="1">1. AGainſt the adoration of the hoſt, I form three Propoſitions; The firſt is this, We are not obliged to adore or worſhip God every where, or in all places where he is, at leaſt not with external adoration, but we are only obliged to worſhip him in all places where he appears in his glorious Majeſty. The firſt part of this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are not obliged to worſhip God in all places where he is, appears by the practice of all Chriſtians. For God being every where, and conſequently in Stones, Trees, Beaſts, Devils, and all other Creatures, there is no man ſo extravagant as to fall on his knees before a Tree, an Aſs, or a Devil, that he may worſhip God in them, who is as really preſent in them, as he is in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are only obliged to worſhip God both with internal and external adoration in all places where he appears in his glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, is proved, firſt, by the commands which Jeſus Chriſt gave his Apoſtles when they asked
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59620:36"/>
him how they ſhould pray; for he anſwers them thus; <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. St. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. Why doth he ſay, <hi>which art in heaven,</hi> and not which art on Earth, or in the Sea, or in the Air, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is equally in all theſe places? but only becauſe God appears in heaven in his glorious Majeſty and there crowns all the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with his glory. Secondly, When God appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the burning buſh, which was not conſumed, he ſaid to him, <hi>Take thy ſhoes from off thy feet, for the place where thou ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt is holy ground, Exod.</hi> 3. Why is this ground called holy, and <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded to approach it with reverence, ſubmiſſion, and adoration, ſeeing any other ground is equally Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that he is equally preſent every where? but only becauſe God did manifeſt ſomewhat of his power and glory in that place, by cauſing the Buſh to burn without being conſumed. Thirdly, <hi>Joſhua and the Iſraelites did proſtrate themſelves before the Ark of the Covenant, Joſhua</hi> 7. 6. becauſe God appeared there in a peculiar and glorious manner, for, from the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat which covered it, he gave his oracles and made known his will, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 22. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When the Prieſt celebrates Maſs, a little before the conſecration, he recommends the <hi>ſursùm corda,</hi> that is, the lifting up of their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59620:37"/>
hearts; Why the lifting them up, ſeeing God is equally both above and below? but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God appears above in heaven in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious majeſty; and conſequently it is thither that we muſt direct our Vows, our Prayers, and our Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſecond Propoſition is this: We are not obliged to adore Jeſus Chriſt in the water of Baptiſm, though he be really there in regard of all that is adorable in him. The firſt part of this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are not obliged to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt in the Water of Baptiſm, is chiefly proved by the practice of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for no man ever fell on his knees before the Water of Baptiſm and adored Jeſus Chriſt in it, at leaſt not with external worſhip, which is only here intended; and doubtleſs the reaſon is, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt diſcovers no beam of his glory there; nor doth he appear in the Water of Baptiſm any more then in other waters; ſo that as we are not obliged to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, ſave only where he appears in his glorious Majeſty, as hath been proved, ſo neither are we obliged to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt, but only where he diſcovers ſome beam of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he doth not in the Water of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſecond part of this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is really preſent in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſm in reſpect of all that is to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59620:37"/>
in him, is proved thus: All that is of it ſelf adorable in Jeſus Chriſt, is either his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or his divine Perſon, or his divine Attributes. As for his Godhead, ſeeing it is really every where it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that it is alſo in the Water of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. As for his Perſon, ſeeing it is divine, and eternal, and infinite, it is really every where, and conſequently in the Water of Baptiſm: and as for his divine attributes, ſeeing they are not really different from the Godhead, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Jeſus Chriſt, it neceſſarily follows, that ſeeing the Godhead and Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, are really in the Water of Baptiſm, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes muſt really be there likewiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The third Propoſition is this: We are not obliged to adore Jeſus Chriſt in the hoſt, though he be really there in reſpect of all that is to be adored in him, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of his Godhead, his divine Perſon, and his divine Attributes; yea, though he were there inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in reſpect of his Manhood too. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reaſon of this hath been toucht upon already, <hi>viz.</hi> That as we are not obliged to worſhip God in all places where he is (at leaſt not with external worſhip) but there only where he appears in his glorious Majeſty, <hi>viz.</hi> ordinarily in heaven, and extraordinarily elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as hath been proved in the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59620:38"/>
And as we are not obliged to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt in the Water of Baptiſm with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal adoration, though he be really there in reſpect of all that is adorable in him, becauſe he doth not diſcover the leaſt beam of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there, nor appears in the Water of Baptiſm more then in other waters, as hath been proved in the ſecond Propoſition: Even ſo we are not obliged to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt in the hoſt with external adoration, although he be there in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all that is to be adored in him, yea, though he were there in reſpect of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ood; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any beam of his glory there, nor doth he appear in the conſecrated hoſts any more then in thoſe that are not conſecrated, for no man can diſtinguiſh the one from the other. And as for his Manhood which is pretended to be there inviſibly, I ſay that there is no ſenſible mark of its preſence, and conſequently nothing which obligeth us to external worſhip, for the ſame reaſon as is already alledged; for if the inviſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Godhead, divine Perſon, and divine Attributes of Jeſus Chriſt which are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves adorable, do not oblige us to external worſhip in the Water of Baptiſm, why ſhould the Manhood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is not of it ſelf adorable, oblige us to external adoration
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59620:38"/>
though it were in the Hoſt, it being there only, as they ſay, inviſibly? In a word, They muſt ſhew us the diſparity, and tell us the reaſon why we are not obliged to adore Jeſus Chriſt with external worſhip in the Water of Baptiſm, though he be really there preſent in reſpect of all that which is adorable in him, <hi>viz.</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Godhead, his divine Perſon, and his divine Attributes, and yet are obliged to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt in the Hoſt with an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal worſhip, though nothing renders him more adorable there then in the water of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To this the Jeſuite <hi>S. Rigant,</hi> one of the moſt learned of his Order, anſwers, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be nothing in the conſecrated Hoſt that renders him more adorable then in the Water of Baptiſm; yet there is ſomething in the Hoſt which obligeth us to external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is not in the Water of Baptiſm; becauſe, ſaith he, the Manhood of Jeſus Chriſt is in the Hoſt, and is there in ſtead of a ray of glory; and God will be adored in all places, where the Manhood perſonally united to the Godhead, is preſent: But in the Water of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm Jeſus Chriſt diſcovers no beam of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his Manhood which is equivalent to a ray of glory, is not there.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To this I reply, That the rays or beams of glory which oblige us to external adoration in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59620:39"/>
a certain place, muſt be ſenſibly in that place. And therefore ſeeing the Manhood of Jeſus Chriſt which is pretended and ſuppoſed to be really preſent in the hoſt, is neither viſible nor ſenſible, it cannot be equivalent to a beam of glory. To which I add, That as the Godhead and divine Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt which are equally preſent in the Water of Baptiſm, and in the Hoſt, do not oblige us to external worſhip, for this only reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they do not diſcover any ray of their glory there: ſo neither doth the Manhood of Jeſus Chriſt, pretended and ſuppoſed to be really preſent in the hoſt, oblige us to external adoration, for this only reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it appears not there, nor diſcovers any ray of its glory. Laſtly, I affirm that by the very doctrine and practice of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church it ſelf, we are not obliged to adore Jeſus Chriſt in all places where his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is, becauſe, as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors confeſs, we are not obliged to adore Jeſus Chriſt in that hoſt which the Prieſt hath newly eaten, and whoſe accidents are not yet deſtroyed; nor in that hoſt which is lockt up in the Cupboard that is on the Altar; nor in that hoſt which a Prieſt carries under his Cloak to a ſick perſon in the Country.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To this the ſame Jeſuite anſwers, That although the glory of Chriſts Manhood appears
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59620:39"/>
not to our bodily eyes, yet it appears to the eyes of our ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> to our faith; for the greateſt glory of Chriſts Manhood conſiſts in its being perſonally united to the Godhead, and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſtained in a peculiar manner by the Word. Suppoſe then, ſays he, that Jeſus Chriſt be in the hoſt, we are ſure that it is perſonally united to the Godhead; and conſequently, the glory of Chriſts Manhood, which conſiſts in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal union, doth certainly appear to our Faith, which is ſufficient to oblige us to an external adoration of Jeſus Chriſt in the Hoſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To this I reply, That there is a twofold glory of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, or of his Manhood, <hi>viz.</hi> the one eſſential, internal, and hid from our ſenſes; the other accidental, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and apparent to our ſenſes: the eſſential and internal glory of God which is hid from our ſenſes, conſiſts in the eminence of his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are to be infinite, almighty, moſt wiſe, &amp;c. and the accidental and external glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, which appears to our ſenſes, conſiſts in ſome miraculous and extraordinary effect, which is ſenſible; as when God cauſed a Buſh to burn without being conſumed, when he pronounced his Oracles from above the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat; and when, being made man, and having manifeſted himſelf in the fleſh, he commanded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59620:40"/>
the Winds and the Waves, caſt out Devils, raiſed the dead, &amp;c. But I affirm that we are not obliged to worſhip God with an external adoration in all places where he is, in his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and internal glory only, although it appears to our Faith, becauſe God being every where with this eſſential, and internal glory, we ſhould be obliged to worſhip him with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal adoration in Trees, in Beaſts, yea and in Devils too, which is abſurd: But we are only obliged to worſhip God with external worſhip in all places where he makes his eſſential and internal glory appear by ſome accidental and external glory, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſome miraculous or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effect, which is ſenſible, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a ray of his eſſential and internal glory, as appears by what is ſaid in the firſt Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In like manner the perſonal union of the Godhead and Manhood, being an eſſential glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and an internal glory of his Manhood, wholly hid from our ſenſes, doth not oblige us to the external adoration of Jeſus Chriſt, although it certainly appears to our Faith, except it be accompanied with an external and ſenſible glory; for if the eſſential and internal glory of the Godhead and divine Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, which appear equally preſent to our Faith in the Water of Baptiſm, do not oblige us to an external adoration of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59620:40"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, except it be accompanied with an accidental, external and ſenſible glory; why ſhould the internal glory of Chriſts Manhood, which is infinitely beneath the eſſential and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory of the Godhead, and appears pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Faith of thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, oblige them to the external adoration of Jeſus Chriſt, if it be ſeparated from all external and ſenſible glory? To this I add, That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the doctrine and practice of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, we are not obliged to adore Jeſus Chriſt with external adoration in all places where the perſonal union of the Manhood with the Word, appears to the Faith of thoſe of that Church; for we are not obliged to adore Jeſus Chriſt in that hoſt which a Prieſt hath newly ſwallowed; nor in that hoſt which is lockt up, nor in that hoſt which a Prieſt carries under his Cloak to a ſick perſon in the Country; although the eſſential glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory of his Manhood (which this Jeſuits makes to conſiſt in the perſonal union of the Manhood with the Word) appear certain to the Faith of thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="10">10. To this the Jeſuite anſwers, That as if we would obtain any grace from God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as he really exiſts in a ſtone, we ſhould be obliged to proſtration and external worſhip of the Godhead really preſent in that ſtone:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59620:41"/>
ſo, if we would obtain any grace from Jeſus Chriſt really exiſting in the hoſt, we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to approach unto it with reverence, and external adoration; and conſequently we are obliged to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt in the hoſt with external adoration whenſoever we would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any grace from him, as he exiſts in the hoſt.</p>
            <p n="11">11. To this I reply, That as we are never obliged to beg grace of God, as he exiſts in a ſtone, except he diſcovers ſome beam of his glory there, (for it is ſufficient to beg grace of God, conſidered as he exiſts in heaven, where he appears in his glorious Majeſty, according to the command of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>when ye pray, ſay, Our Father which art in heaven,</hi> and according to the command of the Apoſtles, <hi>lift up your hearts)</hi> ſo we are never obliged to beg grace of God or Jeſus Chriſt, conſidered as exiſting in the hoſt, becauſe he diſcovers no ray of his glory there; but it is ſufficient to beg grace of God or Jeſus Chriſt, conſidered as exiſting in heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he always appears there in his glorious Majeſty. Therefore as we are never obliged to beg grace of God, conſidered as exiſting in a ſtone, ſo we are never obliged to adore him there: and as we are never obliged to beg grace of God or Jeſus Chriſt, conſidered as exiſting in the hoſt, ſo we are never obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59620:41"/>
to adore him there with external ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="12">12. To this the Jeſuit anſwers, That God hath done many miracles by this Sacrament, and in it, both by puniſhing prophane perſons, and the deſpiſers of it; and alſo by making a little child appear upon the Altar, or fleſh in ſtead of the bread, or bloud in ſtead of the wine; all which ought to be acknowledged as ſo many rays of the glory of Chriſts Manhood, and that they ever oblige us to the external adoration of Jeſus Chriſt in the hoſt.</p>
            <p n="13">13. To this I reply, That I do not at all doubt but that God hath many times puniſhed prophane perſons, and the contemners of this Sacrament, both ordinarily and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. tells us that many of thoſe that did receive this Sacrament unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, were ſick, and many ſlept, that is, were dead: and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the Treatiſe of thoſe that fall, obſerves Gods judgment againſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and prophane perſons, and the contemners of this Sacrament. But as for thoſe apparitions of Jeſus Chriſt in form of a child, and of fleſh and bloud, &amp;c. I look on them as fabulous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries invented by Monks and other ſuperſtitious perſons, above ſeven or eight hundred years after Chriſt, when the doctrine of the real preſence of Chriſts Manhood in the hoſt, began
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59620:42"/>
to prevail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was powerfully oppoſed by Gods people in thoſe days.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <hi>14. Secondly, I ſay, That although there had been ſuch apparitions yet we muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thence, either the preſence of Chriſts Manhood, or external adoration; becauſe that is not Chriſts fleſh which ſeems to be ſo; and theſe apparitions may be illuſions of the Devil. The Jeſuite</hi> Vaſquez <hi>in</hi> Diſput. <hi>193.</hi> chap. <hi>2. ſpeaks thus.</hi> I anſwer, That which appears is not the fleſh of Chriſt, nor of any other that is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fleſh; but it is only an effigies, or appearance of fleſh, as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith: and whereas the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are deceived, and do believe that Chriſts fleſh is there in a diviſible and bloudy manner, it is no great matter, and this deceit muſt be corrected by the right inſtruction of the Doctors. Gabriel Biell, <hi>a famous Doctor of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church,</hi> Leſſon <hi>51. upon the</hi> Canon of the Maſs, <hi>ſaith,</hi> That ſuch apparitions of fleſh and bloud may be made by the illuſions of the Devil, to deceive the ſimple, God permitting it to be ſo; <hi>and he gives an example of it,</hi> viz. That in a Convent of Minor Friers at <hi>Yſennes</hi> in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> a certain perſon like unto an Angel, appeared to a Lay-Frier that was preparing himſelf for the Communion, and thruſt into his mouth a piece of fleſh, which as ſoon as he had ſwallowed, he was poſſeſſed, and grievouſly tormented by the Devil. <hi>The Jeſuit</hi> Suarez,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59620:42"/>
Tom. <hi>3.</hi> Diſp. <hi>55.</hi> Sect. <hi>3. ſpeaks thus.</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells us that by length of time this fleſh and this bloud which appear in the Euchariſt, are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and corrupted. <hi>But when this happens, ſaith that famous</hi> Romiſh <hi>Doctor</hi> Alexander Hales, Sent. <hi>4.</hi> Queſt. <hi>11.</hi> It is a ſign that the apparition which was made in that form, was not made by the power of God, but by the power of the Devil, or by the craft of man.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Thirdly, If it were as true as it is falſe, that Jeſus Chriſt hath appeared ſometimes in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt in the form of a little child, or of fleſh and of bloud; yet I ſay, that as God, when he appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh that burned without being conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was to be worſhiped there, for this only reaſon, becauſe he diſcovered a beam of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by cauſing the Buſh to burn without being conſumed; but it doth not follow that God muſt be worſhiped in all other Buſhes, though he be as really in them as he was in that, for this only reaſon, becauſe he doth not diſcover in them any ray of his glory: ſo, if Jeſus Chriſt hath ſometimes appeared viſibly in the hoſt (which I do not grant) I think then he ſhould have been worſhiped, becauſe of ſuch a viſible appearance, which is equivalent to a ray of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but it follows not that Jeſus Chriſt muſt be adored in other hoſts, where his Manhood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59620:43"/>
not, though it be really there, for this only reaſon, becauſe no ray of his glory appears there.</p>
            <p n="16">16. To the three foregoing Propoſitions I add this Argument, which is very conſiderable: In lawful adoration it is requiſite that he that adores, be well aſſured that what he adores is the true God, elſe he may juſty be reproached, as Jeſus Chriſt reproached the woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, Ye worſhip ye know not what.</hi> But the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> can never be aſſured (according to their own maxims) that the hoſt which they worſhip is the true God, and they have always cauſe to ſuſpect that they worſhip a morſel of Bread in ſtead of the Redeemer of the World; becauſe according to their own doctrine, the real preſence of Chriſts body in the hoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on lawful conſecration; and lawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration depends on the quality of the Prieſt, and on the pronouncing of the words of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and on his intention in pronouncing them; for there is no conſecration (as they ſay) when either he that celebrates Maſs is no Prieſt, or doth not pronounce the words that are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially requiſite to conſecration, <hi>viz. this is my body,</hi> &amp;c. or doth not pronounce them with intention to conſecrate; and conſequently in theſe caſes the hoſt remains meer bread. But it is impoſſible certainly to know theſe three

things: For as for the quality of the Prieſt, he muſt have been baptized; and he that baptized him muſt have obſerved the eſſential form of Baptiſm, and have had intention to baptize him: Again, he muſt have received Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a true Biſhop; and the Biſhop muſt have obſerved the eſſential form of Ordination, and have had intention to make him a Prieſt; and to make this Biſhop a true Biſhop, he muſt have been baptized in due form, and with the requiſite intention, and muſt have received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination in due form, and with the requiſite intention from other Biſhops; and they again, for the making them true Biſhops, muſt alſo have received Baptiſm and Ordination in due form, and with the requiſite intention, from other true Biſhops, and theſe from others, and ſo back to the Apoſtles. But who can be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that from the Apoſtles to a Biſhop, or Prieſt, now adays, there hath been no failing, either in the eſſential form of Baptiſm or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or in the requiſite intention? As for the pronouncing of the words requiſite to conſecration, none but the Prieſt can know whether he hath pronounced them or not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the celebration of the Maſs, thoſe words are pronounced ſo ſoftly, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon preſent can hear them. And as for the intention, it is evident that no man but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59620:44"/>
can know it. Beſides, It is known that ſome Prieſts are Magicians, as <hi>Lewis Goffredi,</hi> and other wicked Prieſts, who do neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate in due form, nor with the requiſite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, eſpecially ſuch as believe nothing of what they profeſs; yea, divers Monks and Prieſts that have been converted to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have aſſured us that for a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their converſion they did abhor the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that was practiſed in the adoration of the hoſt. Judge then if ſuch perſons as theſe had any intention to conſecrate in the celebration of the Maſs.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors have ſought all the remedies imaginable to prevent this danger. Pope <hi>Adrian Queſt.</hi> 3. ſpeaks thus: <hi>In the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Euchariſt, there is always a tacite condition,</hi> viz. <hi>if the conſecration be duly made; (as bath been decided at the Council of Conſtance) otherwiſe they could not be excuſed from idolatry, that worſhip the hoſt when the Prieſt pretends to celebrate, but celebrates not; or pretends to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, and is no Prieſt, as it many times happens.</hi> Obſerve theſe words, <hi>it many times happens,</hi> for they ſhew that there is great cauſe of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that much caution muſt be uſed. For, as if a woman, in her husbands abſence, ſhould ſay to a man that comes to her, and tells her he is her husband, (and ſhe hath probable grounds
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59620:44"/>
to ſuſpect him) <hi>If thou art my husband I will receive thee,</hi> and thereupon endeavours to clear it before ſhe admits him to any privacy; this condition frees her promiſe from blame; but if ſhe gives her ſelf up to him, before ſhe clears this doubt, ſaying, <hi>I will receive thee if thou art my husband,</hi> this condition doth not free her action from blame, but ſhe will be reputed an adultereſs. Even ſo if a man to whom an hoſt is propoſed to be adored, and he hath reaſon to doubt whether it ought to be adored, ſhould only ſay, <hi>If thou art Chriſt I will adore thee,</hi> and ſhould not adore it before he be well aſſured of it, this condition would render him blameleſs; but if, notwithſtanding his doubt, he adores it, this condition, <hi>if thou art Chriſt, I adore thee,</hi> doth not exempt him from the crime of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for to what purpoſe is the condition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be tacite, or expreſt, <hi>I adore thee if thou art Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he actually adores it, without knowing whether it be ſo or not.</p>
            <p n="18">18. To what hath been ſaid, I add, That the Primitive Church never adored the hoſt, nor believed that the body and bloud of Chriſt were really and inviſibly in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt; for if the Chriſtians of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church had believed it, they had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Heathens with ſpecious pretences to excuſe the idolatry of their Image-worſhip, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59620:45"/>
to retort upon the Chriſtians thoſe very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they had made uſe of againſt them.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Firſt, The Heathens did maintain that their Idols were compoſed of two things, <hi>viz.</hi> of a viſible Image and an inviſible Deity dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in it. <hi>They bring their gods,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> in <hi>Theodoret</hi> in <hi>Atrep, into their baſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of wood and ſtone, and ſhut them up there as in a priſon. Your gods,</hi> ſaith <hi>Arnobius,</hi> Book 6. <hi>dwell in Plaiſter and Baked Earth; and, that they may make theſe materials more venerable, they ſuffer themſelves to be ſhut up, and to remain hid and detained in an obſcure Priſon.</hi> But might not the Heathens have juſtly replied to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians, if they had believed what the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors do now adays. And do not you believe the very ſame of your hoſt, that it is compoſed of two things, <hi>viz.</hi> of the viſible ſpecies of bread, and the inviſible body of Chriſt, which is hid under the ſpecies? Doth not your Chriſt dwell in baked dough, and that he may make a piece of bread more venerable, doth he not ſuffer himſelf to be ſhut up, and doth he not remain hid, as in a Priſon?</p>
            <p n="20">20. Secondly, The Heathens held that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration was the means whereby the Deity, which they adored, was made preſent in the Image. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apolog. chap.</hi> 12.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59620:45"/>
ſaith, <hi>I find nothing to object againſt Images, but that the matter of them is ſuch as our Frying-pans and Kettles are made of, which changeth its deſtiny by conſecration.</hi> And <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> ſpeaks thus of a Pagan Image, <hi>Behold it is melted, forged, faſhioned, and yet it is not God; behold it is gilded, finiſhed, erected, and yet it is not God; behold it is adorned, conſecrated, and worſhiped, and then it is God.</hi> And <hi>Arnobius</hi> in Book 6. <hi>Dedication or Conſecration makes them dwell in Images, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not to dwell in habitations of Earth, or rather, being forced to go into them by the right of Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are incorporated, and joined to the Images.</hi> But might not the Heathens have replied to the Chriſtians thus. We find it juſt ſo in your Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſigns are of the ſame matter with our common Bread and Wine, but change their deſtiny by conſecration; behold it is knea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and moulded, and yet it is not God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is baked in the Oven, and yet it is not God; behold it is conſecrated and adored, and then it is God; for your Chriſt doth not refuſe to enter into theſe earthy matters, or rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to go into them by the right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, he is incorporated and joined to the ſpecies of the Bread and Wine.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Thirdly, The Heathens had both great and little Images, and did believe that the Deity which they worſhiped, was as well in the little
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59620:46"/>
as in the great ones. <hi>Arnobius</hi> in Book 6. jears them for this, ſaying, that, <hi>If their Gods had their great and little Images in which they dwelt, they muſt needs be ſtraightned for want of room in the little ones, whereas in the great ones they might ſtretch themſelves out at their full length.</hi> But might not the Heathens have reproached the Chriſtians of thoſe times in the ſame manner if they had believed that Jeſus Chriſt had been wholly contained as well in a little hoſt as in a great one, and as well in the leaſt part of the hoſt as in the greateſt?</p>
            <p n="22">22. Laſtly, The Heathens were reproached for worſhiping Wood and Stone, the work of mens hands; things that cannot ſee, hear, ſmell, taſte, breath, ſpeak, or move; things expoſed to age, ruſt, corruption, duſt, falling, breaking, burning, &amp;c. to the injuries of Worms, Mice, and other Beaſts; ſubject to the power of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be ſtoln, lockt up, &amp;c. as you may read in <hi>Arnobius, Lactantius, Minutius Felix,</hi> and other ancient Doctors of the Church. But if thoſe ancient Chriſtians had believed what the Romaniſts now do, might not the Heathens have replied thus; And can you deny that the hoſt which you worſhip is the work of a mans hands, that moulded it, and gave it ſuch a form as pleaſed him, and then conſecrated it with certain words to make your Chriſt come into
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59620:46"/>
it whole and entire? Do not you adore your hoſt, which neither ſees, nor hears, nor ſmells, nor breaths, nor walks, nor ſpeaks, nor moves? Is not your hoſt ſubject to age, duſt, felling, burning, to Worms, to Mice, and other Beaſts? Is it not ſubject to be taken away, ſtolen, lockt up, &amp;c. But if it be ſaid that the accidents of the hoſt are only ſubject to theſe inconveniences, and not Jeſus Chriſt that is under them, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the Heathens had ſaid the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> that their Gods were not ſubject to theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, but the Images only in which they were; for in <hi>Arnobius</hi> his 6. Book, they ſpeak thus: <hi>We believe not the Copper, Gold, and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whereof the Images are made, to be Gods and Deities, that of themſelves deſerve adoration; but in theſe materials we adore thoſe that ſacred dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation introduceth, and cauſeth to dwell in the Images.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. THe taking away of the Euchariſtical Cup was eſtabliſhed as an Article of Faith by the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church Repreſentative, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Council at</hi> Conſtance, Anno <hi>1415.</hi> Seſſion <hi>13. in a Canon, the chief clauſes whereof are theſe:</hi> Seeing that in divers parts of the World there be ſome who raſhly preſume to ſay, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people ought to partake of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt under both ſpecies of the Bread and Wine; and do give the Communion to Lay-people, not only under the ſpecies of the Bread, but alſo under the ſpecies of the Wine; this preſent holy general Council of Conſtance, lawfully aſſembled in the name of the Holy Ghoſt, being deſirous to provide for the ſafety of the faithful againſt this errour, doth therefore declare, decree, and determine, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Jeſus Chriſt did adminiſter this venerable Sacrament to his Diſciples under both the ſpecies of Bread and Wine; and although in the Primitive Church the Faithful did receive this Sacrament under both ſpecies, yet notwithſtanding that (for the avoiding of certain dangers and ſcandals) this cuſtom, which was introduced with reaſon, ought
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59620:47"/>
to be kept, <hi>viz.</hi> that Prieſts that ſay Maſs ſhall communicate under both the ſpecies of the Bread and Wine, but that Lay-perſons ſhall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate under the ſpecies of Bread only: and they that ſhall ſay the contrary, ought to be expelled as Hereticks, and grievouſly puniſhed by the Biſhops, or their Officials. <hi>This Canon was confirmed by the ſucceeding</hi> Romiſh <hi>Councils, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the Council of</hi> Trent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt ſo horrible a Canon and ſo ſtrange a Law, it is very difficult to oppoſe any thing; for, if you tell them that this Law is contrary to the Inſtitution and command of Jeſus Chriſt, they freely confeſs it; ſeeing that although Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did inſtitute and adminiſter the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt under both ſpecies, yet they will not have it ſo practiſed. If you tell them that this Law is contrary to the command of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and practice of the Primitive Church, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly own it; for they openly declare, that although the Faithful in the Primitive Church did receive the Sacrament of the Euchariſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both ſpecies, yet they that practiſe it thus ought to be expelled and puniſhed as Hereticks. This is the true way of ending all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and of keeping us from diſputing with them. For example, If we alledge that St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. ſaith, that <hi>they who forbid to marry, and command to abſtain from meats, do teach the</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59620:48"/>
               <hi>doctrines of Devils;</hi> they need only anſwer, That although St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſay ſo, yet we muſt not believe it, becauſe the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church hath determined otherwiſe. Again, If we alledge, That the ſame Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. ſaith, that <hi>we are ſaved by grace, through faith; and that not of our ſelues, it is the gift of God; not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt;</hi> they need only anſwer, That although this was written by the Apoſtle, yet we muſt not believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church hath determined, that we are ſaved by works and faith as coming from our ſelves, and from the ſtrength of our own free will, &amp;c. And now I leave you to judge whom we ought to follow, whether theſe lying Doctors, or Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles. But that which I find utterly inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that they accuſe of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, errour, and hereſie, thoſe that by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and following the practice of the Primitive Church, do affirm that we ought to partake of the Cup as well as of the Bread. Again, I find it an inſufferable piece of impudence, that they boaſt ſo much of antiquity, and of the conformity of their Creed to that of the Primitive Church, and yet can ſo openly renounce both in this chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal point of doctrine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors now adays think
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59620:48"/>
to ſhelter themſelves, by telling us it is true that Jeſus Chriſt did inſtitute the Sacrament of the Euchariſt under both the ſpecies of the Bread and Wine; and that the Primitive Church did ſo celebrate it, not by any expreſs command of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but meerly by Eccleſiaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ical policy, which may be changed, as ſeveral occaſions and circumſtances require. And they add, That it is ſufficient to obſerve that which is of the eſſence of the Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> to receive the body and bloud of Chriſt; but that the Church may change that which is accidental, <hi>viz.</hi> to receive them under both the ſpecies, or under one ſpecies only; for they will have it, that the bloud of Chriſt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecies of the Bread, by concommitance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that his body is under the ſpecies of the Wine by concommitance; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt being now glorious, his body and bloud cannot be ſeparated.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To this I reply, Firſt, That there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command of Jeſus Chriſt to take the Cup and drink, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. in theſe words, <hi>drink ye all of it.</hi> To this the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the word <hi>all</hi> is not extended to all men; for then we ſhould ſay that the Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Cup ought to be given to <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> and all other <hi>Infidels.</hi> And they add, that the word <hi>all</hi> doth not extend to all thoſe that are of the body
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59620:49"/>
of the Church of the Elect, for then the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical cup ſhould be given to little children, whom God hath elected to eternal life: But ſay they, the word <hi>all</hi> is extended only to all thoſe, to whom Jeſus Chriſt gave the cup, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Apoſtles, conſidered as they were Paſtors.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To this I reply, That although Jeſus Chriſt gave this command to drink of the Euchariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cup to his Apoſtles only, yet we muſt know in what quality they received this command. But it was not in the quality of Apoſtles, for then none but Apoſtles could partake of the cup; and there being now no more Apoſtles, it ſhould be quite taken away, and ſo Maſs could be no more celebrated. And it was not in quality of Paſtors, or ſacrificing Prieſts; for Jeſus Chriſt was then the only Sacrificer, as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors ſay, and the Apoſtles did not then exerciſe the function of ſacrificing Prieſts. Beſides it belongs to Paſtors, and thoſe that adminiſter the Sacraments, being publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to give, but to private perſons to receive only: But the Apoſtles in the celebration of the Euchariſt, did only receive of Jeſus Chriſt their Maſter and Paſtor: Therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the command to drink of the cup, as they were Believers. Whence it follows that all the faithful that partake of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, are obliged by the command of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59620:49"/>
Jeſus Chriſt to drink of the cup. So then the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors are miſtaken when they tell us that none but Prieſts that ſacrifice, have a right to drink of the cup, and that thoſe Prieſts that do not ſacrifice, muſt communicate under the ſpecies of the bread only, for at that time the Apoſtles did not ſacrifice. To this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if the command of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>drink ye all of it,</hi> was ſpoken to Paſtors only, becauſe they to whom Chriſt ſpake were Paſtors; then it follows that the command of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Take, eat,</hi> was ſpoken to Paſtors, becauſe they to whom Jeſus Chriſt ſpake were Paſtors; and ſo the people will not be obliged by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to communicate under the ſpecies of the bread, and conſequently will be wholy depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Sacrament, which is very abſurd and contrary to Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly, I ſay, That in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. there is an expreſs command to all the Faithful to drink of the cup, in theſe words, <hi>Let a man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup.</hi> In which words the Apoſtle ſpeaks to all Believers, who, no doubt, have cauſe to examine themſelves. And this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs his Epiſtle (and conſequently theſe words) to all thoſe of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as well Lay-men as Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical; for in <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. he directs it to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59620:50"/>
               <hi>all that in every place call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> To this I add, That Jeſus Chriſt doth not only ſay, <hi>as often as ye eat this bread,</hi> but alſo, <hi>as often as ye drink this cup ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come;</hi> ſo that we do as much commemorate Chriſts death by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the cup in the Euchariſt, as we do by partaking of the bread. And this is very proper, for ſeeing that not only the body of Chriſt was broken, but alſo his bloud ſhed on the Croſs; and that in every propitiation and expiation for ſin, the effuſion of bloud was very conſiderable (becauſe it repreſents death better then any thing elſe doth) it is certain that they do not celebrate the memory of Chriſts death as they ought, that do not partake of this part of the Sacrament, whereby only we commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the effuſion of Chriſts bloud.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thirdly, I ſay, that in the diſpute about the Euchariſt, our Adverſaries do alledge to us the words of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>chap.</hi> 6. of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, <hi>Except ye drink the bloud of the ſon of man, ye have no life in you.</hi> Why then do they deprive the people of life, by taking the cup from them and hindering them from drinking? And it is not at all to the purpoſe here to alledge concommitance, and to tell us that by taking Chriſts body under the ſpecies of the bread, we take his bloud alſo, becauſe 'tis inſeparable
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59620:50"/>
from his body. For, to this I anſwer, Firſt, That to take Chriſts bloud in taking the hoſt, is not to drink it: But Jeſus Chriſt ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, Except a man drink his bloud he hath no life in him. Secondly, I ſay, That although in ſome places by the body, ſhould be meant the body and bloud too, yet it could not be in thoſe places where a manifeſt diſtinction is made between the body and the bloud: But in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt this diſtinction is very apparent; for Jeſus Chriſt gave firſt the Sacrament and ſign of his body, in theſe words, <hi>Take; eat, this is my body, which is broken for you;</hi> and then ſeparately the Sacrament of his bloud, in theſe words, <hi>Drink ye all of it, for this is my bloud, which is ſhed for you.</hi> And he not only ſpeaks of them ſeparately, but repreſents them as really ſeparated in his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he ſaith, <hi>my body broken for you, and my bloud ſhed for you.</hi> In which words there is no place for concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for the body broken by divers wounds doth not contain the bloud, and the bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhed, is not contained in the body. Alſo our Adverſaries affirm, that the ſacramental words do operate that which they ſignifie; But by their own confeſſion, they ſignifie the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts body from his bloud, as Card. <hi>Perron</hi> acknowledgeth in his reply to the King of <hi>Great Britain, pag.</hi> 1108. in theſe words, <hi>The</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:59620:51"/>
               <hi>ſcope of the entireneſs of this Sacrament, is to put us in mind that this body and this bloud which we receive, were divided by his death on the Croſs;</hi> whence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>as often as we eat this bread, and drink this cup, we ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> Thirdly, I ſay, That as he that eats bread dipt in wine, hath indeed wine in his mouth, but doth not drink it; ſo he that ſhould eat or ſwallow a conſecrated hoſt, would not drink Chriſts bloud, though it were in it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſtly, I ſay, That ſeeing the Sacraments were inſtituted to aſſure us the more of the truth of Gods promiſes, and that all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort depends on this perſwaſion, that all Gods promiſes are moſt true; it neceſſarily follows, that as much of the Sacrament as is taken away, ſo much of the certainty of this perſwaſion is diminiſhed. And 'tis to no purpoſe to ſay that one part of the Sacrament doth as much confirm Gods promiſes as the whole Sacrament doth; for if it be ſo, then God hath unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily inſtituted two Sacraments; for it had been enough to have inſtituted Baptiſm only, ſeeing it is ordained to confirm Gods promiſes. But, if for ſuch a confirmation two Sacraments are better then one, and if two pledges, and two ſeals for that purpoſe, are of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence then, one alone; then in one Sacrament alſo, two ſigns are of more weight then one
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59620:51"/>
alone, for the confirmation of Gods promiſes. and ſeeing it is ſaid St. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. that the cup is the New Teſtament, and the New Covenant in the bloud of Chriſt, becauſe it is the Sacrament of it, why then are people deprived of it?</p>
            <p n="9">9. As for the imaginary dangers and ſcandals which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors find in peoples par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the cup, I ſay in general, that Jeſus Chriſt (in whom the treaſures of wiſdom are hid, and in whom the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells bodily) foreſaw them as well as they; and yet he inſtituted and adminiſtred the cup, and commanded all to drink of it. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> who was extraordinarily inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, doth (notwithſtanding theſe pretended dangers and ſcandals) command the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as well Lay perſons as Eccleſiaſtical, to drink of the cup, as hath been already proved.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The firſt inconvenience which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries find in peoples partaking of the cup, is that they fear they may dip their mouſtaches in the Chalice, and ſo the bloud of Chriſt may remain on ſome hair of the mouſtache; alſo they fear that the ſpecies of the wine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Chriſts bloud, may fall to the ground, and being fallen it cannot be gathered up again.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer: Firſt, That Women,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59620:52"/>
Eunuchs, and ſuch young men as have no beards, ought not to be excluded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is better to be without Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaches then without the participation of the whole Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This inconvenience proceeds only from a falſe ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſts bloud is under the ſpecies of the wine; but if in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt there be nothing but Bread and Wine in ſubſtance, and any of it ſhould fall to the ground accidentally, and not through any fault of ours, this inconvenience is not great enough to violate the inſtitution and command of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The ſecond inconvenience is, That it is almoſt impoſſible to obſerve this Law where there is a great number of people and but one Prieſt.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, That in places where there is much people, as in Cities, there are divers Prieſts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If one Prieſt be not enough, another muſt be called from ſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That which cannot be done in one day, muſt be done in two or three days, rather then the command of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and the practice of the Primitive Church abandoned.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59620:52"/>
12. The third inconvenience is, that ſome have a natural antipathy, or averſion to Wine, and conſequently cannot drink of the cup.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That becauſe corporal actions do depend on certain natural powers, they are ſuppoſed to be commanded to thoſe that have natural powers proper to exerciſe thoſe actions, and to none elſe. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, The hearing of Gods Word is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to deaf perſons, but to thoſe that can hear it; but drinking of Wine is a corporal action, and therefore commanded to thoſe only that can drink it. So that if the cup muſt be taken from all Lay-people, becauſe ſome of them have a natural antipathy to Wine; then the preaching of the Goſpel muſt be taken from Chriſtians, becauſe ſome of them are deaf and cannot hear it.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The fourth inconvenience is, That there are ſome Countries where no Wine grows, as in <hi>Lapland, Norway,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer; Firſt, That although no Wine grows in thoſe Countries, yet ſome may be brought thither.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But if none can be brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſpoiled, and its form changed, then it is better to ſubſtitute the ordinary drink of the Country in ſtead of Wine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But if this common drink of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59620:53"/>
the Country may not be ſubſtituted in ſtead of Wine, then they that cannot have Wine, do abſtain from it, becauſe they are forced thereunto; and it is neither impudence nor contempt, to abſtain from a thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Jeſus Chriſt, when it is not to be had: but to ordain that they that have wine in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance ſhall abſtain from the cup, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable boldneſs, and a moſt unchriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Sacrament.</p>

            <head type="sub">Againſt the Maſs.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THe Maſs, according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, is a Sacrifice of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt propitiatory for the ſins of the living and dead; and ſo it is defined by the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſion</hi> 22. Againſt ſuch a Maſs we might alleadge all the Arguments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made uſe of againſt Tranſubſtantiation, and the pretended preſence of Chriſts body in the hoſt; for our Adverſaries confeſs that thoſe reaſons which deſtroy Tranſubſtantiation, and the pretended preſence of Chriſts body in the hoſt, do alſo deſtroy the Maſs. But in this Chapter we ſhall only uſe ſuch Arguments as are directly againſt the Maſs, and do utterly deſtroy it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The firſt Argument is drawn from this, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the inſtitution and firſt celebration of the Euchariſt, Jeſus Chriſt did not ſacrifice nor offer his body and bloud to his Father, as appears by what is mentioned in the three Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in which there is not the leaſt foot-ſtep to be ſeen of a ſacrifice, or oblation of Chriſts body and bloud. This
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59620:54"/>
               <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth in <hi>Book</hi> 1. of the <hi>Maſs, chap.</hi> 27. in theſe words, <hi>The oblation which is made after conſecration, belongs to the entireneſs of the Sacrament, but is not of its eſſence; which I prove, becauſe neither our Lord nor his Apoſtles, did make this oblation at the firſt, as we have demonſtrated out of</hi> Gregory. The Jeſuite <hi>Salmeron</hi> in <hi>Tom.</hi> 13. of his Commentaries on the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> makes a Catalogue of unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, in which he puts the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, the worſhiping of Images, the Maſs, the manner of ſacrificing, and the tradition that Jeſus Chriſt did offer a ſacrifice in the Bread and Wine.</hi> Card. <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Annals on the year 53. freely confeſſeth that the ſacrifice of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is an unwritten Tradition. A ſtrange thing that the Maſs, which is the foundation of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church (for the Doctors require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the people, but that they ſhould go to Maſs) cannot be found to have been inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted or commanded by Jeſus Chriſt. And the truth is, if Jeſus Chriſt in the celebration of the Euchariſt had offered unto God his Father a ſacrifice of his Body and Bloud, propitiatory for the ſins of the living and dead, then there had been no need that he ſhould have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed again on the Croſs, becauſe, having already expiated our ſins in the ſacrifice of the Euchariſt, there was no need he ſhould expiate
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59620:54"/>
them again on the Croſs. To this I add, that St. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. mentions the Offices which Jeſus Chriſt left his Church when he aſcended into Heaven, in theſe words, <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and ſome Paſtors, and Teachers,</hi> but makes no mention at all of the Sacrificers of Chriſts body and bloud, nor in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> nor in the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> when he deſcribes the duty of Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons, without making the leaſt mention of this ſacrificing of Chriſts body and bloud.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſecond Argument is drawn from the definition of a Sacrifice, as it is given us by our Adverſaries, Card. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in <hi>Book</hi> 1. of the <hi>Maſs, chap.</hi> 2. defines it thus: <hi>Sacrifice is an external oblation made to God alone, whereby in acknowledgment of humane infirmity, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, the lawful Miniſter conſecrates by a myſtical ceremony, and deſtroys ſomething that is ſenſible and permanent.</hi> From theſe laſt words, <hi>viz.</hi> that the lawful Miniſter deſtroys ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſenſible, I form two Arguments which deſtroy the ſacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, In every ſacrifice the thing ſacrificed muſt fall under our ſenſes; for our Adverſaries ſay it is a ſenſible thing: But the body and bloud of Chriſt, which are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be ſacrificed in the Maſs, under the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59620:55"/>
of the bread and wine, do not fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſenſes, as we find by experience: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the body and bloud of Chriſt, which are pretended to be under the accidents of the bread and wine, are not the thing ſacrificed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument is this: In every true ſacrifice the thing ſacrificed muſt be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; that is, it muſt be ſo changed, that it muſt ceaſe to be what it was before, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith in expreſs terms in the place above cited: But in the pretended Sacrifice of the Maſs Chriſts body and bloud are not deſtroyed, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt dieth no more, Rom.</hi> 6. Therefore in the pretended Sacrifice of the Maſs, the body and bloud of Chriſt are not the thing ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To theſe two Arguments <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in <hi>Book</hi> 1. of the <hi>Maſs, ch.</hi> 27. and other <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors anſwer, that Chriſts body ſimply is not the thing ſacrificed in the Maſs, but it is Chriſts body, as it is under the ſpecies of the bread; and that it is in reference to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the bread, that Chriſts body is ſenſible and viſible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They anſwer that in the ſacrifice of the Maſs Chriſts body is deſtroyed in reſpect of its ſacramental being, but not in reſpect of its natural being; for when it is eaten in the ſacrament it ceaſeth to be under the ſpecies of the bread.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59620:55"/>
5 To theſe anſwers I reply, Firſt, That Chriſt body is not viſible by the ſpecies of the bread, becauſe, as our Adverſaries ſay, that hides it from us, and hinders us from ſeeing it. And although a ſubſtance may be ſaid to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and cognizable by its accidents, yet it is never ſo by the accidents of another ſubſtance; and conſequently Jeſus Chriſt may be ſaid to be viſible by his own accidents, but not by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the bread, which are juſt alike both in the conſecrated and unconſecrated hoſts; and 'tis a ridiculous ſhift to ſay that Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is viſible under the ſpecies of the bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſpecies is viſible; for as we cannot ſee Wine that is in a Hogſhead, becauſe we ſee the Hogſhead; and we cannot ſee Money that is in a Purſe cloſed, becauſe we ſee the Purſe; ſo neither can we ſee the body under the ſpecies of the bread, becauſe we ſee the ſpecies; for as our Adverſaries ſay, that ſpecies hinders us from ſeeing it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly, I ſay, That by the ſacramental being is underſtood, only an accidental being of Jeſus Chriſt (for example his preſence in the Sacrament) or elſe beſides that, is underſtood his ſubſtantial being too. If his ſubſtantial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be alſo underſtood (ſeeing the ſubſtantial being of a thing is nothing elſe but its ſubſtance and nature) then it will follow that if Jeſus
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59620:56"/>
Chriſt be deſtroyed in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt in reſpect of his ſubſtantial being, he muſt alſo be deſtroyed in reſpect of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being, which is contrary to what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt dieth no more.</hi> If an accidental being of Jeſus Chriſt be only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood (for example, his preſence in the Sacrament) then theſe abſurdities will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That the ſacrifice of the Maſs will be the ſacrifice of an accident only, and not of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt is not Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, but an accident of him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will follow that the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and that of the Croſs will not be the ſame ſacrifice in reference to the thing ſacrificed, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt, and his preſence are not the ſame thing; Jeſus Chriſt being a ſubſtance, and his preſence an accident, which is contrary to the deciſion of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which hath determined that the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and that of the Croſs, are the ſame in reference to the thing ſacrificed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It will follow that the thing which is deſtroyed in the Sacrament, is not the ſame with that, which was produced there, becauſe there is only an accident deſtroyed, whereas a ſubſtance was produced by Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59620:56"/>
which is a ſubſtantial converſion, as hath been ſufficiently proved.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It will follow that the ſacrifice of the Maſs will be offered in the Prieſts ſtomach only, becauſe this preſence is not deſtroyed till the Prieſt hath eaten the hoſt; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſacrifice of the Maſs will be offered after the Maſs, for this preſence is only deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the deſtruction of the accidents; and commonly theſe accidents are not deſtroyed till after Maſs is ſaid.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It will follow that the juſtice of God will ceaſe to be the ſame; for whereas heretofore it could not be ſatisfied but by the death of Chriſt, and by the deſtruction of his natural being; now God is appeaſed, our ſins expiated, and Gods juſtice ſatisfied by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his ſacramental being only; for they will have it, that the ſacrifice of the Maſs is propitiatory for the ſins of the living and the dead.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The third Argument is drawn from theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>Almoſt all things are by the Law purged with bloud, and without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſſion: It was therefore neceſſary that the patterns of things in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhould be purified with theſe, but the heavenly things themſelves with better ſacrifices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then theſe.</hi> From which words I form this Argument.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59620:57"/>
There is no propitiation, or remiſſion of ſins without ſheding of bloud, as the Apoſtle ſaith: But in the Maſs there is no ſheding of bloud (for it is called an Unbloudy ſacrifice:) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Maſs there is no propitiation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins; and conſequently no propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifice for ſin. This Argument may be thus confirmed: Under the Old Teſtament there was no propitiation, or purification, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſheding of bloud, and the types of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things were ſo purified, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Therefore under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo there can be no propitiation or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification without ſheding of bloud, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, being repreſented by the legal types, muſt be purified by a more excellent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>viz.</hi> by the ſheding of Chriſts bloud. And although the Apoſtle uſeth the word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> in the plural number, yet we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the only ſacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs; becauſe when one thing is oppoſed to many, it is often expreſſed in the plural number; as when Baptiſm, which is but one, is called Baptiſms, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. But the only ſacrifice of the Croſs of Chriſt in the Text above cited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 23. is oppoſed to the old Sacrifices, which were types and figures of the ſacrifice of the Croſs.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The fourth Argument is drawn from the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59620:57"/>
words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>This is the Covenant which I will make with them after thoſe days ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remiſſion of theſe is, there is no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin.</hi> Whence I form this Argument: Where there is remiſſion of ſins there is no need of an oblation, or a propitiatory ſacrifice for ſin, as the Apoſtle ſaith. But in the Chriſtian Church, by vertue of the New Teſtament, or New Covenant, confirmed by the bloud of Chriſt, there is remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16, 17. Therefore in the Chriſtian Church now adays, there is no need of an oblation, or propitiatory ſacrifice, and conſequently no need of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>9. The fifth Argument is drawn from the words of the Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. <hi>9.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not himſelf often, as the High Prieſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth into the holy place every year with the bloud of others; for then muſt he often have ſuffered from the foundation of the World, but now once in the end of the World, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf. And as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to men once to die, but after this the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him ſhall he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59620:58"/>
               <hi>This is confirmed by the words of the ſame Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. <hi>10.</hi> The Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with thoſe ſacrifices which they offered year by year, continually make the comers thereunto perfect, for then would they not have ceaſed to be offered, becauſe the worſhipers once pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſhould have had no more conſcience of ſins. But in thoſe a remembrance is made again of ſins every year; for it is not poſſible that the bloud of bulls and of goats ſhould take away ſins, &amp;c. And every High Prieſt ſtandeth dayly miniſtring and offering often times the ſame ſacrifices which can never take away ſins; but this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſate down on the right hand of God. For by one offering he hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified: <hi>which is conformable to what he had ſaid a little before, that</hi> we are ſanctified by the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all. <hi>From all which I form theſe Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Firſt the old ſacrifices were reiterated, for the Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>the High Prieſt entereth into the holy place every year with the bloud of others:</hi> but the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt muſt not be reiterated, for the ſame Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt offereth not himſelf often;</hi> and that <hi>he hath once appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf:</hi> Therefore the ſacrifice of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59620:58"/>
the Maſs is not the ſacrifice of the Croſs reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or the reiteration of the ſacrifice of the Croſs, as our Adverſaries would have it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Secondly, The Apoſtle adding, <hi>elſe he ſhould often have ſuffered from the foundation of the World,</hi> Makes it apparent that Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be offered without ſuffering: For, as he that ſhould ſay, this is not fire elſe it would be hot, doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe that fire is hot; and as he that ſhould ſay he is no man elſe he would be rational, doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe that man is rational: ſo when the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt offereth not himſelf often, otherwiſe he ſhould often bave ſuffered,</hi> doth neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe that Jeſus Chriſt cannot offer himſelf without ſuffering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Jeſus Chriſt doth not ſuffer every day in the Maſs: Therefore he is not offered every day in the Maſs by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Prieſts.</p>
            <p n="12">12, Thirdly, Theſe words, <hi>from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,</hi> are of great weight, for 'tis as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, if the only ſacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs be not ſufficient to take away ſins which ſhall be committed hereafter, it follows that it was not ſufficient to take away ſins which have been committed heretofore from the creation of the World; for it is very unſuitable that the ſacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs ſhould have more vertue
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59620:59"/>
before it was offered then ſince: But the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt on the Croſs, had the vertue to take away ſins before it was, <hi>otherwiſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he ſhould often have ſuffered from the foundation of the World:</hi> Therefore it hath alſo vertue to take away ſins committed ſince it was, and conſequently there is no need that it ſhould be reiterated in the Maſs.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Fourthly, The Apoſtles compariſon is conſiderable, the ſenſe whereof is this: As men ſuffer death but once, and after death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear no more till the day of the reſurrection, and day of judgment; ſo Chriſt hath offered himſelf to his Father once for all on the Croſs to take away ſins, and will be no more on earth until he comes to judge the quick and the dead. This utterly deſtroys the Maſs, in which Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be offered and ſacrificed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually by the miniſtry of Prieſts.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Fifthly, Sacrifices that take away ſins, and ſanctifie thoſe that come thereunto, ought not to be reiterated; for the only reaſon which the Apoſtle alledgeth, why the old ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Law were reiterated, is becauſe they could not take away ſins, nor ſanctifie the comers thereunto as appears by the Text above cited. But the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt on the Croſs, takes away ſins and ſanctifies thoſe that come thereunto: Therefore the ſacrifice of Jeſus
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59620:59"/>
Chriſt on the Croſs, ought not to be reiterated, and conſequently is not reiterated in the Maſs.</p>
            <p n="15">15. If Jeſus Chriſt did offer himſelf a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on the Croſs that he might ſanctifie us for ever, and purchaſe eternal redemption for us, then it is evident that the fruit and efficacy of this ſacrifice endures for ever, and that we muſt have recourſe to no other ſacrifice but to that of the Croſs: But Jeſus Chriſt did offer himſelf a ſacrifice on the Croſs, that he might ſanctifie us for ever, and purchaſe eternal redemption for us, as appears by the Texts aforeſaid: Therefore the efficacy of the ſacrifice of the Croſs endures for ever, and we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to no other Sacrifice but to that of the Croſs. In a word, either we muſt confeſs that the ſacrifice of the Croſs hath no vertue to take away ſins, and to ſanctifie us for ever, (which is contrary to what the Apoſtle ſaith) or elſe if it hath this vertue and ſufficiency, then Jeſus Chriſt hath offered one only ſacrifice once for all, and conſequently is not offered dayly in the Maſs by the Miniſtry of Prieſts.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Laſtly, The Apoſtle almoſt throughout the whole Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s,</hi> ſaith, that Jeſus Chriſt was conſtituted and conſecrated by his Father, High Prieſt for ever; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>chap.</hi> 7. he ſaith, That <hi>many were made Prieſts, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59620:60"/>
               <hi>of death; but Jeſus Chriſt becauſe he continueth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſthood; and that he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them;</hi> and conſequently he hath no need of Vicars or companions in his Prieſthood.</p>
            <p n="17">17. In anſwer to theſe Arguments the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Doctors are wont to ſay that the ſacrifice of the Maſs is the ſame with that of the Croſs, in reſpect of the eſſence of the Sacrifice, the ſame thing being offered in both, <hi>viz.</hi> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Chriſt by the ſame Prieſt, <hi>viz.</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt. But it differs in reſpect of the manner of offering; for on the Croſs Jeſus Chriſt offered himſelf bloudily, that is, when he died he ſhed his bloud for mankind; but in the Maſs he offers himſelf unbloudily, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſheding his bloud, and without dying: On the Croſs Jeſus Chriſt was deſtroyed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his natural being, but in the Maſs he is deſtroyed in reſpect of his ſacramental being. They add, that all the Arguments drawn from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> reſpect only that bloudy oblation which was once offered on the Croſs; but beſides this bloudy ſacrifice there is another that is unbloudy, which is daily offered in the Maſs. Laſtly, They ſay, that the ſacrifice of the Croſs is primitive and original, but this of the Maſs repreſentative,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59620:60"/>
commemorative, and applicative of that of the Croſs as the Council hath it in its 22. <hi>Seſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. To theſe diſtinctions I reply, That the ſacrifice of the Maſs doth not differ from that of the Croſs in reſpect of the manner only, (which is but an accidental difference) but it differs in reſpect of eſſence too.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the natural death of Jeſus Chriſt is of the eſſence of the ſacrifice of the Croſs: But the ſacrifice of the Maſs doth not comprehend the natural death of Jeſus Chriſt, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt dieth no more, Rom.</hi> 6. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſacrifice of the Maſs doth not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that which is of the eſſence of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Croſs, and conſequently differs from it eſſentially, and not in reſpect of the manner only.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe the repreſentation of a thing differs eſſentially from the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: For example, The Kings Picture differs eſſentially from the King. Alſo the memorial of a thing differs eſſentially from the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is a memorial: For example, The cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Paſsover, which was a memorial of the Angels favourable paſſing over the houſes of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> differs eſſentially from that paſſing over. And laſtly, the application of a thing differs eſſentially from it: For example, The application of a Plaiſter differs eſſentially
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59620:61"/>
from the Plaiſter. But according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in <hi>Seſſion</hi> 22. the ſacrifice of the Maſs is repreſentative, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative, and applicative of that of the Croſs: Therefore the ſacrifice of the Maſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers eſſentially from that of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the ſacrifice of the Croſs is of an infinite value, and conſequently ought not to be reiterated; for its value being infinite, it is ſufficient to take away all ſins paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith <hi>Book</hi> I. of the <hi>Maſs, chap.</hi> 4. But the ſacrifice of the Maſs is of a finite price and value, according to the ſame <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and other <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors; at which we may juſtly wonder, ſeeing, as our Adverſaries ſay, it differs not from the ſacrifice of the Croſs, either in reſpect of the thing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, or in reſpect of the chief Prieſt, and yet from theſe the ſacrifice hath all its price and value.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Secondly, I ſay that an unbloudy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice is a feigned, and an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing, and that the Arguments drawn from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> do wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>that without ſheding of bloud there is no remiſſion of ſins:</hi> Therefore in the unbloudy ſacrifice of the Maſs, there can be no remiſſion of ſins, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59620:61"/>
conſequently it cannot be a propitiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt cannot be offered without ſuffering; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt offereth not himſelf often, otherwiſe he ſhould often have ſuffered:</hi> But the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt with ſuffering, is a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſacrifice: Therefore there is no unbloudy ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the bloudy ſacrifice of the Croſs, being of an infinite value, hath purchaſed an eternal redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. and hath taken away all ſins, paſt, preſent, and to come. Whence it follows that there is no other ſacrifice either bloudy or unbloudy, that can purchaſe the pardon of our ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſacrifice of the Croſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſufficiently done it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the juſtice of God requires that ſins ſhall be expiated by the puniſhment that is due to them; and this is ſo true that the wrath of God could not be appeaſed but by the bloudy and ignominious death of the Croſs: Therefore the juſtice of God muſt have changed its nature if ſins can be expiated in the Maſs without pain, or ſuffering.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Thirdly, To the diſtinction of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſacrifice, which was offered on the Croſs, and repreſentative, commemorative, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative, which is daily offered in the Maſs, I
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59620:62"/>
reply, Firſt, That what the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith in <hi>Seſſion</hi> 22. <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Euchariſt there is a ſacrifice repreſentative, commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and applicative of that of the Maſs, may bear a good ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is in it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, commemoration, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacrifice of the Croſs, <hi>viz.</hi> a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, becauſe the bread broken, repreſents the body broken; and the wine poured into the cup, repreſents the bloud of Chriſt ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins: a commemoration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that is done in it, is done in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Jeſus Chriſt and his death according to his own command in theſe words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> and according to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come:</hi> and an application, becauſe the merit of the ſacrifice of the Croſs is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us not only by the word, but alſo by the Sacraments, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. But our Adverſaries are not content with this, for they will have it that in the celebration of the Euchariſt, there is offered a true and proper ſacrifice propitiatory for the ſins of the living and the dead, which hath been already refuted at large.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſay that the application of the ſacrifice of the Croſs may be conſidered on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59620:62"/>
Gods part, or on mans part: on Gods part, when he offers Jeſus Chriſt to us, with all his benefits, both in his Word and Sacraments: on mans part, when by a true and lively faith, working by love, we embrace Jeſus Chriſt with all his benefits offered to us both in his Word and Sacraments. And this is it that Jeſus Chriſt teacheth us, St. <hi>John</hi> 3. in theſe words, <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, (viz.</hi> on the Croſs) <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life: For God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, (viz.</hi> to die) <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> he doth not ſay, whoſoever ſacrificeth him in the Maſs, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth, &amp;c. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews it clearly in theſe words, <hi>God hath ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud;</hi> he doth not ſay through the ſacrifice of the Maſs but through faith. And we really and truly apply the ſacrifice of Chriſts Croſs when we have recourſe to him, as a man applies a Plaiſter when he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to it, and lays it on the wound: But the recourſe or refuge of a penitent ſinner to the ſacrifice of the Croſs for obtaining mercy from God, is nothing elſe but Faith. As for the diſtinction of the ſacramental and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59620:63"/>
natural being of Jeſus Chriſt, it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready refuted in the 6. Number.</p>
            <p n="21">21. <hi>I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe with the teſtimony of</hi> Thomas Aquinas, <hi>the moſt famous of all the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Doctors, and called by our Adverſaries, the Angelical Doctor. This</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas <hi>in</hi> Part. <hi>3.</hi> Queſt. <hi>83.</hi> Artic. <hi>1. having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this Queſtion,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether Chriſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, he concludes with theſe memorable words.</hi> The celebration of this Sacrament is very fitly called a ſacrificing of Chriſt, as well becauſe it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Chriſts Paſſion, as becauſe by this Sacrament we are made partakers of the fruit of the Lords Paſſion. <hi>And afterward he gives his anſwer, in theſe words:</hi> I anſwer, We muſt ſay that the celebration of this Sacrament is called a ſacrificing of Chriſt, in two reſpects. Firſt, Becauſe (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Simplicius</hi> ſaith) we are wont to give to Images the name of the things whereof they are Images, as when we ſee Pictures on a Wall, or in a Frame, we ſay this is <hi>Cicero,</hi> that is <hi>Saluſt,</hi> &amp;c. But the celebration of this Sacrament (as hath been ſaid above) is a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Image of Chriſts Paſſion; which Paſſion is the true ſacrificing of Chriſt, and ſo the celebration of this Sacrament is the ſacrificing of Christ. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The celebration of this Sacrament is called the ſacrificing of Chriſt in regard of the effect of Chriſts
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59620:63"/>
Paſſion becauſe by this Sacrament we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the fruit of the Lords Paſſion. <hi>Let the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>keep to this deciſion of their Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctor, and we ſhall agree with them in this point; for I am confident that there is not one of the Reformed Religion but will ſubſcribe this true doctrine of</hi> Thomas Aquinas.</p>

            <p n="1">1. IN the two firſt Chapters we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the two principal Objections of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, drawn from theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> &amp;c. and from theſe, <hi>he that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my bloud, hath eternal life,</hi> &amp;c. Now we muſt anſwer the reſt.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> 1.</head>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt Objection is this. When the eſtabliſhing of Articles of Faith, the Inſtitution of Sacraments, and the making Teſtaments and Covenants are in agitation, men ſpeak plainly and properly, and not obſcurely or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravitely: But in the celebration of the Euchariſt Jeſus Chriſt eſtabliſhed an Article of Faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, and ſpake of a Teſtament and a Covenant; for it is ſaid of the Cup that it is the New Teſtament and the New Covenant in the bloud of Chriſt; yea, he ſpake then to his Diſciples, to whom he ſpake in plain and proper terms, and not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59620:64"/>
in obſcure terms, or in figures or parables, as he did to the people.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p n="3">3. To this objection I anſwer, Firſt, That it is falſe that Articles of Faith are always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in proper terms in holy Scripture, as when it is ſaid in the Creed that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God,</hi> it is evident that this is a Figure and a Metaphor, for God being a Spirit, hath neither right hand nor left; and all interpreters expound this ſitting on Gods right hand, metaphorically, <hi>viz.</hi> for that Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip both of Heaven and Earth, which he hath received from God his Father, as earthly Princes make their Lieutenants, whom they appoint to govern in their name, to ſit on the right ſide of them. Again, When it is ſaid, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, and I will give thee the Keys of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that theſe are Figures and Metaphors, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth in <hi>Book</hi> 1. of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, chap.</hi> 10. and yet it is chiefly by this paſſage that they endeavour to prove the Popes authority.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59620:65"/>
4. Secondly, I anſwer, That the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture commonly ſpeaks of Sacraments in figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative terms; thus Circumciſion is called Gods Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. in theſe words, <hi>This is my Covenant, every male ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> that is, this is the ſign of the Covenant, as appears by the following verſe, <hi>Ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your foreskin, and it ſhall be a token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between me and you.</hi> So the Paſchal Lamb is called the Lords Paſsover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. becauſe the bloud of this Lamb ſprinkled on the dore-poſts, was given as a ſign of the Angels favourable paſſing over the houſes of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;</hi> as appears by <hi>verſe</hi> 13. of the ſame Chapter. So Baptiſm is called <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> becauſe it is the Sacrament of it. In a word, The Euchariſtical cup is called the New Teſtament, becauſe it is the ſign, ſeal, and ſacrament of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thirdly, I anſwer, That in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Teſtaments are not always expreſſed in proper terms without a Figure; for the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49. and that of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 33. are nothing elſe but a chain of Metaphors, and other Figures. And Civilians will have it, that in Teſtaments we ſhould not regard the proper ſignification of the words, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Teſtator. To this I add that Jeſus Chriſt did not then make the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59620:65"/>
and the New Covenant, but only inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Seal and Sacrament of them: For the Covenant was made with all mankind in the perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> after the Fall, when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him that the ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head. This was afterward renewed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God promiſed him that in his ſeed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> in Chriſt, the bleſſed ſeed, who hath deſtroyed the Kingdom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. After this it was confirmed by the bloud of Chriſt ſhed on the Croſs: Then it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed through all the World when the Apoſtles had received the Holy Ghoſt. And laſtly, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm and the Euchariſt are the Signs, Seals, and Sacraments of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Fourthly, I anſwer, That by theſe words, <hi>To ſpeak clearly or plainly,</hi> be underſtood, to ſpeak intelligibly, ſo that the Apoſtles might and ought to underſtand what he ſaid to them, then it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is certain that Jeſus Chriſt did ſpeak clearly; for to ſpeak ſacramentally, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtile uſed in all Sacraments, was to ſpeak clearly and not obſcurely: But if by theſe words, <hi>to ſpeak clearly,</hi> be underſtood to ſpeak without a figure, then it is falſe that he always ſpake clearly to his Diſciples, witneſs the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Diſciples to whom he ſaid St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>follow me, and I will make you fiſhers of men:</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:59620:66"/>
And when he ſaith elſe where, <hi>ye are the ſalt of the earth, the light of the world</hi> &amp;c. To this I add, The Apoſtles did ask Jeſus Chriſt the meaning of Parables, and other things which they did not underſtand; and therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had much more reaſon to ask the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo many ſtrange things as follow from the Maſs, from Tranſubſtantiation, and from the pretended preſence of Chriſts body in the Hoſt, <hi>viz.</hi> how a humane body can be in a point, and in divers places at once? how the head of Jeſus Chriſt and his whole body could be in his mouth? how accidents can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſubject? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Laſtly, Seeing Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>drink ye all of this cup,</hi> all Prieſts, whether Jeſuites, Monks, or other <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be conſtrained, really, properly, and without a figure, to drink of the cup, whether melted or not, and really to ſwallow it, until they ſhould confeſs that there are figures in the words of Jeſus Chriſt in the celebration of the Euchariſt.</p>

            </div>
            <div n="2" type="objection">

                  <hi>Objection</hi> 2.</head>
               <p n="8">8. The ſecond Objection is this: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt is more excellent then that of the Paſſover, becauſe the Sacrament of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59620:66"/>
the Paſſover is a type of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, and the thing typified is always more excellent then the type: But if the Sacrament of the Euchariſt did not really contain the body and bloud of Chriſt, but was only the ſign of it, then it would follow that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt would not be more excellent then that of the Paſſover; nay, the Sacrament of the Paſſover would be more excellent then that of the Euchariſt; becauſe a Lamb and its bloud is more excellent then Bread and Wine; and the death of a Lamb, and the ſhedding of its bloud, doth much better repreſent the death of Chriſt, and the ſhedding of his bloud on the Croſs, then Bread broken, and Wine poured into a cup can do.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p n="9">9. To this I anſwer, Firſt, That the thing typified by the Paſchal Lamb, is Jeſus Chriſt, and not the Sacrament of the Euchariſt; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews clearly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. when he calls Jeſus Chriſt our Paſſover, in theſe words, <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover was crucified for us.</hi> The truth is, a whole Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh killed and burnt toward the evening, and its bloud ſhed, doth very well repreſent Jeſus Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, without ſin, put to death, and his bloud
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59620:67"/>
ſhed toward the end of the World, and in the fulneſs of time; but ſuch a Lamb repreſents no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which is ſeen in the Euchariſt. Beſides the Types and Sacraments of the Old Teſtament were inſtituted that the Faithful of thoſe Times might come to the knowledge of the things typified and ſignified, for the ſalvation of their ſouls: But the Faithful under the Old Teſtament never came to the knowledge of the Euchariſt by the Paſchal Lamb; and though they had come to the knowledge of it, yet they had had no benefit thereby. In a word, ſeeing the Paſſover and the Euchariſt are types, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſigns, of Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to ſay, that the Paſſover is the type of the Euchariſt, becauſe a type is not properly the type of another type, but only of the thing typified; as the image of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is not the image of another image of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but only of <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Secondly, I anſwer, that the excellence of one Sacrament above another, muſt be drawn from its form and efficacie, and not from its matter, becauſe it is form that chiefly gives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to things compoſed of matter and form. But the form of Sacraments depends on the words of Inſtitution, becauſe being ſigns of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, their form can only depend upon the will of God, who chooſeth certain
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59620:67"/>
things to ſignifie other things; and this will of God cannot be known but by revelation, which is the Word; ſo that it is properly ſaid that the Word joined with the Element makes the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: Therefore, although the Sacrament of the Paſſover be more excellent then the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt in reſpect of its matter, becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal Lamb and its bloud, are more excellent then the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt; and that the Lamb and its bloud have a greater ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie with Jeſus Chriſt and his bloud ſhed on the Croſs, then the Bread and Wine of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt have; yet the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is much more excellent then that of the Paſſover in reſpect of its form, which depends on the words of Inſtitution, becauſe that at the inſtitution of the Sacrament of the Paſſover God ſpake not one word of the principal end for which he did inſtitute it, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the type of Jeſus Chriſt and his death. But at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt Chriſt declared in expreſs terms, that he did inſtitute the eating of the bread broken, and the drinking of the wine, poured into the cup, to be commemorative ſigns of himſelf, and his death. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt is yet more excellent then that of the Paſſover, in reſpect of its efficacy, which depends on two things, <hi>viz.</hi> on the form, which being more
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59620:68"/>
manifeſt in the Euchariſt, doth alſo operate with more efficacy, and alſo becauſe it repreſents a thing paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the death of Chriſt. But the knowledge of things paſt is more clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then the knowledge of things to come; and we are more toucht with the memory of things paſt, when ſome ſymbole brings them to our thoughts, then when we conſider things to come, through clouds and ſhadows. To this I add that the bread and wine of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt have a greater analogie with Jeſus Chriſt then the Paſchal Lamb had, in one reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of the ſpiritual nouriſhment which we receive by Chriſts death; for as Baptiſm is the Sacrament of our ſpiritual birth, ſo the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is the Sacrament of our ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. But this nouriſhment is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repreſented by bread and wine which are the ordinary nouriſhment of our bodies, then by a Lamb.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I anſwer, That it is far leſs inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to give ſome prerogative to the Paſover above the Euchariſt, <hi>(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>z.</hi> to give it a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent matter and analogie) then to aſſert the corporal preſence of Chriſt in the Hoſt, by an unheard of Tranſubſtantiation, which deſtroys the nature of Sacraments, gives our Lord a monſtrous body, includes notorious abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and contradictions, and gives the lye to

               <p n="11">11 The third Objection was propoſed at <hi>Niſmes, Anno</hi> 1657. by the Jeſuite S. <hi>Rigaut,</hi> thus. God doth communicate, or can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the creature in a finite degree that which he poſſeſſeth in an infinite degree. For example; God hath an infinite power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he can do all things at once; therefore he communicates, or can communicate to the creature a finite and limited power, whereby it may do divers things at once, as appears in a man, for he can ſee, hear talk, and walk at the ſame time. God hath alſo an infinite wiſdom and knowledge, whereby he knows all things at once; therefore he communicates, or can communicate to the creature a finite knowledge, whereby it may know divers things at once. And even ſo God hath a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual infinite extent, which is called immenſity, whereby he fills all things and all places at once: Therefore God communicates or can communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the creature, <hi>viz.</hi> to a body a finite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, whereby it may fill divers ſpaces, and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſeveral places at once. Whence it follows that Chriſts body may be in divers places at the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> in Heaven and in the Hoſt.</p>

                  <p n="12">12. To this I anſwer, That as God cannot be in two places (for example, in heaven and upon earth) without being in all thoſe places that are between both, (for then he would be diſtant, and ſeparated from himſelf) ſo Chriſts body cannot be in two diſtant places, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> in Heaven and upon Earth in the hoſt, without being in all thoſe places that are between both, for then it would be diſtant and ſeparated from it ſelf, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, as hath been ſufficiently proved. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing Chriſts body is not in all places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and between Heaven and Earth, it follows that it is not in heaven and upon Earth in the hoſt, nor at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> in conſecrated hoſts. So that to make a creature, for example the body of Chriſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of Gods extent or immenſity, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that as God by his infinite extent occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies all places, ſo Chriſts body ſhould by its finite extent occupy ſome place. But if to make it partake in a finite degree of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attribute of immenſity, it muſt be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, yet it is ſufficient that it be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places ſucceſſively and not at once; or if to make it partake of this attribute it muſt be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59620:69"/>
in divers places at once, yet it is ſufficient that it occupies them by its ſeveral parts; for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the head be in one place, and the feet in another, &amp;c. In a word, that it be without diſcontinuance or ſeparation, as God is every where without diſcontinuance. Thus the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Maſter <hi>Bruguier</hi> then anſwered and much better, but I cannot remember his full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat anſwer.</p>

               <p n="13">13. The fourth Objection is this. If di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers bodies may miraculouſly be in one and the ſame place, then it alſo follows that one body may miraculouſly be in divers places, there being no more difficulty or impoſſibility in the one then in the other. But divers bodies may miraculouſly be in one and the ſame place; for Jeſus Chriſt came into the room where his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were, the dores being ſhut, which he could not have done, if his body had not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the dores. Beſides, It is ſaid that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Mary</hi> was a Virgin both before and after his birth, which could not have been if Jeſus Chriſt had not penetrated her belly and come forth without fraction or overture. Laſtly, Jeſus Chriſt penetrated the ſtone that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59620:70"/>
was laid on his ſepulchre when he roſe again; and it is ſaid that he penetrated the heavens when he aſcended.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p n="14">14 To this I anſwer, Firſt, That it is not ſaid that Jeſus Chriſt came in, the dores being ſhut; for theſe are the words, <hi>The ſame day when it was evening, and the dores having been ſhut for fear of the Jews, Jeſus came,</hi> &amp;c. which words do indeed ſhew the time when Jeſus came in unto his Diſciples, but not the manner of his entry by penetration, but if the words be tranſlated, <hi>the dores being ſhut,</hi> and that they do import that the dores were not opened by any body, yet they do not exclude the opening of them in the twinckling of an eye by the divine power, ſith we have exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this in holy Scripture; for <hi>Acts</hi> 5. we read that the Apoſtle went out of Priſon, though the dores had been faſt ſhut, but it is ſaid that <hi>the Angel of God opened them.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 12. <hi>The dore of the Priſon opened to S. Peter of its own accord;</hi> that is, without being opened by any body. And ſo it is ſaid that Jeſus Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, <hi>the dores being ſhut, or having been ſhut;</hi> which excludes the opening of them by any body, but not the opening of them by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

power in ſo ſhort a time that it was undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwer, That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was a true Virgin both before and after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, if by being a Virgin be meant not to have had the company of a man; but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Jeſus Chriſt came out of the Virgins belly by opening her womb; for it is ſaid, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. that <hi>Joſeph and Mary carried Jeſus Chriſt to Jeruſalem to preſent him to the Lord; as it is written in the Law, every male that openeth the womb ſhall be holy unto the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly I anſwer, That Jeſus Chriſt did not penetrate the ſtone that was laid on his ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre; for it is ſaid, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. That <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God rolled it back from the dore of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly I anſwer, That when it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. that Jeſus Chriſt penetrated the heavens, we muſt underſtand it improperly, in the ſame manner as it is commonly ſaid that an Arrow penetrates the Air; that is, the Air gives way to the Arrow that paſſeth through the Air; and ſo Jeſus Chriſt penetrated the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, becauſe the Heavens gave way to his body, and not that the Heavens and his Body were in one and the ſame place.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. All the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors agree with us, that modal accidents (which are nothing elſe

But all the Objections by which they endeavour to prove that the accidents of the bread and wine may exiſt without a ſubject, (that is, without their ſubſtance) do prove the ſame thing of modal accidents too.

               <p n="16">16. The fifth Objection is drawn from <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. in theſe words, <hi>From the riſing of the Sun unto the going down of the ſame my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place ſhall they offer incenſe to my name, and a new and pure offering:</hi> where by this new and pure offering nothing can be underſtood but the ſacrifice of the Maſs; becauſe by this offering we cannot underſtand Prayers, Alms, Contrition of heart, and other good works, which are ſometimes in Scripture called Oblations and Sacrifices, for the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> promiſeth a new offering. But Prayers, Alms, and other good works were common amongſt the Jews; and beſides, they of the Reformed Church do believe that all the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59620:71"/>
actions of the Faithful are poluted, and the Prophet ſpeaks of a pure and clean offering. Again, By this offering which <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaks of, cannot be underſtood Lambs, Bulls, and ſuch like Animals, which were wont to be ſacrificed in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; becauſe the Prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that it ſhall be offered in every place, even amongſt the Heathen. Laſtly, By this offering cannot be underſtood the bloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which Jeſus Chriſt offered on the Croſs, becauſe that bloudy ſacrifice was offered but once upon Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Prophet ſpeaks of an oblation that ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in every place: Therefore by this offering muſt be underſtood the ſacrifice of the body and bloud of Chriſt, under the ſpecies of the bread and wine, which is nothing elſe but the Maſs.</p>

                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p n="17">17. To this I anſwer, Firſt, That by the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaks, muſt be underſtood that ſpiritual Worſhip and Service which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhould perform unto God under the New Teſtament, which is compriſed in that ſacrifice which they offer to God, both of their perſons and religious actions; and this is the reaſon why St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. ſpeaks thus. <hi>I beſeech you therefore, Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the mercies of</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59620:72"/>
                     <hi>God that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 15. ſpeaking of the grace that was given him of God, he ſaith, <hi>it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him that he ſhould be the Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt to the Gentiles, miniſtring the Goſpel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable, being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Whence it appears that by this oblation whereof <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> ſpeaks, we muſt not underſtand the offering of Chriſts body and bloud under the accidents of bread and wine, but the offering up of the perſons and religious actions of thoſe that ſhould be brought unto God by the preaching of the Goſpel, and particularly the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Secondly I anſwer, That in the whole paſſage of <hi>Malachy</hi> above cited, the words <hi>new offering</hi> are not to be found, but only <hi>clean offering.</hi> And though a new offering had been there ſpoken of, yet I ſay that things may be ſaid to be new, when being ſpoiled and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, they are reſtored and made ſound again. But the ſervice of God which had been corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the Law, was re-eſtabliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles under the Goſpel, ſo that all things were made new; a new Time, <hi>viz.</hi> the time of the preaching of the Goſpel; a new People, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chriſtian People; a new place, <hi>viz.</hi> all parts of the World, and not at
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59620:72"/>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> only; a new Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lords Prayer; new Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm and the Lords Supper; and new Preaching, <hi>viz.</hi> the preaching of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Thirdly I anſwer that the oblation which is offered unto God under the Goſpel, is pure and clean; the ſervice which is performed to him, according to his Word, is pure; the preaching of the Goſpel is pure. In a word, the Chriſtian Religion is pure, though there be many failings in thoſe that profeſs it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Faithful that preſent their bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, be compaſſed about with many infirmities, and that their religious actions be accompanied with divers failings, yet their perſons and works may be ſaid to be pure and clean in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in whoſe name they are preſented to God; ſo that although they cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pleaſe or ſatisfie God; yet as they are members of Chriſt, they are reputed holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: for it is theſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>who as living ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual houſe, a holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſo our ſacrifices are a pure and clean offering, but it is through Jeſus Chriſt, who covers them with his purity and holineſs, ſo that the defects of them are not imputed to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59620:73"/>
us. To this I add, That beſides the perfect purity which we have by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs, we have alſo a purity begun by the Holy Ghoſt; of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. in theſe words, that <hi>the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> for that which God hath decreed, Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="20">20. The ſixth Objection is drawn from <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. in theſe words: <hi>And Melchiſedec King of Salem, bringing forth bread and wine (for he was a Prieſt bleſſed him.</hi> And from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. and from <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> From which words our Adverſaries argue thus.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59620:73"/>
Firſt, They ſay that Jeſus Chriſt is a Prieſt, not after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec;</hi> the difference between <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> conſiſting in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Aaron</hi> and the other Levitical Prieſts offered bloudy Sacrifices, killing and ſhedding the bloud of Beaſts, which they ſacrificed to God, as a ſign and figure of the bloudy ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt on the Croſs. But <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> offered an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy ſacrifice, for when he went to meet <hi>Abraham</hi> returning from the ſlaughter of the Kings, he offered to God Bread and Wine. And ſeeing this Bread and Wine offered to God by <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> were ſigns and types of Chriſts body and bloud, Jeſus Chriſt was obliged to offer an unbloudy ſacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> his body and bloud under the ſpecies of bread and wine, which he did at the inſtitution and celebration of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, that ſo the reality of the thing typified might anſwer thoſe ſhadows and types. Secondly, That although <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> had brought all this bread and wine for the refreſhment of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Army that returned from the ſlaughter of the Kings, yet he firſt offered it to God, and then gave it to them, that ſo they might partake of the ſacrifice of bread and wine. And the reaſon of this is, becauſe the Scripture ſaith that <hi>Abraham</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the battel with great ſpoils; amongſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59620:74"/>
which there was meat and drink enough for the refreſhment of himſelf and his people: alſo it ſaith expreſly that <hi>Abrahams</hi> people had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch refreſhment as was neceſſary before <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> met them; and conſequently they had no need of the bread and wine which he brought, except it had been to partake of the ſacrifice of the bread and wine which he offered. Thirdly, They ſay this is ſtrongly proved by the following words, <hi>for he was Prieſt of the moſt high God,</hi> which ſhew the reaſon why <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec</hi> brought bread and wine, <hi>viz.</hi> to make an oblation or offering of it to God; for if he had brought this bread and wine for the refreſhment of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his people, the Scripture would have ſaid that he had brought this bread and wine, becauſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faint and tired, had need of meat and drink; but it ſpeaks nothing of this: on the contrary it ſaith that he brought bread and wine, <hi>for he was Prieſt.</hi> Fourthly, They ſay that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedec;</hi> and ſeeing there can be no Prieſt without a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, there can be no eternal Prieſt without an eternal or perpetual ſacrifice. But the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Croſs was offered but once, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reiterated, <hi>for Jeſus Chriſt dieth no more, Rom.</hi> 6. Therefore there muſt be another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſacrifice in the Church, which Jeſus
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59620:74"/>
Chriſt offereth by the hands of Prieſts, which can be nothing elſe but the ſacrifice of the Maſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſacrifice of Chriſts body and bloud un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecies of the bread and wine, typified by the ſacrifice of the bread and wine of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec.</hi>

                  <p n="22">22. Secondly, I anſwer that the Hebrew word uſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſignifies commonly brought, drew out, cauſed to be brought, cauſed to be drawn out, cauſed to come, &amp;c. But we muſt not ſtray from the proper ſignification of words but upon very great neceſſity, which appears not in this Text. And although this Hebrew word ſhould ſignifie <hi>brought to offer,</hi> and that it ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>offered,</hi> yet our Adverſaries would gain nothing by it; for it is not ſaid in the Text that he brought bread and wine to offer unto God; but we muſt rather expound it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that he brought bread and wine to offer and preſent it to <hi>Abraham:</hi> And indeed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <hi>viz. and bleſſed him,</hi> do clearly ſhew it, for the Pronoun Relative <hi>him,</hi> relates to <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the expoſition of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. where he ſaith expreſly that <hi>Melchiſedec met Abraham and bleſſed him.</hi> And a little after he ſaith, that <hi>Melchiſedec bleſſed him that had the promiſes; and that the leſs is bleſſed of the greater.</hi> But if theſe words, <hi>he brought bread and wine,</hi> muſt be expounded thus, he offered bread and wine to God, then it muſt neceſſarily follow that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> bleſſed God and not <hi>Abraham;</hi> for in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59620:76"/>
he offered bread and wine to God, and bleſſed him, the Pronoun <hi>him</hi> can relate to none but God.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Thirdly, I anſwer, That <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> brought bread and wine to <hi>Abraham</hi> to refreſh him and his people, and not to offer unto God. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in <hi>Book</hi> 1. of the <hi>Maſs, chap.</hi> 6. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> brought bread and wine to <hi>Abraham</hi> to refreſh him and his people, who returned faint and tired from the ſlaughter of the Kings, which is true; but he adds that Jeſus Chriſt had offered it to God before, which is falſe, and cannot be proved. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> writes that the Jews under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> meeting <hi>Abraham</hi> after his victory, brought bread and wine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him and his people. <hi>Joſephus</hi> writing this Hiſtory, ſaith, that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> preſented bread and wine to <hi>Abraham</hi> to refreſh him and his Army. <hi>Damaſcene, Book</hi> 4. of the <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> ſaith that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> treated <hi>Abraham</hi> with bread and wine.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Fourthly, The Reaſons of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, mentioned in the Objections to prove that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> brought bread and wine to <hi>Abraham</hi> that he might partake of the ſacrifice which he had offered, are not conſiderable; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> returned from the battle with great ſpoils; and ſo there was meat and drink enough
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59620:77"/>
for him and his people; and that they had taken their repaſt before <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> met them, &amp;c. Theſe Reaſons, I ſay, are inconſiderable, becauſe although <hi>Abraham</hi> had great ſpoils, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored all to the King of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and though his people had eaten and drank of ſuch as they found amongſt the ſpoils, yet it is not ſaid that <hi>Abraham</hi> did eat and drink; and though both he and his people had eaten and drank, yet it is not ſaid how long it was ſince, and that they had no need of more proviſion; and though they had no need of more, yet <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> not knowing that they had eaten and drank, did, that which prudent men are wont to do, <hi>viz.</hi> provide all that may be needful in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Fifthly, I anſwer, That the principal reaſon which our Adverſaires bring to prove that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> offered unto God bread and wine, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is in the Hebrew Text, <hi>for he was Prieſt,</hi> is a manifeſt falſification; for it is in the Hebrew Text, <hi>and he was Prieſt.</hi> Alſo the old Latine Interpreter, and the Greek Septuagint tranſlate it as we do, <hi>viz. and he was Prieſt:</hi> And it is very probable that this paſſage hath been corrupted in <hi>Jeroms</hi> Latine Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe in his Hebrew Queſtions, and in his Epiſtle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> he tranſlates it, <hi>and he was Prieſt.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Caecilius,</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59620:77"/>
and St. <hi>Auguſt. Book</hi> 4. of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine, chap.</hi> 21. and elſewhere, tranſlate it, <hi>and he was Prieſt.</hi> So that although the Hebrew particle uſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> do ſometimes ſignifie, <hi>for,</hi> yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that both its proper and common ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>and;</hi> and that for one place where it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>for,</hi> there are a thouſand at leaſt where it ſignifies <hi>and;</hi> and that there is nothing that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us to tranſlate it <hi>for;</hi> it is evident that the Argument of our Adverſaries is of no force at all. Therefore it is more pertinent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe words, <hi>and he was Prieſt,</hi> to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>viz. and bleſſed him,</hi> then to what goes before, <hi>viz. brought bread and wine.</hi> For as <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> being a liberal King, brought bread and wine to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to refreſh him and his people; ſo, as he was a Prieſt much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then <hi>Abraham,</hi> he bleſſed him. And though it ſhould be tranſlated, <hi>for he was Prieſt,</hi> yet it would not follow that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> did ſacrifice bread and wine unto God; for it might be ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> would ſhew the reaſon of the good will of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> toward <hi>Abraham; viz.</hi> it was very fit that he that was Prieſt of the moſt high God, ſhould teſtifie his kindneſs to ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a ſervant of God as was <hi>Abraham,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting bread and wine to him, whereof he thought there was need.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Sixthly, I anſwer, That from what is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59620:78"/>
ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>viz.</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt is a Prieſt for ever, it will not follow that he muſt offer himſelf every day in the Maſs, under the ſpecies of bread and wine, by the miniſtry of Prieſts; for the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> placeth the perpetuity of the Prieſthood partly in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no need he ſhould be offered any more, ſeeing by one oblation he hath conſecrated for ever thoſe that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and partly in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that being exalted far above the heavens, he intercedes continually for us; for the Prieſthood conſiſts in certain functions, and in the virtue and efficacy of them. And ſeeing there are two parts of Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whereof one relates to the oblation of himſelf, which he offered on the Croſs; and the other to his interceſſion; it is certain that the virtue and efficacy of the oblation is eternal, and that the interceſſion will continue unto the end of the World.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Seaventhly, I anſwer, That in all the holy Scripture where the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec</hi> is ſpoken of, three things only are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was a Prieſt, that he was a Prieſt for ever, and that he was ſo with an oath, according to the application that is made of it to Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. in theſe words, <hi>The Lord hath ſworn and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever, after</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59620:78"/>
                     <hi>the order of Melchiſedec,</hi> but there is nothing at all ſpoken of the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> nor is it ſaid wherein it did conſiſt: for as it was fit that all the offices which we find, were born by the greateſt Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets under the Old Teſtament, ſhould be collected in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> which was done by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them as types and figures of Jeſus Chriſt; and that the moſt illuſtrious type was <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec;</hi> ſo it was more expedient not to ſpeak of the nature of the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not expedient then to ſpeak of the nature of the ſacrifice of the Meſſiah. And therefore although we know not the nature and quality of the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> yet we know that he was a Prieſt: Even as we know that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was a King, though we know not in what manner he executed his Kingly Office.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Laſtly, I anſwer, That it is falſe that the difference between the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi> and that of <hi>Aaron</hi> did conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Aaron</hi> offered the bloudy ſacrifices of Beaſts, and <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> offered an unbloudy ſacrifice of bread and wine. It is alſo falſe that the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> to that of Jeſus Chriſt doth conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that as <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> did ſacrifice bread and wine, ſo Chriſt did ſacrifice his body and bloud under
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59620:79"/>
the ſpecies of bread and wine: theſe are humane inventions, and are founded neither on Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture nor Reaſon, for on the contrary, the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> placeth the difference between the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec,</hi> and that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and its likeneſs to that of Chriſt in quite another thing. Firſt, He is called <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> which being interpreted (as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.) is King of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and then King of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, King of Peace; and herein he very well repreſents our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is truly King of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, not only becauſe he is righteous, and was always without ſin; but alſo becauſe by his ſatisfaction he hath purchaſed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for us, <hi>being made unto us of God, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> He is alſo truly King of peace, in that he hath reconciled men unto God, made their peace with the Angels and hath particularly recommended peace to them. As for <hi>Aaron,</hi> and other High Prieſts, they were no Kings, much leſs are the Prieſts of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church ſo, and conſequently cannot be after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> and they that have written the lives of the Popes have ſufficiently declared what righteouſneſs and peace they have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the true and faithful ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, as I ſhall ſhew at large elſewhere. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. repreſents <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:59620:79"/>
to us as a man come from heaven, <hi>without father, without mother, without deſcent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life:</hi> not that he was really ſuch a one, but becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> hath wholy concealed from us his Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Deſcent, Birth, and Death, that he might be the type of Chriſt, who was without Father, as he is Man; without Mother, as God; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deſcent, both as God and as man; having neither beginning of days as God, nor end of life, as God or as Man. But the Fathers, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, Birth, and Death of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and other High Prieſts, are exactly deſcribed by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And there were never any Popes, Biſhops, or Prieſts, whoſe Parents, Birth, and Death, were not known, and conſequently they cannot be after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi> Thirdly, The Apoſtle adds, that <hi>Melchiſedec being made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Prieſt for ever;</hi> becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> makes no mention of his death, nor of any one that ſucceeded him in his Prieſtly office; that ſo he might be the type of Jeſus Chriſt, who never left his Prieſtly office, but will exerciſe it until the end of the World, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ding for thoſe that are his, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his ſacrifice to God the Father conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. As for <hi>Aaron</hi> and other Prieſts, they are dead, and have had ſucceſſors. And the Popes, Biſhops, and Prieſts, die daily, and have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59620:80"/>
ſucceſſors; and conſequently are not after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi> Fourthly, The Apoſtle ſaith likewiſe, that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> took tithes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and adds that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> bleſſed him that had the Promiſes, <hi>viz. Abraham,</hi> and that the leſs is bleſſed of the greater. Whence it appears that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> having taken tithes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bleſſed him, and <hi>Levi,</hi> and all the Prieſts in his perſon, was more excellent then <hi>Abraham, Levi,</hi> and all the Prieſts. In which reſpect he was a type of Jeſus Chriſt, who was infinitely more excellent then <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his ſucceſſors, becauſe he in whom all the promiſes were fulfilled, muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more excellent then he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them only. But I do not believe that the Prieſts of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church are ſo bold as to prefer themſelves before <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, in whoſe ſeed all the Nations of the Earth are bleſſed; and conſequently are not after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi> Fifthly; The Apoſtle never ſpake of the ſacrifice of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec,</hi> ſo far was he from comparing it with the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, as being like it, or with that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as being unlike it; ſo that all that our Adverſaries ſay of it, is nothing elſe but meer humane invention.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. I conclude my anſwer with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Jeſus Chriſt hath offered no ſacrifice but
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59620:80"/>
after the order whereof he was eſtabliſhed a Prieſt. But he was eſtabliſhed a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> only, as the Apoſtle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. Therefore he hath offered no ſacrifice but after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec:</hi> But (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors) there is no other ſacrifice after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> but that of the Maſs: Therefore (according to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Doctors) Jeſus Chriſt hath offered no other ſacrifice, but that of the Maſs. And ſeeing (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them) the ſacrifice of the Maſs is an unbloudy ſacrifice, it follows that Jeſus Chriſt hath offered no other ſacrifice, but an unbloudy ſacrifice; and conſequently he hath not offered a bloudy ſacrifice on the Croſs, which is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy.</p>
