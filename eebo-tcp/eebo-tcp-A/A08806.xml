            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Euery beggars plea is; if you knew my miſerie and neceſſity, you would relieue me, and ſhew me mercy.</p>
               <p>For many complaine without cauſe, and pretend more want then they feele: but we goe to God as to one that knoweth what we want, who hauing commanded vs to ſeeke, and aske, and knocke, wee cannot hope to haue our wants ſupplied by any other way, then by his reliefe of vs.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in the dedication of his houſe of praier to God, doth not begge that God would giue vs what we want, but by the way of petition, and ſo his praier runneth: for though he charge God with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Dauid</hi> his father, concerning the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of his throne; yet he asketh it of God by ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and deſireth that promiſe to bee giuen to his praiers.</p>

               <p>Our anſwer is, that the example of Chriſt is cleere,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sol.</hi>
                  </note> both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 For praying for thoſe things which he knew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God to be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For praying againſt thoſe things which hee alſo knew appointed by God to be done. And if Chriſt ſhould not haue praied in theſe caſes, hee ſhould neuer haue praied.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He knew that God had giuen him a light for the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Iſ. 46.1. Pſal. 2.8.</note> and yet God the Father biddeth him to aske this of him by prayer. And though Chriſt knew that he came into the world to ſuffer and lay downe his life for his Church, and he told his Diſciples in the way to Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold wee goe vp to Ieruſalem, and the ſonne of man ſhall be deliuered, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet hee praied three times in the Garden, that if it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26138:7"/>
were poſſible that cup might paſſe from him, that hee might not drinke of it: the reaſon whereof is this.</p>
               <p>For the puniſhment which hee did willingly ſuffer as our mediatour, he did wiſely decline as man, who may lawfully pray, <hi>Libera nos a malo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſts prayer is exemplarie to vs, and tels vs that for all good things, ſupplication againſt all euill deprecation, is ſo neceſſary, that in both we muſt reſort to God. Let no man alledge the conſtant will of God by no meanes to be ſwerued, as an euaſion from praier; for the will of God is reuealed, that he will be ſought by prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2 A further vſe of praier for maintenance of our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance with God: nothing draweth vs nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to him, that putteth vs in his ſight, in his eare, and abſtracteth vs from the world, euen from our ſelues in an holy rapture.<note place="margin">Iſ. 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Come, ſaith the Lord, let vs reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>: then God and wee reaſon together, when hee ſpeaketh to vs in his word, wee to him in our prayer: and that was another reaſon why our Sauiour did pray often, and all the Saints of God delight in praier aboue all other exerciſes of religion for the conuerſation with God.</p>
               <p>The way of religion, and holy obedience, is called <hi>walking with God,</hi> and as they that walke together doe commonly comfort the way, and paſſe the time of their iourney in conference, ſo doe the faithfull conferre and talke with God.</p>
               <p>It is a great eaſe of the heart to open our griefes to one that can and will comfort, to reueale our ignorance to one that can informe vs aright; our wants to one that can ſupply vs. The intereſt that we haue in the loue of ou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And being now at the right hand of God, he maketh interceſſion for vs, for wee are his care, and hee careth for vs.</p>
               <p>Concerning the place where he praied,<note place="margin">3 Note.</note> it is not here named, neither needed it, for all places are oratories for priuate praier; the Lyons denne is <hi>Daniels</hi> Chappell, the belly of the Whale <hi>Ionahs.

               <p>Euery man had a god to whom he might flye in time of need and danger, and in that extremitie, to that god euery man directed his prayer; therefore the Diſciples could not be ignorant of this duty, which is a leſſon taught in the ſchoole of nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The practiſe of the Church taught them the vſe of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:26138:11"/>
prayer, there was <hi>Domus orationis,</hi> and men vſually went vp thither to pray. The Scribes and Phariſes were great examples of frequent, of long prayers.</p>
               <p>Neither can I ſuſpect theſe Diſciples ſtrangers to the better examples of the holy men and women of forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, whoſe holy deuotion and worſhip of God, thoſe Bookes of Scripture which then were read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely in their Synagogues, did ſufficiently declare.</p>
               <p>But all this is helped, and their affections be now by Chriſts example ſtirred to apprehend the neceſſity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more then before.</p>
               <p>Examples be of great vſe in this kinde.</p>
               <p>Beloued, this is a neceſſary point to be taught and beleeued: whoſoeuer ſhall deſire to be inſtructed in the doctrine of prayer, let him be firſt perſwaded of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this duty.</p>
               <p>Two things doe make this duty of prayer neceſſary in the Church, and amongſt the holy ſeruants of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The ordinance of God who hath commanded it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Our owne neceſſities, which are no other way to be relieued.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Concerning Gods ordinance.</p>
               <p>We finde it often commanded in Scripture in direct termes, and it is implied in the two great Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law; for not onely obedience is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein, but all thoſe holy duties alſo by which our obedience may be any waies furthered, and that giues great place in the precept to prayer, ſeeing that is the chiefeſt meanes by which we doe obtaine that ability by which the law of God is in any meaſure fulfilled.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is a note of the faithfull, that they be <hi>viri orationum,</hi> and where God giueth his ſpirit, there is prayer, for his is a ſpirit of grace and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:26138:11"/>Vnder the name of prayer is comprehended the whole duty of Chriſtian religion: for the Apoſtle ſaith,

               </p>
               <p>Which words are taken from the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioel 2.32.</note> as the margent of the Bibles directeth you.<note place="margin">Act. 2.21.</note> And it is vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged alſo by the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> And the Apoſtle doth well declare that prayer is the chiefe part of Gods worſhip by that gradation: for no man praieth aright, but he that beleeueth, and none beleeueth, but hee that hath heard, and none can heare without a Preacher, none can Preach, except he be ſent.</p>
               <p>In which gradation you may obſerue the whole worke of mans guiding to ſaluation is accompliſhed in prayer. For, firſt God ſendeth his Miniſter to Preach his word to his Church, he is not diſobedient to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly calling, but goeth on the errand of God, and preacheth in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The faithfull heare the word from him, faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by this hearing, and doth bring forth this ripe fruit of inuocation, ſo that the worke of meanes is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate in prayer, and ſaluation followeth, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth prayer the ſumme of Chriſtian duty, and to ſtand there for the whole exerciſe and practiſe of religion.</p>
               <p>In the contrary, <hi>Dauid</hi> deſcribing the vngodly by many notes, doth conclude with this, as the laſt and ſtrongeſt proofe to conuince them of vngodlineſſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon on Gods part is, for by prayer God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured: This declareth him to be God, when the eyes of all things looke vp to him, when wee ſeeke his face, and confeſſe him the onely giuer of euery good and perfect gift, this is a ſacrifice of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>With ſuch ſacrifices GOD is pleaſed, ſo that our

               </p>
               <p>And to encourage the ſeruice, hee directeth vs both in the matter and forme of praier, and in the way and meanes to the Father in his name, and he fortifieth the precept with full and gratious promiſes made to them that doe pray to him.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtles doe ſo much vrge this duty: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to pray continually, to put our whole ſtrength to prayer. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> vrgeth the ſame precept, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that wiſedome is obtained by prayer, and declareth what it is that makes many prayers miſcarry, when we aske amiſſe: But the feruent prayers of the iuſt doe ſpeed alwaies.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another matter that neceſſitateth the duty of prayer is, that God hath left vs no other reuealed meanes to obtaine ſupply of our wants, but by prayer; inſomuch as what God hath directly promiſed to vs, yet hee requireth vs to demand this of him by prayer, whether it be for giuing vs good things, or for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euill from vs.</p>

               <p n="1">1 God beſtoweth his gifts as a faithfull Creator, and ſo he is conſeruer of his creatures by a generall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and thus he letteth his Sunne ſhine, and his raine fall vpon the iuſt and vniuſt; thus he openeth his hand, and filleth all things with plenty.</p>
               <p n="2">2 God beſtoweth other fauours as a mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and with thoſe fauours, his bleſſing goeth forth, and paſſeth vpon them onely that feare him: for ſeeing he hath ordained Chriſt his Sonne to be the way of his bleſſing, all the benefits that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth on man without the mediation of Ieſus Chriſt, doe come without his bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The vngodly of the earth doe receiue many of Gods common gifts, but not by the way of grace, therefore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26138:13"/>
they are without his bleſſing, ſo that we cannot eſteeme the owners thereof rich: ſeeing the bleſsing of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth man truely rich.</p>
               <p>But whatſoeuer the vngodly poſſeſſe, is to them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified; therefore let not our eye be ſet vpon that which they haue and enioy, to enuy their proſperity, rather let vs conſider the want of Gods bleſsing, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their miſerie, and let Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teach vs that</p>
               <p>The good things which God beſtoweth on his deare children, are ſanctified by the word of God, and by prayer.</p>
               <p>Thus the gifts of God are made bleſsings to vs, &amp; the holy Ghoſt hath an hand in the diſpenſation of them to Gods glory in vs, &amp; the aduancement of our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The difference betweene theſe two receiuers, doth appeare to vs,
<list>
                     <item>1 In the effect that theſe gifts worke in them.</item>
                     <item>2 In the vſe to which they are applied.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 For the effect.</p>
               <p>Where God for Chriſts ſake doth beſtow, and wee doe receiue good things from him, there followeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, which euer accompanieth godlineſſe: but the vngodly man is neuer ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the vſe.</p>
               <p>The iuſt man applieth all the gifts of God to three ends.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To the glory of God, for he vſeth the gifts of God as the faculties of well doing, <hi>whether ye eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 To the good of our neighbour, for that is the law, <hi>proximum tuum vt teipſum,</hi> ſo that in the Church of God there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and both our ſpirituall and temporall gifts doe by communion of charity ſo participate themſelues to our brethren and ſiſters, as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26138:13"/>
the ſtomach in the body, receiueth in nouriſhing food, not for it ſelfe onely, though into it ſelfe firſt, but for the good of the whole body.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe the end of our creation was not for this life, and we haue here no abiding city, therefore the faithfull doe apply all the gifts of God, as helpes to the proſecution of eternall life, whereas the vngodly finde them impediments to them: the cauſe is, for they make them the end of their labours, and fixe their hearts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of the neceſſity of prayer is thus clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Commandement by which it is impoſed, and from our neceſſities no other way to be relieued.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the next place. I obſerued in thoſe Diſciples, that they found themſelues not well inſtructed in that ſeruice of God, and therefore deſire to be taught.</p>
               <p>And this is a common defect, for although by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſtinct we know that good things are ſought by prayer, and the wants and griefes which we doe feele, will eaſily breake forth into words, yet the Apoſtle ſaith,
<q>Wee know not what wee ſhould pray for as we ought.<note place="margin">

               <p>But becauſe this motion doth ariſe from a ſenſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in themſelues, <hi>we know not,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Then of that ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Euery man hath this defect, for fleſh and bloud is not wiſe enough to pray, prayer is the worke of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirit then that which enliues and actuates our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, it is the worke of the holy Ghoſt: the ſame ſpirit that is the ſpirit of grace, is alſo the ſpirit of ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:26138:14"/>But euery man doth not feele this defect, for many doe ouerweene their ability this way, and deſpiſe the helpe of all ſet prayers, and take vpon them to be able without any other directions, to tell their owne tales to God Almighty, and vpon this ability which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in themſelues, for this ſeruice they doe neglect the publique meetings of our Church to our common prayers.</p>
               <p>I iudge not their ſufficiencie that way, but I muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh you that you doe miſtruſt it euery man in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo farre, as to put all the feare and holy reuerence you can to this worke.</p>
               <p>For if we be carefull in petitions to great perſonages, and Princes, to weigh our words, and to aduiſe with our beſt care, both what and how we deſire.</p>
               <p>This holy ſeruice of God which is ſo maine a part of Gods worſhip, cannot bee vndertaken with too much feare and reuerence, wee cannot come too prepared to this conference with our God.</p>

               <p>A neceſſary point to be learned, for our deſires doe affect many things which we may not aske of God by prayer; <hi>petimus quae appetimus. Solomon</hi> had the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace ſet wide open to him, and commanded to aske what he would of God: he asked wiſdome, which God took ſo well, that with wiſdome he gaue him other things in abundance, heare the word of God to him.</p>

               <p>Theſe bee things that euery man would faine haue, long life, and riches to accommodate that life withall, that our heart deſireth; and all our enemies out of the way, that we might haue nothing to croſſe vs.</p>

               <p>And our Sauiour Chriſt when hee anſwereth this their requeſt, doth briefely comprehend in a ſhort prayer that ſame <hi>ſummam petendorum,</hi> which both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth vs what, and limiteth vs how farre wee may aske of the father in his name.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Prayer is called the calling vpon the name of the Lord; and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>holy and reuerent is his name.</hi> The old law amongſt the heathen for their homely gods, was <hi>Deos caſtè adeunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is in God greatneſſe, which filleth vs with feare; and goodneſſe, which filleth vs with hope; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reuerence that we muſt bring with vs to prayer, muſt be a mixt compoſition of the heart, partly put on with hope, and partly ſtopped with feare, for all feare will keep vs away from God, and all hope will make vs too bold when we come to him.</p>
               <p>To this muſt be added to expreſſe this,<note place="margin">2 Outward.</note> outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence; for the body muſt not ſit out in this holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, that is the temple of the holy ghoſt, euery whit

               <p>But ordinarily, the proſtration of the body, or geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, the lifting vp of the eyes, and hands, haue beene the expreſſions of prayer in great examples.</p>
               <p>And the conſideration of the great and high Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of God may well ſtoope vs to theſe reuerend formes, which ought not to be forborne, where with conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they may be vſed, for God challengeth it as a part of his honour. <hi>To mee, ſhall euery knee bow,</hi> and he giues it in reward to his ſonne, that at his name, euery knee ſhall bow, and euery tongue ſhall confeſſe to him.</p>

               <p>It is noted in the beſt example of all, that Chriſt in the daies of his fleſh offered vp his prayers and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to his Father with ſtrong cries and teares; the Euangeliſt addeth, with ſweat trickling downe his face, of water and bloud, which was like the plague of fire mingled with haile amongſt the Egyptians: for that ſhower of water and bloud which Chriſt wept from his agonized body, did lay and calme the ſtorme of Gods indignation againſt ſinne, and did burne vp, and drown the proud Prince of darkeneſſe, that he was neuer able to preuaile againſt the Church, and death was ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp in victory.</p>
               <p>The greateſt prayer is that holy fire with which the Church fighteth againſt Sathan, and therefore feruent prayer is by Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> called <hi>Deo ſacrificium, oranti ſubſidium, daemonibus flagellum.</hi>

               <p>A poore deuice to legitimate their vaine traditions and humane inuentions, by comparing them with thoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26138:24"/>
omiſſions of ſtorie which yet are verified to vs in the way of Apoſtolical doctrine recorded in holy Scripture.

                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> though he had the holy Ghoſt, yet it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by meaſure, but in Chriſt, the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelt bodily: <hi>Iohn</hi> was in his time <hi>Lucerna ardens,</hi> when the Sunne of righteouſneſſe aroſe vpon the Church, Chriſt Ieſus: <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue warning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe</hi>: therefore the prayer that <hi>Iohn</hi> taught his Diſciples, gaue place to Chriſts prayer, as <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe did giue place to Chriſt. But the fidelitie of <hi>Iohn</hi> is notable, for hee omitted no neceſſarie doctrine to informe the vnderſtanding, and to direct the holy practiſe of his Diſciples: therefore comming now to a fuller veſſell, euen a liuing fountaine of grace and wiſedome, they deſire no longer to drinke at the Ciſterne, but to repleniſh themſelues at the Well head.</p>
               <p>But the argument is effectuall, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> omitted not that care of teaching his Diſciples to pray, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might boldly claime that inſtruction alſo from him their Maſter, whoſe ſhooe latchet, <hi>Iohn</hi> was not worthy to looſe.</p>

               <p>The principall points of our doctrine are, what wee muſt beleeue, what wee muſt doe, and what wee muſt pray for. The doctrine of faith, the doctrine of good life, and the doctrine of prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> taught all theſe: for,
<list>
                     <item>1 He preached Chriſt to them, the ground of faith.</item>
                     <item>2 He exhorted them to repentance, and good life.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>His example is our direction in all theſe things.</p>
               <p>You alſo haue two leſſons from hence.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To ſtirre vp your ſelues by the example of other Diſciples, and other congregations to doe the like: if you heare of their diligence in hearing, and their profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie in learning the duties of Gods worſhip, let their <hi>ſicut,</hi> their good example inflame you with holy emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make as good a progreſſion in knowledge and piety, as they haue made.</p>
               <p>For why ſhould other congregations outlearne you in theſe neceſſarie duties: doe not you thinke that God will require his good ſeed of the word ſowne in you, and examine what you haue done with it?</p>
               <p n="2">2 You are further to be moued to an holy emulation of Gods graces in your ſelues, to contend with your ſelues, to increaſe your knowledge, &amp; adde ſtrength and growth to your iudgement, that you may outgrow your owne infancy and minority in that ſpirituall vegetation which is called <hi>incrementum Dei</hi>: ſo <hi>Andrew</hi> that had learned of <hi>Iohn,</hi> comes now to be taught of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 You haue a faire example to require inſtruction at the hands of them who haue the ouerſight of you: you may ſay to that <hi>Archippus,</hi> as the Diſciples of Chriſt did to Chriſt, <hi>teach vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Iohn taught his Diſciples:</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:26138:25"/>
that is, you may ſtirre vp your Miniſter to teach and inſtruct you, as other faithfull and conſcionable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word doe inſtruct their congregations. The Apoſtle biddeth the Coloſſians ſay to <hi>Archippus, Take heed to the miniſtery which thou haſt receiued in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You haue the ſame right to his labours in his calling, as he hath to the tithes of your labours. Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples put him to it to teach them: and let all people doe the like to their miniſter.</p>

                  <p>So that they which pretend they cannot pray, haue no excuſe, for they know where they may be taught, euen in this, it is but aske, and it ſhall be giuen to you.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Iohn</hi> taught his Diſciples to pray, how much more and ſooner will Chriſt teach thoſe that come to him?

                  <p>Chriſt is now ſitting at the right hand of his father, but this record of his anſwere to direct vs in prayer, liues in this book of the eternall goſpell, here wee may haue it at a ſhort warning, and though <hi>Iohns</hi> prayer be loſt, and no monument left of it; yet this holy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection contained in his anſwere to his diſciples, ſhall remaine, and what he ſaith to them, hee ſaith to all that haue the ſame deſire and affection to learne to pray. <hi>When you pray, ſay, Our father, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26138:26"/>
wrong the good meaning of our Sauiour.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 If wee thinke this ſo preciſe a direction for prayer, as that we may neuer vſe any other words but theſe in prayer, but that all our prayers muſt be <hi>totidem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> for, that that is not our Sauiours meaning, is plain in the doctrine of prayer deliuered by our Sauiour in the ſermon which he preached on the mount: where hee ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, pray on this manner, or to this purpoſe, according to theſe inſtructions in this forme contained.</p>
                  <p>For I muſt informe you that the preciſe frame of the prayer for the words thereof is not punctually the ſame in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> which ſhewes that there is no necſſitation of the Church obliging it to the words thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another miſtake is on the contrary hand, when we quite forſake the words which Chriſt himſelfe hath put into our mouthes, and eſteeme this prayer but as a coppy to write after, a mould to make prayers by, and not a prayer it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>This error hath put it ſelfe in print, and ſome of our noueliſts haue taken vpon them to ſhew reaſon why this ſhould neuer be vſed for a prayer.</p>
                  <p>His late Maieſty of worthy memory, giues a quick touch of this erroneous fancy in his learned and godly expoſition of the Lords prayer; for he ſaith, that the Browniſts, the authors of this opinion, doe approue this prayer for a ſamplar to make prayers by, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it for a prayer, becauſe they hold all ſet formes of prayer vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p>His Maieſty ſaith well that they like, praying by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant, and not by plaineſong, by commentary, but not by text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 One reaſon againſt the vſe of this prayer, is, becauſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:26138:26"/>
it is Scripture; which were a good reaſon to iuſtifie the vſe of it, for that is the vſe of <hi>Dauids</hi> Pſalmes, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hymnes of Scripture to apply them to our occaſion.<note place="margin">Pſ. 31.6. Luc. 28.46.</note> It is Scripture, <hi>In manus tuas, Domine, commendo ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam meam</hi>: yet Chriſt vſed it for a prayer vpon the croſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They alledge that prayer muſt expreſſe our wants to God in particular, but the Lords prayer is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                  <p>Our anſwer is, that both in generall and in particular we muſt pray to God, and therefore our larger prayers doe referre themſelues to the generall heads of this prayer, and this concludeth them all, and this prayer is full, euen in particular petitions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They plead that this is not to be vſed for a prayer, becauſe it is but the patterne by which prayers are to be made; which we anſwere thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is vntrue that this is onely a patterne to make prayers by, it is a prayer alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is no good conſequence, becauſe it is a patterne, therefore it is not a prayer, for it is plaine that it is both, and it is a ſinne againſt holy Scripture to abridge the full vſe of it.</p>
                  <p>We alleadge for the vſe of it</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The plaine precept of our Sauiour: <hi>Pray, Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> not thus only, but this: and ſo long as wee doe what he commandeth, we cannot doe amiſſe:</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The excellency of it from the author, for it was dictated from Chriſt himſelfe, who beſt knoweth how to direct, and is beſt acquainted with the ſtile of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 The excellency of it for vſe, being a ſhort, and compendious compoſition, eaſie to be remembred, and repeated.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The excellency of it for perſpicuity and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being eaſie to ſuch as deſire to informe themſelues what and how to pray.</p>

                  <p>So I hope I haue ſatisfied you in the point of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to vſe theſe very words in prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I muſt adde yet another rub in our way before I come to the words of the prayer.

                  <p n="3">3 The Letany contai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth a full expoſition of the Lords prayer, beeing the moſt diuine compoſition that euer the ſanctified heart of man compoſed, beſides the holy canonicall Scripture, fit for all times, for all perſons, and therefore wee conclude that with the Lords prayer, as the Well head from whence euery drop of it deriued it ſelfe.</p>

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:26138:28"/>It is alſo appointed to be repeated before the tenne Commandements, as a preparatiue to the hearing of the law of God, that we may ſeeke from God all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie graces both ſpirituall and temporall, whereby we are inabled to the faithfull keeping of the law in affection, and holy obedience.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that if wee doe but onely ſay ouer the words of this praier, and doe not zealouſly apply it to theſe occaſions, it is a vaine lip-labour, and God is much diſhonoured in it: therefore doe but wiſely conſider the holy vſe that may be made of it, and Gods ſeruice ſhall be much aduanced in the reuerend vſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon for the frequent vſe of this praier, is in reſpect of the full contents of it, for it is ſo large, and extendeth it ſelfe to ſo many neceſſary graces deſired, as no mans memory can ſo ſoone preſent them to his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſend vp our petitions to God for them all, in the flames of zeale and deuotion, all at once: wee haue therefore no better way, then to frame our requeſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to euery petition, and then to returne with the ſame words to God.</p>
                  <p>But what if we repeate the ſame words to iterate the ſame petitions to God, why is it more blameable in vs then in Chriſt himſelfe,<note place="margin">Math. 26.44.</note> who in the Garden is ſaid to haue vſed three times ſeuerally the ſame words, not the ſame petition onely.</p>
                  <p>Or then in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who when Sathan buffeted him, did three times pray the ſame prayer,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12 8.</note> as hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth?</p>

                  <p>But the often repeating this prayer, or any other, made by the rule of this, or any one petition of this, is a good ſigne of that importunity which Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth in prayer, and which we finde effectuall by the euents thereof in the parable of the Widow and vniuſt Iudge,<note place="margin">Luk. 18 1.</note> and of him that borrowed loaues of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                  <p>It is a rule of charitie to make the beſt conſtruction we can of any thing that is done or ſaid by our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and therefore in the directions of the holy Church, of which we are members and parts, and into which by our Baptiſme, we are admitted, it is both piety and charity to make the beſt of all, and not to abuſe our wit to finde faults: we are very happy in this, that God hath by his owne Sonne taught vs both what good things to aske of God, and in what fit words; and I dare preſſe the frequent vſe hereof vpon warrant of this plain and cleare text: <hi>Quando oratis, dicite; quandocunque oratis,</hi>

prayer from an old Poet:
<q>Iuppiter rex, optima nobis, &amp; vouentibus &amp; non vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentibus tribue, mala autem poſcentibus quoque abeſſe iube.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we may ſay of Chriſt; hee hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, what thou maiſt boldly aske by faith: he hath drawne thy petition himſelfe, and puts thee on vpon thy ſuit, that thou ſhalt neither goe on thine owne head, nor in thine owne name, <hi>ne pecces lingua tua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will yet adde one note, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>when ye pray,</hi> as putting it for granted, that you thinke vpon it as a neceſſary duty, that you reſolue vpon it as a fit ſeruice of God to pray.</p>
                  <p>So when you Faſt, ſaith hee, doe thus, as ſuppoſing that you will finde times for theſe things; if you make no conſcience of prayer, this direction is of no vſe to you.</p>
                  <p>To pray, you haue heard is an holy ſerious act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a principall part of Gods worſhip, when you really doe that, ſay thus, if it be but ſaying of prayers, as good let it alone.</p>
                  <p>It is to no purpoſe to teach men how to pray, that haue no meaning or purpoſe to pray: neither is it to any purpoſe to teach them the way to heauen, that ſet their faces not to Ieruſalem, but to Babylon.</p>
                  <p>It is a great fault in them that doe not pray, and yet ſay, <hi>Our father,</hi> as all they doe, whoſe tongues repeat the words, and yet neither their vnderſtandings are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, either in the matter or order of the petitions, nor their affections once moued at any thing they ſay.</p>
                  <p>This is a direction for none but ſuch as deſire to learne it, for none but ſuch as deſire to make vſe of it; that is, for ſuch as would poure ſorth their hearts, and open
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26138:30"/>
their deſires to God.</p>
                  <p>When you meane to doe ſo, you may either vſe theſe very words, or you may frame your petitions in this order, or if you haue any one of theſe petitions alone to ſollicite God in, this may be your rule and direction.</p>
                  <p>I muſt therefore call vpon you to pray, and in your prayer to follow this holy direction, and to make you more able for it, I haue vndertaken to interpret this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer to you, wherein you ſhall ſee what you may aske, and you muſt keepe you ſo preciſely to this rule as not to dare to aske any thing elſe: for Chriſt would not ſay, when you pray, ſay <hi>Our father,</hi> but that he meaneth to giue you a full inſtruction, and to ſet you in a good and perfect way of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoeuer you aske more then this, or beſide this, is ſinne, and prouoketh God againſt you.</p>

                  <p>His words are plaine, the Angell that redeemed him
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:26138:33"/>
from all euill, and will it not fall out to be the ſame God that fedde him in the former verſe.</p>
                  <p>In very grammaticall conſtruction, if he ſpake of two perſons, God Almighty in the firſt, and a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell in the ſecond place, he would, he muſt haue ſaid in the plurall, <hi>benedicant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore many learned iudgements haue vnderſtood this Angell to be Chriſt Ieſus, who onely is called the Redeemer, and deliuerer of his Church from all euill.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we ſay to the Church of Rome, let them direct their praiers to him onely that ſaueth and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from all euill, and wee will pray with them, and that Angell we will worſhip with all holy worſhip.</p>

                  <p>True it is that when the Biſhop of Rome was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe Biſhop, and maintained the Apoſtolicall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the true Church: he was called <hi>Pappa</hi> or <hi>Papa,</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the Greeke word which is <hi>Pater.</hi> And ſo it was not a proper title to the Biſhop of Rome, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Biſhops, as at this day the name of Father is giuen to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:26138:46"/>But this vnlimited claime to the name in chiefe ouer all, not onely the lay people, but the very Clergie of the whole Church, he hath rather purchaſed with S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſword, then with S. <hi>Peters</hi> keyes.</p>
                  <p>But he holdeth it now with that abſolute right to it, that none can be a member of the true Church, but he muſt be his ſonne.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth, in his letters lately ſent from Rome, to our then moſt excellent Prince, reſiding for the time in the Court of Spaine, doth thus court his Highneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truely the armes of papall charity, with ſighes, doe worſhip the God of mercy, and doe ſtretch them forth for your ſafety to embrace you a moſt deſired ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> I cannot blame him, for when the Kings and Princes of England were popiſh, his Holineſſe had his coffers much the fuller for it, and his Kitchin was the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided.</p>
                  <p>But one thing I note in that letter, that this <hi>Gregorie,</hi> the then Pope, doth confeſſe himſelfe modeſtly, farre inferiour to <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, whoſe name he aſſumed at his Coronation, in ſanctitie and vertue, although equall in dignity, and of the ſame name.</p>
                  <p>I wonder that he ſhould be ſo open, as to confeſſe a ſucceſſion in dignity, and not in ſanctity, in ſeate, and not in vertue, for this makes it no argument, which yet is falſely vrged, and his Holineſſe forſakes the truth in it. He affirmeth that <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, did firſt by his apoſtolique authority bring the Goſpell into this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>And inferreth, that he being his ſucceſſor, and equall in name and dignity, though inferiour to him in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vertue, ſhould follow his footſteps in reſtoring the goſpell to this land againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:26138:46"/>But the aſſertion of <hi>Gregories</hi> firſt plantation of the Goſpell in England, is moſt falſe: for <hi>Parſons</hi> in his Booke of the three conuerſions of England to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, doth make that of <hi>Gregory,</hi> the third, and not the firſt conuerſion.</p>
                  <p>But were it true, the argument followeth not, that hee who now carrieth his name, but is inferiour to him in holineſſe and vertue, ſhould haue the ſame power, or hope to worke the ſame effect that hee did; for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of God, in the conuerſion of ſoules, doe not worke by name and dignity, but by ſanctitie and vertue.</p>
                  <p>And euen herein this <hi>Gregory</hi> that then vſurped the Church Monarchie, is inferiour to <hi>Gregory</hi> the great in holineſſe and vertue, becauſe <hi>Gregory</hi> the great did not onely abſtaine from the name of vniuerſall Biſhop, and the common Father of the Church, but he wrote moſt inuectiuely againſt it.</p>
                  <p>For he wrote an angry reprehenſion to <hi>Eulogius,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Alexandria, for ſtiling himſelfe vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>Iohn,</hi> Patriarch of Conſtantinople, vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that vndue title, he wrote to him to rebuke it; hee called it <hi>nefandum, ſtultum, ſuperbum vocabulum</hi>; he ſaith that the Councell of Chalcedon offered his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours at Rome, that title, <hi>ſed tame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nullus ſibi hoc teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nomen arripuit.</hi> But now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath charged the late Kings Maieſtie, with denyall of the faith, becauſe he ſuppoſeth that in the oath of alleageance, he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Pope the title of ſupreame Father of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I had not diuerted thus farre to the Popes vſurpation of this honour of <hi>Our Father,</hi> but that the times grow ſicke of a ſurfer of light and truth, and beginne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and propend to apoſtacie, that the God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies grows impatient thereof, and by admirable iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudgement

                  <p n="2">2 We muſt conſider who they be that ſuffer, theſe are brethren with vs according to the fleſh, here our bowels yearne, and we haue cauſe to mourne and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on their behalfe for their ſinnes, that deſerued this iudiciall proceſſe againſt them.</p>
                  <p>He that hath a chriſtall glaſſe in his hand, into which his enemie hath infuſed poiſon to deſtroy him, and ſeeth the glaſſe broken in his hand, diſcouereth the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his life, by that breaking, may he not at the ſame time be glad that the poiſon is ſpilt, and ſorry that ſo good a glaſſe is broken.

                  <p>Our elements of which we are compoſed in the frame of our bodies, are mixt, and not pure and ſimple bodies: the affections that are in the inferiour part of the ſoule, are alſo mixt, for our beſt courage is ſhaken with ſome feare, our hope, mingled with ſome doubt, our ioy commedled with ſorrow, that in the very ſeruice of God we reioyce with trembling.</p>
                  <p>In our intellectuall part, our vnderſtanding is not cleare of clouds: in our ſpirituall and diuine inſpirations by the holy ghoſt, there is <hi>aliquid carnis,</hi> ſome of the naturall man that eclipſeth the light, and weakeneth the force of the holy ghoſt in vs.</p>

                  <p>The powder traitours, whoſe zeale of the religion of Rome, turned them all into gunpowder, and inflamed them to that furie and malice, as to deſtroy the peace and the Religion of this Land with one blaſt; how would they haue ioyed to haue brought forth the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe in full birth, which they had conceiued? yet the bowels of our compaſſion were moued towards them, to ſee them dye and ſuffer the iuſt reward of their moſt damnable proiection.</p>
                  <p>But the bowels of the wicked are cruell; ſhall I ſhew you the mercy of a Pope, it was <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. vpon occaſion of the murther of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. the French King, who in ioy of it, being performed treacherouſly by a Monke, ſet on by himſelfe, doth make a panegyricall oration in the praiſe of the Creatour, and admireth the excellent worke of God in it, <hi>quod ſimplex monachus non mutato habitu, nongladio, clipeoue armatus ad regem libere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrauit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not the folly of this ſonne of <hi>Belial</hi> worthy to be deſpiſed, that makes this a miracle, that a Monke vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and in his own habite, wherein no man miſtruſted him, did commit this treaſon, for ſo theſe falſe Monkes were without ſuſpition admitted to the Kings preſence; but had he changed his habite, and come armed, he had beene preuented.</p>
                  <p>He reioyceth in the Kings death, yet he was no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique, as Rome cals hereſie, but a ſonne of the Pope, and he layeth the murther to Gods charge.</p>

                     <hi>Regem Deus per ſacratum virum interfecit</hi>: the whole oration is extant in print, &amp; they are all aſhamed

of it, ſo full it is both of folly and malice.</p>
                  <p>Wee may not doe the God whom we worſhip and ſerue, that vnthankefull iniurie, to omit the late fearefull example of his iudgement, declared vpon a Popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticle aſſembled in a priuate meeting to an hereticall Sermon; they are blinde that ſee not the hand of God in it, and they that take not warning by it to auoyd the like, may tempt the iuſtice of God to ſome new execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he hath treaſures of wrath.</p>
                  <p>I thinke I ſpeake the charitable thoughts of you all: it was a iudgement much to be deplored in reſpect of them that ſuffered the ſame. So great a number preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either broken with the ruines of the houſe, or ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with the cloſeneſſe of their owne heapes one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, others wounded, ſome dead found, ſome fallen into madneſſe.</p>
                  <p>We haue cauſe all of vs to lament the ſudden violent death of ſo many, of whom we haue cauſe to perſwade our ſelues charitably, that they had the zeale of God, but not according to knowledge, and that they were made beleeue that they did God good ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>But how many open Churches did they paſſe by, how many learned Preachers might they haue heard at that time, from whoſe light they might haue borrowed light, and in whom they might haue heard Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaking to his Church, and declaring the way of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they forſooke the houſes of God to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into a chamber, where their owne weight was their ruine by the iuſt hand of God, as we muſt needes confeſſe; for his workes are often ſecret, but alwaies iuſt.</p>
                  <p>Did not the blinde leade the blinde, and both fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 I obſerue how quickly vpon the forbearance of the

                  <p n="2">2. How readie the treacherous Prieſts, who haue fallen from vs by Apoſtaſie are to confirme the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of ſuch as are gone from vs, to tempt others not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another ſpeciall obſeruation in that conuenticle, was the time when this ſuddaine deſtruction came vpon Papiſts, it was by their new computation of the yeare, in the Gregorian Calender, on their fift day of <hi>Nouember.</hi> So that God would haue them taſt of his iuſtice, with a touch and remembrance of that diſmall day which their religion had deſſigned to our ruine: now they haue their fift of <hi>Nouember</hi> as well as we, but with ſo mercifull a difference on our part, ſo iuſt a difference on their part, that when they ſhall thinke of our fift of <hi>Nouember,</hi> they may ſee their owne hand plotting miſchiefe, Gods hand detecting, and defeating it, and their fift of <hi>Nouember</hi>
will acknowledge, no hand but of Almighty God, in the whole worke of their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Their intendment forged in hell was to haue wrought vpward to blow vp all; this execution from the hand of God wrought downeward in the fall.</p>
                  <p>On our fift of <hi>Nouember,</hi> the great aſſembly of the State, which maintaine true Religions was aimed at.</p>
                  <p>On their fift of <hi>Nouember,</hi> a priuate Conuenticle, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall changelings, and ſuch as haue denied the faith of Chriſt, here rightly and ſincerely taught, were hit.</p>
                  <p>And as their day intended the ſodaine death of ſome of their owne friends, to make thoſe whom they hated more ſure;</p>
                  <p>So it is to be feared that ſome of our owne Proteſtants, ſomewhat too curious to pry, &amp; ſomewhit too daring to

                  <p>Where the Apoſtle ſheweth the vtter ceſſation of the kingdome of grace, ſwallowed vp of this kingdome of glory.</p>
                  <p>This place of the Apoſtle is notable, and containeth points of deepe conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Concerning Chriſts deliuering vp of the kingdome, we muſt know that Chriſt is King, as God and man, &amp; ſo is the head of his Church, and this kingdome hee holdeth by vertue of his office, as hee is Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, and when that worke is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the fulneſſe of his glory of the elect, then that kingdome muſt ceaſe, and be giuen vp into the hands of the Father, who gaue him the adminiſtration thereof, for the gathering together of the Saints, and for the bringing of all the elect to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When he ſaith that Chriſt ſhall deliuer vp this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to his Father, let no man conceiue that the Father was all this while out of his kingdome, and is now by the Sonne reſtored at laſt to it. For as the Pſalmiſt. <hi>The Lord is king, be the earth neuer ſo impatient, &amp; hee ſitteth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:26138:71"/>
betweene the Cherubimes.</hi> But the kingdome of God is oppoſed by ſundry enemies, and he hath committed the vengeance of his enemies to his Son, who when he hath ſubdued all the enemies of his fathers kingdome to him, then ſhall the kingdome of God appeare in ful glorie, and there ſhall be none left to oppoſe it, or to riſe againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where it is ſaid that the Sonne himſelfe, by whom all the enemies of this kingdome ſhall be ſubdued, ſhall then be ſubiect to the father: this reuealeth a double myſterie of grace to the Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the Sonne hauing finiſhed the office of his Mediatourſhip, betweene God and man, ſhall not lay downe his humanity with it, for when it is ſaid that the Sonne ſhall be ſubiect to the Father, that cannot be in reſpect of his Diuinity, for ſo he is equall to the Father, he muſt therefore continue man ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The vſe of the humanity of Chriſt retained after the accompliſhment of his office, and the deliuery vp of the kingdome of his Father, is another gratious myſtery, for he remaineth ſtill the head of the Church, and that is the knot of our vnion to the Father, for Chriſt hath a double Office.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 One of reconciling the Church to his Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another of confirming and eſtabliſhing the Church in this glory.</p>
                  <p>He drawes vs to him by his word, &amp; by his ſpirit, that he may reconcile vs, and ſo he preſenteth vs to his father without ſpot or wrinckle, and confirmeth vs in that ſtate both of fauour &amp; glory, by maintaining our vnion with him, for which he keepeth, the hypoſtaticall vnion eternally vndiſſolued.</p>
                  <p>Indeed that Hypoſtaticall vnion of the Diuine nature, with our humanity, is not compleate, in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection, till wee be one with him, as he is with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:26138:71"/>
the father, which hee prayeth for.<note place="margin">Ioh 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore the Apoſtle calleth the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, <hi>The fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all</hi>;<note place="margin">Eph. 1.23.</note> for when he hath drawen all to him, and made them one with him, as he is one with the Father, then there is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which he deſireth, and no oppoſition left to reſiſt or diſturbe it for euer.</p>
                  <p>Then the father is declared vniuerſall King, and his glory is reuealed without any Eclipſe, all the clouds which obſcured it, are remooued, &amp; all the enemies of it vtterly confounded, Then is he both reuealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>The King of glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you haue heard how many ſorts of kingdomes God hath, the next queſtion is, which of theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes we pray for, that it may come.</p>
                  <p>And here I wonder that I finde great interpreters, both ancient and moderne, at ſome difference, ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the petition of one, others of another of theſe kingdomes, but the ſolution is eaſie, and it is worke for another day to reſolue it.</p>
                  <p>To cleare this queſtion of which of theſe kingdomes this is meant,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Solution.</hi>
                     </note> one obiection is made that theſe three firſt petitions of this prayer, by conſent of moſt interpreters, are to be referred wholly to the glory of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne God onely, from whence it is concluded, that wee pray not here for the kingdome of grace by which God ruleth in his Church at large, and particularly in the ſoules and conſciences of the faithfull, for to pray ſo, is to pray for our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame is alleaged for the kingdome of glory, which God giueth to his choſen, for they ſay to pray for the comming of that, is alſo to pray for our ſelues, and for our owne future glory.</p>
                  <p>And for the firſt, which is the kingdome of Gods
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:26138:72"/>
power, by which hee ruleth the world which hee hath made, that is thought not to be here meant, becauſe that kingdome hath euer beene come, ſince God began the world, begun in the creation, and proceeding in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation and gubernation thereof.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is concluded that no other kingdome here is praied for, but the laſt of Gods full glory, when Chriſt ſhall haue ſubdued all his enemies vnder his feet, and ſhall then himſelfe be ſubiect to him, when God ſhal be all in all.</p>
                  <p>To which obiection my anſwer is, that the ground of this diſpute is falſe and fallacious, that only the glory of God is deſired in the three firſt petitions, without reſpect had at all to our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt petition when wee deſire of God, the hallowing of his name, doe we not deſire that it may be hallowed by vs? and therein we doe as well begge our owne ſanctification to that holy ſeruice, as the ſpeciall honour of Gods name; for as I haue ſhewed the name of God will be glorified in deſpight of all oppoſers, but it is ſanctified onely by ſuch as are holy.</p>
                  <p>So in this ſecond petition, we exclude not our ſelues, though we ſeeke the glory of God, we doe withall ſeeke our owne glorie in it, therfore I am not carried with the ſtrong ſtreame of our later writers, though of reuerend memorie in the Church of God, to ſhrinke vp this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to any one of theſe aboue mentioned kingdomes, but I ſhall euer in my deuotions comprehend them all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 We deſire the comming of the kingdome of Gods power, in the generall gouernment of the world, for though that kingdome be come already in part, yet it may be more declared to the world, then yet it is, and it muſt be exerciſed with the continuation of the world, yet more and more, and that we pray for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:26138:72"/>For how many nations and languages of the world yet are there, who though they doe confeſſe ſome deity whom they pretend to ſerue, yet they are not come to this knowledge to beleeue and confeſſe that <hi>The Lord is King.</hi> The comming of the Kingdome of Gods power to theſe may declare him King of kings, and Lord of Lords.</p>
                  <p>Though the Deuill could not catch the Sonne of God in this net, hee hath preuailed with many to make them beleeue that hee is the ſupreme Monarch of this world, and that all the kingdomes of the earth are at his diſpoſe, which maketh many goe to the Deuill, for the kingdomes of this world, though ſome ouer-weaning the Popes temporall power by which hee claimeth a Monarchicall ſupremacie ouer the kingdomes of all the world, haue ſought to him for ſuch high preferment.</p>
                  <p>For the Pope ſtands as ſtiffly vpon the claime of all the kingdomes ſubiection to him, as the Deuill doth. They are all giuen to me, and to whomſoeuer I will I giue them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I pray, let thy kingdome, O Lord, declare it ſelfe, and let the Deuill and the Pope both know and learne the leſſon which thou taughteſt proud <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar,</hi> that,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.32.</note> 
                     <hi>The moſt high ruleth in the kingdome of men, and giueth it to whomſoeuer he will.</hi> Let all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth know, that theſe two great impoſtors, the Deuill &amp; the Pope do gull their credulous <hi>deuotoes,</hi> for neither of them hath any thing to doe with the kingdomes of the world, God hath reſerued that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie of right in <hi>regno potentiae ejus.</hi>

                  <p>That when wiſdome preacheth they may not walke as fooles; when truth preacheth, they may not belieue lies; when faith preacheth, they may not liue in infidelity; when holineſſe preacheth they may not liue in all ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vncleaneſſe, walking in the way of their corrupt luſts in all abomination, to the prouoking of God to anger againſt them.</p>
                  <p>The inward meanes for the aduancing of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, here deſired, is the holy Ghoſt creating in vs new hearts, and regenerating vs to a godly life, and eſtabliſhing vs in the ſame.</p>

                  <p>I dare not with our many Engliſh Writers, vpon this Petition, quite exclude the abſolute will of God,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:26138:83"/>
and limit the Petition onely to the will reuealed in his Word, yet. I confeſſe that if it were to bee carried by voyces, the moſt of the Interpreters that I reade, goe this way.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 I feare to abate any thing of the full contents of the words, or to ſhrinke vp any of the bredth of them, ſo farre as they may be dilated to Gods glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Seeing of all hands it is agreed, that the glory of God is eſpecially aymed at in theſe three firſt petitions, which Maſter <hi>Caluine</hi> doth well call <hi>primam tabulam orationis Dominicae,</hi> hauing indeed, reference to the firſt table of the Law. I ſee that the extent of this Petition, to both the ſecret and reuealed will of God, doth beſt accompliſh that addreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Let thy abſolute and ſecret will take place in all things according to the royall dignity and high command of thy kingdome of power, and let thy will be done by vs according as thou haſt reuealed it in the lawes of thy kingdome of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 What is meant by doing this will of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The abſolute and ſecret will of God is done vpon all creatures; ſo it is ſaid of him, <hi>Hee hath done whatſoeuer he will</hi>: and ſo this Petition is a ſubmiſſion of our ſelues to the ſame will of God, both in our owne perſons, and in all things elſe whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>That when God ſhall by euents declare what his will was, we doe humbly preſent our ſelues to it, and reſt content with it, not murmuring and repining at it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God doth all things for the beſt, howſoeuer humane iudgement might conceiue ſome other way better.</p>
                  <p>There is great reaſon to make a petition of this, for many things ſucceed according to this abſolute will of God, that croſſe vs and our deſires, and we could haue
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:26138:83"/>
wiſht them otherwiſe, both our iudgements eſteeming, and our deſires affecting ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>When death taketh the husband from the wife, the father from the children, the Maſter from the familie, vpon whoſe life their maintenance and ſupportation for the neceſſaries of life depended.</p>
                  <p>When ſome ſuddaine fire in a few moments of time deuoureth the fruits of many yeares laboures, and turneth a mans whole eſtate into aſhes, that none is the better for that which periſheth,</p>
                  <p>When ſhippewrake, or the ſwallow of the ſea at once deuoureth both the liues and goods of many that might haue ſuruiued, and remained both to the generall vſe of the commonwealth, and the particular benefit of priuate eſtates.</p>
                  <p>When Theeues and Robbers ſecretly invade the goods of their neighbours, or by ſtrong hand ſtrip them out of all that they carry about them, &amp; perchance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by do either vtterly impoueriſh their eſtate in the robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or violate their bodies with ſtripes &amp; wounds to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them, or take away their liues from them,</p>
                  <p>When ſickneſſe comes and weakens the labourer that he cannot worke, and diſableth any from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his duetie either in his owne priuate, or in the common affaires of ſtate.</p>
                  <p>When a forraine enemie inuadeth our land, and layes claime to all our labours with, <hi>Haec mea ſunt, veteres mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate Coloni.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, all theſe be frequent effects of the abſolute will of God, and, coming to paſſe, wee know that God would haue it ſo, the will of God is therein reuealed, the motiues and reaſons inducing him, the vſes and ends by him intended, are to vs vnknown, they may as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, ſeeme to vs ſometimes ſtrange and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:26138:84"/>
ſeuere, but they are alwayes iuſt.</p>
                  <p>We haue no fence againſt the vexation and ſorrow of theſe ſad euents, but to reſt our ſelues vpon the will of God, and to ſay in ſubmiſſion and proſtration to it, <hi>fiat voluntas tua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this acception of the will of God, theſe words are an humble contentedneſſe with all that God doth, and they are a prayer to God to giue vs a paſſiue obedience, that we may embrace with thankefull cherefulneſſe all that God will put vs to.</p>
                  <p>This is the duety of our full ſubiection to this ſupreme Monarch, whoſe kingdome we pray for, wee know that there can be no errour or iniuſtice in his adminiſtration of this kingdom, for he doth al things by a power, that is managed with wiſedome, and ſweetned with goodneſſe and mercy, and ſeaſoned with equall iuſtice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For the doing of the will of God reuealed to vs in the holy word of God, we pray firſt that the kingdome of God may come, which is the kingdome of light by which wee ſee what is the will of God, acceptable and perfect, and then we pray to God for actiue obedience that he will giue vs grace, to doe that which is good, and which he requireth at our hands, according to his will.</p>
                  <p>We haue great need to make this arequeſt to God, for of our ſelues, as of our ſelues wee are not able to think a good thought, <hi>And there is none that doth good, no not one, all corrupt and abominable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts are onely euill continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The worſt is, ſo it is with vs, and we cannot helpe it, if to will be preſent with vs, we faile in performance of good.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ier. 10.23.</note>Holy <hi>Ieremie</hi> confeſſeth it. <hi>O Lord I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe, it is not in man that walketh to

direct his ſteppes:</hi> We haue a great example in our firſt parents, who in the ſtate of perfect nature embraced temptation, and forſooke the obedience of the reuealed will of God in one eaſie commandement.</p>
                  <p>How then can we hope, whoſe nature is corrupted with ſo many ſinnes, to maintaine any fit correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the holy will of God reuealed in ſo many great Commandements. <hi>Primam Magnum, &amp; ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſimile.</hi> Nature is now ſo ſicke of that reluctancy to this will of God, that the Law of God which ſhould be the bridle to hold vs in, is become the ſpur to put vs on into all kind of euill, as the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>The ſtrength of ſinne is the Law</hi>; So ſtrong is our weakeneſſe againſt the will of our God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nec nos obniti contrà, nec tendere tantum Sufficimus.</hi> And as <hi>Medaea</hi> ſaid,

                  </p>
                  <p>Wee ſhall ſee our ſelues beſt, in the glaſſe, the cleare Chriſtall mirrour of the holy will of God, to which he requireth our actiue obedience. For this will of his is reuealed to vs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In the 2 Tables of his Law which containeth the rule of workes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In the holy Goſpell which containeth the rule of faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For the firſt, The will of God concerning our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 This will of God beginneth at our conuerſion; wee are by nature ſtrangers and aliens from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael: therefore God calleth vpon vs for our conuerſion to him.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ezech 33.11.</note> 
                     <hi>I haue no pleaſure in the death of the, wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way and liue, Turne ye, Turne ye from your euill wayes, for why will yee die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 18.14.</note>So our Sauiour, <hi>It is not the will of your Father that is in heauen, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To declare this to be his will, he roſe early to ſend his Prophets, to his people to conuert them to him.</p>
                  <p>And our Sauiour in the Goſpell doth reſemble himſelf to that good ſhepherd that went into the wilderneſſe to ſeeke a ſtraied ſheep, to bring it backe to the flocke, &amp; to the woman that lighted a Candle and ſwept her houſe, and ſought diligently till ſhe found her loſt groat; Both of them made merry, when they found what they had loſt. Such ioy God hath in the conuerſion of a ſinner.</p>
                  <p>When a profane perſon becommeth holy, when a couetous perſon turneth liberall, when a drunkard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſober, and a glutton temperate, when a ſwearer feareth an oath, &amp; a lier loueth the truth, when a breaker of the Sabbath, is glad when it is ſayd to him, <hi>Come let vs goe vp to the houſe of the Lord,</hi> and anſwereth them, <hi>My feete ſhall ſtand in thy gates, O Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When an oppreſſor turnes mercifull, and a proud man humble, and a contentious man quiet and peaceable; this is as God would haue it, and this is ioy to the Almighty, and the Angels of heauen reioyce in it, for this is the will of God.</p>
                  <p>But in the contrarie our ſinnes doe grieue the holy one of Iſrael; grieue not the ſpirit of God, our ſinnes do ouercharge him, hee complaineth that he is like a Cart ouerladen with ſheaues.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 The will of God is our obedience to his holy lawes which he hath giuen vs, as his couenant, that in keeping of them it might goe well with vs. His owne mouth hath reuealed his will in this point.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 If we conſider our naturall infidelity, for the natural man is ſo far from beleeuing; that he hath not the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to diſcerne thoſe things which belong to the ſpirit of God, neither can hee, ſaith the Apoſtle, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned.

                  <p>This infidelitie muſt be purged, before the will of God can be done by vs, and till this be purged, the very preaching of the word, the meanes ordained by God to beget faith in vs, ſeemeth fooliſhneſſe.</p>

                  <p>That is firſt concerning the ſecret will of God, wee muſt know that it is abſolute, not to be changed by God, not to be reſiſted by man, but implicitly to be yeelded vnto, although we know it not, we beleeue it doth decree all things out of wiſedome and Counſaile, with iuſtice and goodneſſe, and all for the beſt, and when God ſhall by euents declare it to vs, wee muſt know that God is to be praiſed and thanked for it.</p>
                  <p>How therefore we muſt remember in our deuotions to referre our petitions to this abſolute will of God, ſo that our petitions muſt be with reſeruation of that will, <hi>ſaluo ſemper decreto diuino.</hi>

                  <p>Seeing this ſecret and abſolute will of God is within himſelfe, the Saints of God by a generall warrant for prayer for all things needfull, doe goe to God often for ſuch things, as in that free and abſolute will he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed not to grant: and this may be done without ſinne in the faithfull, and without preuarication of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuealed will of God.</p>
                  <p>So we pray for the peace of Ieruſalem, that is, the Church of God, when yet God may finde it fit in his wiſedome to ſend the ſword amongſt them; as we ſee in the Churches of Bohemia, both the Palatinates, and the French Proteſtants. God hath declared his will to vs in that which they haue ſuffered, and in that which as yet they endure vnder the Popiſh tyranny of thoſe Ieſuited Princes by whom the religion and truth of God is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet we pray ſtill for their deliuerance from the hand of their enemies, but neither diſliking the effects, nor doubting the wiſedome, nor quarrelling the counſell of God in this decree, but ſubmitting to it.</p>
                  <p>So we pray often for the recouerie of our brethren and ſiſters from ſickneſſe, the returne of our friends from long voyages, the proſperous ſucceſſe of our affaires: yet God hath ſometimes decreed againſt theſe, yet wee may pray without ſinne in all theſe caſes.</p>

                  <p>It is beſt left with admiration and wonder at it, with due conſideration of it, as the bittereſt cup that euer was tempered by the hand of God, not ſo much for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily paſſion, as for the inward pangs and convulſions that the ſoule of Chriſt ſuffered for the ſonnes of his Church.</p>

                  <p>Yet we may lawfully pray, reſeruing our ſubmiſſion to the will of God, that this cup tempered of purpoſe for vs, by the decree of God, may be taken from vs.</p>
                  <p>Herein we oppoſe not the abſolute will of God, but
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:26138:89"/>
we oppoſe the euill, <hi>malum poenae,</hi> which is againſt vs, and contrary to vs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 For comfort in afflictions, for Chriſt praying his Father, though he preuailed not in the maine matter of his ſuit, <hi>ad tranſitum calicis,</hi> yet he ſped another way, for in his agonie, when there was fire in his bones, which melted him that he ſwet water and bloud,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.43.</note>

                  <p>Therefore it is a blaſphemous aſſertion that one of our nouelliſts vented in print, that Chriſt did directly pray againſt the will of his Father.</p>
                  <p>This cleareth the queſtion, in my iudgement; our firſt duty is rightly to know what may concerne vs in the point of Gods abſolute and ſecret will; that is, that the abſolute will of God is, to turne all things to the beſt to them that loue him: ſo farre wee may lawfully pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which God hath ſecretly decreed to doe, that his will may bee done vpon vs for our good, and his glory.</p>
                  <p>Wee deprecate onely that euill that may corrupt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our wiſedome, faith, or patience, which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to pray againſt the will by which this euent is willed, but againſt the ſting of it.</p>
                  <p>And ſo Chriſt prayed <hi>tranſeat amaritudo calicis,</hi> but euen that with reſeruation of his fathers will, entire and vnreſiſted.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:26138:90"/>
the will of God, is holy Scripture, which Chriſt biddeth all men to ſearch, and which are profitable to make the man of God perfect, abſolutely perfect in all good workes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe the holy ghoſt hath recommended to vs with all kinde of holy indulgence, and fauour, and the bleſſed man doth exerciſe himſelfe herein day and night.</p>
                  <p>To aſſiſt this worke of knowledge of his reuealed will, as he hath opened the booke of his will to vs, the holy Bible, ſo he hath opened the dores of his houſe to vs for our meetings: and therein he hath ordained and eſtabliſhed the Euangelicall Prieſthood of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, for he ſendeth forth Miniſters of his goſpell to Preach the ſame, and he furniſheth them with his holy inſtructions, directing them what to ſay, and he giueth them their errand: then he openeth to them the dore of vtterance, that he may declare his will in their mouthes, to his Church.</p>
                  <p>Then he openeth the vnderſtandings, and moueth the affections of the hearers to receiue the word of Gods will, both in <hi>Scientiâ</hi> and in <hi>Conſcientiâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For how can the will of God be done there, where it is not knowne nor vnderſtood. Surely they had no minde to doe the will of God, that cried <hi>nolumus ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam viarum tuarum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And they that neither ſtudie holy Scriptures, nor good helpes in vſe for the vnderſtanding thereof, nor come to Church to heare there what is good, and what God requireth at their hands, or heare there without profit, not heeding or obſeruing what is taught; all theſe haue not the care nor conſcience of doing Gods will.</p>

                  <p>And that we pray here, for that God with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will would giue vs the grace of obedience to doe it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1.4.</note>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his precept is, <hi>Let patience haue her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect worke, that ye may be perfect, and entire, wanting nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the way to perfect the worke of patience, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach the Coloſſians. It is an hard leſſon, but they which will goe in the narrow way, and enter in at the ſtrait gate that <hi>leadeth to life,</hi> muſt looke for no eaſier leſſons in the ſchoole of the Croſſe.</p>

                  <p>And becauſe all affliction for the time, is grieuous and painefull, therefore when we are in paine, we pray thrice to God, that this euil may depart from vs, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did. But to be put to ſuffer long, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue vnder the croſſe, which is the doctrine of long-ſuffering

in calamities, that goeth more againſt the heart: all this is againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>But to reioyce in afflictions, to take them for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, to ſwallow them for health, and to beleeue them to be the fauours of God. Fleſh and bloud hath neuer an eare to heare of this paradoxall diuinity, yet patience hath not her worke perfect, and wanting nothing, till all theſe meete in the worke thereof.</p>
                  <p>Patience is not perfect, except it beare all that God inflicteth on vs.</p>
                  <p>It is not entire, except it beare ſo long as God ſhall thinke it meete to viſit.</p>
                  <p>It is not wanting nothing, yea it is wanting al things, if it want ioyfulneſſe, which through the bitterneſſe of the phyſicke, doth taſt the ſweetneſſe of health, and through the darke cloud of calamities, behold the cleare light of Gods countenance.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing wherein the faith of the Church is more tryed, then in ſuffering the hand of God vpon vs when hee ſmiteth vs, and in bearing the Croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Trying of our faith,</hi>

                     <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth to inuert the propoſition,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.4.</note> for hee ſaith, that <hi>patience worketh experience or tryall:</hi> they are thus reconciled.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of tryall actiuely, as it is the worke of God by afflictions, trying our faith, and ſo whileſt wee are vnder the rod of God, God maketh proofe &amp; tryall of our patience, how we can beare what he inflicteth.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of this tryall paſſiuely, as it is the experience which we haue of our ſelues, and ſo it is an effect of our patience, becauſe by bearing afflictions,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:26138:97"/>
we doe make a full proofe of our faith, for it is not faith, except it be loue alſo, and loue ſuffereth all things, and faith worketh by loue.</p>
                  <p>They alſo doe reconcile the two Apoſtles well, who ſaid, that patience and experience, <hi>mutuo ſe generant,</hi> for one is the effect of the other, as one exemplifies it well; for health is the cauſe of ſtirring and exerciſing of the body, and againe, ſtirring and exerciſing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is the cauſe of health.</p>
                  <p>And thus it is betweene hearing and faith, for hearing begetteth faith, and faith begetteth hearing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene faith and loue, for the loue of God maketh vs beleeue in him, and truſt him, and the more we beleeue, the more we loue.</p>
                  <p>This is that patience which teſtifieth of our faith: as in <hi>Iob, Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him:</hi> this declareth that wee are ſubiects of Chriſts kingdome, when the will of this King is receiued in his lawes with obedience, in his gifts with thankfulneſſe, in his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with patience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But to patience, we muſt adde perſeuerance, which is called long ſuffering; for it pleaſeth God to try the faith and patience of his ſeruants often, with ſpinning out their probation to ſome length of time, to ſee if any thing haue power ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to withdraw them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</p>
                  <p>The beſt of Gods ſeruants haue felt this an hard try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, inſomuch that <hi>Dauid</hi> often complaines, and thinks the time of his ſufferings long, and his viſitation ſharpe; and <hi>Iob,</hi> the great example of patience, <hi>for you haue heard of the patience of Iob,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, yet euen <hi>Iob</hi> felt ſome cold fits of feare, and ſome feuorous burnings of impatience, betweene whiles, though vpon better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, he came againe to himſelfe, and went on in long-ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:26138:97"/>If wee conſider wiſely either with what patience God doth beare with the many prouoking ſinnes which we commit to his diſhonour, or with how long ſuffering he expecteth our repentance and turning to him, wee ſhall the leſſe eſteeme the production of our triall: for if God ſhould in iuſt puniſhment fit ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to the dimenſion of our ſinne, wee ſhould ſuffer both much more, and much longer then we doe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing we finde our ſelues, not vnder his execution, as guilty perſons to be tortured for our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and rackt for our many rebellions, but as pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents vnder the cure of a gratious Phyſitian, who puts vs to paine to cure vs, wee haue no cauſe to complaine though affliction gall vs for the time, which wee haue deſerued, ſhould oppreſſe and confound vs for euer.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the afflictions of this life are not worthy of the glory that ſhall bee reuealed, who would refuſe foule and deepe waies to go to the crowne of glory that neuer withers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To perfect the worke of patience wee muſt adde hereunto reioycing in our tribulations.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> doth well expreſſe the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſtriuing for a mortall, and an immortall crowne of glory. Thoſe that ſtriue for a prize here on earth, haue no ioy till they come to the end of their labours, all the way to the crowne is feare, and care, and much labour and ſorrow; but to the Saints that ſtriue for that <hi>immenſum pondus gloriae, non minus iucunditatis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt ipſa certamina,</hi> and this proceedeth from that difference which is betweene the ſeruants of God, and the ſeruants of ſinne. For in the righteous, though there be a man of fleſh which ſhrinketh at the ſmart of his ſufferings, yet there is alſo a ſpirituall man, who ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth againſt the weakneſſe of nature, and ouercometh
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:26138:98"/>
it by the ſtrength of grace, and that hid man of the heart taſteth the ſweetneſſe of God in the cup of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſeeth the light of Gods countenance through the thick cloud of temporall vexations. True it is that all afflictions are iuſt puniſhments of ſinne, and they are in their nature euill, and it is vnnaturall to reioyce for them, becauſe they are againſt vs; but to reioyce in them proceedeth from a ſenſe of that diuine grace which ſweeteneth them, and maketh them wholſome to vs, for God is neare vs in the middeſt of them, as S. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſaith.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore if thou wouldeſt haue the will of God done by thee and vpon thee; thy duties are, knowledge of this will, remembrance of it, obedience to it, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in it, and this patience muſt haue a perfect worke, euen to long ſuffering of, to ioyfulneſſe in all our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

                  <head>1 Bread.</head>
                  <p>Bread, as you know, is called the ſtaffe of life, for by it the life is ſupported, reſembled therefore to the ſtaffe or pole that ſtandeth in the middeſt of a tent which ſtayeth it vp: ſo this earthly tabernacle of our body is ſupported by bread: and therefore the taking away bread from vs, is called the breaking the ſtaffe of bread.<note place="margin">Leu. 26.16. Ezek. 4. 16.5.16.</note> And ſo the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> calleth it, <hi>I will breake the ſtaffe of bread in Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon why it is ſo called I take from <hi>Dauid,</hi> who calleth it <hi>Bread which ſtrengthneth mans heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read no mention of bread till the fall of man,<note place="margin">Pſ. 104.15.</note> neither ſhould man, had he ſtaied in the ſtate of his firſt innocency, haue needed to haue tilled the ground for his food, but the earth had yeelded him fruits for his ſuſtentation without any labour, no more but take and eate, and the bleſſing of God vpon that ready proviſion ſhould haue ſupported man.</p>
                  <p>In the raine of Manna and Quailes, the moſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red food that we read of, the fauour of God to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:26138:99"/>
in the wilderneſſe then was a tange of the curſe of God, for they were to goe forth to gather the Manna and Quailes, and after they muſt dreſſe it for food; and bread is not made without preparation of the earth for the ſeed, ſemination of it in the ground, expectation of the grouth of it, and the reaping, gathering into the barne, dreſſing of it for the mill, grinding of it for the ouen, moulding and making it fit for food.</p>
                  <p>This bread I vnderſtand here meant in this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>da nobis panem.</hi> And though ſome of the ancient of fathers haue extended this name of bread to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Euchariſticall bread, of which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the bread which came downe from heauen:</hi>
yet I dare not follow them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe that I finde great Authors diuided in iudgement concerning this bread; ſome only vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſpirituall bread of our ſoules, ſuſteining them to life euerlaſting; ſome only vnderſtanding the ordinary neceſſaries of life.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt ſhew that is made for this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that it is not likely in this abſolute forme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that Chriſt would comprehend any motion for things temporall for the body, but at ſecond hand, and by way of implication, or conſequence, ſeeing</p>

                  <p>Therefore after thoſe petitions that concerne the glory of God, this is put, to teach vs to deſire life, that we may ſpend it in the worſhip and ſeruice of God, this then is <hi>Dauids</hi> prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let my ſoule liue, and it ſhall praiſe thee:</hi>

                     <hi>giue mee bread, that I may liue to ſerue thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This petition for the ſupportation of life doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue all vnreaſonable afflicting of the body, thoſe that boaſt of their faſtings, and watchings, and ſelfe-whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, as if God tooke delight in the torments and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of our fleſh, doe glory in vaine; God requireth not theſe extremities, he will haue mercy and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they that deſtroy their life in zeale of Gods glory, are called Martyrs of a fooliſh Philoſophie: <hi>felons de ſe,</hi> they wilfully demoliſh the temple in which God ſhould be praiſed, and by vnſeaſonable and vnaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble violence of mortification, they turne this bread into a ſtone, this fiſh into a ſerpent. Long life is the promiſe of God in the Law, the firſt promiſe of the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch as honour ſuperiour authority.</p>
                  <p>They that deſtroy the temple of God, them ſhall God deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Remember this ſo often as you eat bread, you aske it, and God giueth it you of purpoſe to ſtrengthen your heart, that when he ſaith, <hi>My ſonne giue me thy heart</hi>; you may not preſent him with a dwindled, withered
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:26138:105"/>
heart, weakned and infirmed with vntimely afflictions, but ſtrong and able for his ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>And make a conſcience to beſtow the ſtrength of your heart vpon him that giues you bread to ſtrengthen your hearts, that he may thinke his bread well beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for hee loueth not the ſacrifices of the leane, and lame, and blinde, and impotent of your flock; the beſt ſerues him beſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From this name of bread giuen to the neceſſaries of life, we are taught that we haue no warrant to pray to God for more then what is needfull. The ſonne of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keh</hi> doth pray againſt riches; <hi>giue mee not riches:</hi> yet many there be that ſell heauen for riches, and exchange God for Mammon, whoſe damnation ſleepeth not.</p>
                  <p>Many there be who ſtudy the back, what ſhall I put on, not now only what ſtuffe, but in what faſhion, that I may out ſhine my equals, my betters; they make I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols of their bodies, and beſtow ſuch painting, guilding, and iewelling of it, as if it were immortall, their back is their God.</p>
                  <p>Many ſtudy what they ſhall eat, all the inquiſitions of rarities and delicacies that the earth, the ayre, the ſea can afford, are congeſted into their catories and kitchins to pleaſe their various palates with change of viands, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picuriouſly ſatiating themſelues with the marrow and fatneſſe of Gods good creatures, cramming themſelues for the Deuils ſhambles, making their bellies their Gods, and delighting in their ſhame.</p>
                  <p>I deny not but God doth open his hand and giueth great abundance of all good things, crowning the yeare with his plenty, and making the earth not onely to bring forth bread to ſtrengthen the heart of man, but wine alſo to make his heart glad, and oyle to make him a chearefull countenance, for who can controll him do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:26138:105"/>
with his owne as he pleaſe, and diſpoſing of it where he will.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill I ſay I finde no warrant to aske of him any more then the needfull ſupport of life, we may not pray beyond our proportion, food neceſſary for life; for therefore do we aske bread of God: to ſhew our deſires limited to the meanes ordained by him for our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall dare to paſſe theſe bounds, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the fearefull example of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the way of their iourney toward Canaan.</p>

                  <p>Theſe ouer dainty palates that are euer longing for delicacies, may make fat bodies, but they haue leane ſoules, and when they pray beyond warrant, God may heare them, and may grant their requeſt, but they ſhall loſe by it.</p>
                  <p>There was a rich man, who liuing was richly and ſoftly arraied, delicately fed euery day, but hee that heares him pitifully complaining out of hell, for a little cold water, will ſcarce deſire to be in his coate, or to bee of his meſſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 This teacheth vs to be content with bread, and to thanke God for it, for if wee haue but ſufficient for life, we haue as much as we aske, and ſo much as Chriſt our Maſter, who teacheth vs to pray, thinkes fit to allow vs to aske of our father which art in heauen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Seeing we finde God ſo rich and plentifull as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his hand ſo wide, to giue vs more then we aske, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abundantly to ſome more, to ſome leſſe. Let not vs, like children, when wee haue any thing giuen

vs, meaſure the worth of the gift, by comparing it with that which is giuen to others, but weigh the gift in and by it ſelfe, and let vs admire and praiſe the open hand of God, who ouer-doeth our demands, and maketh our cup runne ouer.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this name of bread doth ſo limit vs to the demand onely of things neceſſarie, let me admoniſh you that there is <hi>duplex neceſsitas.</hi>

                  <p>I conceiue that this petition doth extend to both theſe, for,</p>

                  <p>When God ſhall ſeeke vs, if we bee found in him, as Chriſt is Gods, ſo ſhall we be.</p>
                  <p>Let him therefore be in our eare; God ſaith, <hi>Heare him.</hi> Let him be in our loue teſtified by obedience, <hi>If ye loue me, keepe my commandements.</hi>

                  <p>But we are admoniſhed by the Apoſtle to make our calling and election ſure: not in the decree of God, but in our owne perſwaſion. And it cannot bee ſure, except we vſe the meanes ordained to aſſure vs.</p>

                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:26138:136"/>But if wee haue truely diſcouered in our ſelues the body of ſinne, and haue opened into God in a contrite confeſſion, and haue bewailed them with teares of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feined contrition, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth <hi>Sanguine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vulnerati cordis</hi>: and haue asked God forgiueneſſe, and cried him mercy from them.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>applicatio remedij,</hi> that there is a ground for our ſaith to beleeue the pardon of them ſealed to vs, and not before.</p>
                  <p>God teſtified of <hi>Dauid</hi> that he was a man after his owne heart, yet he ſinned ſoulely; and till he had made confeſſion of his ſinne, and had deplored it penitentially, he was not abſolued from it.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt told <hi>Peter</hi> that Sathan deſired to ſift him, but he had prayed that his faith ſhould not faile him.</p>
                  <p>That did not make his threefold denyal of his Maſter, no ſinne, he knew it, and remembring himſelfe, he went forth from the place where hee had done the fault, and wept bitterly.</p>
                  <p>The rule therefore is, that</p>
                  <p>All the promiſes of God, and our faith in thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, haue reference to the holy vſe of the meanes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God, for eſtabliſhing our peace with him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the name of God, goe the way that hee hath ordained for you to walke in; follow the holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all the faithfull ſeruants of God, who haue gone to Gilead for balme, when they haue had any ſoarenes; and haue humbly proſtrated their diſeaſes before the Phyſitian, who came to comfort them that mourne, and to binde vp the broken hearted, and ſay, <hi>Domine dimitte nobis debita noſtra.</hi>

                  <p>Our Sauiour therefore teacheth vs in this petition, not to ſeeke the pardon of our owne ſinnes to God, but in the way of peace.

                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe this pardoning of wrongs done to vs, is a ſupernaturall grace, and doth teſtifie of vs, that we haue the image of God in vs, for naturally we returne euill for euill, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, one euill word, one euill worke for another.</p>

that he may be forgiuen his treſpaſſe: It concernes vs our ſelues ſo neare, as the forgiuing of our owne ſinnes doth import; for if we cannot plead our actiue pardon, we cannot deſire this paſſiue pardon; we muſt be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if we will be pardoned.

               <p>Theſe foure laſt petitions are chained together, with a coniunction copulatiue.</p>
               <p>Giue vs our daily bread, that we may liue, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs all our ſinnes paſt and preſent, that we may bee reconciled to thee.</p>

               <p>This petition doth put off both theſe, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the preuenting grace of God to ſanctifie our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and affections, ſo that temptation may not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten vpon vs.</p>
               <p>The coherence and ſcope of this petition thus clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, let vs proceed in this order.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To enquire what temptation is.</p>
               <p n="2">2 How God leadeth into it, againſt which we pray.</p>

               <p n="1">1 What temptation we pray againſt.</p>
               <p>There is a temptation whereof often mention is made
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:26138:149"/>
in Scripture, whereby God doth make tryall of the wiſedome, faith, hope and loue of his children, of their patience, and other vertues, both to make them better acquainted with themſelues, and to make vſe of their good example abroad, for confirming ſuch as are in the Church, and for recouering ſuch as are departed from the Church, and for bringing in ſuch as are without the Church.</p>
               <p>This is a fanne by which God doth diuide the chaffe from the wheate: it is the fire which purgeth the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and refineth it.</p>
               <p>God euer vſeth this for the good of his holy ones, this kinde of temptation, <hi>Aquin.</hi> deſcribeth thus, it is</p>

               <p>In which words, the Apoſtle well deſcribeth this temptation, againſt which we pray, for it conſiſteth of two parts,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Our concupiſcence draweth vs away from the rule of Gods law, and the obedience of it, as in the firſt of the Angels that ſinned, they were drawne away from that content that ſhould haue eſtabliſhed them in the liking of their high and glorious creation, by entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

an aſpiring ſublimation of themſelues to an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with God: whereas the condition of their creation ſhould haue beene a law to them, to haue repoſed them on the prouidence of their maker.</p>
               <p>So in the temptation of <hi>Euah,</hi> the Serpent began with her to queſtion the law of the forbidden fruit, and to moue doubts concerning the equity of that law.</p>
               <p>And euer ſince, our concupiſcence corrupted with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall impurity, reſiſteth the law of God ſo farre, as the law againſt ſinne doth become an occaſion of ſinning.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This concupiſcence enticeth to doe euill, for ſo the Angels being diuerted from the content in the law of their creation, were entiſed to that ſinne of rebellion, which loſt them heauen.</p>
               <p>And our Mother <hi>Euah</hi> ſeeing the fruit was faire, good to eate, and to bee deſired for the knowledge of good and euill, was enticed to eate thereof.</p>

                  <p>Sathans darts are fiery, and ſtrongly ſhot, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly aymed, the ſeruants of God haue much adoe to quench them.</p>
                  <p>When Sathan had ſuggeſted to <hi>Dauid</hi> to number the people, he propounded the matter to <hi>Ioab, Ioab</hi> diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the temptation, and diſſwaded it, ſaying to <hi>Dauid,</hi>

                  <p>This reſiſtance muſt be conſtant, for Sathan is called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the god of flyes: flyes if they be beaten off, will come on againe, ſo will Sathan, for if he be driuen off from vs once, he will not ſo giue vs ouer, but as <hi>Balak</hi> brought <hi>Balaam</hi> from place to place, to try if any where he would curſe Iſrael, ſo will Sathan doe, leaue no place, no time free from his aſſaults to doe miſchiefe.</p>

                  <p>There be two great dangers that we are yet ſubiect to after God hath in mercy forgiuen all our treſpaſſes paſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Falling into new ſinnes, for if Sathan cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt vs in one temptation, hee will aſſault vs in another; it is ſaid of him, that he hath <hi>Nomina mille, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le nocendi artes</hi>: as <hi>Dauid,</hi> though we neuer reade him againe tempted either to adultery or murther, yet hee was led into a new temptation, to number the people.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> though he neuer faulted more in denying his Maſter, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tooke him in the manner, for not walking <hi>pede recto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For our originall corruption hath in it the ſeed of all kinde of ſinnes, and many baites being at once in ſight, it is an hard eſcape to quite them all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The other danger is of relapſe, for after repentance and pardon obtained, we may fall againe into the ſame ſinne, with much more danger then before, eſpecially ſuch ſinnes as cuſtome hath aſſiduated: as a common lyar, a common ſwearer, a common drunkard, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon breaker of the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>How can we ſay that any of theſe ſinners that liue in the daily practiſe of theſe ſinnes, doe repent them, or how dare they ſay, <hi>Leade vs not into temptation,</hi> when they loue the workes they doe ſo well, as not to part with them.</p>
                  <p>Relapſes haue ſo ſmall comfort in holy Scripture, as it is obſerued by ſome learned, that there is not one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Scripture in either teſtament of grace, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, whereupon ſome of the ancient Fathers haue gone too farre in denying poſſibility of grace, after recidiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I dare not goe ſo farre: it is breaking of a bruiſed

reede. Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> in his booke of the nature and practiſe of repentance, doth ſay,</p>
                  <p>We finde no example in Scripture of recouery after relapſe, yet in his booke of the conflicts of Sathan with a Chriſtian, nameth two examples, one of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who twice ſaid that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his ſiſter: and of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who twice ſware by the life of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He alſo chargeth <hi>Dauid</hi> with more adulteries alſo in maintaining many wiues. But as in the body, ſo in the ſoule, relapſes are full of danger.</p>

                  <p>Sinne is a burthen, <hi>Dauid</hi> complaineth of it, too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy for him to beare, and as we deſire to be waſhed from the filth and pollution of it, ſo deſire we to be eaſed from the importable burthen of it: from the terrors of a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſcience, from the feare of the wages of it; for, <hi>ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium peccati mors,</hi> from the ſhame of it in the world, from the griefe of it in the heart; for they that hide ſinne in the boſome, carry all theſe roddes about them.

                  <p n="1">1 That the holy word of truth hath plainely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that all the elect of God are waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt, and haue the free and full forgiueneſſe of all their ſinnes ſealed to them by the oracle of truth, by God who cannot lye, by two immutable things: his word and oath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That notwithſtanding this certaine ſealed pardon giuen by God, obtained by Ieſus Chriſt, yet God for the puniſhment of ſinne, doth in his ſeuere iuſtice, leaue his faithfull ſeruants to the carke and torment of a guilty conſcience, which for want of faith to ſue out this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and to plead it at the court of iuſtice, doth almoſt

leade the diſtreſſed guilty perſon to the gates of hell.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The euill that here we deprecate, is the terrour of the conſcience, wanting faith to make a comfortable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all the gratious promiſes of God to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, taking them home to our ſelues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another euill is preſumption, laying hold vpon theſe promiſes without faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For the want of faith.</p>
                  <p>It is true that the faith of the elect cannot faile finally or totally.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For the foundation of God is ſealed with this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The grace of election is the gift and calling of God, and his gifts and calling are without repentance.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another euill in the ſtate of a Chriſtian is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, when we make too bold with our God; this is not faith, but the corruption of it: <hi>corruptio optimi peſsima: O keepe thy ſeruant from preſumptuous ſinnes, ſo ſhall I be innocent from the great offences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 As preſumption is a ſinne in act, we pray againſt it in <hi>Dimitte nobis debita noſtra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is a ſinne that we feare to be comming on by our corrupt nature inclining vs to it, ſo we pray againſt it in <hi>ne nos inducas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 But we muſt conſider preſumption as it may bee a puniſhment, a rodde of God to ſcourge vs for ſome other ſinne, and ſo we pray to be deliuered from it in this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
                  <p>This preſumption whether it build too much vpon the experience of Gods former fauour, as <hi>Dauid, dixi in corde meo, nunquam mouebor: tu domine &amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Generally it pleaſeth God to puniſh one ſinne by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:26138:162"/>
as wee haue great and full examples: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the people falling into idolatry, <hi>Therefore God alſo gaue them vp to vncleaneneſſe,</hi>

                        </note>For this cauſe God gaue them vp vnto vile affections.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when <hi>Dauid</hi> waxed wanton of his peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and begunne to forget God, God gaue him vp to vncleaneneſſe, to defile his body with adultery, and after that to hide it with murther: ſo did he <hi>Peter,</hi> for ſinning in preſumption of the ſtrength of his faith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Sathan: God gaue him vp to the deniall of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and to maintaine that with ſwearing and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>IT is plaine in the ſtorie of the Goſpell, that Chriſt did twiſe teach to pray this prayer: once priuately, which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> relateth, and that at the requeſt of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>

               <p>The Diſciples obtained what they deſired in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> for Chriſt taught them to pray, and the prayer

               <p>Therefore the conſideration of our confeſſion of his power, moueth him to grant our requeſts in all theſe things.</p>
