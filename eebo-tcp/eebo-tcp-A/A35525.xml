            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
HER ROYAL HIGHNESS,
THE
PRINCESS of ORANGE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Should not offer Your
Royal Highness a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of so little value, had
I not this to encourage
me; that 'tis not the Gift it
<pb facs="tcp:51944:3"/>
self; but the Way of giving,
which finds Acceptance with
Great, and Generous Minds.
And in this (as in other things)
they resemble the Divinity;
that looks with a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Eye upon Sincerity, and
Truth (tho' in the plainest
Dress) than upon all the Pomp,
and Splendour of a Costly
Worship.</p>
            <p>It is not as a Poet, Madam,
that I address my self to Your
Royal Highness. For I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to no Exactness in an Art,
which I never profess'd. The
Course of Life, which I have
form'd to my Self, lies quite
in another Road; and I have
never convers'd with the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb facs="tcp:51944:3"/>
but in some dead Intervals
of Time; when I have had no
Company but my own self, and
no Business but to think.</p>
            <p>So that, when I throw
these Papers at Your Royal
Highnesses Feet, it is not that
I think they deserve that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
but as an humble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Duty; which I am
more particularly oblig'd to
pay; because I have been so
happy as to pass some Time in
Your Royal Highnesses Court;
and to be a Witness of those
Things, which have enter'd
Your Character in the Books
of Fame; and rais'd it to so
high a Pitch, that it strikes
Your Enemies with Silence,
<pb facs="tcp:51944:4"/>
Your Friends with Joy, and
all the World with Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>I know, Madam, to flatter
Greatness is a Disease common
in Courts; and those few who
escape it, because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with an infected Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
are seldom look'd upon
as sound; but I am sure, I was
never guilty of that Weakness.
And indeed, not to mention
the real Injustice, as well as the
numerous ill Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that attend it; there is
something in the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Flattery too mean,
and little for an Honest Mind
to stoop to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51944:4"/>
But, at the same time that I
abhor Flattery, I love Justice;
and in all, that I say to Your
Royal Highness, upon this
Occasion, every body is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to declare (or with Silence
give their Consent) that I only
give Honour to whom Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is due.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that very few are
fit to hear their own Elogies;
for where there is the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Pride, or Vanity, it
turns their Heads, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
'em to a fall. But a Mind
elevated above all that is
Light, or Trivial; when it
looks upon the Shadow of its
own Greatness, is excited with
a generous Heat, and presses
<pb facs="tcp:51944:5"/>
forwards in the Race of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>And therefore I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to shew your Royal
Highness, what Streams of
Blessings are flowing upon
you, by the Influence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
thro' the Channels of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Fortune.</p>
            <p>Tho', Madam, You have
the Happiness to be lineally
descended from an Ancient
Race of Kings; and joyn'd
to a growing Hero, whose
Courage and Conduct (like
the Light) are best known by
themselves; and can never
have so good an Elogy, as his
own Actions; yet Providence
has taken such particular Care
<pb facs="tcp:51944:5"/>
in forming You; that You
have fewer Equals in Personal
Advantages, than in Birth,
and State.</p>
            <p>I could enlarge upon this in
as many Particulars, as there
are Ways of being distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from the rest of the
World. And in every one of
these Heav'n has some Design.
The various Gifts of Nature
are not dispens'd in vain.
Beauty, and Gracefulness are
no small Advantages to Great
Persons; giving a certain
Force to all their Words, and
Actions, which is hardly to be
resisted; and perswading us,
with a silent Eloquence, into
an awful Veneration of their
<pb facs="tcp:51944:6"/>
Excellencies, and an Imitation
of their Vertues. At the same
time, a quick, and right Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of Things; a clear
and solid Judgment; with a
Natural Tendency to all that
is Just, and Good, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
are such inestimable
Blessings in a high Station;
that You are more beholding
to God for being so qualified,
than for being born a Princess.
When I add to all this, that
Your Soul is touch'd with a
Spark of that Fire, which
warms the Hearts of Angels,
and kindles Mortality into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
that are Immortal; it gives
such a double Lustre to all the
rest of Your Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb facs="tcp:51944:6"/>
and invests You with
something so Glorious, and
Divine; that we can never have
Eyes enough to Admire You,
or Tongues enough to praise
You.</p>
            <p>But the Greatness of my
Subject carries me beyond my
Self; and I am lost in a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Thoughts too migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be utter'd. I Shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leave to a Historian what
is so much above my Talent,
and Business at this Time.</p>
            <p>Those, who are rash enough,
to sully any part of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
will certainly betray a
great deal of Weakness, or
Malice; and the Injuries, which
they invent, will fall at last
<pb facs="tcp:51944:7"/>
upon their own Heads. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Truth are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Care of Heaven. They
surmount every thing; and
their Lustre breaks through
the thickest Clouds. When
any Subtilty, or Force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
can perswade Men to
believe, that the Sun does not
Shine; or that the Stars are not
bright; then (and not till then)
shall the Glory of an Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Life be stifled, and
obscur'd.</p>
            <p>As for this Little Present,
Madam; which I presume to
offer Your Royal Highness;
'tis compos'd of some Things,
which have been writ at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Times, and upon several
<pb facs="tcp:51944:7"/>
Occasions; and, as they have
been thrown aside among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of the same Nature
(which I forbear to Print, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have not had time to
look 'em over) so they are
most of 'em very rough, and
imperfect. But, at the same
time, I cannot doubt of Your
Royal Highnesses Protection,
to any thing, that is Writ in
Defence of Truth, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
at a time, when they are
almost driven out of the
World. And That has been
the chief Design of most of
these Papers. I have aim'd at
the truest Images of Nature,
the fairest Pictures of Virtue,
and the purest Ideas of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb facs="tcp:51944:8"/>
I have endeavour'd to
represent the Passion of
Love, not as a great many
modern Hands have drawn
it, but (as it ought to be) in
its own native Beauty, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>
            <p>I ask Your Royal Highness
Pardon, for the Liberty, I
have taken. I wish You eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Thing, that may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to make You entirely
happy. And, as this little
Present has been only the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of some Idle Hours:
so if it had been the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all my Life; I should
think my self more than dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
paid; in having an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of declaring to
<pb facs="tcp:51944:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the World; that I am (with
an inviolable Zeal, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity)</p>

            <l>Honour when meritoriously assign'd</l>
            <l>To Noble Actions, and a God-like Mind,</l>

From the bright Regions of Eternal Day,</l>

            <l>To an unspotted Breast, and enter there.</l>
            <l>Thrô every corner of the Heart it shines,</l>

            <l>They, in their own Dominions only Great,</l>
            <l>I, Conqu'rour of the World, my Self and Fate.</l>
            <l>Thus arm'd, let Fortune use me as she will,</l>
            <l>I stand prepar'd to meet with Good or Ill.</l>
            <l>If I am born for Happiness and Ease,</l>

Those Paths I'le chuse, the blessing to repay,</l>
            <l>Where Vertue calls, and Honour leads the way:</l>
            <l>But if the Weather of my Life proves foul,</l>
            <l>Tho' Storms arise, that make whole Kingdoms rowl,</l>
            <l>Yet I must on; and 'spight of all their Force</l>
            <l>I'le steer my Vessel her appointed Course;</l>
            <l>With her firm Beak the Billows she'll divide,</l>
            <l>And plow her Passage thro' the foaming Tyde.</l>
            <l>And at what Time, or in what Place so e're</l>
            <l>The pale-fac'd Conquerour happens to appear;</l>
            <l>Fierce as he is, his Violence I'le tame,</l>

            <l>What those who mock Love's Pow'r must undergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>This Heart of mine, now wreck'd upon despair,</l>
            <l>Was once as free and careless as the Air;</l>
            <l>In th' early Morning of my tender years,</l>
            <l>E're I was sensible of Hopes and Fears,</l>
            <l>It floated in a Sea of Mirth and Ease,</l>
            <l>And thought the World was only made to please;</l>
            <l>No adverse Wind had ever stopp'd its Course,</l>
            <l>Nor had it felt great Love's tempestuous Force,</l>
            <l>(That Storm that swells the Tydes of Human Care,</l>
            <l>And makes black Waves come rolling from afar,)</l>
            <l>'Till too much Freedom made it grow secure,</l>
            <l>As if the Sunshine always would endure;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51944:14"/>
And I, with haughty and disdainful Pride,</l>
            <l>Mock'd the blind God, and all his Force defy'd.</l>
            <l>At this enrag'd, the injur'd Deity</l>
            <l>Chose out the best of his Artillery,</l>
            <l>And in a blooming Virgin's Dove-like Eyes</l>
            <l>He planted his Victorious Batteries;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>(Phillis</hi> her Name, the best of Woman-kind,</l>
            <l>Could Love have gain'd the Empire of her Mind)</l>
            <l>These shot so furiously against my Heart,</l>
            <l>That Nature's strength, tho' much improv'd by Art,</l>
            <l>With Groans gave way to each resistless stroak,</l>
            <l>As when the Thunder rends some sturdy Oak.</l>
            <l>The wing'd Battalions from her lovely face</l>
            <l>Flew to the Breach, and, rushing in apace,</l>
            <l>Did quickly make her Mistress of the place.</l>
            <l>As Love's Vice-gerent I her Laws obey'd,</l>
            <l>It must be so where Conquerours invade.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51944:15"/>
But when she saw how pow'rful she was grown,</l>
            <l>Made chief Commandress of the vanquish'd Town,</l>
            <l>She would no more Love's just Decrees obey,</l>
            <l>But sett up for an Arbitrary Sway:</l>
            <l>And when her Tyranny was grown so great,</l>
            <l>That ev'ry humble Sigh provok'd her Hate,</l>
            <l>Reason, an active States-man, Wise, and Stout,</l>
            <l>Heading the injur'd Native, turn'd her out.</l>
            <l>The God of Love will find some gentle Fair</l>
            <l>To govern in her room; but let her swear</l>
            <l>To hold a merciful and equal Sway,</l>
            <l>And all his old Imperial Laws obey.</l>
            <l>Till she appears, no Charms can <hi>Strephon</hi> move,</l>
            <l>Unless it be the gen'ral Thoughts of Love;</l>
            <l>That thin <hi>Camelion-Dyet</hi> of the Air,</l>
            <l>Fancy's Idea of an Unknown Fair.</l>
            <l>For where, or what she is, Heav'n only knows,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51944:15"/>
But there's so strange a Magick force in Love,</l>
            <l>The talking on't sometimes may fatal prove;</l>
            <l>And therefore, gentle Nymph, let's have a care,</l>
            <l>And tell no more such Stories now, for fear,</l>
            <l>Like Children, after talking of a Spright,</l>

Of all the Modern Writers who have try'd,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Boileau,</hi> to me, the most accomplish'd seems;</l>
            <l>Bold and Severe, yet free from all extreams.</l>
            <l>Nature to some has giv'n an active Wit,</l>

            <l>Who, laughing at the Follies of the Town,</l>

            <l>Others in Judgment only do excel,</l>
            <l>And in Affairs of State do pretty well;</l>
            <l>But when their Nat'ral Talent they abuse,</l>

            </l>
            <l>And make the World afraid of being wise.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Boileau</hi>'s easie and unerring Wit,</l>
            <l>Does ev'ry Coxcomb so exactly hit,</l>
            <l>And sets before his eyes so true a Glass,</l>

            <l>Clasp'd in her frozen Arms,</l>

            <head>DESPAIR.</head>
            <head>A SONG, set by Mr. Abel, Servant to
His MAJESTY.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>O You immortal Powers of Love,</l>
               <l>Why do you all my Hopes remove?</l>
               <l>You give me up to certain Fate,</l>
               <l>And force me to be desperate.</l>

            <lg>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:51944:36"/>
               <l>Is it for this I've sacrific'd</l>
               <l>My Quiet, and the World despis'd?</l>
               <l>To burn, to bleed, to sigh, to groan,</l>
               <l>To Love, be wretched, and undone?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When first you did my Soul inspire,</l>
               <l>And I aproach'd your gentle Fire,</l>
               <l>Was I unwilling to forego</l>
               <l>My Ease, and be a Slave to you?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I hasten'd to the Myrtle Grove,</l>
               <l>And there an Altar rais'd to Love;</l>
               <l>On which my Heart still burning lies,</l>
               <l>Inflam'd, at first, by <hi>Phillis</hi>'s Eyes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She pull'd it from panting Breast,</l>
               <l>And in a Veil of Crimson drest,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:51944:37"/>
'Twas on the fatal Altar laid,</l>
               <l>By the too rash, unthinking Maid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For, oh! I fear, she did prophane,</l>
               <l>And take Love's sacred Name in vain;</l>
               <l>For which unhappy Error, I,</l>
               <l>By injur'd Love, am doom'd to dye.</l>
