         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and others of all ſorts, that gaue their
hands and conſent to further and vphold that
honourable action.</p>
            <p>Vpon which encouragement of ſo many
worthy Patrons, the Companie very deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged themſelues, in ſending Men and
Ships, Cattle, and all kinde of prouiſions, with
Gouernours and Captaines for peace and war,
inſomuch as no earthly meanes ſeemed then
wanting for the ſpeedy reducing of that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nation, and ſauage people, to a quiet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>But ſuch was the will of Almighty God, as
the world well knoweth, that this great hope
and preparation, by many diſaſters on Sea and
Land, too long to be here recited, was in a
manner cleane defeated, and there onely remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a poore remnant of thoſe Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11866:2"/>
Cattle and prouiſions, that eſcaped the
danger and which are now remayning there
to rayſe and build vp that intended Colonie.</p>
            <p>Which when thoſe Gentlemen th'aduenturers
here ſaw, and that the expectance of ſo great a
preparation brought nothing home but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
ſucceſſe and bad reports, they for the
moſt part withdrew themſelues, in deſpaire of
the enterprize, and ſo gaue it ouer, not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to repayre the ruines, nor to ſupply what
themſelues had vnderwritten, to diſcharge the
deepe engagement, whereinto the Company
was drawne by their encouragement.</p>
            <p>By whoſe vnconſtancie and irreſolution, the
hope of that Plantation, together with the liues
of our people there, had then vtterly periſhed,
had not Gods ſecret purpoſe beene more
ſtrongly fixed to vphold the ſame, by ſtirring
vp the mindes and vndaunted ſpirits of a very
ſmall remnant of conſtant Aduenturers, that
with Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> (their Treaſurer and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
from the beginning) in all that time of
three yeares diſaſter, were neuer diſcouraged,
nor withdrew themſelues from weekely Courts
and meetings, yeelding their purſes, credit and
counſeil, from time to time, to make new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
euen beyond their proportion, to vphold
the Plantation.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch as by the fauourable aſſiſtance of
God, who in his owne wiſdome doth oftentimes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11866:3"/>
effect the greateſt ends by weakeſt meanes, it is
now come to paſſe, that our Engliſh Colonie
there, ſubſiſteth in a very good and proſperous
condition: They ſow and reape their Corne in
ſufficient proportion, without want or impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
their Kine multiply already to ſome
hundreds, their Swine to many thouſands, their
Goates and Poultry in great numbers, euery
man hath houſe and ground to his owne vſe,
and now being able to maintaine themſelues
with food, they are alſo prepared and ready,
once hauing the meanes, to ſet vpon the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
whereof there are many ſorts; as alſo to
plant and ſow ſuch ſeuerall kindes of Seeds and
Fruits, as may beſt befit the Soyle and Climate,
to make the Land profitable to themſelues and
th'Aduenturers.</p>
            <p>This being a true Relation of the preſent
ſtate and hope of things in VIRGINIA, wee
thought good in this ſhort manner to mention
it by the way, as well to giue thoſe worthy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
in VIRGINIA their deſerued praiſe, for
the vnſpeakable paines and hazzard which they
haue endured there, in framing the people and
Plantation to ſo happy a forme, as alſo to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the deſpayring thoughts of ſuch old rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Aduenturers, that make no other reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but whatſoeuer hath beene ſpent vpon the
name of VIRGINIA to be loſt and caſt away;
the ſpeciall purpoſe of this our Publication,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11866:3"/>
being to another end, which for the further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of all reaſonable minded, wee will now in
few words deliuer.</p>
            <p>It was publiſhed to the world, about ſeauen
yeares ſince, and the time is now expired, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee promiſed to cauſe a Diuident to be made
of the Lands in <hi>Virginia,</hi> as well to euery mans
perſon that went himſelfe to the Plantation, as
to euery particular man that had aduentured
his money.</p>
            <p>And in as much as we are now by the Natiues
liking and conſent, in actuall poſſeſſion of a
great part of the Country, the other part not
as yet freed from encomber of woods and
trees, nor throughly ſuruayed, whereby to make
a Diuident of the whole: yet of that part which
is now fit for Plantation, we intend God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to beginne a preſent Diuiſion by Lot to
euery man that hath already aduentured his
mony or perſon, for euery ſingle ſhare of twelue
pound tenne ſhillings, fifty Acres of Land, till
further opportunitie will afford to diuide the
reſt, which we doubt not will bring at leaſt two
hundred Acres to euery ſingle ſhare.</p>
            <p>This Diuiſion is intended to be done by a
new Gouernour with Commiſſioners and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers
to be ſent from hence to ioyne with
others that are there already, to giue euery man
his Lot in due proportion, according to ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11866:4"/>
indifferent Directions as ſhall be giuen them in
charge.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as this courſe of ſending a
Gouernor with Commiſſioners and a Suruayor,
with Men, Ships, and ſundry prouiſions, for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
and other occaſions, as all men may
conceiue, cannot bee effected without great
charge and expence to the Company; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought requiſite, and determined, that ſo
many Aduenturers as will partake of this firſt
Diuident, ſhall preſent their Names, with their
number of ſhares, into a Booke remayning at Sir
<hi>Thomas Smiths</hi> for that purpoſe, before the 25.
of <hi>Iune</hi> next.</p>
            <p>And they ſhall alſo promiſe vnder their hands,
to contribute to the ſaid charge, the ſumme of
twelue pound ten ſhillings, to be paid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
one Moneth after Subſcription, whether his
ſhares be more or leſſe, except any man ſhall be
pleaſed to aduenture more, and for which
twelue pound ten ſhillings (or more if hee will)
he ſhall alſo haue a further Diuident of land in
proportion, as for all other his monies formerly
aduentured. But for ſuch as are not able to lay
downe preſent monie, if they ſhall deſire fauour,
it is agreed for them, that the Treaſurer may
receiue the one halfe of their ſaid aduenture in
preſent money, after their vnderwriting, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
out the ſhips, and the other halfe at ſixe
Moneths after that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:11866:4"/>
And that no man may hereafter excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by ignorance, nor taxe the Company for
concealing their purpoſe, we declare to all men,
that this preſent Diuiſion is to be onely in the
Lands lying along the Kings Riuer on both
ſides, and all about the new Townes erected; in
which ſo many as ſhall giue in their names as
aforeſaid, may haue their parts, and thoſe that
will not, may at their pleaſure forbeare till here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
to take their Lot vpon the ſame tearmes
in places more remote.</p>
            <p>The Names of all ſuch as will partake of this
Diuident, ſhall be giuen in writing to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
before they goe hence, at whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
they ſhall bring with them a perfect Map
and Deſcription of the ſaid lands and ground
diuided, that euery man may ſee and know in
what condition and where his land lyeth, that
accordingly he may diſpoſe thereof at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
eyther by going himſelfe in perſon to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
it, or by ſending families to manure it for
yearely rent, or for halfe the cleare profits as
many others doe.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, euery mans portion allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, ſhall be confirmed as ſtate of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
to him and his heyres for euer, with
bounds and limits vnder the Companies Seale,
to be holden of his Maieſtie, as of his Manour
of <hi>Eaſt Greenwich,</hi> in <hi>Socage Tenure,</hi> and not in
<hi>Capite,</hi> according to his Maieſties gracious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11866:5"/>
Patents already granted to the VIRGINIA
Company in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding, as we hope, the chiefe
brunt and doubt of that Plantation is now ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt,
whereof to their great charge and hazzard
the old Aduenturers haue endured the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
part, and might therefore iuſtly appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
this preſent Diuident to themſelues, yet at
the motion and deſire of many Gentlemen and
others, intending to be new aduenturers, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
and granted by the Company, that all
new Aduenturers, ſubſcribing and performing
the conditions before mentioned, for twelue
pound tenne ſhillings, or more, ſhall partake in
proportion as freely in this preſent Diuident,
and in any other priuiledge and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in VIRGINIA, as if with the
old Aduenturers they had
been partakers from
the beginning.
