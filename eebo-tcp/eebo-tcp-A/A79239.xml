            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>HIS MAJESTIES LAST ANSWER To the PAPERS and PROPOSITIONS Of the Commiſsioners of Scotland.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have conſidered the ſeverall Papers and Propoſtions delivered to me by you, and do aſſure you, that I deſire nothing more, then that I may entirely unite the hearts and affections of all my good Subjects of Scotland to me, and amongſt themſelves, as well for the honor, peace, and proſperity of that Kingdom, as that they may joyntly and unanimouſly aſsiſt me in the revenge of that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and impious murder of my Father, and the recovery of my juſt rights in my other Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which they are all equally ingaged by the Lawes of God and of that Kingdom: and to the obtaining of ſuch an union, I will conſent to all that in conſcience and honor I may, without impoſing on my other Kingdoms; as firſt I will maintain, confirm and defend the Government Eccleſiaſticall and Civill of Scotland as it is ſetled by Law, and all the ancient known Lawes of that Kingdom, as likewiſe all ſuch Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as have been actually conſented unto by the King my Father, being perſonally preſent in Parliament, or by his Counſellors lawfully authorized by him; and particularly thoſe Lawes concerning the Nationall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Confeſsion of Faith and Presbyteriall Government of that Church. Touching that part of the League and Covenant which concerns my other Kingdoms of England and Ireland, it is not in my power juſtly to take any reſolution therein, without the advice of my reſpective Parliaments of thoſe Kingdoms, by whoſe advice and conſent only Lawes are there to be made and altered. Neither can I conſent to any thing which ſhal oppoſe or diſturb the peace lately concluded in Ireland; but J am very willing to refer the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the League and Covenant, and all the other particulars you mentioned as to England, to a free Parliament to be convened there by my Writ, as ſoon as the condition of that Kingdome will permit me ſo to do, by whoſe advice J am reſolved to govern my ſelf therein. In the mean time as J am ready to do all that is in my power to the ſafe and quiet protection of my people of Scotland under the benefit of the Lawes of that Kingdom, as likewiſe further to gratifie them in all that may really tend to their welfare, ſo J ſhall expect that obedience and duty from them in the exerciſe of my regall power, as is due to me by their allegiance, to which they ſubmitting, and for the buriall of all bitterneſſe and animoſities which the former diſtractions and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may have produced, and the better effecting the happy union before mentioned, I am very willing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to conſent to an Act of Oblivion and indempnity to all perſons of what condition ſoever of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Scotland, excepting only ſuch perſons (if any ſuch there be in or of that Kingdom) that ſhall hereafter upon ſufficient and due evidence in a lawfull triall be found actually and expreſly guilty of that laſt unparallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led horrid act of the murther of their late Soveraign. And if it ſhall appeare unto me that the League and Covenant containeth any thing in it not compriſed in thoſe Acts concerning the Nationall Covenant, and Presbyteriall Government of the Church of Scotland, and neceſſary to the welfare of the ſaid Church and Kingdom, without reference to England or Ireland, J ſhall upon the full ſetling of ſuch an Union, and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſuch an Act of Oblivion as is before mentioned, apply my ſelf to give full ſatisfaction therein, paſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſiring to remove all occaſions of miſunderſtanding between my ſelf and all my good Subjects of that my Kingdom of Scotland: and what is not plenarily anſwered at this time, ſhall be ſupplied by an Expreſſe which I will diſpatch into Scotland as ſoon as conveniently I can.</p>
