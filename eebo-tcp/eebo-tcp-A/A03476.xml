            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALL the Ilands of <hi>Banda,</hi> from the tenth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust 1609. were by a speciall treaty &amp; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made with the <hi>Orang-cayas,</hi> or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of the fore-said Ilands, were put vnder the protection of the high and mighty, the States generall of the vnited Prouinces, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to defend them from the Portugall, and other their Enemies, prouided that they of the said Ilands are bound to deliuer vnto the Fort called <hi>Nassau,</hi> or vnto the Committes of the said Company, all their fruits or spices at a certaine price, and so forth, as by the said treaty of agreement more at large appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.

In this wilfulnesse
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4343:3"/>
the Bandaneseis continued, till in Iune 1620. Till that at laccatra was published both amongst the English and the Netherlands Fleet, then riding there in the Road: the treaty concluded and agreed vpon, betweene his most excellent Maiesty, the King of great Britaine, and the high and mighty Lords the States generall, for to reconcile vpon certaine conditions, the English and Netherlands East India Companies.</p>
            <p>The which Treaty, and by conference of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling concerning the Molluccoes, Amboyna, and Banda, all disputes and differences betweene the English and the Netherlands Company concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the same, were to that time abollished, and a generall force of Ships of Warre was ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, for the defence of both Companies in their rights, and the commerce which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Indies.</p>
            <p>The Reduction of the wilfull Bandaneseis vnto the Netherlands Camp, was hindred a yeare or two, through the actuall proceedings which the English in Banda it selfe, since the yeare 1616. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the yeare 1618. About the coast of Iaua, and whole India through, by open hostility did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: whereby the aforesaid Bandaneseis being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and made bolder, did withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues wholly from vnder the subiection of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Nassaw, doing vnto vs and ours all wrong and hostility, and with-holding from vs their fruits (to say) Nutmegs and Maces, which they did not onely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4343:4"/>
sell vnto the English, and to the Indians, but also to the Portugalls, who are both their and our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with whom they seeke to make neerer aliance of friendship, as already in the great Iland named Banda, were come fifty or three score Portugalls, who by some more affistance, considering the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall force of the said Iland, would haue beene suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to haue depriued both the English and the Netherlands Companie of the rights therein, and the fruits thereof, without hope hereafter to haue any redresse.</p>
            <p>In regard of those inconueniences, after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the contract that was made, the Generall of the Netherland company, in the common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell for defence, (consisting of English-men and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders) propounded the necessity of the taking of Banda, as also of the redressing and assuring of those Quarters, and of the trade in Amboyna and Moluccoes, to the which end, both the Companies according to the contract were bound together, to vse all the force and power that he could, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feruation of the places, as much as concerned the trade, for both the Companies. And it appeareth by the Act made by those of the said Counsell for defence, bearing date the first of Ianuary 1621. <hi>stilo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oua,</hi> that the English Committies there declared, that the necessities of the businesse was well knowne vnto them; as also that they were very willing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with vs, to doe some common exploit: but for that as then, they wanted both power and meanes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4343:4"/>
of men and ships, that they could not for that time furnish any thing towards the same: Whereupon, the Netherlands Gouernour Generall declared, that with the particular power of the Netherland Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he would take the same in hand, and effect it in such manner, as God should be pleased to prosper his proceedings.</p>
            <p>And to that end, vpon the 13. of Ianuary, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour Generall went from Iacotra to Amboyna, where he ariued vpon the 14. of February, and from thence went to Banda, to the Castle of Nassaw, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Iland Nera, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 27. of February 1621. In the meane time, one of the English Counsell for defence, that had beene at Iacotra vpon the first of Ianuary 1621. and was priuy to the contract made, lying then in Amboyna, when the Gouernour Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall went from thence to Banda; sent Letters in our owne Ships to the English-men, lying in the small Iland Puleron, and made knowne and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto those of Banda, in what manner the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Netherland Company, intended to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile the great Iland of Banda: and when the said Gouernor Generall was come to the Fort of Nassaw in Banda, hee vnderstood that the English-men in Puleron, had ayded them of the Towne of Lontor, in the great Iland of Banda, with 4. Peeces of great Ordnance; and that if they had had longer time, that the entrance of the Generall of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Army into Lantor Hauen, should haue beene let and withstood by a great battery. As also that some Englishmen in Lantor, assisted these of Banda,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4343:5"/>
ours and (according to the contract) their enemies, both with counsell and force, encouraging them with their presence, and notwithstanding that the said Generall required the said Englishmen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to leaue the Towne, for the causes and reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid as also for that they themselues, according to the contract and Order made by the Counsell of Defence, before that time might not buy any Fruit in <hi>Molucques, Amboina,</hi> and <hi>Banda,</hi> as after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Contract they might doe, and that onely together, and in common places with the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders, yet some few of them stayed still with them of Banda our common enemies. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing also that the Gouernour Generall prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, that hee was not therein to be blamed, if by that meanes any hurt were done vnto them, being among &amp; with our common enemies, from whom they should &amp; ought to haue seperated themselues.</p>
            <p>First, tho Gouernors Generall, determined to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle the great Island of <hi>Banda</hi> on the South side, (by some called <hi>Lontor,</hi> because the principall Towne is so called) by land in a place called <hi>Luchny,</hi> and to that end caused the Ship called the <hi>Hart</hi> to Anckor thereabouts, which lay not long there, but it was shot at by an English piece of Ordinance, whereby our men were forced to tow the said Ship with a Galley from the shore, and to leaue two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckors and two Cables behinde them, or else it had beene in great danger of sincking or burning, out men assuring vs, that an English Gunner had shot at them, and that they perfectly descryed and saw him, although the English-men seeme to deny it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:4343:5"/>
Whereby altering of their first purpose, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Netherlanders resolued to land vpon the inward part of the Island of <hi>Banda,</hi> there to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe themselues, and then to goe vp vpon the Hilles, and there to plant there Ordinance, and to that end vpon the 8. of March, 1621. landing with 17. Companies betweene <hi>Comber</hi> and <hi>Ortatten,</hi> they marched along the shoreside, within the reach of three Pieces of great Ordinance lent then by the Englishmen, and not long before planted there, whereby if they had marched forward many of our men had been slaine, and so wee should haue found no place there to encampe our selues, but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from the Hilles would haue domineer'd ouer vs, no man knowing what counsell to giue, whereby wee might get vp vpon the hilles. The way where on aboue Three yeares before wee had beene, being all intrenched, whereupon the Generall determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to enter againe into his Ship with the whole Army, to take another course. They of <hi>Banda</hi> not once pursuing after vs, but with flowting and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king let vs goe, and so thinking thereby that they had gotten the vpper hand of vs, most part of them brought their Wiues and Children againe into <hi>Lontor.</hi> After these two enterprizes, partly hindred by the English Ordinance, were in that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner crost The Generall for a third resolution, determined to assayle the great Island of <hi>Banda,</hi> on both sides, that is on the inner side of the Land with 6. Companies, and on the South side with 10. Companies. That they on the Inner side should land an houre before
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4343:6"/>
the others should land, by that meanes to draw the enemy forth, and so to make place on the other side, while a Company of chosen men should land on the North side, to climbe vp vpon the Hilles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in other places of the land should also bee in a readinesse, being 330. persons, whereof 150. were Musketiers, appointed for the manning and ashu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of 30. Boates which the said Company would bring on the South side of the Island.</p>
            <p>This was effected vpon the 11. of March, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly 6. Companies by breake of day, went on Land betweene <hi>Comber</hi> and <hi>Ortatten.</hi> Captaine <hi>Vog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heel</hi> with certaine chosen Souldiers marching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who climbing vp vpon the hilles, found such resistance, that all their powder being spent, they were in great danger to bee spoyled, but being well followed and seconded by the rest, the enemy was forced to retire, and while this skirmish continued, the other 10. Companies landing out of the said 30. Boats, went on shore vpon the South side of <hi>Banda,</hi> in a small Bay, some with Laders and others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out climbing vp vpon the Cliffes, and being gotten vp, they marched to the backside of <hi>Lontor</hi> without any resistance, but onely those that set vpon the first troopes, being some 10. or 20. Musketiers, by whom one of our men was slaine, and 4. or 5. hurt, whereby <hi>Lontor</hi> was taken on the South side by the said 10. Companies, while the other 5.
