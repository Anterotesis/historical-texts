         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap> vp the place wyth flesh: And thus oydde God make the woman, out of the rybbe that he had taken from Adam. Of this maner dyd god make for man a companion, lyke vnto hymselfe, and mete for hym. Here nowe ought we to consi der the occasion, why GOD made the woman out of the slepynge man, and not whyle he was awake. Of the rybbe, &amp; not as well of the earthe, as he had made the man to fore. For all this ser ueth to the declaracion of our purpose.</p>
               <p>Fyrst in the slepe of Adam, dyd he set forthe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

death of Christ, out of the which (vnto the same Lorde Christ) there is prepared a pure and holy spouse in the Fountayne of water thorowe the worde, as Paule sayth to the Ephesians y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fyfte Chapter Of suche health and grace of GOD should marryed folkes also haue vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dynge and knowledge. Moreouer his mynde is to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifye vnto vs that in takyng holy wedlocke in hand, all te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacions should slepe. The ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce regard, and feare of God, ought to ioyne them togither, that are disposed to marry. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was taken from and out of the syde of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and not from the earthe, least ony man shoulde thyncke that he had gotten his wyfe oute of the myer: but to considre, that the wife is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> husbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des flesh and bone, and therfore to loue her. yet was she not made of the head. For the husbond is the head and master of the wyfe. Nether was she made of the feete (as thoughe thou mighteste spurne her away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the, &amp; nothyng regard her) but euen out of thy syde, as one that is set next vnto man, to be his helpe &amp; companion. And as the bone of the flesh is strong, so ought the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to be the strengthe, healpe &amp; conforte of the wyfe. Therfore was she also taken and created oute of the ryb or bone, and not out of the fleshe.</p>
               <p>But in the circumstau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that followeth, shal euery thing be more playne afterward. For now
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:11114:21"/>
it followeth howe God gaue the woman vnto man, and how that he receaued and toke her.</p>
               <p>God brought the woman vnto Adam, and as it is euident in the fyrst Chapter) he blyssed them and sayde vnto them, growe and multiplye, and <note place="margin">Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Out of the which wordes we may perceaue clerely, that God was the fyrst causer of wedlocke, and fyrst dyd knyt them togyther, &amp; blyssed them. Nowe as soone as the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was brought vnto Adam, &amp; gyuen vnto him, he sayd immediately: this is once bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. Afore dyd Adam beholde &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidre all beastes and lyuynge creatures here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, and gaue euery one his peculiare name ac cordyng to his kynde, but among all thynges ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge he found none, to whome he myght beare an harte and mynde, namely to dwell by it, to loue it, and of it to procreate one lyke vnto him selfe. And therfore is it reason, that wythe fyre they be punyshed vnto death, which agaynst all kynde and nature of man, haue to do with bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, and not only with women.</p>
               <p>As soone now as the woman was set before Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he knowledged immmediatly, that she was <note place="margin">Occasion of loue and con sent into ma riage.</note> for his purpose, that he lyked her well, &amp; that he could fynde in his harte to loue her, as one that was of his owne kynde, of his owne bloud, flesh of his fleshe, and bone of his bone. For thoughe
<pb facs="tcp:11114:22"/>
he slepte, and the woman was created out of his rybbe, yet sawe he well that she was lyke hym &amp; suche one as he hytherto had not found amonge all other lyuynge creatures. God also had pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kynde, the loue, the harte, the inclinacion &amp; naturall affeccion that it besemeth the one to haue towarde the other.

               <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foloweth it farther in Moses. For this cause shall a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue his father and mother, &amp; cleaue vnto his wyfe, &amp; they two shalbe into one flesh. These wordes doth Adam (or t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wyll make discorde betwene maried folkes, God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a man in that behalfe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake father &amp; mother, &amp; to kepe hym to his wyfe. The loue therfore in mariage ought to be nexte

vnto God) aboue all loues. The seconde: They two, saythe he, shall be into one fleshe, that is to saye, one body. Nowe lyke as the greatest loue, the moost excellent and vnpayneful seruyce, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and earnest labour, is in the partes of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body, one doyng for another, one louynge, defendyng, helpyng &amp; forbearynge another, suffe rynge, also lyke ioye &amp; lyke payne one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Euen so ought it to be betwene man &amp; wo man in wedlocke. And lyke as the partes of a mans body seperate not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afore death, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so must wedlocke be a knot vnlooseable. And lyke as the partes of a mans body, whan they are sundred one from another conceaue an exceadynge great anguysh, dolour and payne, euen so ought it to he an exceadynge grefe for marryed folkes to be seperated.</p>
               <p>And thus Moses, ouer &amp; besydes that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrst originall of holy wedlocke, layeth also the foundacion of lawes matrimonyal, out of the which all other statutes are taken.

               <p>It plesed not Paul, that in wedlocke al hope should be sodenly cast of for vnbeleues sake, and vyolence ministred to seperacion.

For her sake thought he that a man shoulde forsake father and mother and kepe hym onelye vnto her He knowledged that she was one body wyth hys, then must it follow also, that she had lyke mynd hart &amp; wyll. For neuer one body hath <note place="margin">The wil of mariage com meth of god.</note> two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary wylles, but one body hath one wyl.

But to auoyd whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let euery man haue a wyfe of hys owne, &amp; euery woman her owne husband. He sayth it is a quiet state of lyuyng for a man not to touche or lye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a woman: yea if God haue graunted hym &amp; gyuen him the gyfte, that he may wel and without burnyng, lyue chaste &amp; vnmaryed.

peculiar maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariage. As for harlottes &amp; vnthriftes, they are not perculiar propre or own one to another, but borowed &amp; lent for a tyme.</p>
               <p>It foloweth yet more playnely in Paul, how <note place="margin">The worke of martimo ny is no syn.</note> that he not onely vouch saueth the worke of wed locke to them that be maried, but commaundeth also (yee and taketh away the priuate power of either of them both therin) &amp; sayeth clearly, that nether of them maye denye vnto the other the dewe worke of matrymonye. Let the husbande, (sayth he) geue vnto the wife dewe beneuolence. Likewise the wife vnto the husband. And this with comelye wordes expresseth he the actuall <note place="margin">Marke wel.</note> worke of mariage which certayne of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, of a speciall chosen holynesse &amp; falfe fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned clenlynesse, had vtterlye denyed vnto theyr maried spouses, thinkyng therby to be very holy clene and spirituall.

                     </gap>.</note> it is dennesse also, a man to lye wyth his owne maried wife. For Paule in the same chapter speakyng of wydowes &amp; wydowers saiethe that it is good yf they so remayne, but immediatelye addeth he therto, sayenge: Neuerthelesse, yf they can not absteine, let them mary. For better it is to marye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to burne. And within a litle after he sayth moreouer: But and yf thou take a wife thou synnest not. Beholde, what could be more clerely spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: To mary (sayth the Apostle) is no synne, then must it folow also that the worckes of mariage are not synne, not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues but because of the mariage selfe &amp; gods ordinaunce.</p>
               <p>And that more is then all that we haue yet <note place="margin">Uirginite is &amp; holy &amp; ex cellent thing.</note> spoken of, it foloweth farther in Paul: And yf a virgyn mary he or she synneth not.

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must it folow, that god rekeneth not the worke of mariage for synne &amp; vnclennes But synne and wicked vnclennesse is it to com mytte whoredome.

               <p>The wise man Salomon sayeth Prouer. v. Beglad with thy maryed wife, whom thou hast taken in thy youth, &amp; loue her as a deare chosen hynde. Let hyr brestes satisfye the at all tymes, and reioyse styll in her loue. For why shuldeste thou come nye an harlot (my sonne) and haunt the bosome of a straunge woman? In the which wordes, Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like as Paule also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth and prayseth the loue and worke of mariage as clenlynesse, but draweth men from whoredom as from it that is nothing but fylthy. Therfore (doutelesse) mariage was instituted to auoyde whoredome and vnclennesse and the worcke of mariage is rekened of God for no synne. All which thinges I haue the more largelye spoken of, &amp; proued and confirmed the same with holye scripture: And though I dyd not gladlye take in

               <p>Paul, Ephe. v. sayeth thus: ye wyues, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytt <note place="margin">The dewtye &amp; obedience of wyues.</note> your selues vnto your husbandes, as vnto the lorde. For the husband is the wyues heade, like as Christ also is the head of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; sauyour of hys body. Now as the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion or church is in subiection vnto Christe so let the wiues also be in subiection to theyr hus bandes in all thynges. First doth Paule speake of the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that maried weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> owe to theyr husbandes. Let the weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayth he be in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is to say, seruiseable &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto their

Wherout it fo loweth, that the sayde obedience extendethe not vnto wickednesse &amp; euell, but vnto that whiche is good, honest, and comely. In asmuche as god deliteth onely in goodnesse, and forbyddeth euell euery where. It foloweth also, that the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whiche wiues shew vnto their husbandes displeaseth god no lesse, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whan he is resisted hymselfe.</p>

Thou shalt depend and wait vpon thy husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des beck, him shalt thou feare, and he shall haue aucthori te ouer the. Thus wryteth Paule himself. i. Ti moth. ii. I suffre not a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to teach or preach or to haue dominion ouer her husband. For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was first made and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eua.

<pb n="liiii" facs="tcp:11114:73"/>
humbled her, made her fearfull and subdued her. Such punyshment and ordinaunce of God ought they to regarde, and wyth a good wyll (ac cordyng to the commaundement of the Lorde, to obey theyr husbandes, leest they fall into Gods wrathe and into further punyshment.</p>
               <p>But to the intent that the husband shall not <note place="margin">Howe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The husbande (saythe he) is the wyfes head, euen as Christ is the head of hys congregacion. Nowe is Christ so the heade of the congregacion, that he shewethe vnto it the same thyng, whiche the head sheweth vnto the bodye. The head seeth and hearethe for the whole body, ruleth and gydethe the body and geueth it strength of lyfe. Euen so doth Christ defende, teache &amp; preserue his congregacion. To be shorte, he is the sauioure, conforte, eye, harte, wisdome and gyde therof. Therfore muste the husbandes be heades vnto the wyues in lyke ma ner, to shewe them lyke kyndenes, and after the same fashyon to guyde them and rule them with discresion for theyr preseruacion, and not wyth force and wylfulnesse to entreate them.</p>
               <p>Thyrdly, Paul setteth an ensample to the wi ues howe they must be obedient &amp; behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sel ues vnto theyr husbandes, &amp; saythe: Lyke as the

Upon Christ is her thought day &amp; nyght, she lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gethe onely after Christ, for Christes sake also (if it maye serue to his glory) is she hartely well content to dye, yea she gyueth ouer herselfe whol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly therto for Christes loue, knowyng assuredly, that her soule, her houour, body, lyfe and all that she hathe, is Christes owne. Thus also must euery honest wyfe submit her selfe, to serue her husband wythe all her power, and gyue herselfe ouer frely and wyllyngly, neuer to forsake hym tyll the houre of death: to hold her content wyth her husbande, to loue hym onely, to harken vnto

hym, &amp; in all thynges to order her selfe after hys commaundement. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth it in Paule lykewyse, what <note place="margin">The dewtys and loue of husbandes.</note> the husbandes owe to theyr wyues, &amp; how they ought to loue them. Ye husbandes, sayth he, loue your wyues, as Christ loued the congregacion, and gaue hymselfe for it, to sanctify i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, and hath clensed it. &amp;c. The husbandes dewetye is to loue hys wyfe. Nowe is loue ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle and frendly, she is not disdaynefull, she seketh not her owne profyt she is not proude, she is not pufte vp, she is not hastely prouoked vnto wrathe, she takethe not a thyng soone to the worste, she is not lothsome &amp; tedious, but feruente &amp; seruiseable, and therfore (as we sayde afore) the husbande is the wyues head, that is, her defender, teacher and conforte. Yet nedeth it no farther declaracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for as muche as Saynt Paule hymselfe sheweth the maner &amp; fashyon of the loue, that is, howe they oughte to loue theyr wyues, and sayth: Ye men loue youre <note place="margin">How menne shoulde loue theyr wyues.</note> wyues, as Christ loueth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregacion.

               <p>This is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the measure of the mutuall loue
