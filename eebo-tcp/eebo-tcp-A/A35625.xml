            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1667"/>
            <p>IN the Nineteenth Year of the Reign of His late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second,  paſſed an Act of Parliament for Aſſigning Orders in the Exchequer, without Revocation, made, as is therein expreſſed, for the Advantage of the Trade of this Kingdom; and for Seven Years to give Credit to His Majeſty's Exchequer; alſo for payment of Moneys that ſhould be Charged on any Branch of His Majeſty's Revenue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſaid Act encouraged ſeveral Goldſmiths and Others to Advance great Sums to ſerve publick Occaſions, which had not been advanced, but upon the Reputation of that Act. But notwithſtanding the Encouragement given in that Act, His ſaid Majeſty in Council, on the Second of <hi>January</hi> 1671/72, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1671"/> declared, That his Neceſſities forced him to poſtpone Payments of Money for One Year; And to that purpoſe was then publiſhed his Declaration, to put a ſtop to Payments in the Exchequer, and to Command the Lords of the Treaſury, that they ſhould employ and diſpoſe of all the Moneys ſo ſtopped, for ſetting forth, and payment of the Fleet, and other publick Services, in order to the Preſervation and Safety of His Majeſty's Government, and Defence of His People.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1676"/>
            <p>By the ſaid unuſual ſtop upon Payments in the Exchequer, the ſaid Goldſmiths were unable to pay their Debts: Whereupon His Majeſty, to Remove the great Difficulties which very many of His Subjects lay under by the ſaid ſtop of Payments; And for want of a more effectual Relief, was pleaſed in <hi>April</hi> 1676, to direct the then Lord High Treaſurer to cauſe the Accounts of thoſe perſons whoſe Payments in the Exchequer were ſo ſtopped to be truly Examined, and exactly Stated; which Matter his Lordſhip referred to the Conſideration of Sir <hi>John Ernle,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Howard, Charles Bertie</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Sir <hi>George Downeing,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Harbord</hi> and Mr. Auditor <hi>Aldworth,</hi> (then Members of the Houſe of Commons;) who having frequently debated, and ſeriouſly conſidered thereof, declared to his Lordſhip, That they were fully ſatisfied in each reſpective perſon's Account, and had nothing further to Offer or Object in relation thereto; And then, by his Lordſhip's Order, the ſaid Auditor made up thoſe ſeveral Accounts, with the Intereſt due thereon, to the Firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1676, after the Rate of Six Pounds <hi>per Cent. per Annum;</hi> and each of the perſons concerned, having Sworn to the Truth of his Account before One of the Barons of the Court of Exchequer, they were approved of and ſigned by the ſaid Sir <hi>John Ernle,</hi> as he was Under-Treaſurer and Chancellor of the Exchequer; as alſo by the ſaid Lord-Treaſurer, who then were His Majeſty's proper Officers for paſſing Accounts, and under Oath faithfully to diſcharge thoſe Offices of Truſt: So they having in due Form paſſed thoſe ſeveral Accounts, the Lord High Treaſurer in <hi>February</hi> 1676, Reported them to His Majeſty in Council.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1677"/>
            <p>And in lieu and ſatisfaction of the Moneys due upon thoſe Accounts to each Reſpective perſon, his ſaid Majeſty, by his Letters Patents under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> did about <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1677, Grant to them, their Heirs and Aſſigns, and for the benefit of their Creditors, a yearly Rent or Sum for ever, payable out of the Hereditary Revenue of Exciſe, equal in Value to the Intereſt of each Reſpective Debt, after the Rate of Six Pounds <hi>per cent. per Annum,</hi> with a Clauſe of Redemption upon his Majeſty's paying the Principal-Money, with the Arrears of Rent: The ſaid Rent or Annual Sums to be paid Quarterly upon Talleys to be ſtruck in the Receipt of the Exchequer upon the Commiſſioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Exciſe; And his ſaid Majeſty, by the ſaid Patents, Directs and Commands the Treaſurer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Barons and Officers of the Exchequer of the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors, That they do from Time to Time perform all Acts neceſſary for the conſtant payment of the Money; and from time to time Levy and Strike Talleys without any further Warrant; ſo that thoſe Yearly Sums may be conſtantly paid without any further or other Warrant, to be ſued for from the King, his Heirs or Succeſſors: And if the Money ſhould happen to be paid into the Receipt of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, that then the High-Treaſurer, and Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, Under-Treaſurer, Chamberlains and Barons of the Exchequer for the Time being, and all other Officers and Miniſters of the Exchequer, and of the Receipt thereof, are authorized and required to pay out of ſuch Moneys as ſhall be ſo paid into the Exchequer, or elſewhere, ſo much as ſhall be in Arrear, without any further or other Warrant; and the ſaid Payments to be preferred before any other Payment out of the ſame, by Vertue or Colour of any Warrant, Order or Directions whatſoever, of any After-date, excepting for the Management of the ſaid Revenue, and about 36209 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> 4½ a Year to the then Queen-Conſort and the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> Alſo his Majeſty thereby Granted, That thoſe Letters Patents ſhould be Expounded and taken moſt favourably and beneficially for the Patentees, and their Aſſigns; alſo Covenanted to make further Aſſurance, if required: And on the 23d of <hi>May</hi> 1677, Ordered in Council, That the ſaid Letters Patents ſhould be printed, and made publick for the Information and Satisfaction of the Creditors of the ſaid Goldſmiths.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1683"/>
            <p>And purſuant thereto, the ſaid Patentees, and their Aſſigns, were paid in the Reigns of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second and King <hi>James</hi> the Second, to <hi>Lady-day</hi> 1683; but not any part ſince that time, notwithſtanding all due Applications to that purpoſe. Which Occaſioned the Proprietors to have many Thoughts which way to be Relieved: And upon their applying to the Members of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, to know if it was not proper for them to Offer their Caſe to their Committee of Agrievances; They adviſed firſt to proſecute their Legal Remedy, which through great Difficulties hath been Effected by Ten Years Labour, and great Charge: Their Titles under the ſaid Patents have been ſolemnly allowed to be good, by the ſeveral Judgments given in the Court ot Exchequer, for the Patentees and their Aſſigns. And although by Writs of Error the ſaid Barons Judgments were brought before the then Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal in the Exchequer-Chamber, where the Judges of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> and <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> all agreed, That thoſe Patentees, and their Aſſigns, have a Legal Title: Alſo all the Judges but One agreed, That the Juriſdiction of the Court of Exchequer (according to ancient Preſidents) is ſufficient, and ought to direct Payments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1696"/> of Money out of the Exchequer,  or elſewhere, when a Legal Title is brought before them: But the ſaid Judgments of the Barons being Reverſed by the Lord-Keeper, and a Writ of Error being allowed in Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi>'s Cauſe againſt the ſaid Judgment of Reverſal, the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, the Houſe of Lords had the Records of the ſaid Proceedings brought before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1699"/> their Lordſhips; and upon their hearing Counſel on both ſides, as alſo the Judges Opinions, their Lordſhips Reverſed the ſaid Lord-Keeper's Judgment of Reverſal; and affirmed the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Barons of the Court of Exchequer, and Remitted the ſame to the ſaid Barons, to make Execution accordingly; which the Barons have alſo Awarded, by their Writ of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, carrying with it a <hi>Liberate</hi> or Warrant, to the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, and Chamberlains of the Receipt, to pay the Arrears to <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 1699; and that for the Quarterly payments after the ſaid time, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> upon the Commiſſioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Exciſe, to the ſaid <hi>Williamſon,</hi> as they grow due, purſuant to the ſaid Letters Patents; and accordingly Demands have been made by the ſaid <hi>Williamſon</hi> of the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, and Chamberlains of the Receipt, who have made payment thereon.</p>
            <p>☞ If Demanded, What does theſe Proprietors expect from the Parliament, now they are to provide for Deficiencies, and the Nation's Safety <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Anſwered, They neither deſign to hinder other Buſineſs, nor expect any new Fund; but pray, that they may enjoy the Fruits of their Legal Eſtates, according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief which the Law hath given them; and not be obſtructed therein, by a Scruple made by the King's Counſel in the Court of Exchequer, when the Barons Awarded the ſaid Writ of Execution: <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is not any Saving for theſe Proprietors Eſtates out of the Hereditary Exciſe, which is one of the Revenues in the Act, for Granting to His Majeſty a further Subſidy of Tunnage and Poundage, towards Raiſing the Yearly Sum of Seven hundred thouſand Pounds, for the Service of His Majeſty's Houſhold, and other Uſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Overplus is not to be diſpoſed of without Authority of Parliament: So from thence they infer, That theſe Proprietors are thereby debarred the Payment of their Annual Rents or Sums, from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 1699, when that Act Commenced, during His Majeſty's Life; And the ſaid Barons refuſing to give their Opinions of the ſaid Act as to this Matter, unleſs it were with the Reſt of the Judges, they Awarded the ſaid Execution for Payment out of the Money ariſing from the Hereditary Exciſe; <hi>Not otherwiſe diſpoſed or applied by Authority of Parliament; nor forbid or reſtrained to be diſpoſed or applied without Authority of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon a Petition in the Honourable Houſe of Commons (at the Paſſing that Act) for a Saving of theſe Proprietors Legal Rights, it was there debated, and agreed to be needleſs, becauſe that Bill no ways affected their Eſtates, nor any Saving made therein for any other Perſons, who are alſo Entituled unto ſeveral Eſtates from the Crown: However, to ſatisfy them it ſhould not Injure them, was put in the word <hi>hereafter</hi> in the Sentence, That all Grants and Diſpoſitions whatſoever hereafter to be made of ſuch Overplus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (ſhall be void; which their Counſel alſo took to be an Allowance of their Patents.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty having the Four and Twenty Thouſand Pounds a Year, which is Excepted in their ſaid Patents for the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and alſo the Remainder of the Hereditary Exciſe, which was King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's, after Payment of the ſaid Patentees and their Aſſigns what due to them, they could not have been part of the Proviſion for His Majeſty's Houſhold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſs the Act for Raiſing that Duty had been mentioned in the Preamble amongſt the other Revenues, out of which His Majeſty's ſaid Seven Hundred Thouſand Pounds a Year ſhould ariſe; but all thoſe Branches were His Majeſty's Revenues, excepting the Cuſtoms therein mentioned, before that Act was made; ſo they neither needed Granting, or was thereby Granted to His Majeſty, but ſtood in all reſpects betwixt the King and private Perſons, in the ſame Condition as they were in, before the Paſſing of that Act.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Act did not Commence, until near Two years after it was Enacted, that the Talleys therein mentioned might firſt be paid; but there is not therein any word tending to a Reſumption of any Grants or Annual Payments; nor a Saving for any perſons Rights or Titles out of any of thoſe Revenues, not ſo much as for Charges in Collecting; And in the Enacting-part is only an Appropriating of the King's Clear Money out of all thoſe Branches of Revenue. But the ſaid Scruple tends to the Ruin of Thouſands of the Subjects of this Kingdom, by depriving them of the Fruits of their ſaid Eſtates in Fee, unleſs they ſhall be Redeemed by Payment of the Principal-Money, and the Arrears thereof; Although in the ſaid Act, neither their Perſons nor Titles are ſo much as mentioned, nor any Reaſon therein given, for doing theſe proprietors ſuch an Injury, whoſe Titles being purchaſed for valuable Conſiderations, they are in no particular inferior to the beſt of Titles from the Crown.</p>
            <div type="considerations">

               <list>
                  <item>I. That theſe Patentees Moneys which were advanced by Encouragement of the ſaid Act of Parliament of the 19 <hi>Car.</hi> 2<hi>di,</hi> were in an unuſual manner ſtopped in the Exchequer; and that they were forced for their Relief, to deliver up their former Orders and Securities; and in lieu thereof, to accept of Patents for Annual Sums payable out of the Hereditary Revenue of Exciſe.</item>
                  <item>II. That the ſaid Exciſe is neither part of the ancient Demeſnes, nor came to the Crown by the Expence of either Subjects Blood or their Money; but it is an Eſtate in Fee, which was Granted by the Parliament to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, in lieu of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Tenures <hi>in Capite,</hi> and by Knight's Service and Purveyance, which were Prerogatives thought grievous to the Subjects; and by the same Act releaſed and diſcharged; ſo that Revenue was no ways appropriated to publick Uſes.</item>
