            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not the leaſt, but the greateſt kinde of folly, when a man hauing but a little ſcience, preſumeth to teach not onely thoſe which haue onely ſcience, but ſuch as haue moſt certaine experience. For mine owne part (among many) I am moſt free from this guilt: though for the good of many I haue publiſhed this Treatiſe which will make me thereby ſeeme guiltie. Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Booke or Treatiſe is a collection of ſuch notes as haue bin by me ſelected out of the beſt Tacticke writers both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Moderne. All which I haue illustrated with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and precepts, the better to instruct all yong Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; who by reading them may get much knowledge. But it may be theſe braue ſpirits are minded to get knowledge by experience, and not to ioyne experience vnto knowledge: therefore they affect the bloody fields of <hi>Africke</hi> better then the beautifull Schooles in <hi>Greece.</hi> Well, let them doe ſo; but in my opinion it ſeemes a farre better and ſhorter way (for them) to attaine to the name of worthy perfect Captaines, to ioyne experience vnto knowledge, then to get knowledge by Experience. For Mans life is ſhort and ſubiect to many caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, oftentimes it is cut off before it can come to any ſuch perfection as is required in an excellent man of War; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſmall experience with diligent reading, and perfect lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of feats of Warre may frame and make many politicke Captaines in a ſmall time.</p>
            <p>I doe not meane that knowledge without experience can doe any great thing at all; but being ioyned both together, doubtleſſe they may be as able to bring to paſſe as great and
<pb facs="tcp:21471:5"/>
as merueilous things in valiant men in theſe our dayes, as they haue done to others before our time: To which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience alone brought them, but diligent learning and ſtudy of the Art of Warre, written and ſet forth by Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Writers and Poets. Innumerable are the Bookes which this age doth afford of the like ſubiect for their direction: the number of which I haue augmented by two; namely, <hi>The Character of Warre,</hi> and <hi>The Proſpectiue Glaſſe of Warre. The Character of Warre,</hi> doth instruct them in the vſe of the Postures, in the vſe of Facing, Wheeling, Countermarching, Doubling, Distances, and the like. And how to Command a Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The proſpectiue Glaſſe of Warre</hi> doth instruct them how to Victuall an Army, how to prouide money to pay Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, how to finde out the enemies purpoſes, Traps, and Stratagems; how to direct an Army to march either by day or by night; how to Embattell; how to behaue themſelues in battell, when to fight, when to auoide fight, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent things worthy of their knowledge. Then let them read, and reading they will learne to iudge aright of the Author; who puts a difference betweene the ſtate of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and the ſtate of Captaines; betweene the skill to read in Schooles, and the knowledge to rule an Army; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſcience that wiſe men haue in Books, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that others haue in war; betweene the skill to write with the pen, and others to write with the ſword; betweene one that for his pastime is ſet round with deskes of Bookes, and another in perill of life, encompaſſed with troopes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Therefore preſumes not to teach any ſuch graue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Souldiers; onely records what they haue done, or can doe; which he recounts to others to imitate, who it may be haue neither ſeene nor read them. Spare not then to iudge and cenſure him who will euer remaine thine.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Prouide for victuals before you vndertake the warre, for then is the time of beſt prouiſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In your warre begun, ſtore your ſelfe with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, either neere hand or farre off. And conduct it with good and ſtrong conuoyes, leſt the Enemy ſurpriſe it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In your Townes of warre, either without or within, haue great ſtore of Milles to grinde corne to ſuſtaine you the better in a ſeidge: And bee ſure to looke well vnto them, &amp; ſufficiently to defend them, eſpecially thoſe that are without the Towne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you beſeidge Townes or Cities, you ought to hurle downe all Milles within and without, and to cut of the water from them, if you cannot keepe them for your owne vſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Prouide that ſuch neighbours as dwell neere vnto you, may ſafely bring victuals into your Campe without danger of the Enemy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In caſe of neceſſity ſend your Souldiers into their Prouince to abide &amp; be relieued with victuals for a time. Example,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galli</hi> being in ſome diſtreſſe of victuals, chooſe the Citie <hi>Attella,</hi> a Citie full of victuals, to ſtay there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till by their friends they might bee relieued, both with victuals and Souldiers. In which Citie their Souldiers for a while were largely relieued and freely, with or at the charges of the Cittizens.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:21471:7"/>
7. Seeke by all meanes to intercept your Enemies victuals; and lay ſeidge to thoſe places from whence their chiefe reliefe of victuals doth come. Example,</p>
               <p>The Captaines of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſift, in the warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> lacked victuals ſomewhat, where on the other ſide, the <hi>Germans</hi> lying in a plaine fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Country, had plenty of victuals, vpon the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aoundance of the Country, being large; and partly becauſe certaine friendly Cities and Countries lay behinde them on the otherſide of the Riuer. For the ſame purpoſe <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour went about for to gaine the Cities ſtanding about the Riuer from them, and ſo the aduantage of the ſame Riuer with victuals: which was a braue act.</p>
               <p>Like this was that of <hi>Francis Sforſa,</hi> who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> or Army at <hi>Nouaro,</hi> had great comfort of victuals from <hi>Biagraſſa,</hi> he beſeidged that Towne ſuddenly, &amp; tooke it: by which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hee tooke from them their chiefe victuals: And ſhortly after the <hi>French</hi> Army was faine to remoue.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If you are for to iourney towards the warres, iourney in a plentifull Country, and which hath in long time beene in peace. Thus did the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the eight when he came to the Citie of <hi>Aſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Alſo you are to iourney in your Confederates Country, and who vpon very great occaſion is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your ſociety, for ſuch will ayde you liberally. This was likewiſe practiſed by <hi>Charles</hi> the eight when he inuaded <hi>Naples:</hi> For other wayes of getting of victuals, and preſeruing them ſo got, peruſe theſe preſedents.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Some Kings, Captaines, and Generals, which haue either taken, or ſaued ſome Citie which was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21471:8"/>
likely to be loſt, haue cauſed their Souldiers to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued of victuals in the ſame; in the houſes of them which were their Enemies.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Some haue vſed for to ſend certaine Captaines of Souldiers into other Cities, for to eaſe the preſent ſpending in the place where they were.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Some haue vſed to ſend all the poore and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent people out of their Citie ſo beſeidged, that their victuals might laſt the longer.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Some would ſuffer none either to returne or to haue reliefe of victuals: Which vnreaſonable hard vſage needed not, if Gouernors would before hand, and before need, prepare both for abundance of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, or elſe withall take order for the moderate ſpending of their victuals: For negligence of prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of victuals in time, and miſpending, or elſe lacke of good keeping or ordering them which you haue, ſhould be well ſeene vnto. I pretermit this. And I fall vpon the prouiſion of money for the payment of your Souldiers wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Precepts for the payment of Souldiers wages.</note> Hauing money ſufficient, it is beſt to pay your Souldiers beforehand, or monthly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you be bare of money, pay ſome wages, and procure that the Souldiers may haue victuals good cheape all the while you lacke money, or imploy them where continuall ſpoyle may be had.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you haue little money, pay a part of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in the hands of ſuch ſouldiers as are moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make a Mutiny.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some Generals when as their ſouldiers haue beene ready to reuoult or mutiny for lacke of pay, haue ſtraight way brought them to the battell, for this purpoſe; if victory happened on their ſide, they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21471:8"/>
would pay their ſouldiers of the ſpoyle of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or elſe if their Army were ouerthrowne, then they ſhould be cleerely and well diſcharged of the grieuous and dangerous complaint.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some haue cauſed the Cittizens of Cities to receiue ſouldiers into their houſes for to giue vnto them meate, drinke, and lodging, and to giue wages vnto the ſame ſouldiers. Thus did <hi>Anthony de Leua</hi> at <hi>Millan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was he that forbad all his Cittizens for to eate any bread but onely ſuch as ſhould bee bought of him: For which purpoſe he appointed in euery ſtreete certaine houſes where bread ſhould be ſold, at what price he luſted, and none durſt do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. By which kinde of means he got into his hands all ſuch kinde of money as any Citizen of <hi>Millan</hi> had in his Cheſts, or elſe could make or reſerue by any meanes or wayes; with which he payd his ſouldiers. This was his way, but ſome haue found other wayes beſides theſe.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <note place="margin">Wayes to get money to pay Souldiers.</note> 5. Some Generals haue gaged all their plate and Iewels vnto rich monyed men, to pay their ſouldiers.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <note place="margin">Charles the 8. of France.</note> 6. Some Kings haue borrowed all the Iewels and ornaments of certaine great Ladies or Eſtates, which were their friends and kinſmen, and haue pawned the ſame to Vſurers for to pay their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Borrow largely of your Confederates money, who ſeeketh your ſociety in his warres: for his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall purpoſe: The <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. could do this paſſing well.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Seeke of ſuch a Confederate any other ayde or furniture for your warres, which furniture can
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21471:9"/>
ſtay your laying out of much expence.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Seeme (to ſuch a Confederate) to deferre your warres that you may the better wring forth of him greater ſummes. It may bee he may proue like <hi>Lodowicke Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Millan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Duke, ſeeing <hi>Charles</hi> the eight make no haſte to inuade <hi>Naples</hi> according vnto promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Lodowicke</hi> was to worke a feate by <hi>Charles</hi> his comming, which otherwiſe hee was very hardly to do; he ſent his ſonne in Law with a braue Captaine into <hi>France</hi> vnto the King, offering him money, ſhippes, horſemen, and many other things of great importance, which the King accepted, and for that cauſe before did ſtay the warre. Thus much of this, which ſhall ſuffice for the wayes of getting of money to pay ſouldiers, and likewiſe for victualling your Army. I will now ſhew the wayes by which you may finde out your Enemies purpoſes, Trapps, and Stratagems. To doe which, well obſerue theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Waies to finde out the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies purpoſes Traps, and Stratagems.</note> 1. Firſt, you are to ſuſpect vehemently, or elſe to feare, how your Enemy hath an invention by ſome ſubtiltie or politique ſtratagem, or inuention, or elſe ſome crafty deceite or wile to entrap, beguile, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow your Army.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next for ſuch intents or purpoſes, you ſhould entertaine very good and ſundry eſpialls, who by all meanes are to be very attentiue, inquiſitiue, curious, liberall, ſuſpitious, and bold.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Which eſpecially ſhould remaine or abide neer the Court of your Enemy, or elſe neere vnto the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of your Enemies, or in ſome friends Country of your Enemies, or neere ſome neighbour of your

Enemies, or in the way of your Enemies, or elſe a Common Trauellor, or elſe a Studient in the Land of the Enemies, or a ſubiect of reputation in the Land of your Enemies, or elſe a Merchant or common ſeller of wares, or a Barber, or a Victualler in your Enemies Country.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Which kinde of eſpialls, you are neuer to truſt throughly, but euer to bee iealous of them, and to weigh and conferre their reports with the reports of other eſpialls, and with likely-hoods, oppertunities, and reaſons.</p>
               <p>Haue eſpialls continually, if it be poſſible, in your Enemies Army.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Langraue,</hi> with other Captaines of the Germans, (againſt the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt by name) had in <hi>Charles</hi> his Army <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt Emperour lacked good Eſpials, for which cauſe he left many things vndone, which had beene for his ſingular profit, if hee had knowne of ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>Therefore prouide you good Eſpialls; which Eſpials are ſo neceſſary in the wars as any thing elſe: for by them you ſhall vnderſtand how your Enemie will fight, what hee will doe againſt your Army, Marching, Fighting, or Flying. Which motions, (or rather principall heads of the Art of warre) ſhall be handled in the foure next Chapters following.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am now to enter by degrees vpon theſe foure principall heads of the Art of warre: namely, Marching, Embattel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Fighting, and Flying from an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. All which I will deliuer with as good method, plainneſſe, and breuitie as I can. I am to begin with Marching: wherein I pray obſerue my method and order; which ſhall be, fiirſt by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to preſcribe it: Then by Example to approue it; Example being the life of precept. I begin.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Precepts for Marching.</note> 1. In Marching you muſt bee very miſtruſtfull of your Enemie, leſt he entrap you with Ambuſhes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt therefore appoint ſome to march before to diſcouer ſuſpected places; as Woodes, Mountaines, Foreſts, Rockes, Banckes of Riuers, Caues, Hills, hollow and deepe wayes. The moſt of which are rough and intricate, and ſcarce paſſable for the heauy Armed and horſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The fitteſt for this ſeruice are your Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21471:10"/>
I, and your Dragons to ioyne with them, for they may alight from their Horſes and ſerue on foot.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You muſt march ſometimes in one forme, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another, according to the place and occaſion offered. Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> at the Riuer <hi>Granicus</hi> marched with his horſe foremoſt to paſſe the Riuer, and to aſſaile the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had oppoſed their Horſe againſt him on the bankes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Marching through the ſtreights to fight the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of <hi>Iſſos,</hi> he marched with his Horſe behinde his Foot, becauſe he was vncertaine how neere the Enemy lay, and was loath to put them to hazzard before they had libertie of ground to order themſelues, and might haue aſſiſtance of the Foot. At the Riuer of <hi>Ister</hi> hee did the like; for hauing paſt the Riuer, hee marched through a Corne field, and therefore ſo marſhalled them for feare of an Ambuſh. Otherwiſe it was his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in marching (as it is the manner alſo at this day) to diſpoſe his Horſe halfe behinde, and halfe before: the Carriage in the midſt, or Otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But how to March properly both by day and by night, with your Carriage truely placed, and euery thing rightly ordered, is a point worthy to be taken notice of: Briefely thus.</p>
               <p>Being to March in the day, obſerue the manner of March now in vſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let ſome Dragons and Musketteers march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to repreſſe the Enemies incurſions, and to ſearch Woods and Forreſts for Ambuſhes, and to ſurpriſe ſtraight Wayes, Bridges and Foords. Send after them your Pyoneers to mend the wayes, to cut the woods that are in the way, leaſt by bad way the Army be tyred.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:21471:11"/>
8. Let the Foot of the Vantguard (or right wing) follow, enery battalion there of in order, hauing halfe the horſe of the Army before them, and all their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and Carriage behinde them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. After let the battalions of the battell follow with all their baggage and carriage in the Reare, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Let the battalions of the Reareward (or left wing) follow, with all their baggage or carriage behinde them. Let euery one of the battalions haue their ſhoot before and behinde. And let the remainder of your Horſe bring vp the Reare. As for your Ordnance, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute that (as your Carriage) both behinde the Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, the battell, and the Rereward; the better to ſerue againſt all attempts.</p>
               <p n="10">10. At night, quarter the Battalions of the Vantgard all in one place; thoſe of the Battell all in another; and thoſe of the Reareward all by themſelues, but not too farre a ſunder for feare of danger.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In the morning being to diſlodge: Firſt ſhoot off one peece of Ordnance, a little after that another, and ſo a third in his time. Shooting the firſt, the Army takes notice you will diſlodge; therefore they truſſe vp their baggage and load it. Shooting the ſecond, they take vp their Armes and fall into ranke: ſhooting the third, they ſet forward to march. Thus Graue <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> did diſlodge his Souldiers. <hi>Veſpatian</hi> did it by the ſound of a Trumpet (as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> doth report) in the third Booke of his Antiquities, Chap. 3.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Being to march in the night obſerue the <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> order.</p>
               <p>Send your baggage and carriage before with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient guard. Then follow, firſt with your Pikemen, then with your light Armed (being Musketteers;) next
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21471:11"/>
with all your Horſe in the reare; the better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by breake of day to come all together into one place, as ought to be. This way your Army in the night is eaſily kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and is ſooneſt eſpied if it breake.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Being to inuade an Enemies Countrie, march with your Carriage in the Reare. When you doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march from an Enemies Countrie, let your Carriage be in the Front, vnleſſe great ſtore of Enemies be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to intercept it; then you muſt place it in the midſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now in fight you may diſpoſe of it fiue manner of wayes; either before the Army, or behinde, or on the one flanke, or on the other, or in the midſt. Before the Army, when you feare to be charged behinde: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Army, when you lead towards the Enemy: when you feare to be charged in Flanke, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide: in the midſt, when a hollow battell is needfull and fit. This laſt was practiſed by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Horatio Vere</hi> in the <hi>Pallatinate,</hi> and by the <hi>Graecians</hi> (as <hi>Zenophon</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in his third booke of the Aſcent of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Being to march through a wood obſerue <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons</hi> counſell. Let your Foot and Horſe in order ſingle themſelues as the way fals out, and you ſhall make your paſſage the more ſecure and eaſie: <hi>Zenophon</hi> did thus, as you may read in his ſixt book of the Aſcent of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. It were not amiſſe to haue ſome Musketteers to march on the ſides of the Wood, to ſecure the reſt within.</p>

                  <note place="margin">How to troule an enemy out of a wood.</note> 17. If your Enemy be in a Wood, Fenne, Hill, Fort, Towne, or other place of ſtrength, that admitteth no acceſſe, ſend your Musketteers to ſhew themſelues, and with a brauado to toule him out of his aduantage, and bring him into the field, where he may the more eaſily

               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> leading his Army againſt the Tribals that had hid themſelues in a wood, commanded his Archers and ſlingers to run out and ſhoot, and ſling among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to ſee if he could toule them into the plaine. The Archers and ſlingers ſpared not to let flye, and the Tribals being wounded with arrows, threw themſelues out of the wood with all ſpeed, to fall vpon the vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Archers. Then <hi>Alexander</hi> with his Horſe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged them, and being ouerborne by the Horſe they fled through the Wood to the Riuer.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Alexander</hi> whenſoeuer he was to vſe expedition, marched away with the Horſe and light armed, leauing the Armed to come after. The Armed are for a firme and ſtedfaſt fight, not for Concurſions.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Being then forſome farre, yet ſodaine attempt, leaue your Pikemen behinde, and march away with your Horſe and Musketeers: for when celeritie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, who ſo fit to be imployed, as they who haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder their ſpeed.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Being to march againſt an Enemy in his owne Countrie, giue the word to come to ſuch a <hi>Prouince,</hi> but Inuade another: by this you ſhall deceiue your Enemy.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Precepts for the ordering of your Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels.</note> 1. You are to chuſe your place both for Rainging of your battels before fight, and in the fight of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that the ſame place be able to containe your whole Army without diſturbance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next in ordering your battels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt conſider what dangers are likely, or elſe may happen by cauſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or fortune, and to prouide for remedies by your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beforehand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Likewiſe you are to conſider, that you ought not to order your battels in all caſes and reſpects alike, but very diuerſly as your caſe ſhall require. For you are to order your battels according, partly vnto the nature of the ground, partly vnto the quantity, quality, or regard of your Enemies Army, and partly vnto ſuch reſpect as is fitteſt againſt ſuch orders or battels of your Enemies beſt knowne to your ſelfe for your beſt aduantage.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You are to order your Army into conuenient parts, and to appoint euery one his place, number, and action.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You are to order your battels, that no part of your Army be any diſturbance to any part of your battels.</p>

               <p n="7">7. You are with diſcretion to learne and know the equality and inequality of the number of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army with your owne Army. For you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moſt aptly order your Army in iuſt battels, for to be ordered according to diſcipline of warre, before you know and conſider throughly, the nature, force, and weakeneſſe of either of your Armies.</p>

               <p n="9">9. Conſider alſo what kindes of aduantages the times of the yeare or the day affordeth, which can bee had by your Enemies or your ſelfe, or elſe of the Ayre, or elſe of Tempeſts paſt or preſent.</p>

               <p n="11">11. Which well knowne and conſidered, you are then to order your battels, to take your ground, for to plant your ordnance, to auoyd your dangers, to take your aduantages, for to worke your ſtratagems alſo for your moſt comfort, and ſo to fight accordingly. But how to order your battels, and ſo to fight accordingly, is to bee diſcuſſed of more largely; for therein is the chiefe ſubſtance of the Art Military, in which ſome Generals haue beene more expert then others.</p>
               <p>Excellent Generals (of old) commonly did vſe to ordaine of footmen apt for to fight, three great battels; a <hi>Vantgard,</hi> a <hi>Battell,</hi> and a <hi>Rearward;</hi> and two wings of their horſemen: And when they came to fight, they did ſet them for the moſt part in an euen front: The Battell in the midſt; on the right hand the Vantgard, which was called the right winge; on the left the Reareward, which was called the left winge. Their order we doe in a manner follow: For wee haue Vantgard, Battell, and Reareward, which wee place in Front as they did; onely we differ in the kinde of Embattailing. By kinde of Embattailing, I meane not bils, &amp; bowes; but groſſe Bodies: For they parted their Army into three parts,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21471:15"/>
and Embattailed them into three groſſe Bodies. Wee diuide our Army into three parts, but not into ſuch groſſe Bodies; as for example, Say wee haue 12000. Foot, and 4000. Horſe; if we bring them into one front without ſeconds, we do thus.</p>
               <p>In our Vantgard, or right winge, we put 3000. men, diuiding them into three battalions, ſometimes into more, as we ſee occaſion. In our Battell wee put 6000. men diuiding them into three battalions, euery one containing 2000. a piece, for the battalions in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, muſt exceede thoſe in the wings.</p>
               <p>In our Reareward or left winge, we put 3000. men, diuiding them into as many battalions, with as many men in either of them, as was to bee in the Vantgard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned. Our horſe we place halfe in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge, and halfe in the left winge, the ordinary place for horſe. For proofe of this, looke into the ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and you ſhall ſee them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to put two Regiments into one battalion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but one, and ſometimes they will make two bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions of one Regiment. Wee as they are not tyed to any certaine number, but may vary as we ſee occaſions.</p>
               <p>Occaſions are produced by the Enemy, by the ground, by our ſelues to our beſt aduantage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do accordingly. If our number bee more, wee haue the more battalions; if leſſe, the fewer, vnleſſe ſome pollicie be vſed.</p>
               <p>Some Generals haue Martialed their Army onely into one Battell, ſome into two, ſome into three, ſome into foure, ſome into fiue, ſome into ſix, and ſome into nine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> at the battell of <hi>Taro,</hi> did martiall their Army into nine battalions; whereof three was to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21471:15"/>
fight with the Enemy, other three to bee aide to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three fighting, and the other three was appointed for ſundry other purpoſes and effects.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Ferdenand,</hi> beſides his ordinary battalions, had another ſtanding aloofe behinde his other battailes, for to take aduantage, or elſe to helpe in neceſſitie as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerued; which were light horſemen.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Surry,</hi> at the battell of <hi>Sloddon,</hi> had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beſides his ordinary Battels, one battell of light horſemen, with which hee diſcomfitted <hi>Iames</hi> (the fourth) King of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> at the ſame battell of <hi>Sloddon,</hi> did martiall his Army into ſix battailes, without horſe reliefe, or ſeconds, which loſt him the field. For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with their horſe (when the King had the better) would preſently giue vpon his Flanks, ſo ſnatcht the victory out of his hands, hauing neither Horſe nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds to recouer it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Argonians,</hi> haue diuided their Army into fiue Battels; which battels in forme of ſtraight or direct hornes, were extended from the great battell or midle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But theſe were partly Horſe and Foote.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heluetians,</hi> haue martialed their Army into three battels, without Horſe or ſeconds; ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one battell onely of footmen, which was their vſuall forme by cuſtome. But not to be imitated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> haue martialed their Army into two battels; one of footmen in one winge, and another of horſemen in another winge, all in an euen Front. Now they do otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> haue martialed their Armed foote into three Battels. The firſt ſubſiſting of the <hi>Haſtatij,</hi> the ſecond of the <hi>Principes,</hi> the third of the

                  <hi>Triarij:</hi> with <hi>Velites</hi> to either of them, and Horſe in the winges. How their <hi>Velites</hi> (light Armed men) were placed, being too weake to deale with Horſemen, or armed Foote (without aduantage) I will ſhew you hereafter.</p>
               <p>Some haue ordered a weake battell of Foot or horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, againſt a ſtrong battell of their Enemies Foote or Horſemen, thereby to bring their Enemies ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome ſtratagem, which was wiſely done by the great Captaine <hi>Gonſaluo,</hi> againſt the <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> This <hi>Gonſaluo</hi> ſent a noble <hi>Spaniard</hi> called <hi>Mondotius,</hi> againſt the Generall of the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to fight with his Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which <hi>Mondotius,</hi> had a company of light horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for to inuade the Reare of the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and with him likewiſe went two Cohorts of Calliuer-ſhot, which kept company in the front almoſt with them, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as in two ſpred winges. <hi>Mondotius</hi> horſe left theſe ſhot, and inuaded freſhly the hindermoſt of the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> barbed horſemen, with fury ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Mondotius</hi> light horſemen: <hi>Mondotius</hi> light horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men retired as though they were not able to encounter the barbed Horſemen: thus flying, cauſed the barbed horſemen to perſue out of order: Then the Calliuer-ſhot keeping aloofe off (about a furlong) and in forme of a halfe Moone, ſhot of vpon the <hi>French</hi> barbed horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, before &amp; on the Flanks. <hi>Gonſaluo</hi> thereupon ſent a company of his barbed horſemen to the aide of his light horſemen flying, &amp; his Calliuers fighting: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his light horſemen returned, and ioyned with their owne barbed horſemen that came for aide, and both of them in order, did ſet vpon the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> out of order; the ſhot continuing on both ſides, and backes as before. Which kinde of order (you ſee) and flying,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21471:16"/>
and ayde of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was for to bring firſt ſuch <hi>French</hi> force to diſorder, and ſo thereby to diſcomfort them the eaſlier, which was done to their mindes.</p>
               <p>Some haue rainged certaine files of ſhot before eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry battalion, to skirmiſh with the Enemy a farre off, and neere at hand, thereby to weaken him by degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did ioyne battell. This was pactiſed by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth the <hi>French</hi> King, againſt <hi>Albertus</hi> Arch Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Gouernor of <hi>Brabant,</hi> in the name of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> when he came to raiſe the ſeidge at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.</hi> The forme of whoſe battell I will now deſcribe both by word and figure: But firſt let me declare his number. For his number, it was 12000. foote, and 4000. Horſe. Now hee ordered them in this manner: His foote was Martialed into nine Battalions; three of which were for the right winge, three for the battell, and three for the left winge; The three battalions on the right winge, were two Regiments of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and one <hi>French</hi> Regiment; each flankt with Muskettiers, and containing very neigh 1000. Foote a peece; before euery one of which were placed nine files of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; three in the right angle, three on the left, and three in the midſt before them: (peruſe the firſt figure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) euery file contained ten men. The three battalions for the Battell, were three Regiments of <hi>Swize,</hi> flankt with Muskettiers, with nine files of Muskettiers a peece placed before them as the other, onely theſe Regiments contained more men then the reſt, being together about fiue thonſand. The three battailions for the left winge, were three <hi>French</hi> Regiments, embattailed as the reſt, with Muskettiers before them in the ſame forme as the other; euery battalion containing aboue 1000. The King had 12 field Peeces, which to his commendations

he planted Souldier like; Three foreright, three flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſix on either winge to annoy the Enemy, both in front and flancke. His Horſe was raunged without theſe, not forthright, but obliquewiſe, to encompaſſe the Enemy; being in number 4000. in each winge 2000. two hundered in Front, and 10. in depth; that the one halfe of the winge might giue the charge, the other bee their ſeconds. Behinde the King were his Trenches, guarded with 3000. Foote to defend him from the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Towne, therefore the King needed no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds at all. But if you would ſee 12000. Foote, and 4000. Horſe, embattailed both with ſeconds and aydes for all attempts, peruſe the ſecond Figure going before, (ioyned to that of the Kings.)</p>
               <p>Where you ſhall ſee 15. battalions of Foot, martialed in a manner after the <hi>French</hi> Kings forme, viz. In the Vantgard or right wing, are three battalions of 500. a peece, Flanckt with Muskettiers; before euery one of which are raunged ten files of Muskettiers; three in the right angle, three in the left, and foure in the midſt iuſt before them; euery file containing ten men, which ſhot are to make their way through the interuals of the battalions in the Reare of all, there to giue vpon the Enemies Flanks. In the Battell are three battalions, containing 3000. men, (a thouſand a peece) flankt with Muskettiers, and with Muskettiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in the ſame faſhion as the reſt. In the Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (or left winge) of the battell, are likewiſe three battalions of 500. a peece, Embattailed as the reſt, with Muskettiers before them, in the ſame forme as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Behinde theſe battalions (for ſeconds) are foure battalions of 500. a peece, ſtanding againſt the Interuals of their oppoſite battalions; which Interuals are 200.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21471:18"/>
foote broad, that the foure battalions may the better paſſe through them. Theſe foure battalions haue ſhot before them as the former, which with the reſt may march forth to skirmiſh with the Enemie; or ſtand ſtill to ſecond them vpon their retreate, before the Battels ioyne: after being in the Reare to giue vpon your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies flanks as the other. The reſt of the battalions are in Front but twelue foote diſtance one from another, and at three foote order.</p>
               <p>The diuiſions of Muskettiers are allowed ſix foote, that they may the better fall through, hauing giuen fire.</p>
               <p>In the Reare of all are two battalions, of a thouſand a peece, ſtanding iuſt behinde the three battalions of the Battell, about a furlong of. On the Flanks of theſe are 800, Horſe, 400. in each flanke, oblique wiſe, the better to ſtart forth and inuiron the Enemy. In like manner are the Horſe martialed in the outward flanks of the reſt, but in greater numbers. peruſe the Figure.</p>
               <p>By the winges of theſe two battalions are two field Peeces ready turned and bent to the Reare, to diſcharge vpon the Enemy, if he ſhould with Horſe or Foote giue vpon that part; if not, then theſe field Peeces may bee with eaſe brought from thence to ſome other place to annoy him other wayes.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt of the Ordance, I haue planted them vpon two Hils oppoſite againſt the Enemies flanks, thereby to diſtreſſe him. And for the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this, I haue planted 700. Muskettiers to guard them; and will ayde them with more if neede be.</p>
               <p>Now againſt this Battell hauing Ordnance in the Reare, and on the Hils, to diſtreſſe the Enemies Flanks, I oppoſe this Battell following.</p>

Here (or in the Figure going before) you ſee are ſixteene Battalions. The Ordnance planted both in the Wings and in the Front of the maine Battell. The Ordnance in the maine Battell, hath before them 400. Muskettiers, ranged in the ſame forme as the Enemies, the better to hide the deceit: for ſo ſoone as the Muskettiers are cleare of the Battell, the Ordnance are to diſcharge vpon the Enemy to breake his maine Battell; and then the other Battels are to march on to charge the Enemy in diſorder: the Horſe are martialled outward on the wings, and ſtand obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que wiſe to inuiron the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Now before the Horſe giue the charge, eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Musketties doe ſallie forth to ſurpriſe the Enemies Ordnance, being planting on the hils.</p>
               <p>The Figure doth demonſtrate it as plaine as can be, with the number of euery battalion; onely take notice that the ſhot before euery battalion are to make their paſſage through the interuals, and ſides of the battailes, in the Reare of all; from thence to giue vpon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Flankes, if occaſion be, otherwiſe to aide their own men in the Fight. All the ſhot before the battalions are in number 1200.</p>
               <p>This appointing of ſhot for to march before, and to ſurpriſe the enemies Ordnance (in ſuch a place of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage) was heretofore practiſed by ancient Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and lately by our great Commander Sir <hi>Horatio Vere</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> though the Battel were vnfought.</p>
               <p>The planting of Ordnance in the Front of the maine Battaile, betweene the interuals, to breake the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Battalia, was, and is at this day practiſed by the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and other Nations.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the placing of Ordnance in the Reare with ſeconds for all attempts, was, and is at this day practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21471:19"/>
both by <hi>Italians, French, Germanes,</hi> and other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals beſides.</p>
               <p>You ſee then that all this is no crotchet of mine (as the pacing of the ſhot before euery battalion was no crotchet of the <hi>French</hi> Kings) but the vſuall cuſtome of all Generals before and in his time.</p>
               <p>The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did continually obſerue it in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their <hi>Velites</hi> before euery <hi>Maniple.</hi> Their <hi>Velites</hi> were their light Armed, ſuch as vſed throwing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons (in Latine <hi>Maſsilia)</hi> as Bowes, Slings and Darts. To a popular Legion they allotted 1200. <hi>Velites.</hi> 1200. <hi>Hastalij,</hi> 1200 <hi>Principes,</hi> and 600. <hi>Triarij.</hi> Theſe made vp a Legion. This Legion of 4200. foot was deuided into 30. <hi>Maniples;</hi> ten of the <hi>Hastatij,</hi> ten of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes,</hi> and ten of the <hi>Triarij.</hi> The ten of the <hi>Hastatij</hi> made the firſt Battell, the ten of the <hi>Principes</hi> the ſecond Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, the ten of the <hi>Triarij</hi> the third Battell: if but one Legion were Embattailed. To each of theſe Battailes were allotted 400. <hi>Velites,</hi> fortie to a <hi>Maniple:</hi> the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels containing 3000. of well armed men, beſides the <hi>Velites</hi> which were but lightly armed. How theſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples</hi> were placed: how far diſtant each Battell ſtood one from another: the order of the <hi>Velites:</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Horſe, and how ranged by Troopes, muſt not be paſſed ouer. Briefly thus.</p>
               <p>Thee ten <hi>Maniples</hi> of the <hi>Hastatij</hi> they ſet in an euen Front, leauing ſo much diſtance or void ground betwixt euery <hi>Maniple,</hi> as a <hi>Maniple</hi> it ſelfe tooke vp in ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. At a reaſonable ſpace behinde, were the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> placed in as many <hi>Maniples;</hi> but ſo, that their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples</hi> ſtood directly behinde the void places of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatij.</hi> And againſt the bodies of the <hi>Hastatij,</hi> they left likewiſe ſpaces in the <hi>Principes,</hi> to the end the <hi>Hastatij</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, at a larger diſtance behinde theſe were the <hi>Triarij</hi> ſet, aud deuided with ſpaces betwixt euery <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niple,</hi> which ſpaces were great enough to receiue the <hi>Principes</hi> in caſe they retired alſo: but how bigge the croſſe interuals were I cannot truely and ſoundly ſet downe; rather I beleeue they varied, according to the Forces and will of the Generall. <hi>Polibus</hi> noteth that <hi>Haniball</hi> in his <hi>Affrican</hi> Battell remoued the third Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell (for ſo he had diuided them according to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> faſhion) more then a furlong from the ſecond. And although I dare not affirme that the <hi>Romans</hi> did the like, yet may I probably gueſſe it differed not much, becauſe they had neede to haue ſuch ſpace to retire, and to auoid the mingling and confuſion of Troopes. Now the direct waies were indifferent, ſometimes of one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſometimes of another, as vſe required: if the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were there placed as often as they were, they had neede be broad, ſo large as to receiue them with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples;</hi> yet not ſo large as the croſſe interuals, of which I haue ſpoke.</p>
               <p>In the Croſſe Internals the <hi>Velites</hi> were firſt of all placed, 40. before euery <hi>Maniple,</hi> aud ſo ſtood before the Battell did begin <note n="*" place="margin">As you may ſee in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pag.</note>: afterward they marched forth all together to beginne the Fight before the Army did ioyne: <note n="*" place="margin">As you may ſee in the next Figure.</note>they fought a good way before the Front, as our Forlornes doe, ſcattering and disbandied. After which, hauing ſpent their Darts and Arrowes vpon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they retired in good order through the direct wayes, and ſtood in the Reare of euery <hi>Maniple,</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had done in the Front; from whence with

               <p>The Horſe of this Legion were in number 320. diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ten troopes, 32. in a troope: fiue troopes pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the right wing, fiue on the left wing, oblique wiſe, withall cloſing in the Front, and opening in the Reare, like this letter A put downewards.</p>

               <p>I with <hi>Iustus Lipſus</hi> doe admire the <hi>Romane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battailing, and will affirme as much as hee, that if this ancient diſcipline were ioyned with theſe our new found Armes, the old and new world would be ſubiect to one man: for ſurely if our light Souldiers (ſo I call ſhot) were mixt betweene the <hi>Maniples</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Maniples</hi> of the armed, with Interuals and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances for retreat, and that againſt the Horſe and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Foot, what Battalia durſt aſſaile, nay, what Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia could reſiſt vs? For in regard hereof our men ſhould be alwayes fit to charge, fit to retire for a ſecond charge. All which notwithſtanding is to be done with long vſe and exerciſe, leaſt they trouble vs in the doing. If any obiect againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> diſcipline, becauſe ſuch <hi>Maniples</hi> are not able to cope with great Battaliaes? Let
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21471:22"/>
them know, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did make their <hi>Maniples</hi> Cohorts; and their Cohorts were ſometimes 500. ſometimes 600. nay, a thouſand if we beleeue <hi>Vegetius:</hi> and is not this our number when wee Embattaile? and will not you imitate them? well, if you will not, yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the diſcipline now in vſe; a diſcipline approued for inſtruction, inſtructing you to doe thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When your Battalia of Footmen come to ioyne Battaila with your Enemies Footmen, haue a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Muskettiers before you to hurt and weaken your aduerſary before you ioyne battell or fight; which ſhot when they haue wrought their effect muſt haue roome ready open for them to retreat into the Reare; from whence they may be fecht to ſerue againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Flankes. Your Enemies Battalia in ſuch caſe, comming without ſhot before, hath his next remedy in all haſte to ioyne to handy ſtroakes. Your care muſt euer be to auoid confuſion of fight.</p>
               <p>Confuſion of fight isto begin before your time, which cauſeth ſuch inconuenience, as is cauſe oftentimes of loſſe: therefore in the beginning of your Fight take great heede that you inuade nor fight confuſedly. Whereas euery part of the Army hath his ordinary time to fight: neither ſuffer any part of your Army to fight with your Euemy in any other faſhion then you appointed him. And for ſuch caſualties and accidents as may happen to you in Battell or Fight, keepe theſe concluſions following in memory and heart, and they will much auaile you in time of neede.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If your Horſemen be oppreſſed with your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſemen, ſend for ſuccour a ſupply of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who may ſcattering and out of order, as occaſion ſhall ſerue, ſhoot at the oppreſſors, and vpon occaſion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21471:22"/>
retire and returne very often.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To theſe you may ſend a gard of Pikes for reſcue, the better to bring them off ſafe: but if you inuade your Enemy with Muskettiers, with your gard of Pike ſend ſome Horſe, that both may defend them from inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Enemies Horſemen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Likewiſe to giue the Enemy his hands full, follow him with a battalion reſolutely, to put all or one of his battalions to rout; and hauing diſcomfited any one of his Battels, ſend onely a ſmall or conuenient company to perſue the chaſe, and with the reſt inuade quickely ſome part of his Army fighting with any one of your Battels: This muſt of neceſſitie be done; for ſundry vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories haue beene loſt vpon this occaſion: that when one Battell hath ouerthrowne his firſt encountered E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Battell, it hath immediately followed the chaſe, and not holpen his owne fellowes in danger.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in your firſt ioyning of Battell, if your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gaine the victory, ioyne your other Battels imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately whilſt comfort is on your ſide, on your Enemies diſcomfort. This got <hi>Bucoy</hi> the victory at <hi>Prague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. If your Footmen be vehemently oppreſſed with your Enemies footmen; ſend your horſemen to inuade the ſides of your Enemies, and with them ſome ſhot to hold them play: but if you can plant a peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance againſt their flanke, it will much abate their courage.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If your Enemies come vpon you vnprouided and vnlooked for, ſend your Horſemen or ſhot, to skirmiſh with them, whilſt you intend to make you ready for Battell. Alſo your Horſe may extend themſelues into a deepe Heirſe battell, for to inuade your Enemies with their more trouble and ſtay.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:21471:23"/>
8. Or to deceiue your Enemies, march towards them with a company of Horſe, and make ſemblance of fight, as if the whole Army followed. The Enemy at this will ſtand; your battels in the meane time be ſet: you by this may outface the Enemy, and returne againe without fight.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Then being in good order, if your occaſion be ſuch, that you would not haue your Enemies vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of your orders and policies, cauſe you Horſemen to run vp and down: the duſt, to let their fight. Doe the like if you haue planted and ordered your Army all in ſtratagems.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If your Enemies maine battell doe vrge very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly your foreward, and his other battell be not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to helpe, or reſcue, cauſe both your other battels one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide, freſhly to inuade your Enemies maine battell; and herein you ſhall doe wiſely, imitating your predeceſſours, the braue <hi>Engliſh,</hi> at the battell of <hi>Poytiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. If you hauing a ſmall and weake number, and you vnderſtand that your Enemies goe for to diſtreſſe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aide comming to helpe you: where you be ſent after the Enemy to inuade the backes of them when they be fighting with your aide; comming, ſet not you on raſhly vpon your Enemies, before your time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; for if you fight with your enemies ſo, being ſtronger, before your aide haue ſet vpon their Front, you fooliſhly caſt away your ſelues, and alſo leaue your aide in danger: and by your vntimely, raſh, and vnwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like onſet bereaue your ſelues of your aide and helpe. And withall you much comfort your Enemies, who might haue beene diſcomforted; for if you had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your diſcipline and purpoſe, you ſhould haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21471:23"/>
your Enemy cloſely, with as little noyſe as might be, vntill your Enemies had ſet vpon your ayde; then in the heat of their fight, you ſhould haue ſet vpon their backes, before your Enemies were knowing of your comming: which kinde of dealing had beene moſt hurtfull to your Enemies, commodious to your Ayde, and profitable to your ſelues; for warlike diſcipline is, that a weaker company neuer fight with a greater ſtrength, without a ſpeciall aduantage of time, occaſion, and place for to helpe you. Alſo, neuer to breake your aduiſed determinate purpoſe, without you be either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, either drawne to fight by occaſion of ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table accident offered by chance. Accident will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; for in warres no moſt certaine rule can be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is not broken by ſome meanes at ſome ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times: therefore wait time, and ſo I proceede to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councell.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If you abound in number, couet to compaſſe your Enemies, and to diſtreſſe them being weake.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If your Enemies abound in number, prouide by order, or ſtratagem, or place, that your Enemies cannot compaſſe you.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Plant your Campe or Army to fight in a very ſtrong ground by nature, and helpe it by Art.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Some haue vſed to chooſe their ground fortified by nature, as <hi>Proſper Colonno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Some haue no regard of the ſtrength of the place by nature, but chooſe rather to fortifie all wholly by Art and induſtry, as the ancient <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. Some ſeeke places ſomewhat by nature ſtrong, and by Art and induſtry make them more ſtronger. They fortifie themſelues as well in Fight as in Campe, which the good Captaines of our time doe vſually.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:21471:24"/>
18. Therefore if you be vnwilling to fight, and your Enemies muſt needes fight with you, by your induſtry make a ditch three foot deepe, and fiue or ſixe foot broad, and caſt the earth towards you; which ditch, if you thinke good, let it be eſpecially in the Front, alſo in the ſides, and on your backes alſo, as <hi>Proſper Colonno</hi> would often dot.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Which Ditch, if it haue ſundry places open and free for your Enemies to enter, of no great ſpace, it ſhall encourage them there to enter; where if you prouide ſome ſtratagem againſt them, you doe well. The fitteſt ſtratagem for this occaſion, is to place certaine Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies before the gaps, and certaine Ordnance behinde them to be diſcharged when they open in the midſt.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Whereupon, if your Enemies deſiſt, vrge them hardly, onely make a faire ſhew, but proceede no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For you are not to put your confidence in ſuch weake fortification: nor in the arrogancy of your men to fight; by arrogancy many Armies are ouerthrowne, where by wiſedome many are ſaued. <hi>I preſent you the Figure of ſuch an Intrenched Battell to peruſe;</hi> (in the next page following) <hi>but you may doe as you pleaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. If your Company be ſmall, and your Enemy haue great ſtore of Horſemen againſt you, ſo that you be likely to looſe the Battell, if your Enemies againe ſet vpon you; if any great Wood be neere, ſeeke to ſaue your Army by the thickneſſe of the ſame Wood, and ſuffer your Enemies to gaine your Ordnance, and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and Victuals, that they ſpoyling the ſame, you may the better eſcape.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Likewiſe when you haue a Battell more then the Enemies, diuide it into two parts; and where you ſee any danger among your Enemies, ſend firſt one</p>

               <p n="23">23. And in the heat of your Fight, if newes come that your Baggage is in danger, in no caſe the Captaines muſt not ſuffer the Souldiers, or Horſemen confuſedly for to runne for to recouer the ſame, in caſe of loſſe; but by aduice to ſend a company of conuenient men for to doe it, onely by their Commandements, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; for by ſeeking to recouer the ſame pelfe or baggage, ſundry Armies haue been ouerthrown, which otherwiſe might haue beene ſaued.</p>
               <p n="24">24. If your Enemies come ouerſtrongly vpon any part of your Army, ſhoot off your great Ordnance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the thickeſt of them, and when your great Ordnance hath diſperſed them, then cauſe your Horſemen to inuade them ſo diſordered moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
               <p n="25">25. As for your Ordnance, you may plant them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before you, or on your wings, or elſe vpon ſome conuenient Hils behinde you, to ſhoot ouer your heads; or on ſome high grounds on the ſides, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Some haue planted their Ordnance on a leuell ground behinde their Battell, and cauſing the Battell to open in the midſt, haue deliuered the volly vpon the Front of the Enemy. In which caſe you are to marke, that if your Enemy ſo open, then his great Ordnance is ſo planted; and then you haue no better remedy, but to open your ſelues as you ſee them doe before you: In which caſe alſo your Footmen may ſuddenly fall down flat vpon the ground, and that ſafely, and riſe againe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Enemies haue ſhot; for in ſuch a caſe they will neuer inuade you in your Front, before

their ſhot haue been diſcharged: and being down, your Ordnance behinde you may flanke-wiſe immediately play on them, if you were ſo prouided.</p>
               <p n="27">27. In marching againſt an Enemy, if you feare his great Ordnance ſhooting directly againſt you, fetch a long compaſſe to paſſe by them, and ſo to auoid them, if no greater impediment let you.</p>

Some haue, being in danger of the great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, cauſed their ſeruants in Armour for to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde great trees, ſtanding directly in the face or ſight of the Gunners, therby to cauſe them to ſhoot off the more vehemently, as though the whole Battell came that way, and ment for to come vpon the Ordnance: In the meane ſpace, vnder that colour, their Souldiers haue come conueniently ſome other way; or elſe behinde their ſeruants, creeping loe, towards their Enemies; which to imitate, you muſt beforehand learne perfectly the nature of the ground, which you are to paſſe, that you may take all aduantages which the nature of the ſoile can render vnto you.</p>
               <p n="30">30. If your Enemy March with all his Ordnance in the Vantgard, and his other Battels lagge halfe a dayes iourney behinde, follow him with all your power with as great celeritie and ſecrecie as you can, and ſo fight with him, being depriued of his chiefe ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="31">31. If your Enemy March away in good order with his Ordnance before, and in the Reare of his Army ſo trauelling (not determined to fight) and you ſeeke by following your Enemy to fight with him, you muſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21471:26"/>
haue a great regard vnto the place where your Enemy and you both iourny, and there a company of Dragons with Curaſſiers, or Piſtoliers, with two or three field Peeces, are to be ſent before to ſtay your Enemies, and to diſturbe them; that when you ſee them thereby ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you may haue the more leaſure to order your Battels, and to make choiſe of your ground to fight. Then if you fight (if it be poſſible) by all meanes bring your great Ordnance round about your Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; plant them vpon ſome high ground, that you may without impediment ſhoot free vpon your Enemies backes, or ſides: and withall guard your Ordnance with a conuenient number of ſhot, that they may not be ſurpriſed by the Enemy, and turned vpon your ſelues.</p>
               <p n="32">32. If it chance that your Battell be ouerpreſſed by your Enemies, and begin to ſcatter, or for to diſorder; then all your Captaines muſt with all diligence beſtir themſelues, firſt in exhortation, and comforting their Souldiers; then by bringing them againe into order, and turne them againe, which haue turned from their Enemies: If faire words will not ſerue, then let them vſe foule, and from words fall vnto blowes, it may be that will force them to returne. If they perſiſt and will flye, then let ſome few valiant Captaines as know ſuch ſtreights through which they muſt paſſe, runne before to poſſeſſe the ſtreights; there after blowes and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, force them to fall into order againe.</p>

               <p>A good Generall will forecaſt what may happen, and therefore will conſider alwayes of euery ground, as he paſſeth by it, what occaſion it can worke, and how he can take aduantage, or helpe himſelfe thereby; either by the impediments of his Enemy there, or elſe by ſome Ambuſh, or ſome other ſtratagem to be wrought vpon the occaſion of the ſame ground, good or bad.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S great Iudgement was required of you in the ordering of your Battels, and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of your ſelfe in Fight, and after the Battell loſt; ſo there is as much required of you in taking time to Flye: for if you flye not like a good Souldier, but like one voide of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Diſcipline, you will bring diſtruction to your Army, ſhame to your Friends, and diſhonour to your ſelfe: but if you flye with iudgement as a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, you bring ſafetie to your Army, glory to your Friends, and hope of victory to your ſelfe. That you may be enabled to flye thus with honour, obſerue theſe precepts following.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Precepts for Flying.</note> 1. When your Enemies being mightie, or elſe very ſtrong, vrgeth you being weake in ſtrength, helpeleſſe; then know, that vpon ſuch an occaſion (ſo neceſſitated) that a wiſe, orderly, and politicke flight is better then an indiſcreet ſtay without reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you be by neceſſitie compelled to flye, flye in order, and in Battell array, fully prouided of reſcues and helpes, that your Enemies eagerly vrge you not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Flye with ſufficient ſpace of time and place, that your Enemies cannot eaſily ouertake you before you come into ſafetie (I meane places of aduantages for you.)</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:21471:27"/>
4. Flye in many parts and ſundry wayes, which conceale, that your Enemies may haue no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of your meaning, and diuerſitie of flying.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you flye or auoid the fight; doe it either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by neceſſitie, or ſubtiltie, or cautiouſly to bring your Enemy into your danger, or elſe to ſeeke places or occaſions for your beſt, or better aduantage.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you flye, your Enemy hardly vrging you in the Reare and Flankes; your Hoſemen or elſe your Muskettiers, or both, ſhould eagerly skirmiſh with them which perſue ſo earneſtly; ſo that your Army may in the interim win a good ſpace of ground.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Before your Horſe and Muskettiers ſhould iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out (as aboue ſaid) you ſhould haue a Peece of Ordnance remaining in the Reare of your Army for to ſhoot off vpon the vrgers, as opportunity ſhould ſerue.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In like faſhion two or three peeces of Ordnance in the Reare of euery battalia, trauelling, iournying, or flying.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Commonly your Muskettiers (in ſuch caſes laſt rehearſed) are vſed to be placed both in the Reare and Flanks, for the ſaid ſpeciall purpoſe; namely, to skirmiſh with ſuch as doe diſturbe your March; and yet to keepe on their iourney with the reſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Some ſuch as flye vſe to leaue ſome great Stales or Ambuſhes, in places very conuenient (as Woods, Mountaines, Forreſts, Rocks, banks of Riuers, Caues, Hils, hollow and deepe wayes, Corne-fields, and the like) for ſuch a purpoſe, to intrap the vrgers, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can ſerue.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Sometimes (as Count <hi>Mansfield)</hi> they fire
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21471:28"/>
houſes to ſtay their Enemies following: and on that ſide the ſmoake fals (by reaſon of the winde) they lay an Ambuſh to intrap the Enemy. The like doe you, that the reſt of your Army may paſſe with ſafetie.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When you flye onely the Battell, and ſeeke order and time conuenient for the ſame, ſend all your baggage and carriage before, and after them all your Footmen, and with a ſtrong company of Horſe fortifie your Reare, and leaue many fires in the Campe; And for time, chooſe a cloudy darke morning.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In your flying, or before, learne exquiſitely of them as be skilfull of the wayes and places, where, how farre off, or how lye ſuch places, as you hope may ſomewhat defend you from any danger of your Enemies, and make the greateſt haſte towards them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If you can learne of any narrow paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two great Hils, or betweene ſome great Riuer or Wood, &amp; ſome dangerous Hill, or ſome other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous place wherein you may ſafely reſt from your Enemies, make haſte thither.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In which caſe learne very diligently whether there be not ſome ſecret place in the ſame place of your quietneſſe, whereunto your Enemies getting, may diſturbe your quietneſſe; and if there be cauſe, ſuch kindes of dangerous places, to be either well warded, or elſe ſtopped by a trane-ditch, or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good way.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Alſo learne very diligently, whether your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſeeke not by their Horſemen to fetch a great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21471:28"/>
compaſſe about any ſide of your ſaid place of your ſecuritie, either to incloſe you there, or elſe for to goe before you to ſome place of their aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In which caſe, if your Enemies with their whole Army ſeeke to compaſſe the place, and for to be before you, take good aduice, if you may not turne that their practiſe vnto your commoditie, by ſome new inuention.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zenaphon</hi> of the <hi>Graecians</hi> retreat from <hi>Babylon, lib.</hi> 3.</note> As firſt, for to returne backe againe vnto ſome place of refuge; for you are elſe (as the <hi>Graecians)</hi> to ſeeke another way not ſuſpected of your Enemies.</p>
               <p>Or elſe to returne a little backe to giue a colour to your Enemy of flying away, ſo to draw him into the ſame ſtreight to follow you the eaſier in his opinion, and to returne to incounter him the more eaſely.</p>
               <p n="18">18. A chiefe, or elſe a notable place of refuge for Flyers, is to flye to be vnder the wings, or ſafetie of ſome Citie, or elſe ſtrong Fort, well furniſhed with great Ordnance vpon the wals; it is able to ſhoot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your flying Army into the Army of your proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Enemy, and ſo hurt him, to his great danger, and your great ſecuritie, and comfort many wayes.</p>
               <p n="19">19. If you flye, or iourney in three Battels, or more, euery Battell muſt alwayes be in ſight of the next before or behinde, in ſuch order, that the one be alwayes able to ſuccour the other (in caſe it be inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Enemies) ſo Flying, or Iournying. Otherwiſe, for lacke of ſuch order and aide, one may be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited for want of others helpe. To conclude.</p>
               <p n="20">20. If Flying, your Enemy with a great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Horſe and ſhot, inuade your hindermoſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21471:29"/>
diſcharge two Peeces of Ordnance vpon them, or more, which will coole their courage, and will likewiſe by their roaring and thundering noiſe, warne your other Battels to make Alt or ſtand, whereby you may worke your will. Example.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Landgraue</hi> with his Germaine great Army, when <hi>Charles</hi> the fift Emperour ſent a great company of ſhot for to inuade their hindmoſt Battell, and to ſtay them, hee cauſed two Culuerins to be diſcharged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and all the Army ſtaid. <hi>Thus much for Flying.</hi>

               <p>That you may be enabled to doe this, take theſe Rules for your direction.</p>

                  <note place="margin">When to Fight.</note> 1.

               <p n="2">2. When your Enemies aboundeth in all things, and therefore auoideth to fight, and where you want of prouiſion, and your Souldiers luſtie, and deſirous of Battell; there you may ſeeke Battell. <hi>Antony</hi> at <hi>Philippi</hi> againſt <hi>Caſsius</hi> and <hi>Brutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Where you be determined to ſeeke the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, make good choiſe of your ground where you be to fight, and ſee your ſelfe in perfect order and direction, and yet ſeeke all aduantages you can by any meanes finde out. <hi>Proſper Colonno</hi> againſt the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> at <hi>Bicocca,</hi> and <hi>Baſſan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Though you abound in number, ſeeke not to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21471:30"/>
fight raſhly, neither be very deſirous of Battell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very good apparance of likelihood of victory: neither fight before you haue intelligence of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſtrength, pollicies, and orders, except ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame neceſſitie compell you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Auoide not to fight with one great Army, when you know, that if you ſtay, you ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be compelled to fight with two great Armies.</p>
               <p>This was well foreſeene by <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> and as well executed to his glory. <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſull, intercepting <hi>Aſdrubals</hi> Letters (directed to his brother <hi>Hanibal,</hi> to meet him at <hi>Vmbra,</hi> to ioyne both their powers together, for the ſubuerſion of the <hi>Romans)</hi> preſently vpon the reading, left his fellow Conſull in the night (vnknowne to <hi>Haniball)</hi> and with ſix thouſand foot, and one thouſand horſe, came to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> another <hi>Roman</hi> Conſull, who was to intercept <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball</hi> comming from the Mountaines into <hi>Italie,</hi> and there ioyning force with his, gaue Battell to <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball,</hi> ouercame him, and ſlew him before euer <hi>Haniball</hi> knew of his being in <hi>Italie.

               <p>Where you are in danger to looſe a Realme, or two, if you looſe the Battell, your Enemies are in danger onely to looſe their preſent Army: Being no ſtronger then your Enemies, ſeeke not to fight. <hi>Hiſpani. Bell. Verona.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21471:31"/>
your Enemy cannot fight with you, but with his great loſſe, ſeeke not to fight with him. <hi>Proſper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonno</hi> at <hi>Bicocca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If your Enemy be ſo placed in a ſtrong Campe, ſeeke not there to fight with your Enemy. <hi>Carolus Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frenchmen</hi> are by long dalliance and time to be deluded, becauſe they be hot, and deſirous to fight when they be freſh, and eager to be put on in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the warres; afterwards, when by long time they are wearied, they are tractable enongh: ſo will others be beſides <hi>Frenchmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you haue warres made againſt you by a number of confederate Princes or Magiſtrates (take <hi>Caeſars</hi> counſell) deferre the Battell for a time, and weary them out by polliticke vſage. Keepe them from victuals; kill all ſuch as goe for Forrage, or any other purpoſe; make many Alarams nightly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in their Campe, and toyle them with watches and ſodaine labours: By this meanes you ſhall make the warres ſeeme loathſome vnto them, and protract it the longer; whereby, they may fall into diſſention one with another: for ſuch a number of Confederates cannot long agree, but that ſome quarrels will fall out betweene them, or elſe ſome grudges; ſo that ſome may be deuided from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome kinde of perſwaſion or other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you may, if you thinke good, giue Battell to the relinquiſhed: or chaſe them (as the <hi>Imperials</hi> did the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Millan)</hi> with light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes.</p>
               <p>

For the better performance of theſe skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, let all your Souldiers haue the perfect vſe of their Armes. They may haue the perfect vſe of their Armes quickely, if the Seriants doe but at vacant times plye and exerciſe them.</p>
