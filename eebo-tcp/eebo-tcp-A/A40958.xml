            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS no small Reflection on Pieces of this nature, that Panegyrick is so much improv'd, and that De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ication is grown more an Art than Poetry; that Authors, to make their Patrons more than Men, make themselves less; and that Persons of Honour are forc'd to decline patronizing Wit, because their Modesty cannot bear the gross Strokes of Adulation.</p>
            <p>But give me leave to say, Sir, that I am too young an Author to have learnt the Art of Flattery; and, I hope, the same Modesty which recommended this Play to the World, will also reconcile my Addresses to You, of whom I can say nothing but what your Merits may warrant, and all that have the honour of your Acquaintance will be proud to vindicate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52948:3"/>The greatest Panegyrick upon you, Sir, is the unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced and bare Truth of Your Character, the Fire of Youth, with the Sedateness of a Senatour, and the Modern Gaity of a fine <hi>English</hi> Gentleman, with the noble Solidity of the Antient <hi>Britton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Character, Sir, which all men, but your self, are proud to publish of You, and which more celebrated Pens than mine should transmit to Posterity.</p>
            <p>The Play has had some noble Appearances to honour its Representation; and to compleat the Success, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd to prefix so Noble a Name to usher it into the World. A stately Frontispiece is the Beauty of a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But here I must transverse <hi>Ovid</hi>:

            <head>PREFACE to the READER.</head>
            <p>AN affected Modesty is very often the greatest Vanity, and Authors are sometimes prouder of their Blushes than of the Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s that occasion'd them. I shan't therefore, like a foolish Vigin, fly to be pursued, and deny what I chiefly wish for. I am very willing to acknowledg the Beauties of this Play, especially those of the third Night, which not to be proud of, were the heighth of Impudence: Who is asham'd to value himself upon such Favours, undervalues those who confer'd them.</p>
            <p>As I freely submit to the Criticisms of the Iudicious, so I cannot call this an ill Play, since the Town has allow'd it such Success. When they have pardon'd my faults, 'twere very ill manners to condemn their Indulgence. Some may think (my Acquaintance in Town being too slender to make a Party for the Play) that the Success must be deriv'd from the pure Merits of the Cause. I am of another opinion: I have not been long enough in Town to raise Enemies against me; and the <hi>English</hi> are still kind to Strangers. I am below the Envy of great Wits, and above the Malice of little ones. I have not displeas'd the Ladies, nor offended the Clergy; both which are now pleas'd to say, that a Comedy may be diverting without Smut and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>Next to these Advantages, the Beauties of Action gave the greatest life to the Play, of which the Town is so sensible, that all will join with me in commendation of the Actors, and allow (without detracting from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of others) that the <hi>Theatre Royal</hi> affords an excellent and compleat set of Comedians. Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s performance has set him so far above com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition in the part of <hi>Wildair,</hi> that none can pretend to envy the Praise due to his Merit. That he made the Part, will appear from hence, that whenever the Stage has the misfortune to lose him, Sir <hi>Harry Wildair</hi> may go to the Iubilee.</p>
            <p>A great many quarrel at <hi>the Trip to the Jubilee</hi> for a <hi>Misnommer</hi>: I must tell them that perhaps there are greater Trips in the Play; and when I find that more exact Plays have had better success. I'll talk with the Criticks about <hi>Decorums,</hi> &amp;c. However, if I ever commit another fault of this nature, I'll endeavour to make it more excusable.</p>

            <l>POETS will think nothing so checks their Fury,</l>
            <l>As Wits, Cits, Beaux, and Women for their Jury.</l>
            <l>Our Spark's half dead to think what Medly's come,</l>
            <l>With blended Judgments to pronounce his Doom.</l>
            <l>'Tis all false Fear; for in a mingled Pit,</l>
            <l>Why, what your grave Don thinks but dully writ,</l>
            <l>His Neighbour i'th' great Wig may take for Wit.</l>
            <l>Some Authors court the Few, the Wise, if any;</l>
            <l>Our Youth's content, if he can reach the Many,</l>
            <l>Who go with much like Ends to-Church, and Play,</l>
            <l>Not to observe what Priests or Poets say,</l>
            <l>No! no! your Thoughts, like theirs, lie quite another way.</l>
            <l>The Ladies safe may smile: for here's no Slander,</l>
            <l>No Smut, no lewd-tongu'd Beau, no double Entendre.</l>
            <l>'Tis true he has a Spark just come from <hi>France,</hi>

            <l>Those Men of Spleen, who fond the World should know it,</l>
            <l>Sit down, and for their <hi>two pence</hi> damn a Poet.</l>
            <l>Their Criticism's good, that we can say fort't,</l>
            <l>They understand a Playâ€”too well to pay for't.</l>
            <l>From Box to Stage, from Stage to Box they run,</l>
            <l>First steal the Play, then damn it when they've done.</l>
            <l>But now to know what Fate may us betide,</l>
            <l>Among our Friends in <hi>Cornhil</hi> and <hi>Cheapside:</hi>

            <l>But those I think have but one Rule for Plays;</l>
            <l>They'l say they'r good, if so the World says.</l>
            <l>If it should please them, and their Spouses know it,</l>
            <l>They straight enquire what kind of Man's the Poet.</l>
            <l>But from Side-box we dread a fearful Doom,</l>
            <l>All the good-natur'd Beaux are gone to <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <l>Then for a Line or two t' engage their Vote:</l>
            <l>But that way's old, below our Author's Aim,</l>
            <l>No less than his whole Play is Complement to them.</l>
            <l>For their sakes then the Play can't miss succeeding,</l>
            <l>Tho Criticks may want Wit, they have good Breeding.</l>
            <l>They won't, I'm sure, forfeit the Ladies Graces,</l>
            <l>By shewing their ill-nature to their Faces.</l>
            <l>Our Business with good Manners may be done,</l>
            <l>Flatter us here, and damn us when you're gone.</l>
