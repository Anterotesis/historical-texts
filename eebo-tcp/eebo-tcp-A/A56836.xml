         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

either of Faction, or Relation in this ensuing Treatise. I am no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
no Sectary, but a true Lover of Reformation and Peace: My pen
declines all bitternesse of Spirit; all deceitfulnesse of heart; and, I
may safely, in this particular, with Saint PAUL, say, <hi>I speak the truth in Christ and lye not, my Conscience bearing me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the holy Ghost, that I neither walk nor write in craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse,
nor handle the holy Scriptures deceitfully:</hi> Therefore
if thy Cause be Iesus Christ, in the name of Iesus Christ, I adjure thee
to lay aside all wilfull ignorance, all prejudice, all private Respects
and Interests, and all uncharitable censures: Deale faithfully with
thy Soule, and suffer wholesome admonitions: Search the severall
Scriptures herein contained, and where they open a Gate, climbe not
thou over a Stile: Consult with Reason, herein exercised, and where
it finds a mouth, find thou an eare: And let Truth prosper, though
thou perish; and let God be glorified, although in thy Confusion.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Cause</hi> and Ground of these our Nationall Combustions, are these
our Nationall <hi>Transgressions,</hi> which unnaturally sprung from the neglect

want: Which, taking occasion of some differences betwixt His <hi>Majestie</hi>
and His two Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> hath divided our <hi>Kingdome</hi> within
it selfe, which had so divided it selfe from that <hi>God,</hi> who blest it with so

                  </p>
                  <p>As that sinne brought this <hi>division,</hi> so this division (sharpned with
mutuall Jealousies) brought in the <hi>Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Lyon</hi> roares, who trembles not? And when <hi>Iudgements</hi>
thunder, who is not troubled?</p>
                  <p>Among the rest, I (who brought some Faggots to this <hi>Combustion</hi>)
stood astonisht and amazed: to whom the <hi>mischiefe</hi> was farre more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest

I began to make a scrutiny, where the first <hi>Breach</hi> was made, that
let in all these <hi>Miseries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I found the whole Kingdome now contracted into a <hi>Parliament,</hi>
which consisted of three Estates: A <hi>King,</hi> a house of <hi>Peeres,</hi> and a house of
<hi>Commons;</hi> by the <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> whereof, all things conduceable to
the <hi>Weale-publique,</hi> were be advised upon, presented and established.</p>
                  <p>I found this <hi>Vnity</hi> disjoynted, and growne to variance even to <hi>Blood:</hi>
The <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Adherents</hi> on the party; and his two <hi>Houses</hi> and their
<hi>Adherents</hi> on the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60563:5"/>
The <hi>pretence</hi> of this division, was the true <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which
both protested to maintaine; the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> which both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
to preserve; the <hi>Priviledges of Parliament,</hi> which both promise to

                  <p>Standing amazed at this <hi>Riddle,</hi> I turned mine eyes upon his <hi>Majesty;</hi>

(strongly confirmed by a <hi>Precept</hi> and an <hi>Example</hi> out of the <hi>New</hi>)

nations that shall serve the King of Babylon, and bring their necks under his
Yoake, those will I let remaine in their own land, (saith the Lord) and they

These, (and of such many) are they, that whilst they <hi>pretend</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
need, first, to be reformed.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I, in taxing this Army of such impious <hi>Barbarismes,</hi> excuse
or rather not condemne the other; whereof, no question, too great a
number are as equally profane; whilst all together make up one <hi>body</hi> of
wickednesse, to bring a ruine on this miserable Kingdome; for whose

of <hi>numerous Papists,</hi> the utter enemies of true <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To whom the King hath sworne his <hi>protection,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But, unto all his people, as well <hi>Papists</hi> as Protestants, hee hath
sworne his <hi>protection,</hi> therefore from all his subjects, as well <hi>Papists</hi>
as Protestants, he may require <hi>assistance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither does he call in <hi>Papists,</hi> as Papists, to <hi>maintaine</hi> Religion (as
himselfe hath alwayes manifested) but as subjects to <hi>subdue,</hi> or at least
qualifie, Sedition.</p>
                  <p>The ayde of the subject, is either in his <hi>person</hi> or in his <hi>purse;</hi> both
are requireable to the <hi>service</hi> of a Soveraigne.</p>
                  <p>Put case, His Majesty should use the assistance of <hi>none</hi> but Protestants:
tell me, would ye not be apt to cavill, that he is <hi>favourable</hi> to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists;
neither willing to endanger their <hi>persons,</hi> nor endammage their
<hi>purses;</hi> or, at least, that they are reserved for a last blow?</p>
                  <p>Or, in case, Papists should largely <hi>underwrite</hi> to your Propositions,
send in <hi>Horses, Armes,</hi> or other <hi>Provisions,</hi> would you not accept it;
and, for its sake, their <hi>persons</hi> too?</p>
                  <p>Are you so strict in your Preparations, as to <hi>catechize</hi> every souldier?
Or, to examine, first, every <hi>Officers</hi> Religion? Or, having the proffer of
a good <hi>Popish,</hi> or <hi>debaucht</hi> Commander, tell me, should he be denied his
<hi>Commission?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Remember Sir <hi>Arthur Ashton,</hi> whom His Majesty entertaines by
your <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things indifferently considered, it will manifestly appeare, that
the honest minded vulgar are meerly seduced, under the colour of piety,
to be so impious, as by <hi>poysoning</hi> every action of their lawfull Prince, to
foster their <hi>implicite</hi> Rebellion,</p>
                  <p>But, in case, your side should prosper, and prevaile, what then?
would then our <hi>Miseries</hi> be at an end? <hi>Reason</hi> tels us, No; God keeps
us from the <hi>experience:</hi> Think you, that <hi>Government</hi> (whether new, or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60563:11"/>
reformed) which is set up by the <hi>sword,</hi> must not be maintained by the
<hi>sword?</hi> And how can <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> bee consistent with perpetuall
<hi>Garrisons,</hi> which must bee maintained with a perpetuall <hi>charge?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the continuall excursions, and connived-at injuries, committed
by <hi>Souldiers,</hi> judge you.</p>
                  <p>Or, put the case, this necessary <hi>Consequence</hi> could be avoided, think
you the ambition of some <hi>new</hi> States-men, accustomed to such Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and <hi>necessitated</hi> power, on the one side, and the remaining loyalty of
His Majesties <hi>dis-inherited</hi> Subjects, watching all opportunities to right
their injured Soveraigne, and themselves, on the other side, would not
raise perpetuall <hi>tempests</hi> in this Kingdome?</p>
                  <p>Or, if such an (almost) unpreventable <hi>evill</hi> should not ensue, think
you, such swarmes of <hi>Sectaries</hi> sweat for nothing? Are their purses so
apt to bleed to no end? Will not their costs, and paines expect, at least,
a <hi>congratulatory</hi> connivance in the <hi>freedome</hi> of their consciences? Or,
will their swords, now in the strong possession of so great a multitude,
know the way into their quiet <hi>scabbards,</hi> without the expected <hi>liberty</hi>
of their Religions? And, can that <hi>liberty</hi> produce any thing but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht
<hi>disorder?</hi> And, is not Disorder the mother of <hi>Anarchie?</hi> and
that, of <hi>Ruine?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Open then your eyes, closed with crasse, and wilfull blindnesse, and
consider, and prevent that, which your continued <hi>disobedience</hi> will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
repent, too late.</p>
                  <p>But, the truth is, They are all <hi>Papists,</hi> by your <hi>Brand,</hi> that comply
not, in this action with you: Admit it were so; Are not <hi>Papists</hi> as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
for His Majesty, as <hi>Anabaptists, Brownists, Separatists, Atheists,
Antinomians, Turkes;</hi> and, indeed, all <hi>Religions,</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> nay <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
too, for His Subjects? These, of His Majesties side, come freely, out
of their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> as Subjects: Yours, are preached in, comming out
of <hi>obstinacie,</hi> as Rebels: They, at their own charges, proportionable to
their Abilities; These, like <hi>Iudas,</hi> selling their Soveraignes <hi>Blood</hi> for <hi>ill
paid</hi> wages: Yet, both sides pretend a <hi>Quarrell</hi> for the true Protestant
Religion.</p>
                  <p>Good God! What a <hi>monstrous</hi> Religion is this, that seeks protection
from the <hi>implacable</hi> opposition of her two Champions!</p>
                  <p>His Majesty <hi>protests</hi> to maintain it: The two Houses <hi>protest</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it: O, for an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to read this <hi>Riddle!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majesty addes one <hi>Clause</hi> more, wherein if the other <hi>Party</hi> would
agree, the work would be at an <hi>end,</hi> which is,</p>

                  <p>Hath not His Majesty, in the <hi>presence</hi> of that God, by whom hee
reignes, imprecated the <hi>Curse</hi> of Heaven on him and his Royall <hi>Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
(<hi>Sub Sigillo Sacramenti</hi> too) if He, to his utmost, maintaine not
the True <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, exercised in that blessed <hi>Queenes</hi> dayes,
and propagated by the <hi>blood</hi> of so many glorious Martyrs (at which
time God blest this Island in so high a measure) if hee preserve not the
just <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, more, did not His Majesty so promise the severe execution of
the <hi>Statute</hi> against all <hi>Recusants,</hi> that if he failed, he desired not the <hi>ayde</hi>
of his good Subjects?</p>
                  <p>What inferiour person would not think his Reputation <hi>wronged,</hi> not
to take up confidence upon such <hi>terrible</hi> termes? What notorious evill
hath his Majesty perpetrated to quench the sparkles of a common
<hi>Charity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider, O, Consider; Hee acts his part before the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi>
whose eye is more especially upon Him; He acts his part before his <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Princes,</hi> to whom he hath declared this his <hi>Imprecation.</hi> Hee acts
his part before his <hi>Subjects,</hi> whose stricter hand weighes his pious words
with too <hi>unequall</hi> Ballances.</p>
                  <p>Were he the <hi>acknowledger</hi> of no God, yet the <hi>Princes</hi> of the earth,
(if guilty of such a <hi>Perjury</hi>) would abhorre him. Or, were all the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of the earth, blind, deafe, or partiall, would not he think his Crown
a <hi>burthen</hi> to be worne upon his <hi>perjured</hi> brow before his owne <hi>abused</hi>
people? Or, (having renounced his Subjects ayde, upon his <hi>faile</hi>) could
he expect that loyalty, which now he wants upon a <hi>meen suspition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, He is a <hi>Prince,</hi> whom God hath crowned with graces <hi>above his
fellowes;</hi> A <hi>Prince,</hi> whom, for his Piety, few <hi>Ages</hi> could parallell.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Vices</hi> of the times have branded his <hi>Repute?</hi> His Youth, high
diet, strength of body, and Soveraign Power might have inclined, and
warpt him to luxurious <hi>vanity,</hi> as well as other Monarks, whose effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
have enerved the strength of their <hi>declining</hi> Kingdomes; How
many would have held it a Preferment to be <hi>Attorny</hi> to his Royall Lust,
or <hi>Secretary</hi> to His <hi>Bosom</hi> Sinne? Yet, he remaines, a president of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemisht
<hi>Chastity.</hi>
                  </p>

He might have pleased and pampered up his wanton <hi>Palate</hi> with the
choise of curious <hi>Wines,</hi> to lighten <hi>Cares,</hi> which wait upon the regall
<hi>Diademe;</hi> Yet, he continues the patterne of a chast <hi>Sobriety:</hi> He might
have magnified his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>sold</hi> his Justice, to reward a <hi>Service,</hi> in
pardoning offences, (committed by those of <hi>neare</hi> relation) yet, Hee
abides the example of <hi>inexorable</hi> Justice.</p>
                  <p>These and many other eminent <hi>Graces,</hi> and illustrious <hi>Virtues</hi> can

The further it swerves from the first <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>

So is it in the Church; The more she devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,

                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been the wisdome of all Princes, and Free States, of

the humors waxe so <hi>prevalent,</hi> that the desperatenesse of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
might enforce them to as <hi>desperate</hi> a Remedy.</p>
                  <p>It is no lesse prudence and providence in those that are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Supreme power</hi> (as under him) chiefe Governours and

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60563:15"/>
their office in <hi>governing,</hi> that is, in making wholsome <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
and duly <hi>executing</hi> them; That the Inconveniences that

                  <p>The wearyed Physitian, (after his many fruitlesse experiments
upon a <hi>consuming</hi> Body) advises his drooping Patient to the <hi>place
of his birth,</hi> to draw that Ayre, he was first bred in: The likelyest
way to recover our <hi>languishing</hi> Church, is to reduce her to her

thither in a rumbling <hi>Coach,</hi> or a rude <hi>Waggon,</hi> (they are
too full of motion for a restlesse body) nor to ride <hi>Poste,</hi> (the
swiftnesse of the passage makes too sudden an alteration of the
Climate) but in an easie-going <hi>Litter,</hi> the flownesse of whose
pace might give him a <hi>graduall</hi> change of Ayre.</p>
                  <p>The safest way to <hi>reduce</hi> our languishing Church to her first
Constitution, is to avoid all unnaturall <hi>Commotions,</hi> and <hi>violence</hi>

which cannot be without imminent <hi>danger,</hi> and to use the <hi>peace-ablest</hi>

(of which sort the devill hath alwayes instruments to nip

                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, so far have the <hi>Enemies</hi> of this establisht Government
and Discipline, given way to their exorbitant and refractory <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
that they will neither allow the <hi>Matter,</hi> nor the <hi>Forme,</hi> nor
the Authority and testimony of the <hi>Composers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Not the <hi>Matter;</hi> (though they cannot but acknowledge it,
in the generall, to be very good, yet) because it was unsanctified
by <hi>superstitious</hi> lips.</p>
                  <p>2. Not the <hi>Forme;</hi> because set, and composed by <hi>Humane</hi>
Invention.</p>
                  <p>3. Not the <hi>Composers;</hi> because <hi>Bishops,</hi> and so (though <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>

<hi>Antichrist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. As for their <hi>Exceptions</hi> against the Matter; how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
they are, let <hi>Reason</hi> judge: Have not superstitious tongues,
and eyes, viewed and read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in their very Originall
and purity? Shall therefore the Scriptures be disallowed? Have
not superstitious persons profaned our Churches with their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<hi>Doctrines, Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies?</hi> and shall our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
therefore be cryed downe, or shut against the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60563:17"/>
God? because those Poets were <hi>Heathenish,</hi> was S. <hi>Paul</hi> afraid
to use their sayings? Was the Spirit of God too blame, to <hi>endite</hi>
them? Good things, abused, work evill effects upon the <hi>abusers;</hi>
but lose not their goodnesse by the <hi>Abuse,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As for their <hi>Exceptions</hi> against the Forme, being set, and
not conceived, the Authority of the Scriptures I hope will
answer.</p>
                  <p>God the <hi>Father</hi> warrants it: God the <hi>Son</hi> prescribes it: God
the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> allowes it.</p>
                  <p>1. God the Father <hi>warrants</hi> it, in the Old Testament, at the
time of the <hi>Law,</hi> by his command to <hi>Moses, Numb. 6. 21.</hi> where
he gives him a <hi>set forme</hi> and words to blesse the people, <hi>The Lord
blesse thee and keep thee, the Lord make his face to shine upon thee,
and be gracious unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. God the Sonne <hi>prescribes</hi> it in the New Testament, in the
time of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist had taught his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to <hi>pray,</hi> the Disciples of Jesus Christ (whose house was
called the house of Prayer) humbly requested the fame <hi>boone</hi>
from him, who prescribed them that <hi>Forme</hi> which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
used in the end of his Sermon, <hi>Mat. 6. 9.</hi> which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not as a <hi>Model,</hi> (as some would have it) but a very <hi>Prayer</hi>
it selfe, to be used in those very words, as they were delivered
<hi>Luke 11. 2.</hi> not, <hi>After this manner,</hi> but, <hi>when ye pray, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> say.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he will'd the same words to be used, is evident; For his
Disciples would be taught, as <hi>Iohn</hi> taught his: And how were
they taught? S. <hi>Iohn</hi> taught them the <hi>words</hi> onely; he could not
give them the <hi>Spirit</hi> to make an <hi>extemporary descant</hi> upon them.
So that being a direct <hi>Set Forme,</hi> it warranted <hi>Set Formes,</hi> which
were used from the beginning of the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> from
whence, this part of our <hi>Discipline</hi> had her originall.</p>
                  <p>3. God the holy Spirit <hi>allowes</hi> it: Who dare question, that the
<hi>holy Spirit</hi> inspired S. <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epistles, written to the
Churches? In all which Epistles he concludes with this one
Prayer, <hi>The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. As for their <hi>exceptions</hi> against the Composers of this <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,</hi>
who were no lesse then holy Martyrs, (and by <hi>Fire-light</hi>
saw more <hi>Revelations</hi> then these Objectors did by day-light)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60563:17"/>
men of approved learning and true piety: though some have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
and <hi>spirituall pide</hi> enough, to think their owne abilities
and <hi>inspiratious</hi> to flye a higher pitch; and Ignorance enough,
to acknowledge greater <hi>knowledge</hi> in themselves, yet the most
humble, able, and truly sanctified minds, have alwaies had <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome</hi>
in so high reverence, that they conclude, that God that
made their blood the <hi>seed</hi> of the Church, and gave them the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and honour <hi>to dye</hi> in the maintenance of the Truth, would
not permit that seed to bring forth such <hi>darnel</hi> of superstition; or
them, to die guilty of those <hi>Errors,</hi> they so resolutely cryed down
with their <hi>dying blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As for her government by <hi>Episcopacie</hi> (the extirpation wherof
being a great addition to her <hi>Distemper</hi>) It hath as much or more
<hi>Ius Divinum</hi> to plead, then that, which endeavours to demolish
&amp; succeed it, <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> Both are <hi>but mentioned</hi> in the Scripture,
at large; but no <hi>particular</hi> Rules for the executing the office of
<hi>either;</hi> which, being left wholly as <hi>arbitrary,</hi> it rests in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the <hi>Supreme Magistrate</hi> (whom God hath constituted his
<hi>Vicegerent</hi>) to choose, and establish, which may best be found
<hi>consistent</hi> with the Constitutions of the Kingdome, and stand to
most advantage with the <hi>civil</hi> Government.</p>
                  <p>But admit the Civil Government will stand with <hi>either?</hi>
When the Balances stand <hi>eavenly poised,</hi> the least Grain turns it.
In things indifferent, the smallest <hi>circumstance</hi> casts it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Island</hi> of Bitaine (if we look back above 1400 yeares,
being a long <hi>Prescription</hi>) when she first received the Faith, was
then governed by King <hi>Lucius,</hi> whom God made a great <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
for reducing of this Kingdome from <hi>Paganisme;</hi> who, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Rome, and accommodated from thence with two <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
and learned Divines, by their labours, and Gods assistance
upon them, planted the <hi>Gospel:</hi> At the beginning of which plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<hi>Arch-Flamins</hi> and <hi>Flamins</hi> were put downe, and in their
roome <hi>Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> were introduced; which Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<hi>successively</hi> continued, and flourisht through the reigns
of many wise Princes, confirmed by many Acts of Parliament,
since the <hi>Reformation;</hi> exercised and approved by holy Martyrs;
and allowed of, as most fitting, until the yeare of our Lord 1641.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60563:18"/>
At which time, multitudes of the <hi>lower sort</hi> of people, throughout
this Kingdome, petitioned, and tumultuously troubled the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi>
so that some of the Members, perchance according to their
<hi>inclination,</hi> and others, for quietnesse sake, consented to the <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition</hi>
and <hi>extirpation</hi> of Episcopacy, the unadviz'd <hi>Contents</hi> of
their clamorous Petitions.</p>
                  <p>Now if these Governments Hierarchicall and Presbyteriall
be <hi>indifferent;</hi> these Circumstances, (First, of the <hi>time,</hi> when
Episcopall Government began; Secondly, of the <hi>unintermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi>
continuance, for so many Ages; Thirdly, the <hi>credit of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
confirming and approving it) me thinks, should cast such a
kind of <hi>necessity</hi> upon it, that the other (being an <hi>untry'd</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and having no <hi>consent</hi> or <hi>approbation</hi> from the Supreme
Magistrate; and, being onely cryed in by the <hi>Ignorant</hi> multitude,
affected to novelties and change) should have no <hi>wise</hi> friend to
plead for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We reade in the Scriptures of</hi> Elders (<hi>which are members of
a</hi> Presbyterie) <hi>as it is written,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ob.</note> Titus 1. 5. For this cause I left thee
in Creete that thou shouldest set in order things that are wanting,
and ordaine Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee. <hi>Also,</hi>
2 Pet. 5. 1. The Elders which are among you. I exhort, who am also
an Elder. <hi>By which it appears, that</hi> Titus <hi>had instructions to
set up a</hi> Presbyterie.</p>
                  <p>You take the Scriptures by snatches:<note place="margin">Ans.</note> Had you read in <hi>Titus</hi> the

meaning</hi> with his words, <hi>viz. ver. 7. For a Bishop must be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
as the steward of God, not selfe-willed, &amp;c.</hi> So that, it plainly
appeares, that <hi>Elders</hi> mentioned in the 5. verse, are expounded
<hi>Bishops</hi> in the 7. Or, had you compared Saint <hi>Peters first</hi> verse
(before mentioned) with his <hi>fift</hi> in the same Chapter, you would
have found Elders no <hi>positive,</hi> but a <hi>relative</hi> word; no <hi>Office,</hi> but
a degree of <hi>Age. Ver. 5. Likewise the younger submitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the elder;</hi> the Apostle here shewing, what the behaviour
of the <hi>Elder</hi> Ministers should be towards God, and of the <hi>younger</hi>
towards them. So that if either of them had set up a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi>
it was suddenly pulled downe againe; and <hi>Episcopacie</hi> (which
you so much dislike) placed in the roome.</p>

                  <p>How suddenly (to crosse a setled and warranted establishment)

we conformed according to the <hi>Church</hi> of Rome, the Church of
Rome conformed according to the <hi>Word</hi> of God. Rome was,
then, part of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, not being above 187. yeares
after Christ: The <hi>Bishops</hi> of Rome were then so far from being
<hi>Antichrists,</hi> that most of them were <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and dyed for
<hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our Bishops have too great <hi>Revenues;</hi>

But these great Revenues might have been <hi>decimated,</hi>

                     </gap>stereof hath in one word, fully and fairely
answered this Objection.</p>
                  <p>But Bishops have <hi>too absolute</hi> a power,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> which gives them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
and opportunity to be <hi>tyrannicall,</hi> and to exercise an <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
Jurisdiction over their Brethren.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>beginning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ans.</note> I confesse, it was not so; neither stands it
with <hi>wisdome</hi> or <hi>policy</hi> to suffer it to be so: For the Government
of the Church must have <hi>proportion</hi> with the Government of the
State: Government of <hi>severall</hi> natures in one Nation, breeds <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;</hi>
and that, <hi>ruine:</hi> We therefore being a <hi>mixt</hi> Monarchy,
necessarily require a <hi>mixture</hi> likewise in the Hierarchy; which
excledes all <hi>arbitrary</hi> power.</p>
                  <p>It is true, <hi>absolute</hi> Monarchy, and an <hi>unlimited</hi> Hierarchy are
apt to fall into the distemper of <hi>Tyrannie;</hi> and Democracie and a
<hi>parity</hi> in Government is as apt to run into the disease of <hi>Tumult;</hi>
but of the two evils, Tyrannie is the <hi>least,</hi> by how much it is the
easier to be <hi>cured.</hi> A monster with <hi>one</hi> head is sooner overcome
then a <hi>Hidra</hi> with many. If our Hierarchy hath slipt into this <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity,</hi>
it is great wisdome and reason for a Parliament to
<hi>rectifie</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>But the King having the <hi>sole</hi> election of Bishops,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> and so much
favouring them, will hardly consent to the abridgement of their
<hi>power</hi> and <hi>greatnesse;</hi> so that, being his <hi>Creatures,</hi> their power
wil be upheld by him, to the end that upon any <hi>difference</hi> betwixt
him and his people, they may be the more able to uphold him,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60563:19"/>
and ready to make a strong <hi>party</hi> for him; so that the more their
<hi>power</hi> is weakned, the lesse his <hi>party</hi> will be prevalent, whereby,
his <hi>Prerogative</hi> may want Advocates, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

                  <p>His Majesty,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> by his yeelding to the <hi>Bill</hi> of taking away their

                     <hi>and lord it over Gods</hi> Inheritance: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
1 Pet. 5. 3. <hi>forbids it,</hi> Be not Lords over Gods inheritance:
<hi>and Christ,</hi> Luk. 22. 25. <hi>sayes,</hi> The Kings of the earth exercise
Lordship, but it shall not be so with you.</p>
                  <p>Our Bishops were Lords,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> as they were <hi>Peeres</hi> of the Land, and
as Peeres, they had <hi>Votes</hi> in Parliament; which, being <hi>taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
they are no more, now, then what the dignity of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and their owne Merits make them. As for that place in S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> thus it is meant; <hi>Ye shall not be Lords over Gods inheritance,</hi>
that is, Tyrants; <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> being at that time none but
<hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Persecutors,</hi> whose tyrannie made the very name
of <hi>Lord,</hi> terrible, and odious: So that, in that place, by Lordship
is certainly meant <hi>Tyrannie.</hi> Neither can this imply a <hi>Parity</hi> in
our Church; for without a <hi>Superiority,</hi> and <hi>Inferiority,</hi> there
can be no Government: A Parity cannot be considered in <hi>order</hi> of
Government; but onely, in the <hi>work</hi> of the Ministry. In this, all
are <hi>fellow labourers;</hi> In the other, some <hi>command,</hi> and some <hi>obey:</hi>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> had an especiall <hi>command</hi> and charge over
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60563:20"/>
other Ministers. As for that place in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> which you alledge,
The Disciples striving <hi>who should be the greatest among them,</hi> our
blessed Saviours answer was to this effect, <hi>Let Kings exercise po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and authority over their vassals,</hi> (as indeed their tyrannie
made them little better) but it shall be otherwise with you: You
are all <hi>fellow-servants</hi> to me, that am your chiefe <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Bishop
of your soules;</hi> whilst I am here, all superiority lyes extinct:
Christ was then the onely <hi>Governour,</hi> and the <hi>Root</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was in him: But at his departure, he gave <hi>some to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
some to be Pastors, &amp;c.</hi> and yet all those degrees were <hi>equall</hi>
in respect of the <hi>work:</hi> He himselfe said, <hi>Ye call me Lord, and so I
am,</hi> and yet, <hi>Luk. 22. 27. I am among you as he that serveth:</hi>
whereby it manifestly appeares, he intended a parity of the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
in respect of the <hi>worke,</hi> not a parity in the <hi>government</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <hi>workers.</hi>

                  <p>Admit the <hi>piety</hi> of the honest hearted People was the first <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
to these weekly Lectures, how was that piety <hi>abused,</hi> by
those weekly <hi>Lecturers?</hi> They were <hi>chosen</hi> by the people; their
<hi>maintenance</hi> (consisting most of Gratuities) came from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which ebbed or flowed according as their <hi>Lunatick</hi> doctrines
wrought upon the people. Those Lecturers (whose whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
thus proceeded from the people) must for their owne
better livelyhoods <hi>please</hi> the people: And what more pleasing
to the people then the preaching of <hi>Liberty?</hi> and how should
Liberty be enlarged, if not peeced with <hi>Prerogative?</hi> Then down

grew the <hi>Seminaries</hi> of all Ignorance, and the <hi>nursing fathers</hi> of

downe, who never lost themselves so much, as in not setting up
<hi>better</hi> and more <hi>orthodox</hi> in their roomes, which had taken away
the ground of this Objection.</p>
                  <p>Our Bishops being <hi>proud,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ob.</note> 
                     <hi>idle, covetous,</hi> and <hi>Popishly</hi> affected,

                     <note place="margin">Ans.</note> Admit some be so; must, therefore, such, among them, as are
<hi>humble, diligent, charitable,</hi> and enemies to <hi>Popery,</hi> perish? Shall
they that are <hi>bad,</hi> have more power to pull downe a setled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
then they that be <hi>good,</hi> to keep it up? Did <hi>Moses,</hi> the
man of God, extirpate the Government of <hi>Priesthood</hi> because
<hi>Aaron</hi> had a hand in the peoples <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Or, will you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
that the Elders in a <hi>Presbyteriall</hi> Government shall be all
faultlesse? Let the <hi>guilty</hi> receive their respective punishments,
and <hi>let others take their office:</hi> But the <hi>innocent</hi> to suffer with the

                  </p>
                  <p>But admit this Government by Bishops, had nothing to plead
for it, neither <hi>prescription,</hi> nor <hi>continuance</hi> without Intermission,
nor the <hi>Authority</hi> of Parliaments in all Ages, yet considering it
is, now, a Government, in <hi>Being,</hi> it seemes not consonant to
Reason, or policy to <hi>extirpate</hi> it, or take it away, before an <hi>other</hi>
Government be pitcht upon. To pull downe one maine <hi>Pillar,</hi>
before another be made to supply the place, and to <hi>support</hi> the

And to conclude, all that have not <hi>contributed</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,

                  <p>2. If <hi>disinherit</hi> them; It must be done, either <hi>according</hi> to the

the Lawes, ye cannot; for there is no Law for it. If against them,

who quietly suffered the two <hi>Caesars,</hi> being <hi>Idolaters,</hi> not
onely to possesse that Kingdome, but to <hi>usurp</hi> it, because God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them, and <hi>permissively</hi> placed them there: When the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
askt our blessed Saviour, <hi>Didst not thou sow good wheat?
Whence commeth it that there be tares?</hi> His answer was, <hi>The evil
one hath done it.</hi> His pleasure being demanded, whether they
should <hi>weed</hi> them up? his Reply was, No, <hi>Let them alone untill
the harvest</hi> and then he would separate them.</p>
                  <p>A good deed may be ill done, when either against <hi>command,</hi> or
without <hi>warrant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though God hath permitted the <hi>evill one</hi> to plant Papists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, yet he hath not authorized us to <hi>root</hi> them up, nor yet
to take the lives of any, untill their actions come within the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and compasse of the establisht <hi>Lawes</hi> of the Land.</p>
                  <p>We have presidents for the <hi>rooting out</hi> of Idolaters in the
Scriptures;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> which warrant us to doe the like.</p>

You finde it no where,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> but in the time of the <hi>Law;</hi> at which
time, God <hi>immediately</hi> commanded it; which kind of Warrants
are now ceased.</p>
                  <p>Again, In the time of the Law, some were accompted <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
And strangers had not the priviledges that <hi>brethren</hi> have.
<hi>Vsury was lawfull to be taken of strangers,</hi> not of brethren: Now,
in the times of the Gospel, Christ hath made us all <hi>Brethren,</hi>
and called us by his own name, <hi>Christians:</hi> and what was <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
then, to be done to strangers, is <hi>unwarrantable,</hi> now, to be
done to Christians. <hi>We are brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Protestantisme and Popery may be <hi>consistent</hi> in one
Kingdom,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> and Gods name may be harmelesly prophaned with
<hi>Idolaetry</hi> and <hi>superstition,</hi> in the same place, where it is <hi>truly</hi> and
sincerely worshipt.</p>
                  <p>Your inference is not good.<note place="margin">Ans.</note> It is one thing for a Prince to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect</hi>
his subjects; and an other to be <hi>partaker</hi> with them, or to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of their <hi>superstitions.</hi> Kings cannot enforce Consciences,
though pitcht upon a false Religion: All that Magistrates can do
against them (unlesse for <hi>Seducing,</hi> which a particular Statute made
<hi>Treason</hi>) is to punish their <hi>purses,</hi> for not observing his <hi>Statutes</hi>
respectively, or for exercising their Religion <hi>contrary</hi> to his
Lawes, But well it were if such a <hi>necessity</hi> of Connivance had no
such subject to work upon.</p>
                  <p>How happy had it been for this unlucky kingdom, if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
most prudent and pious <hi>offer,</hi> two yeare since, propounded
to us, had been accepted in this <hi>particular, That all the Children
of his subjects of that Religion, should be taken from them, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in the Religion of the Church of England?</hi> By which means,
the whole Kingdom, in a short space of time, would have been
peaceably reduced to an <hi>Vnity</hi> in Doctrine; And, if the same course
were taken with othe Srectaryes, an <hi>Vniformity</hi> in Discipline also.
But our Kingdom must not expect an universall and through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in all particulars, till Catechismes be more strictly
used, and the entercourse of Embassadours (which cannot simply
be avoyded) and Legers be restrained; and strict statutes made
and executed against <hi>sectaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to returne to our first matter. Admit <hi>Episcopacy</hi> were a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60563:23"/>
Government, accidentally inconvenient, and that a <hi>more fitting</hi>
Government, were discovered, prepared and made <hi>ready</hi> to be
set up, It would be but a <hi>new untryed</hi> Government, and not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
known what <hi>proportion</hi> it would beare without <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall</hi>
Constitutions. A horse may be well metled, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and every way commendable for the <hi>saddle;</hi> yet not draw
well in a Coach or <hi>Chariot:</hi> A great part of our <hi>Common-Law</hi>
is built upon the <hi>Cases</hi> of Bishops, insomuch that if that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be changed, there must be a necessary <hi>alteration</hi> of many
Lawes of the land; And what inconvenience may arise from such
an Alteration, I leave to the Judgment of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> being not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of some Consideration.</p>
                  <p>But let these things be accompted not <hi>Inconveniencyes,</hi> and
that the Hierarchicall Government is fit to be <hi>demolished,</hi> either
for the abuse of it, by some few exorbitant <hi>Prelates,</hi> or for the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
that follow, in respect of it <hi>self,</hi> in that it administers such
occasion of <hi>offence,</hi> yet the <hi>too sudden</hi> Execution of a busines of so
great a <hi>consequence,</hi> and concernment, gives a livelier testimony of
<hi>passion</hi> then discretion, (if Polititions may have credit) and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of <hi>extremity,</hi> (which is opposite to all virtue,) and too
much rashnesse, the <hi>distemper</hi> of all serious and honorable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings:
Too sudden an Alteration in matters of <hi>small</hi> moment,
passes not without some inconvenience; but, in things of such a
nature, as a <hi>Government,</hi> nay a <hi>Church</hi> government too (the <hi>nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery</hi>
of the whole Kingdoms happinesse or misery) it cannot be
without <hi>imminent</hi> danger; but the <hi>sudden</hi> alteration of a <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi>
Government of the Church, (which necessarily carryes
the State with it) threatens, nay brings no lesse then <hi>unavoidable
ruine</hi> to both.</p>
                  <p>A Rashnesse, too much (we feare) relishing of private ends to
demolish that government in <hi>twelve moneths,</hi> which hath been
setting up and maintained by as wise generations as ours, above
<hi>fourteene hundred yeeres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How happy had it been for this (at that time prosperous, but
now miserable) Kingdome, had we taken the advantage of (that
greatest <hi>blessing,</hi> that ever gracious Prince conferred upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
Subjects) the <hi>Trienniall Parliament,</hi> wherein, we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60563:23"/>
might every 3 years have inspected this <hi>new recoverd</hi> Kingdome,
and kept it alwayes in a perfect <hi>Crisis,</hi> the approaching Terror
whereof, would not have afforded popular evils so long a time,
or liberty to <hi>root</hi> themselves or gather <hi>head</hi> against the peace and
welfare of our happy Government; through the benefit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we might have taken an advantageous leisure and mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
to <hi>ripen</hi> every Bill, and, by <hi>degrees,</hi> to rectifie every <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd</hi>
Grievance; and indeed, what happines was there, which we
had not then an offerd <hi>opportunity</hi> to bring upon this (now) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Land? The Government of the <hi>State,</hi> as in many things,
it was reduced into an excellent <hi>temper;</hi> so, questionlesse, (had
not this unnaturall difference interposed) it had in all things (by
the continued goodnesse and favour of His Sacred Majesty) been
perfected, to the comfort of us, and the happinesse of succeeding
<hi>Generations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Government of the <hi>Church</hi> likewise might, by the vertue
of the granted <hi>Trienniall,</hi> been narrowly and exactly searcht into;
The <hi>Governours</hi> strictly observed; The <hi>Bad</hi> turned out, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for <hi>better;</hi> They that deserved punishment, punisht accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their <hi>misdemeanours;</hi> Others, lesse offending through
some neglect, <hi>reproved</hi> and <hi>checkt;</hi> and, upon no amendment, the
next <hi>Trienniall,</hi> proceeded against accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fig-tree</hi> was not presently cut downe, <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi>
but suffered till <hi>another yeare;</hi> And punishments before an <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi>
are too rashly and severely inflicted.</p>
                  <p>Thus by this graduall and Trienniall Course, Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
would have <hi>incorporated;</hi> the Government of the Church

the bad Governours had been <hi>rectified,</hi> or <hi>removed;</hi> the

                  </p>
                  <p>But the multitudes of these our nationall <hi>sins</hi> were too great,
to permit so great a <hi>Blessing</hi> on this Nation, as the benefit of this
<hi>Trienniall Prrliament.</hi> God suffered <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>see the holy
Land,</hi> but for the transgressions of the people, <hi>not to possesse it:</hi>
God shewed us a <hi>glimpse</hi> of that mercy (which our sins made us
unworthy to enjoy) and snacht it from us. In which respect, we

                  <p>Repl.</p>
                  <p>You triumph <hi>Cal.</hi> too much before the victory, and crow

in what I know: you condemne him, in what you know
not: What his <hi>Votes</hi> were, or how, or when made, it matters
not to me, but his opinion (declared to all the world) proclaims
him no lesse then <hi>Orthodox:</hi> I look upon him as a <hi>Divine,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely;
not as an <hi>Assembly-man,</hi> relatively: The Satyres <hi>hot</hi>
breath warmed his fingers, which else had been too cold: The

Honour belongs,</hi> commanding <hi>all things to be done decently and in

well in a Prince his Court, but he that is so fierie

                  <p>How this temporizing Doctor still courts <hi>Preferment!</hi> In his last

for a Court <hi>Chaplainship,</hi> wherein, he openly discovers how his
silken Conscience stands qualified for such imployment, being more
ready to sowe <hi>Pillows</hi> under Princes Elbowes, then denounce

are none of Gods <hi>wayes;</hi> but love, temperance, and moderation:
If your house have a <hi>flaw,</hi> or an unsound <hi>pillour,</hi> will you,
straight fire it; and, not rather prop it, and, by degrees, strengthen
it, for after service? Gods fire, (that appeared in the <hi>bush</hi>) gave

is but an <hi>Ignis lambens,</hi> or as rotten wood, shining in the dark;
Or if it be a true Fire, it is but of <hi>Juniper,</hi> which rather serves to

                  <p>I hope, <hi>Cal.</hi> It is not such a fire as yours, called <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi>
which entices poor soules, (wandering in the dark,) to breake
their necks; But (as you have excellently, (although against
your will) tearmed it) a fire of <hi>Iuniper;</hi> No perfume, sweeter;
no Coales, hotter; This Juniper fire sends up sweet perfumes
of <hi>Comfort</hi> to the broken heart, and contrite spirit; but threatens

Take heed of the Kings <hi>plunderers.</hi> The Parliaments Authority
is <hi>inscrutable,</hi> and too great a <hi>mistery</hi> for a private mans Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
But if the Doctors opinion be firmly grounded on the
word of God, my <hi>Confidence</hi> of his Piety is such, that neither
feare of <hi>Prisons,</hi> nor hope of <hi>Fortunes,</hi> are able to divert, or to
corrupt him: But, <hi>Cal.</hi> it had been better worth your paines, to
have refuted his opinion, by the strength of holy Scripture, then
pinned your <hi>implicite</hi> faith upon the Authority of men, though
never so learned or religious, being the self same <hi>Error,</hi> we cry
down, in Popery.</p>

you <hi>do</hi> the Act with a good Conscience, &amp; not <hi>heare</hi> of the Action
without impatience? How willingly can a dog <hi>foule</hi> the roome,

                  <p>I think no wise man doubts, that even in the purer

Ceremonies as well as in the substance of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

                  <p>A true <hi>Chip</hi> of the old block <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who after he had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarized
the name of the Altar, in the common eare, (not daring
to bring in <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> with a full Tide) innocently left out
those words in his <hi>Service book,</hi> which onely made the difference
betwixt a Sacrifice, and the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> so that, but one step more,
and the <hi>work</hi> had been fully done. So this our Doctor (not daring
to urge <hi>Ceremonies</hi> too loud, left the Godly should heare him) sets
the peaceable <hi>Custome</hi> of the former Saints betwixt him and the
danger of all good mens <hi>Censure.</hi> He made the example of the
Saints the <hi>wall</hi> by which his <hi>creeping</hi> Popery might hold, for feare
of falling; who, (had not this blessed <hi>Parliament</hi> dropt down from
heaven, to crush these Superstitions in their <hi>Rise</hi>) had been, by this,
as perfect a <hi>Proficient</hi> as the worst; had had his <hi>high</hi> tricks, his

have more lamented that sea of Christian <hi>blood,</hi> that hath been
shed about these <hi>Ceremenies,</hi> then I find you do: We contend,
so much, about the shell, that, I feare, we have lost the <hi>Kirnell:</hi>

                  <p>It was long since the Zealous Complaint of a Holy
Man, that men could no sooner get up their names in
the world, and be able readily and confidently to
muster up a few places of Scripture, nothing to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60563:36"/>
purpose, but they thought themselves sufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<hi>Moses</hi> himself, setting upon him as furiously

had it none of that Temper.</p>

to conclude none able for the Ministry, but such as have first
their <hi>Ordination</hi> from your popish Bishops, from whose imposition
of hands, they presently receive the <hi>spirit;</hi> till then, being neither

hands must enable a drunkard, or a whore-master, or
worse, to preach the sacred <hi>Word,</hi> and administer the holy <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
who now, by the virtue of this <hi>Hocas pocas,</hi> hath a capacity
to forgive sins, being (though formerly very ignorant) now gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more or lesse, according to the <hi>gift</hi> he brings; where they that
are called by the secret <hi>working</hi> of Gods spirit, inwardly, enlightned
by knowledge, and especiall <hi>Revelation,</hi> and able for Interpretation
(though never gifted with tongues) were not permitted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize
their ministeriall <hi>Function:</hi> but imprisoned, persecuted, and

                  <p>Repl.</p>
                  <p>True, <hi>Cal.</hi> you hit the intention right; and have so plainly
discovered yours too, that every fool may reade it; and (being
converted by you) approve it, too: wherein, you intimate, how
needlesse, Ordination and Learning are, to qualify a <hi>Minister;</hi>
and, that any, who finds himself gifted, may execute the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
office. Tel me, <hi>Cal.</hi> may any, that hath skill to make a shoe,

<hi>Halls</hi> say, no: Why? he hath skill in the <hi>Mistery,</hi> and his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship</hi>
is served! what hinders him, he cannot practice? His
Master must make him free, and he must performe the City <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.</hi>
And shall the calling of a Minister be undertaken by
every unexamined <hi>tagrag?</hi> Shall every <hi>Cobler, Feltmaker,</hi> or

                  <p>If good People should discerne some Errors, (and
those not small) in Princes, the best Patterne they can
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60563:43"/>
propound themselves is, that of <hi>Samuel</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 35.)
mourning and praying for <hi>Saul,</hi> not for Forme onely but
heartily, and fervently indeed; and the worst they can
pitch upon (unlesse they proceede to open Treason) is
that of common Newesmongers and seditious spirits,
who cannot make a Meale, spend a Fire, drink a Pint, or
drive away one hower, without some pragmaticall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and censure of Princes, and their State-Affayres.</p>
                  <p>Cal.</p>
                  <p>Nay Good Doctor; we have had many <hi>Samuels</hi> (or as good) that
have <hi>fasted</hi> and <hi>prayed,</hi> at least these twenty moneths, That God would
be pleased to <hi>turne the Kings heart, and bring him back to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
but god hath stopt his eares against us, and will not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And, since God hath made his pleasure so openly known through
the whole Land, (nay through the world too) that his Majesties heart
is fully resolved and knit to Popery and Superstition; shall we subjects
(whom it so much concernes) be afraid to <hi>communicate</hi> the businesse
to one another? Your conscience, Doctor, is growen a great <hi>Royalist;</hi>
but your tender <hi>Zeale</hi> of your Princes honour will hardly stop our
mouthes or close our eares; Our Case is so, that our discourse of him,
and <hi>States-matters</hi> too, cannot be too pragmaticall (as you call it)
we must, now, take advantage of those his <hi>faults,</hi> which our Fasts,
Prayers, and Petitions could not redresse; And, since his cruell <hi>Course</hi>
of life, and solid <hi>behaviour</hi> will not be a perfect <hi>white,</hi> we must die it
into a <hi>sadder colour;</hi> and these his <hi>Crimes,</hi> which our <hi>teares</hi> cannot
wash fairer, (for the comfort of ourselves and Children) our reports (for
the countenance of the <hi>Cause</hi>) must make fouler, for the <hi>exasperating</hi>
of our Confederates, and <hi>encouragement</hi> of our souldiers; so, that by
this christian <hi>Stratageme,</hi> through, the enterchange of <hi>newes</hi> (which
you condemne) we may facilitate our own <hi>designes.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cal.</hi> Your christian stratageme is but the modest tearme of a <hi>devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
project,</hi> or, in plainer English, a peece of <hi>errant knavery;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the father of your contrivements receives much <hi>glory;</hi> and the
God of Truth, no lesse <hi>dishonour:</hi> Read that <hi>statute</hi> which God
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60563:44"/>
made, <hi>Levit. 19. 16. Thou shalt not go up and down as a Talebearer
among thy people;</hi> where, in the end of the verse, he signes it with <hi>I
am the Lord.</hi> The <hi>falsenes</hi> of the Tale doubles the sinne; the <hi>base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
of the end trebles it; the <hi>person</hi> damnifyed (being a King)
makes it, quadruble; the persons <hi>venting</hi> it, (being subjects) makes
it terrible; but the <hi>place</hi> where it is commonly vented (being <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits</hi>)
makes it horrible; and by the <hi>ministers</hi> of the Gospel too;
and in the <hi>name</hi> of the God of truth too, almost impardonably <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;</hi>
Now <hi>Cal.</hi> Tell me how you like your <hi>Christian stratageme;</hi>
No wonder, if your <hi>Samuels</hi> were not heard: Tis well for you,
God Eares were closed against their prayers: Had he not been
deafe in <hi>Mercy:</hi> and mercifull to <hi>admiration;</hi> and admirable in
<hi>patience;</hi> they, surely, had been heard in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> to the terrible
example of such unparalleld <hi>Presumption.</hi> How often have your
solemne <hi>Petitions</hi> set <hi>dayes</hi> apart, for the expedition of your <hi>Martiall</hi>
attempts in a <hi>Pitcht field,</hi> or for the <hi>raising</hi> of a Seige? How often have your
solemnities been shewed in plentifull <hi>thanksgivings</hi> for
the blood of those thousands, whose soules (without infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
you cannot but conceive, in one day, dropt into the flames of
Hell! What Bells? What Bonefires? What tryumphs? And yet,
for the successe of your oft propounded, and (sometimes) accepted
<hi>Treaties</hi> of Peace, what one blessed <hi>hower</hi> hath been sequestred?
What <hi>Church</hi> doore hath been opened? Which makes me feare
(and not without just Cause) your <hi>Fastings</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> have been
rather to <hi>Contention,</hi> then to Unity; and that they have rather been
attractive for <hi>Iudgements,</hi> then for mercies, upon this blood-bedab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>As for such as will not take out this Lesson, let their

to the taking away the life of his life in his subjects

as to enjoy their Crownes; And if it be not lawfull
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60563:44"/>
thus to smite at their Persons, with the tongue onely,
shall that be thought Zeale for God, which seekes their

                  <p>Cal.</p>
                  <p>Doctor, you are very confident of your own learning, and definitive
<hi>Judgment,</hi> to tye every mans Zeale to your <hi>Rules:</hi> and it seemes, you are
more tender in flinging <hi>Dirt</hi> (as you tearme it) in your Soveraignes
face, then in preserving his soule from the <hi>flames</hi> of Hell: Neither do
I conceive it a thing so he ynous, to take his Subjects hearts from him,
as to <hi>unite</hi> them in the superstitious Bonds of Popery: And as for your
<hi>deposing</hi> him from the Crown, (which you falsely call his absolute
Inheritance) if he break the <hi>Covenants,</hi> whereby the Crown is set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his head, he <hi>dissolves</hi> his own Authority, and our Obedience; and
himself is become his own <hi>deposer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Repl.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cal.</hi> It is not the Doctor, that prescribes Rules to anothers <hi>Zeale,</hi>
but the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> from whence he drawes his infallable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and Conclusions; And whereas you censure him for more
prizing the <hi>cleannesse</hi> of his soveraignes face, then the <hi>wel-fare</hi> of
his soul, your malice wrongs him in your <hi>hop-frog</hi> confutation;
wherein, you make a wilfull preterition of that poynt, whereof you
censure his neglect, in the wrong place. And whereas, you turne
Deposition upon the <hi>default</hi> of Princes, know, kingdoms are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Copyholds,</hi> nor <hi>Leases;</hi> subject, either to <hi>forfeiture,</hi> or <hi>Reentry:</hi>
Kings have, from God, their power of <hi>reigning;</hi> from Man, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony

                  <p>In fine, <hi>David</hi> thought him (<hi>viz.</hi> that slew <hi>Saul</hi>) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of no Reward but death; and of this, so worthy, that
instantly he gave order for his execution, with this sharp
sentence uttered, Thy Blood be upon thine own head,
for thine own mouth hath testified against thee, saying,

                     <hi>I have slaine the Lords Annoynted;</hi> A memorable example,
and an Argument unanswerable against all King-killers,
and deposers of absolute Princes, absolutely annoynted
by just title, as here with us.</p>
                  <p>Cal.</p>
                  <p>Here, revereud Doctor, Your <hi>Simile</hi> limps: First, <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi>
and, (knowing the Crown so neare his head,) spared that life,
which he knew so neare a <hi>Period;</hi> not willing to dabble his <hi>Conscience</hi>
in such needlesse blood: Secondly, (being confident himself was the
next <hi>successor</hi>) commanded present Execution, to terrify his new <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
from the like presumption: Thirdly, (Though you deny it) our
Kings bold not their Crownes by such an <hi>absolute</hi> Title, as those of
<hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Repl.</p>
                  <p>Is the Doctors <hi>Simile</hi> lame, <hi>Cal.</hi> Sure, 'twas your ill usage
made it so: But say, was <hi>David</hi> a Prophet? Had he speciall <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations?</hi>
then, doubtlesse, his wayes and actions were the best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
for us, to follow: But was he a Prophet? Then, sure, he knew
it a heynous sin, to take away the life of Gods <hi>Vicegerent</hi> (though an
Idolater) Had he speciall Revelations? then, questionlesse, he knew
death a just Reward for killing the Lords <hi>Annoynted</hi> (though a
wicked King.) But did this Prophets heart <hi>smite</hi> him, for cutting
off his Soveraignes <hi>skirt?</hi> then, sure, God will not let him go <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smitten,</hi>
that takes his Crown from off his head, or power, from his
hand: But, <hi>Cal.</hi> how truth will be confest by your unwilling lips!
which intimate, the Prophets conscience had been <hi>dabbled in blood,</hi>
had the deed been done, and his subjects <hi>guilty of presumption,</hi> that
should do the like: And, whereas you deny our Kings so <hi>absolute</hi> a
power, or title as the Kings of former times, you should have done
to better purpose, to shew, <hi>who</hi> limited it, and <hi>when;</hi> for your own
single <hi>assertion</hi> is not Classicall.</p>

                  <p>Authority is ever one of Envies eye-sores: Subjection

then the people may suspend Obedience, and cast off the yoke of
their Subjection: We that <hi>are received into the liberty of the sons

The one, to crush the liberty of the too proud subject; The other,
to exercise the consciences of his chosen people: In both, to work

what Prayer was that? even that <hi>English Masse-book,</hi> which (God

their Accusations require many witnesses. <hi>Eutichianus</hi> an ancient

Councel of <hi>Laterane (Vide Append. Concil. Lat. 3. par. 50. cap. 69.)</hi>
It was decreed, That upon an <hi>unproved</hi> accusation of a Clerick,

<hi>wanderers,</hi> all that came <hi>uncalled,</hi> all under 14. yeares of age, and all
that the Accuser brings from <hi>home</hi> with him, shall be rejected, as
<hi>Witnesses,</hi> against a Minister. Another Decree of <hi>Analectus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
the <hi>Accuser</hi> to be a witnesse, or the witnesses to be such as are
<hi>revengefull,</hi> and must be cleare of all suspition. In a Synod at Rome,
about <hi>Constantines</hi> time, it was decreed, No <hi>Deacon</hi> should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

words? How often were his Doctrines traduced, as <hi>false?</hi> How often
was his <hi>Authority</hi> questioned? nay more, denyed? Yet he reviled them
not. Doctor, stroke downe your stomack; The closer you follow
<hi>Christ,</hi> the cheerfullier your <hi>flock</hi> will follow you: But know, in things

                        <p>It is impossible for those who were once enlightned, and have tasted of
the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Spirit,</p>
                        <p>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
come;</p>
                        <p>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance: seeing
they crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an
open shame.</p>

                  <p>To the Readers.</p>
                  <p>NOw the businesse is ended. If you look upon this <hi>skirmish</hi> with
a generall eye, you wil see nothing but (as in a Battail) smoak
and confusion: But if you mark every ones particular behaviour, you
wil easily distinguish betwixt a <hi>rash fierie spirit,</hi> and a <hi>truly valiant.</hi>
In the <hi>Doctor,</hi> you shall find a <hi>David,</hi> fighting Gods defensive <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes,</hi>
without sinister respects, or private <hi>passion:</hi> In <hi>Cal.</hi> you shal
see the son of <hi>Nimshi,</hi> marching furiously, and hewing downe the
<hi>Priests</hi> of Baal, yet neverthelesse a great worshipper of <hi>Calves:</hi>
In the <hi>Replyer,</hi> you may behold <hi>Ionathan</hi> comming a <hi>Reserve</hi> to
<hi>David,</hi> though perchance shooting his arrowes sometimes <hi>wide,</hi>
and sometimes <hi>open:</hi> It lyes in you, Readers, now, to judge, and
give the <hi>Palme:</hi> For the Doctors part and mine (would <hi>Cal.</hi> durst
make the third) we both resigne our shares: Let Truth be crowned
with the Victory, and the God of Truth, with Glory.</p>
