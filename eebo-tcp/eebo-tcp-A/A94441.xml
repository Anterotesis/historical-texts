            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We, (as all other Counties of this Realme) are deeply ſenſible of the many common and heavie Grievances (under which the whole three Kingdomes ſuffer) occaſioned by the Prelates, and have juſt cauſe to rejoyce at, and acknowledge with thankfullneſſe, the pious care already taken by your Honours for the ſuppreſſing of the growth of Popery; the better ſupply of able Miniſters in all places to inſtruct the People; removing of all Innovations, and for your indeavours to ſuppreſſe and remove our Lordly Prelates, the ſole Authors of all our preſent miſeries, Innovations, and moſt profeſſed enemies of the Goſpell: and we doubt not but in your great Wiſdomes you will not only regulate the rigour of their exorbitant Eccleſiaſticall Courts, but likewiſe wholly extirpate them, as neither ſuiting with the Temper of our Laws, nor the nature of Free-men.</p>

               <hi>Primitive Church) by a numerous Presbytery and ruling Elders,</hi> (farre leſſe in power, though more in number) according to the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and thoſe this Honourable Aſſembly (not the Convocation, or every Biſhop in his Dioceſe at his meere pleaſure) ſhall preſcribe; we dare aſſure our ſelves, no ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences ſhal be found in that Government, equivalent to thoſe of Epiſcopacie; which how corrigible they have been by Parliaments and Councels, how ill conſiſtent with a Monarchie; and how dangerouſly conducible to an Anarchie; their incorrigibleneſſe, Treaſons, Rebellions, Conſpiracies, with the Warres and tumults occaſioned by them in all former ages, and now, abundantly manifeſt. And therfore we have juſt cauſe to pray againſt their continuance, as fearing their conſequences would prove the utter loſſe of pietie, Libertie, unitie, peace, Laws, and divine learning, and neceſſarily produce an extermination, if not of Nobilitie, Gentrie, and Order, yet certainly of Religion, and all true pietie.</p>
            <p>With what vehemencie and arrogancie of Spirit the Prelates and their Inſtruments have proſecuted all good Miniſters and people of all ſorts, even to the loſſe of Members, Blood, Libertie, Life, Goods, Fortunes: and how many thouſands of his Majeſties good Subjects they have driven out of the Realme into Forraigne parts; and how plauſible your Honourable proceedings in this preſent Seſſion of Parliament againſt their Innovations, Canons, Exorbitances, (yea, and their very Callings too) have been to the whole Kingdome (who daily bleſſe <hi>God</hi> for them) we need not repreſent to your honours. And therfore humbly pray, that ſome preſent ſpeedie courſe may be taken, as in your Wiſdomes ſhall be thought fit, to ſuppreſſe all Lordly Prelates; together with the importing, Printing and diſperſing of all Popiſh and Arminian Bookes, and the calling in and burning of thoſe forenamed, (eſpecially of the late Canons, Oarh, and Act for the Benevolence) which have produced dangerous diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents both in the Clergie and common people, We having great cauſe to feare, that of all the diſtempers which at preſent threaten the welfare of this State, there is none more worthy the mature and grave conſideration of this Honourable Aſſembly, then to ſtop the Torrent of ſuch ambitious Spirits, as lye masked under our Lordly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates white Rochets, before they ſwell beyond the bounds of Government, and drown his Majeſties three whole Kingdomes in a deluge of blood, and utter deſolation. Then we doubt not but his Majeſtie, perſevering in his gracious inclination to heare the Complaints, and relieve the grievances of his Subjects in frequent Parliaments, it will ſo unite the Head and the Bodie (<note place="margin">(k) Archbiſhops Charges Art. 14.

               <hi>We have preſumed to annex a Copy of ſeverall Petitions exhibited to your Honours againſt the Prelates this Parliament, and of ſundry Poſitions preached by their inſtruments in this and other Counties, which we conceive imply matter of dangerous conſequence to the peace both of Church and State: together with a briefe Remonſtrance of ſundry Grievances, Innovations and Perſecutions, under which we of this County (eſpecially thoſe of the City of </hi>Cheſter<hi>) have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably ſuffered, by meanes of our now Biſhop, and the High-Commiſſioners at </hi>Yorke.<hi> All which we humbly ſubmit to your grave judgements, praying that they may be read, and redreſſed.</hi>
