            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which I knew to be the part of a good Magiſtrate, aiming at true liberty through the right information of religious and civil life, and that which I ſaw, and was partaker, of your Vows and ſolemne Cov'nants, Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England, your actions alſo manifeſtly tending to exalt the truth, and to depreſſe the tyranny of error, and ill cuſtome, with more conſtancy and proweſſe then ever yet any, ſince that Parlament which put the firſt Scepter of this Kingdom into his hand whom God and extraordinary vertue made thir Monarch, were the cauſes that mov'd me, one elſe not placing much in the eminence of a dedication, to preſent your high notice with a Diſcourſe, conſcious to it ſelf of nothing more then of diligence, and firm affection to the publick good. And tbat ye took it ſo as wiſe and impartial men, obtaining ſo great power and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are wont to accept, in matters both doubtfull and important, what they think offer'd them well meant, and from a rational ability, I had no leſſe then to perſwade me. And on that perſwaſton am return'd, as to a famous and free Port, my ſelf alſo bound by more then a</hi> maritime <hi>Law, to expoſe as freely what fraughtage I conceave to bring of no trifles. For although it be generally known, how and by whom ye have been inſtigated to a hard cenſure of that former book entitl'd, The Doctrine, and Diſeipline of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, an opinion held by ſome of the beſt among reformed Writers without ſcandal or confutement, though now thought new and dangerous by ſome of our ſevere</hi> Gnoſtics, <hi>whoſe little reading, and leſſe meditating holds ever with hardeſt obſtinacy tbat which it took up with eaſieſt credulity, I do not find yet that ought, for the furious ineitements which have been uſed, hath iſſu'd by your appointment, that might give the leaſt interruption or diſrepute either to the Author, or to the Book. Which he who will be better advis'd then to call your neglect, or connivence at a thing imagin'd ſo peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, can attribute it to nothing more juſtly, then to the deep and quiet ſtreame of your direct and calme deliberations; that gave not way either to the fervent raſhneſſe, or the immaterial gravity of thoſe who ceas'd not to exaſperate without cauſe. For which uprightneſſe and incorrupt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of what ye were incens'd to, Lords and Commons, (though it were don to juſtice, not to me, and was a peculiar demonſtration how farre your waies are different from the raſh vulgar) beſides tboſe allegiances of oath and
<pb facs="tcp:123241:3"/>
duty, which are my publie debt to your public labours, I have yet a ſtore of gratitude laid up, which cannot be exhauſted; and ſuch thanks perhaps they may live to be, as ſhall more then whiſper to the next ages. Yet that the Author may be known to ground himſelf upon his own innocence, and the merit of his cauſe, not upon the favour of a diverſion, or a delay to any juſt cenſure, but wiſhes rather he might ſee thoſe his detracters at any fair mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as learned debatements are privileg'd with a due freedome under equall Moderators, I ſhall here briefly ſingle one of them (becauſe he hath oblig'd me to it) who I perſwade me having ſcarſe read the book, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him who writ it, or at leaſt faining the latter, bath not forborn to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize him, unconferr'd with, unadmoniſht, undealt with by any Paſtorly or brotherly convincement, in the moſt open and invective manner, and at the moſt bitter opportunity that drift or ſet deſigne could have invented. And this, when as the Canon Law, though commonly moſt favouring the boldneſſe of their Prieſts, puniſhes the naming or traducing of any perſon in the Pulpit, was by him made no ſcruple. If I ſhall therfore take licence by the right of nature, and that liberty wherin I was born, to defend my ſelf publicly againſt a printed Calumny, and do willingly appeal to thoſe Judges to whom I am accus'd, it can be no immoderate, or unallowable courſe of ſeeking ſo juſt and needfull reparations. Which I had don long ſince, had not theſe employments, which are now viſible, deferr'd me. It was preacht before ye, Lords and Commons, in Auguſt laſt upon a ſpecial day of humiliation, that</hi> there was a wicked Book abroad, <hi>and ye were taxt of ſin that it was yet</hi> uncenſur'd, the book deſerving to be burnt, <hi>and</hi> impudence <hi>alſo was charg'd upon the Author, who durſt</hi> ſet his name to it, and dedicate it to your ſelves. <hi>Firſt, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, I pray to that God, before whom ye then were proſtrate, ſo to forgive ye thoſe omiſſions and treſpaſſes, which ye deſire moſt ſhould find forgivneſs, as I ſhall ſoon ſhew to the world how eaſily ye abſolve your ſelves of that which this man calls your ſin, and is indeed your wiſdome, and your Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereof to this day ye have don well not to repent. He terms it</hi> a wicked book, <hi>and why but</hi> for allowing other cauſes of Divorce, then Chriſt and his Apoſtles mention; <hi>and with the ſame cenſure condemns of wickedneſſe not onely</hi> Martin Bucer <hi>that elect Inſtrument of Reformation, highly honour'd and had in reverence by</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth, and his whole Parlament, whom alſo I had publiſht in Engliſh by a good providence, about a week before this calumnious digreſſion was preach'd; ſo that if he knew not</hi> Bucer <hi>then, as he ought to have known, he might at leaſt have known him ſome months after, ere the Sermon came in print,
<pb facs="tcp:123241:3"/>
wherein notwithſtanding he perſiſts in his former ſentence, and condemnes again of wickedneſſe, either ignorantly or wilfully, not onely</hi> Martin Bucer, <hi>and all the choiſeſt and holieſt of our Reformers, but the whole Parlament and Church of England in thoſe beſt and pureſt times of</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth. All which I ſhall prove with good evidence, at the end of theſe Explanations. And then let it be judg'd and ſeriouſly conſider'd with what hope the affairs of our Religion are committed to one among others, who hath now onely left him which of the twain he will chooſe, whether this ſhall be his palpable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or the ſame wickedneſſe of his own book, which he ſo laviſhly imputes to the writings of other men: and whether this of his, that thus peremptorily defames and attaints of wickedneſſe unſpotted Churches, unblemiſht Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the moſt eminent reſtorers of Chriſtian Doctrine, deſerve not to be burnt firſt. And if his heat had burſt out onely againſt the opinion, his wonted paſſion had no doubt bin ſilently born with wonted patience. But ſince againſt the charity of that ſolemne place and meeting, it ſerv'd him furder to inveigh opprobriouſly againſt the perſon, branding him with no leſſe then impudence, onely for ſetting his name to what he had writt'n, I muſt be excus'd not to be ſo wanting to the defence of an honeſt name, or to the reputation of thoſe good men who afford me their ſociety, but to be ſenſible of ſuch a foule endeavour'd diſgrace: not knowing ought either in mine own deſerts, or the Laws of this Land, why I ſhould be ſubject, in ſuch a notorious and illegal manner, to the intemperancies of this mans preaching choler. And indeed to be ſo prompt and ready in the midſt of his humbleneſſe, to toſſe reproaches of this bulk and ſize, argues as if they were the weapons of his exerciſe, I am ſure not of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, or of that dayes work. Certainly to ſubſcribe my name at what I was to own, was what the State had order'd and requires. And he who liſts not to be malicious, would call it ingenuity, cleer conſcience, willingneſſe to avouch what might be queſtion'd, or to be better inſtructed. And if God were ſo diſpleaſ'd with thoſe,</hi> Iſa. 58. <hi>who</hi> on the ſolemne faſt were wont to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe, <hi>it could be no ſigne of his own humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation accepted, which diſpos'd him to ſmite ſo keenly with a reviling tongue. But if onely to have writ my name muſt be counted</hi> impudence, <hi>how doth this but juſtifie another, who might affirm with as good warrant, that the late Diſcourſe of</hi> Scripture and Reaſon, <hi>which is certain to be chiefly his own draught, was publiſht without a name, out of baſe fear, and the ſly avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of what might follow to his detriment, if the party at Court ſhould hap to reach him. And I, to have ſet my name, where he accuſes me to have ſet it, am ſo far from recanting, that I offer my hand alſo if need be, to make good the ſame opinion which I there maintain, by inevitable conſequences drawn parallel from his own principal arguments in that of</hi> Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb facs="tcp:123241:4"/>
               <hi>which I ſhall pardon him, if he can deny, without ſhaking his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to peeces. The</hi> impudence <hi>therfore, ſince he waigh'd ſo little what a groſſe revile that was to give his equall, I ſend him back again for a</hi> phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactery <hi>to ſtitch upon his arrogance, that cenſures not onely before conviction ſo bitterly without ſo much as one reaſon giv'n, but cenſures the Congregation of his Governors to their faces, for not being ſo haſty as himſelf to cenſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas my other crime is, that I addreſſ'd the Dedication of what I had ſtudied, to the Parlament, how could I better declare the loyalty which Iowe to that ſupreme and majeſtick Tribunal, and the opinion which I have of the high-entruſted judgement, and perſonall worth aſſembl'd in that place. With the ſame affections therfore, and the ſame addicted fidelity, Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England, I here again have brought to your peruſal on the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe following Expoſitions of Scripture. The former book, as pleas'd ſome to think, who were thought judicious, had of reaſon in it to a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; what they requir'd, was that the Scriptures there alleg'd, might he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſ'd more fully. To their deſires, thus much furder hath been labour'd in the Scriptures. Another ſort alſo who wanted more autorities, and citations, have not been here unthought of. If all this attain not to ſatisfie them, as I am confident that none of thoſe our great controverſies at this day, hath had a more demonſtrative explaining, I muſt confeſſe to admire what it is, for doubtleſſe it is not reaſon now adayes that ſatisfies, or ſuborns the common cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of men, to yeeld ſo eaſily, and grow ſo vehement in matters much more diſputable, and farre leſſe conducing to the daily good and peace of life. Some whoſe neceſſary ſhifts haeve long enur'd them to cloak the defects of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudied yeers, and hatred now to learn, under the appearance of a grave ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, which eſtimation they have gain'd among weak perceivers, find the eaſe of ſlighting what they cannot refute, and are determin'd, as I hear, to hold it not worth the anſwering. In which number I muſt be forc'd to reck'n that Doctor, who in a late equivocating Treatiſe plauſibly ſet afloat againſt the</hi> Dippers, <hi>diving the while himſelfwith a more deep prelatical malignance againſt the preſent ſtate, &amp; Church-government, mentions with ignominy</hi> the Tractate of Divorce; <hi>yet anſwers nothing, but inſtead thereof (for which I do not commend his marſhalling) ſets</hi> Moſes <hi>alſo among the crew of his Anabaptiſts; as one who to a holy Nation, the Common-wealth of Iſrael, gave Laws</hi> breaking the bonds of mariage to inordinate luſt. <hi>Theſe are no mean ſurges of blaſphemy, not onely</hi> dipping Moſes <hi>the divine Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, but daſhing with a high hand againſt the juſtice and purity of God himſelf; as theſe enſuing Scriptures plainly and freely handl'd ſhall verifie to the launcing of that old</hi> apoſtemated <hi>error. Him therefore I leave now to his repentance.</hi>

               <hi>Others, which is their courteſie, confeſſe that wit and parts may do much to make that ſeem true which is not (as was objected to</hi> Socrates <hi>by them who could not reſiſt his efficacy, that he ever made the worſe cauſe ſeem the better) and thus thinking themſelves diſcharg'd of the difficulty, love not to wade furder into the fear of a convincement. Theſe will be their excuſes to decline the full examining of this ſerious point. So much the more I preſſe it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, Lords and Commons, that ye beware while time is, ere this grand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and onely art of ignorance affecting tyrany, grow powerfull and rule among us. For if ſound argument and reaſon ſhall be thus put off, either by an undervaluing ſilence, or the maiſterly cenſure of a rayling word or two in the Pulpit, or by rejecting the force of truth, as the meer cunning of eloquence, and Sophiſtry, what can be the end of this, but that all good learning and knowledge will ſuddenly decay: Ignorance, and illiterate preſumption, which is yet but our diſeaſe, will turn at length into our very conſtitution, and prove the</hi> hectic <hi>evill of this age: worſe to be fear'd, if it get once to reign over us, then any fift Monarchy. If this ſhall be the courſe, that what was wont to be a chief commendation, and the ground of other mens confidence in an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, his diligence, his learning, his elocution whether by right, or by ill mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning granted him, ſhall be turn'd now to a diſadvantage and ſuſpicion againſt him, that what he writes though unconfuted, muſt therefore be miſtruſted, therfore not receiv'd for the induſtry, the exactneſſe, the labour in it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ'd to be more then ordnary; as if wiſdome had now forſak'n the thirſtie and laborious inquirer to dwell againſt her nature with the arrogant and ſhallow babler, to what purpoſe all thoſe pains and that continual ſearching requir'd of us by</hi> Solomon <hi>to the attainment of underſtanding; why are men bred up with ſuch care and expence to a life of perpetual ſtudies, why do your ſelves with ſuch endeavour ſeek to wipe off the imputation of intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcourage the progreſſe and advance of learning? He therfore whoſe heart can bear him to the high pitch of your noble enterpriſes, may eaſily aſſure himſelf that the prudence and farre-judging circumſpectneſſe of ſo grave a Magiſtracy ſitting in Parlament, who have before them the prepar'd and purpos'd Act of their moſt religious predeceſſors to imitate in this queſtion, cannot reject the cleerneſſe of theſe reaſons, and theſe allegations both here and formerly offer'd them; nor can over-look the neceſſity of ordaining more wholſomly and more humanly in the caſualties of Divorce, then our Laws have yet eſtabliſht: if the moſt urgent and exceſſive grievances hapning in domeſtick life, be worth the laying to heart, which, unleſſe charity be farre from us, cannot be neglected. And that theſe things both in the right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and in the right reformation of a Common-wealth call for ſpeedieſt redreſſe, and ought to be the firſt conſider'd, anough was urg'd in what was
<pb facs="tcp:123241:5"/>
prefac'd to that monument of</hi> Bucer <hi>which I brought to your remembrance, and the other time before. Hence forth, except new cauſe be giv'n, I ſhall ſay leſſe and leſſe. For if the Law make not timely proviſion, let the Law, as reaſon is, bear the cenſure of thoſe conſequences, which her own default now more evidently produces. And if men want manlineſſe to expoſtulate the right of their due ranſom, and to ſecond their own occaſions, they may ſit hereafter and bemoan themſelves to have neglected through faintneſſe the onely remedy of their ſufferings, which a ſeaſonable and well grounded ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might have purchas'd them. And perhaps in time to come, others will know how to eſteem what is not every day put into their hands, when they have markt events, and better weigh'd how hurtfull and unwiſe it is, to hide a ſecret and pernicious rupture under the ill counſell of a baſhfull ſilence. But who would diſtruſt ought, or not be ample in his hopes of your wiſe and Chriſtian determinations? who have the prudence to conſider, and ſhould have the goodneſſe like gods, as ye are call'd, to find out readily, and by juſt Law to adminiſter thoſe redreſſes which have of old, not without God ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bin granted to the adverſities of mankind, ere they who needed, were put to ask. Certainly, if any other have enlarg'd his thoughts to expect from this government ſo juſtly undertak'n, and by frequent aſſiſtances from heaven ſo apparently upheld, glorious changes and renovations both in Church and State, he among the formoſt might be nam'd, who prayes that the fate of England may tarry for no other Deliverers.</hi>

                     <hi>SO God created man in his owne image.]</hi> To be inform'd aright in the whole Hiſtory of Mariage, that we may know for certain, not by a forc't yoke, but by an impartial definition, what Mariage is, and what is not Mariage; it will undoubtedly be lafeſt, faireſt, and moſt with our obedience, to enquire, as our Saviours direction is, how it was in the beginning. And that we begin ſo high as man created after Gods owne Image, there want not earneſt cauſes. For nothing now adayes is more degenerately forgott'n, then the true dignity of man, almoſt in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but eſpecially in this prime inſtitution of Matrimony, wherein his native pre-eminence ought moſt to ſhine. Although if we conſider that juſt and naturall privileges men neither can rightly ſeek, nor dare fully claime, unleſſe they be ally'd to inward goodneſſe, and ſtedfaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that the want of this quells them to a ſervile ſenſe of their own
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123241:6"/>
conſcious unworthineſſe, it may ſave the wondring why in this age many are ſo oppoſite both to human and to Chriſtian liberty, either while they underſtand not, or envy others that do; contenting, or rather priding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a ſpecious humility and ſtrictneſſe bred out of low ignorance that never yet conceiv'd the freedome of the Goſpel; and is therefore by the Apoſtle to the Coloſſians rankt with no better company, then Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and the meer ſhew of wiſdome. And how injurious herein they are, if not to themſelves, yet to their neighbours, and not to them only, but to the all-wiſe and bounteous grace offer'd us in our redemption, will order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[In the Image of God created he him.]</hi> It is anough determin'd, that this Image of God wherin man was created, is meant Wiſdom, Purity, Juſtice, and rule over all creatures. All which being loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> was recover'd with gain by the merits of Chriſt. For albeit our firſt parent had lordſhip over ſea, and land, and aire, yet there was a law without him, as a guard ſet over him. But Chriſt having cancell'd the hand writing of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which was againſt us, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 14. and interpreted the fulfilling of all through charity, hath in that reſpect ſet us overlaw, in the free cuſtody of his love, and left us victorious under the guidance of his living Spirit, not under the dead letter; to follow that which moſt edifies, moſt aides and furders a religious life, makes us holieſt and likeſt to his immortall Image, not that which makes us moſt conformable and captive to civill and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat precepts; whereof the ſtricteſt obſervance may oftimes prove the deſtruction not only of many innocent perſons and families, but of whole Nations. Although indeed no ordinance human or from heav'n can binde againſt the good of man; ſo that to keep them ſtrictly againſt that end, is all one with to breake them. Men of moſt renowned vertu have ſometimes by tranſgreſſing, moſt truly kept the law; and wiſeſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates have permitted and diſpenc't it; while they lookt not peeviſhly at the letter, but with a greater ſpirit at the good of mankinde, if alwayes not writt'n in the characters of law, yet engrav'n in the heart of man by a divine impreſſion. This Heathens could ſee, as the well-read in ſtory can recount of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> whom <hi>Cicero</hi> in his firſt booke of <hi>invention</hi> nobly defends. <hi>All law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we ought referr to the common good, and interpret by that, not by the ſcrowl of letters. No man obſerves law for laws ſake, but for the good of them for whom it was made.</hi> The reſt might ſerv well to lecture theſe times, deluded through belly-doctrines into a devout ſlavery. The Scripture alſo affords us <hi>David</hi> in the ſhew-bread, <hi>Hezechiah</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:123241:6"/>
in the paſſeover ſound and ſafe tranſgreſſors of the literall command, which alſo diſpenc'd not ſeldom with it ſelf; and taught us on what juſt occaſions to doe ſo: untill our Saviour for whom that great and God-like work was reſerv'd, redeem'd us to a ſtate above preſcriptions by diſſolving the whole law into charity. And have we not the ſoul to underſtand this, and muſt we againſt this glory of Gods tranſcendent love towards us be ſtill the ſervants of a literall indightment?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Created he him.]</hi> It might be doubted why he ſaith, <hi>In the Image of God created he him,</hi> not them, as well as <hi>male and female</hi> them; eſpecially ſince that Image might be common to them both, but <hi>male and female</hi> could not, however the Jewes fable, and pleaſe themſelvs with the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall concurrence of <hi>Plato's</hi> wit, as if man at firſt had bin created <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite:</hi> but then it muſt have bin male and female created he him. So had the Image of God bin equally common to them both, it had no doubt bin ſaid, In the image of God created he them. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ends the controverſie by explaining that the woman is not primarily and immediatly the image of God, but in reference to the man. <hi>The head of the woman,</hi> ſaith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>is the man: he the image and glory of God, ſhe the glory of the man:</hi> he not for her, but ſhe for him. Therefore his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is, <hi>Wives be ſubject to your huſbands as is fit in the Lord, Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>In every thing, Eph.</hi> 5. 24. Nevertheleſſe man is not to hold her as a ſervant, but receives her into a part of that empire which God proclaims him to, though not equally, yet largely, as his own image and glory: for it is no ſmall glory to him, that a creature ſo like him, ſhould be made ſubject to him. Not but that particular exceptions may have place, if ſhe exceed her husband in prudence and dexterity, and he contentedly yeeld, for then a ſuperior and more naturall law comes in, that the wiſer ſhould govern the leſſe wiſe, whether male or female. But that which far more eaſily and obediently follows from this verſe, is that, ſeeing woman was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made for man, and he her head, it cannot ſtand before the breath of this divine utterance, that man the portraiture of God, joyning to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his intended good and ſolace an inferiour ſexe, ſhould ſo becom her thrall, whoſe wilfulnes or inability to be a wife fruſtrates the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionall end of her creation, but that he may acquitt himſelf to freedom by his naturall birth-right, and that indeleble character of priority which God crown'd him with. If it be urg'd that ſin hath loſt him this, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is not far to ſeek, that from her the ſin firſt proceeded, which keeps her juſtly in the ſame proportion ſtill beneath. She is not to gain by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123241:7"/>
firſt in the tranſgreſſion, that man ſhould furder looſe to her, becauſe already he hath loſt by her means. Oft it happens that in this matter he is without fault; ſo that his puniſhment herein is cauſeles: and God hath the praiſe in our ſpeeches of him, to ſort his puniſhment in the ſame kind with the offence. Suppoſe he err'd; it is not the intent of God or man, to hunt an error ſo to the death with a revenge beyond all meaſure and proportion. But if we argue thus, this affliction is befaln him for his ſin, therefore he muſt bear it, without ſeeking the only remedy, firſt it will be falſe that all affliction comes for ſin, as in the caſe of <hi>Joh,</hi> and of the man born blind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 3, was evident: next by that reaſon, all miſeries comming for ſin, we muſt let them all lye upon us like the vermin of an Indian <hi>Cathariſt,</hi> which his fond religion forbids him to moleſt. Were it a particular puniſhment inflicted through the anger of God upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or upon a land, no law hinders us in that regard, no law but bidds us remove it if we can: much more if it be a dangerous temptation withall, much more yet, if it be certainly a temptation, and not certainly a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though a pain. As for what they ſay we muſt bear with patience, to bear with patience, and to ſeek effectuall remedies, implies no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. It may no leſſe be for our diſobedience, our unfaithfulnes, and other ſins againſt God, that wives becom adulterous to the bed, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionles we ought to take the affliction as patiently, as chriſtian prudence would wiſh; yet hereby is not loſt the right of divorcing for adultery. No you ſay, becauſe our Saviour excepted that only. But why, if he were ſo bent to puniſh our ſins, and try our patience in binding on us a diſaſtrous mariage, why did he except adultery? Certainly to have bin bound from divorce in that caſe alſo had bin as plentifull a puniſhment to our ſins, and not too little work for the patienteſt. Nay perhaps they will ſay it was too great a ſufferance: And with as ſlight a reaſon, for no wiſe man but would ſooner pardon the act of adultery once and again committed by a perſon worth pitty and forgivnes, then to lead a weariſom life of unloving &amp; unquiet converſation with one who neither affects nor is affected, much leſſe with one who exerciſes all bitternes, and would commit adultery too, but for envy leſt the perſecuted condition ſhould thereby get the benefit of his freedom. 'Tis plain therefore that God enjoyns not this ſuppoſed ſtrictnes of not divorcing either to puniſh us, or to try our patience.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if man be the image of God, which conſiſts in holines, and woman ought in the ſame reſpect to be the image and companion of man, in ſuch wiſe to belov'd, as the Church is belov'd of Chriſt, and if, as God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123241:7"/>
is the head of Chriſt, and Chriſt the head of man, ſo man is the head of woman; I cannot ſee by this golden dependance of headſhip and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but that Piety and Religion is the main tye of Chriſtian Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: So as if there be found between the pair a notorious diſparity either of wickednes or hereſie, the husband by all manner of right is diſingag'd from a creature, not made and inflicted on him to the vexation of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes; the wife alſo, as her ſubjection is terminated in the Lord, being her ſelf the redeem'd of Chriſt, is not ſtill bound to be the vaſſall of him, who is the bondſlave of Satan: ſhe being now neither the image nor the glory of ſuch a perſon, nor made for him, nor left in bondage to him; but hath recours to the wing of charity, and protection of the Church; unless there be a hope on either ſide; yet ſuch a hope muſt be meant, as may be a rationall hope, and not an endles ſervitude. Of which hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But uſually it is objected, that if it be thus, then there can be no true mariage between misbeleevers and irreligious perſons? I might anſwer, let them ſee to that who are ſuch; the Church hath no commiſſion to judge thoſe without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. But this they will ſay perhaps, is but penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to reſolv a doubt. I anſwer therefore, that where they are both irreligious, the mariage may be yet true anough to them in a civill relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For there are left ſom remains of Gods image in man, as he is meerly man; which reaſon God gives againſt the ſhedding of mans bloud, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. as being made in Gods image, without expreſſion whether he were a good man or a bad, to exempt the ſlayer from puniſhment. So that in thoſe mariages where the parties are alike void of Religion, the wife owes a civill homage and ſubjection, the husband owes a civill loyalty. But where the yoke is miſ-yok't, heretick with faithfull, godly with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, to the grievance and manifeſt endangering of a brother or ſiſter, reaſons of a higher ſtrain then matrimoniall bear ſway; unleſſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel inſtead of freeing us, debaſe it ſelf to make us bondmen, and ſuffer evill to controule good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Male and female created he them.]</hi> This contains another end of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching man and woman, being the right, and lawfulnes of the marige bed; though much inferior to the former end of her being his image and helpo in religious ſociety. And who of weakeſt inſight may not ſee that this creating of them male and female, cannot in any order of reaſon, or Chriſtianity, be of ſuch moment againſt the better and higher purpoſes of their creation, as to enthrall husband or wife to duties or to ſufferings, unworthy and unbeſeeming the image of God in them? Now when as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123241:8"/>
not only men, but good men doe ſtand upon their right, their eſtimation, their dignity in all other actions and deportments with warrant anough and good conſcience, as having the image of God in them, it will not be difficult to determin what is unworthy and unſeemly for a man to do or ſuffer in wedlock; and the like proportionally may be found for woman: if we love not to ſtand diſputing below the principles of humanity. He that ſaid, <hi>Male and female created he them,</hi> immediatly before that ſaid alſo in the ſame verſe, <hi>In the Image of God created he him,</hi> and redoubl'd it, that our thoughts might not be ſo full of dregs as to urge this poor conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>male and female,</hi> without remembring the noblenes of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer repetition; leſt when God ſends a wiſe eye to examin our triviall gloſſes, they be found extremly to creep upon the ground: eſpecially ſince they confeſſe that what here concerns mariage is but a brief touch, only preparative to the inſtitution which follows more expreſſely in the next Chapter: and that Chriſt ſo took it, as deſiring to be briefeſt with them who came to tempt him, account ſhall be given in due place.</p>

                     <hi>[And the Lord God ſaid it is not good.]</hi> A man would think that the conſideration of who ſpake, ſhould raiſe up the attention of our minds to enquire better, and obey the purpos of ſo great a Speaker: for as we order the buſines of Mariage, that which he heer ſpeaks is all made vain; and in the deciſion of matrimony, or not matrimony, nothing at all regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Our preſumption, hath utterly chang'd the ſtate and condition of this ordinance: God ordain'd it in love and helpfulnes to be indiſſoluble, and we in outward act and formality to be a forc't bondage; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to a thouſand errors in the beſt men, if it prove a bleſſing to any, it is of meer accident, as mans law hath handl'd it, and not of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[It is not good for man to be alone.]</hi> Hitherto all things that have bin nam'd, were approv'd of God to be very good: lonelines is the firſt thing which Gods eye nam'd not good: whether it be a thing, or the want of ſomthing, I labour not; let it be their tendance, who have the art to be induſtriouſly idle. And heer <hi>alone</hi> is meant alone without woman; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Adam</hi> had the company of God himſelf, and Angels to convers with; all creatures to delight him ſeriouſly, or to make him ſport. God could have created him out of the ſame mould a thouſand friends and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adams</hi> to have bin his conſorts, yet for all this till <hi>Eve</hi> was giv'n him, God reckn'd him to be alone.</p>

                     <hi>[It is not good.]</hi> God heer preſents himſelf like to a man deliberating; both to ſhew us that the matter is of high conſequence, and that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to found it according to naturall reaſon, not impulſive command, but that the duty ſhould ariſe from the reaſon of it, not the reaſon be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up in a reaſonleſſe duty. <hi>Not good,</hi> was as much to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, as not pleaſing, not expedient; but ſince the comming of ſin into the world, to him who hath not receiv'd the continence, it is not only not expedient to be alone, but plainly ſinfull. And therefore he who wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſtains from mariage, not being ſupernaturally gifted, and he who by making the yoke of mariage unjuſt and intolerable, cauſes men to abhorr it, are both in a diabolicall ſin, equall to that of Antichriſt who forbids to marry. For what difference at all whether he abſtain men from mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or reſtrain them in a mariage hapning totally diſcommodious, diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, diſhoneſt and pernicious to him without the appearance of his fault? For God does not heer preciſely ſay, I make a female to this male, as he did briefly before, but expounding himſelfe heer on purpos, he ſaith, becauſe it is not good for man to be alone, I make him therefore a meet help. God ſupplies the privation of not good, with the perfect gift of a reall and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive good; it is mans pervers cooking who hath turn'd this bounty of God into a Scorpion, either by weak and ſhallow conſtructions, or by proud arrogance and cruelty to them who neither in their purpoſes nor in their actions have offended againſt the due honour of wedlock.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Apoſtle ſpeaking in the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. pronounces quite contrary to this word of God, <hi>It is good for a man not to touch a woman,</hi> and God cannot contradict himſelf, it inſtructs us that his commands and words, eſpecially ſuch as bear the manifeſt title of ſom good to man, are not to be ſo ſtrictly wrung, as to command without regard to the moſt naturall and miſerable neceſſities of mankind. Therefore the Apoſtle adds a limitation in the 26 v. of that chap. for the preſent neceſſity it is good; which he gives us doubtleſſe as a pattern how to reconcile other places by the generall rule of charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[For man to be alone.]</hi> Som would have the ſenſe heerof to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of procreation only: and <hi>Auſtin</hi> conteſts that manly friendſhip in all other regards had bin a more becomming ſolace for <hi>Adam,</hi> then to ſpend ſo many ſecret years in an empty world with one woman. But our Writers deſervedly reject this crabbed opinion; and defend that there is a peculiar comfort in the maried ſtate beſides the genial bed, which no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſociety affords. No mortall nature can endure either in the actions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:123241:9"/>
of Religion, or ſtudy of wiſdome, without ſomtime ſlackning the cords of intenſe thought and labour: which leſt we ſhould think faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, God himſelf conceals us not his own recreations before the world was built; <hi>I was,</hi> ſaith the eternall wiſdome, <hi>dayly his delight, playing alwayes before him.</hi> And to him indeed wiſdom is as a high towr of pleaſure, but to us a ſteep hill, and we toyling ever about the bottom: he executes with eaſe the exploits of his omnipotence, as eaſie as with us it is to will: but no worthy enterpriſe can be don by us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out continuall plodding and weariſomnes to our faint and ſenſitive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. We cannot therefore alwayes be contemplative, or pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call abroad, but have need of ſom delightfull intermiſſions, wherin the enlarg'd ſoul may leav off a while her ſevere ſchooling; and like a glad youth in wandring vacancy, may keep her hollidaies to joy and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les paſtime: which as ſhe cannot well doe without company, ſo in no company ſo well as where the different ſexe in moſt reſembling unlikenes, and moſt unlike reſemblance cannot but pleaſe beſt and be pleas'd in the aptitude of that variety. Wherof leſt we ſhould be too timorous, in the aw that our flat ſages would form us and dreſſe us, wiſeſt <hi>Salomon</hi> among his graveſt Proverbs countenances a kinde of raviſhment and erring fondnes in the entertainment of wedded lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and in the Song of Songs, which is generally beleev'd, even in the jollieſt expreſſions to figure the ſpouſals of the Church with Chriſt, ſings of a thouſand raptures between thoſe two lovely ones farre on the hither ſide of carnall enjoyment. By theſe inſtances, and more which might be brought, we may imagine how indulgently God provided againſt mans lonelines; that he approv'd it not, as by himſelf declar'd not good; that he approv'd the remedy therof, as of his own ordaining, conſequently good; and as he ordain'd it, ſo doubtles proportionably to our fal n eſtate he gives it; els were his ordinance at leaſt in vain, and we for all his gift ſtill empty handed. Nay ſuch an unbounteous giver we ſhould make him, as in the fables <hi>Jupiter</hi> was to <hi>Ixion,</hi> giving him <hi>a cloud</hi> inſtead of <hi>Juno,</hi> giving him a monſtrous iſſue by her, the breed of <hi>Centaures</hi> a neglected and unlov'd race, the fruits of a delufive mariage, and laſtly giving him her with a damnation to that wheele in hell, from a life thrown into the midſt of temptations and diſorders. But God is no deceitfull giver, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow that on us for a remedy of lonelines, which if it bring not a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able minde as well as a conjunctive body, leavs us no leſſe alone then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:123241:10"/>
before; and if it bring a minde perpetually avers and diſagreeable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies us to a wors condition then the moſt deſerted lonelines. God cannot in the juſtice of his own promiſe and inſtitution ſo unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly mock us by forcing that upon us as the remedy of ſolitude, which wraps us in a miſery worſe then any wildernes, as the Spirit of God himſelf judges, Prov. 19. eſpecially knowing that the beſt and wiſeſt men amidſt the ſincere and moſt cordiall deſignes of their heart doe dayly erre in chooſing. We may conclude therfore ſeeing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall Expoſiters confeſſe to our hands, that by lonelines is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant the want of copulation, and that man is not leſſe alone by turning in a body to him, unleſſe there be within it a minde anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that it is a work more worthy the care and conſultation of God to provide for the worthieſt part of man which is his minde, and not unnaturally to ſet it beneath the formalities and reſpects of the body, to make it a ſervant of its owne vaſſal, I ſay we may conclude that ſuch a mariage, wherin the minde is ſo diſgrac't and vilify'd below the bodies intereſt, and can have no juſt or tolerable contentment, is not of Gods inſtitution, and therfore no mariage. Nay in concluding this, I ſay we conclude no more then what the common Expoſiters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves give us, both in that which I have recited and much more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But the truth is, they give us in ſuch a manner, as they who leav their own mature poſitions like the eggs of an Oſtrich in the duſt; I do but lay them in the ſun; their own pregnancies hatch the truth; and I am taxt of novelties and ſtrange producements, while they, like that inconſiderat bird, know not that theſe are their own naturall breed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[I will make him a help meet for him.]</hi> Heer the heavnly inſtituter, as if he labour'd, not to be miſtak'n by the ſupercilious hypocriſie of thoſe that love to maiſter their brethren, and to make us ſure that he gave us not now a ſervil yoke, but an amiable knot; contents not himſelf to ſay, I will make him a wife, but reſolving to give us firſt the meaning before the name of a wife, ſaith graciouſly, <hi>I will make him a help meet for him.</hi> And heer again, as before, I doe not require more full and fair deductions then the whole conſent of our Divines uſually raiſe from this text, that in matrimony there muſt be firſt a mutuall help to piety, next to civill fellowſhip of love and amity, then to generation, ſo to houſhold affairs, laſtly the remedy of incontinence. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they reck'n them in ſuch order, as leavs generation and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:123241:10"/>
to be laſt conſider'd. This I amaze me at, that though all the ſuperior and nobler ends both of mariage and of the maried perſons he abſolutely fruſtrat, the matrimony ſtirs not, looſes no hold, remains as rooted as the center: but if the body bring but in a complaint of frigidity, by that cold application only, this adamantine <hi>Alpe</hi> of wedlock has leav to diſſolve; which els all the machinations of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or civill reaſon at the ſuit of a diſtreſſed mind, either for divine worſhip or humane converſation violated, cannot unfaſten. What courts of concupiſcence are theſe, wherin fleſhly appetite is heard before right reaſon, luſt before love or devotion? They may be pious Chriſtians together, they may be loving and friendly, they may be helpfull to each other in the family, but they cannot couple; that ſhall divorce them though either party would not. They can neither ſerv God together, nor one be at peace with the other, nor be good in the family one to other, but live as they were dead, or live as they were deadly enemies in a cage together; tis all one, they can couple, they ſhall not divorce till death, no though this ſentence be their death. What is this, beſides tyranny, but to turn nature upſide down, to make both religion, and the minde of man wait upon the ſlaviſh errands of the body, and not the body to follow either the ſanctity, or the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty of the mind unſpeakably wrong'd, and with all equity complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? What is this but to abuſe the ſacred and miſterious bed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to be the compulſive ſtie of an ingratefull and malignant luſt, ſtirr'd up only from a carnall acrimony, withour either love or peace, or regard to any other thing holy or human. This I admire how poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it ſhould inhabit thus long in the ſenſe of ſo many diſputing <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologians,</hi> unleſſe it be the loweſt lees of a canonicall infection liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown to their ſides; which perhaps will never uncling, without the ſtrong abſterſive of ſom heroick magiſtrat, whole mind equall to his high office dares lead him both to know and to do without their fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous caſe-putting. For certain he ſhall have God and this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plainly on his ſide. And if it be true both in divinity and law, that conſent alone, though copulation never follow, makes a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, how can they diſſolv it for the want of that which made it not, and not diſſolv it for that not continuing which made it, and ſhould preſerve it in love and reaſon, and difference it from a brute conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.</p>

languages word for word can render it; but all agree effectuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of diſpoſition and affection to be heerby ſignify'd; which God as it were not ſatisfy'd with the naming of a help, goes on deſcribing <hi>another ſelf, a ſecondſelf, a very ſelf it ſelf.</hi> Yet now there is nothing in the life of man through our miſconſtruction, made more uncertain, more hazardous and full of chance then this divine bleſſing with ſuch favorable ſignificance heer conferr'd upon us, which if we do but erre in our choice the moſt unblamable error that can be, erre but one minute, one moment after thoſe mighty ſyllables pronounc't which take upon them to joyn heavn and hell together unpardnably till death pardon, this divine bleſſing that lookt but now with ſuch a human ſmile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and ſpoke ſuch gentle reaſon, ſtrait vaniſhes like a fair skie and brings on ſuch a ſcene of cloud and tempeſt, as turns all to ſhipwrack without havn or ſhoar but to a ranſomles captivity. And then they tell us it is our ſin; but let them be told again, that ſin through the mercy of God hath not made ſuch waſt upon us, as to make utterly void to our uſe any temporall benefit, much leſſe any ſo much a vailing to a peacefull and ſanctify'd life, meerly for a moſt incident error which no warines can certainly ſhun. And wherfore ſervs our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py redemption, and the liberty we have in Chriſt, but to deliver us from calamirous yokes not to beliv'd under without the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſouls, and to reſtore us in ſom competent meaſure to a right in every good thing both of this life, and the other.

                  <p>That there was a neerer alliance between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> then could be ever after between man and wife, is viſible to any. For no other woman was ever moulded out of her husbands rib, but of meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for the moſt part they com to have that conſanguinity which they have by wedlock. And if we look neerly upon the matter, though mariage be moſt agreeable to holines, to purity and juſtice, yet is it not a naturall, but a civill and ordain'd relation. For if it were in nature, no law or crime could diſanull it, to make a wife, or husband, otherwiſe then ſtill a wife or husband, but only death; as nothing but that can make a father no father, or a ſon no ſon. But divorce for adultery or deſertion, as all our Churches agree but England, not only ſeparats, but nullifies, and extinguiſhes the relation it ſelf of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo that they are no more man and wife; otherwiſe the innocent party could not marry elſe-where, without the guilt of adultery; next were it meerly naturall why was it heer ordain'd more then the reſt of morall law to man in his originall rectitude, in whoſe breſt all that was naturall or morall was engrav'n without externall conſtitutions and edicts. <hi>Adam</hi> therfore in theſe words does not eſtabliſh an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble bond of mariage in the carnall ligaments of fleſh and bones, for if he did, it would belong only to himſelf in the literall ſenſe; every one of us being neerer in fleſh of fleſh, and bone of bones to our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents then to a wife; they therfore were not to be left for her in that reſpect. But <hi>Adam</hi> who had the wiſdom giv'n him to know all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to name them according to their properties, no doubt but had the gift to diſcern perfectly, that which concern'd him much more; and to apprehend at firſt ſight the true fitnes of that conſort which God provided him. And therfore ſpake in reference to thoſe words which God pronounc't before; as if he had ſaid, this is ſhe by whoſe meet help and ſociety I ſhall no more be alone; this is ſhe who was made my image, ev'n as I the Image of God; not ſo much in body, as in unity of mind and heart. And he might as eaſily know what were the words of God, as he knew ſo readily what had bin don with his rib, while he ſlept ſo ſoundly. He might well know, if God took a rib out of his inſide, to form of it a double good to him, he would far
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:123241:12"/>
ſooner diſ-joyn it from his outſide, to prevent a treble miſchief to him: and far ſooner cut it quite off from all relation for his undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eaſe, then nail it into his body again, to ſtick for ever there a thorn in his heart. When as nature teaches us to divide any limb from the body to the ſaving of his fellows, though it be the maiming and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the whole; how much more is it her doctrin to ſever by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, not a true limb ſo much, though that be lawfull, but an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, a ſore, the gangrene of a limb, to the recovery of a whole man. But if in theſe words we ſhall make <hi>Adam</hi> to erect a new eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mariage in the meer fleſh, which God ſo lately had inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and founded in the ſweet and mild familiarity of love and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and mutuall fitnes, what do we but uſe the mouth of our generall parent, the firſt time it opens, to an arrogant oppoſition, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Gods wiſer ordinance. Theſe words therfore cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any thing new in mariage, but either that which belongs to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> only, or to us in reference only to the inſtituting words of God which made a meet help againſt lonelines. <hi>Adam</hi> ſpake like <hi>Adam</hi> the words of fleſh and bones, the ſhell and rinde of matrimony: but God ſpake like God, of love and ſolace and meet help, the ſoul both of <hi>Adams</hi> words and of matrimony.</p>

This joyning particle <hi>Therefore</hi> is in all equity, nay in all neceſſity of conſtruction to comprehend firſt and moſt principally what God ſpake concerning the inward eſſence of Mariage in his inſtitution: that we may learn how far to attend what <hi>Adam</hi> ſpake of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward materials therof in his approbation. For if we ſhall bind theſe words of <hi>Adam</hi> only to a corporall meaning, and that the force of this injunction upon all us his ſons to live individually with any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which hath befaln us in the moſt miſtak'n wedlock, ſhall conſiſt not in thoſe morall and relative cauſes of <hi>Eves</hi> creation, but in the meer anatomy of a rib, and that <hi>Adams</hi> inſight concerning wedlock reacht no furder, we ſhall make him as very an idiot as the Socinians make him; which would not be reverently don of us. Let us be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to allow our great forefather ſo much wiſdom, as to take the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting words of God along with him into this ſentence, which if they be well minded, wil aſſure us that fleſh and ribs are but of a weak and dead efficacy to keep Mariage united where there is no other fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The rib of Mariage, to all ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> is a relation much rather then a bone; the nerves and ſinews therof are love and meet help, they knit not every couple that maries, and where they knit they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom break, but where they break, which for the moſt part is where they never truly joyn'd, to ſuch at the ſame inſtant both fleſh and rib ceaſe to be in common; ſo that heer they argue nothing to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a falſe or violated Mariage, but muſt be led back to receive their meaning from thoſe inſtitutive words of God which give them all the life and vigor they have.</p>

                     <hi>[Therefore ſhall a man leav his father, &amp;c.]</hi> What to a mans thinking more plain by this appointment, that the fatherly power ſhould give place to conjugall prerogative? yet it is generally held by reformed writers againſt the Papiſt, that though in perſons at diſcretion the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in it ſelfbe never ſo fit, though it be fully accompliſht with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, board and bed, yet the father not conſenting, his main will without diſpute ſhall diſſolv all. And this they affirm only from col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective reaſon, not any direct law: for that in Exod. 22. 17. which is moſt particular, ſpeaks that a father may refuſe to marry his daughter to one who hath deflour'd her, not that he may take her away from one who hath ſoberly married her. Yet becauſe the generall honor due to parents is great, they hold he may, and perhaps hold not amiſſe. But again when the queſtion is of barſh and rugged parents who deferr
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123241:13"/>
to beſtow their childern ſeaſonably, they agree joyntly that the Church or Magiſtrat may beſtow them, though without the Fathers conſent: and for this they have no expreſs autority in Scripture. So that they may ſee by thir own handling of this very place, that it is not the ſtubborn letter muſt govern us, but the divine and ſoftning breath of charity which turns and windes the dictat of every poſitive command, and ſhapes it to the good of mankind. Shall the outward acceſſory of a Fathers will wanting, rend the fitteſt and moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onat mariage in twain, after all nuptial conſummations, and ſhall not the want of love and the privation of all civil and religious concord, which is the inward eſſence of wedlock, doe as much to part thoſe who were never truly wedded? ſhall a Father have this power to vindicate his own wilfull honour and autority to the utter breach of a moſt dearly-united mariage, and ſhall not a man in his own power have the permiſſion to free his Soul, his life, and all his comfort of life from the diſaſtre of a no-mariage. Shall fatherhood, which is but man, for his own pleaſure diſſolve matrimony, and ſhall not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, which is Gods Ordinance, for its own honour and better conſervation, diſſolv it ſelf, when it is wrong, and not fitted to any of the cheif ends which it owes us?</p>

Not a rule yet that we have met with, ſo univerſall in this whole inſtitution, but hath admitted limitations and conditions according to human neceſſity. The very foundation of Matrimony, though God laid it ſo deliberatly, <hi>that it is not good for man to bee alone</hi> holds not always, if the Apoſtle can ſecure us. Soon after wee are bid leav Father and Mother, and cleav to a Wife, but muſt underſtand the Fathers conſent withall, els not. <hi>Cleav to a Wife,</hi> but let her bee a wife, let her be a meet help, a ſolace, not a nothing, not an adverſary, not a defertrice; can any law or command be ſo unreaſonable as to make men cleav to calamity, to ruin, to perdition? In like manner heer, <hi>They ſhall be one fleſh:</hi> but let the cauſes hold, and be made really good, which only have the poſſibility to make them one fleſh. Wee know that fleſh can neither joyn, nor keep together two bodies of it ſelf; what is it then muſt make them one fleſh, but likenes, but fitnes of mind and diſpoſition, which may breed the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of concord, and union between them? If that be not in the nature
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123241:13"/>
of either, and that there has bin a remediles miſtake, as vain wee goe about to compell them into one fleſh, as if wee undertook to weav a garment of drie ſand. It were more eaſy to compell the vegetable and nutritive power of nature to aſſimilations and mixtures which are not alterable each by other; or force the concoctive ſtomach to turn that into fleſh which is ſo totally unlike that ſubſtance, as not to be wrought on. For as the unity of minde is neerer and greater then the union of bodies, ſo doubtles, is the diſſimilitude greater, and more dividuall, as that which makes between bodies all difference and diſtinction. Eſpecially when as beſides the ſingular and ſubſtantial differences of every Soul, there is an intimat quality of good or evil, through the whol progeny of <hi>Adam,</hi> which like a radical heat, or mortal chilnes joyns them, or disjoyns them irreſiſtibly. In whom therefore either the will, or the faculty is found to have never joyn'd, or now not to continue ſo, 'tis not to ſay, they ſhall be one fleſh, for they cannot be one fleſh. God commands not impoſſibilities; and all the Eccleſiaſtical glue, that Liturgy, or Laymen can compound, is not able to ſoder up two ſuch incongruous natures into the one fleſh of a true beſeeming Mariage. Why did <hi>Moſes</hi> then ſet down thir u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting into one fleſh? And I again ask, why the Goſpel ſo oft repeats the eating of our Saviours fleſh, the drinking of his blood? <hi>That wee are one body with him, the members of his body, fleſh of his fleſh and bone of his bone.</hi> Epheſ. 5. Yet leſt wee ſhould be Capernaitans, as wee are told there that the fleſh profiteth nothing, ſo wee are told heer, if we be not as deaf as adders, that this union of the fleſh proceeds from the union of a fit help and ſolace. Wee know that there was never a more ſpiritual myſtery then this Goſpel taught us under the terms of body and fleſh; yet nothing leſs intended then that wee ſhould ſtick there. What a ſtupidnes then is it, that in Mariage, which is the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reſemblance of our union with Chriſt, wee ſhould deject our ſelvs to ſuch a ſluggiſh and underfoot Philoſophy, as to eſteem the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mariage meerly by the fleſh; though never ſo brokn and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted from love and peace, which only can give a human qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to that act of the fleſh, and diſtinguiſh it from beſtial. The Text therefore uſes this phraſe, that <hi>they ſhall bee one fleſh,</hi> to juſtify and make legitimat the rites of Mariage bed; which was not unneed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if for all this warrant, they were ſuſpected of pollution by ſome ſects of Philoſophy, and Religions of old, and latelier among the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123241:14"/>
Papiſts, and other heretics elder then they. Som think there is a high myſtery in thoſe words, from that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of them, Epheſ. 5. <hi>This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak of Chriſt and the Church:</hi> and thence they would conclude mariage to be inſeparable. For me I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not now whether matrimony bee a myſtery or no; if it bee of Chriſt and his Church, certainly it is not meant of every ungodly and miſwedded mariage, but then only myſterious, when it is a holy, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and peacefull match. But when a Saint is joyn'd with a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, or both alike, wicked with wicked, fool with fool, a hee drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard with a ſhe, when the bed hath bin nothing els for twenty yeares or more, but an old haunt of luſt and malice mixt together, no love, no goodnes, no loyalty, but counterplotting, and ſecret wiſhing one anothers diſſolution, this is to me the greateſt myſtery in the world, if ſuch a mariage as this, can be the myſtery of ought, unleſs it bee the myſtery of iniquity: According to that which <hi>Paraeus</hi> cites out of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> that a bad wife is a help for the devill, and the like may be ſaid of a bad husband. Since therfore none but a fit and pious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony can ſignify the union of Chriſt and his Church, ther cannot hence be any hindrance of divorce to that wedlock wherin ther can be no good myſtery. Rather it might to a Chriſtian Conſcience bee matter of finding it ſelf ſo much leſs ſatisfy'd then before, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of an unhappy yoke, wherein there can be no repreſentation either of Chriſt, or of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Thus having enquir'd the inſtitution how it was in the beginning, both from the 1 Chap. of <hi>Gen,</hi> where it was only mention'd in part, and from the ſecond, where it was plainly and evidently inſtituted, and having attended each clauſe and word neceſſary, with a diligence not drouſy, wee ſhall now fix with ſom advantage; and by a ſhort view backward gather up the ground wee have gon; and ſumm up the ſtrength wee have, into one argumentative head, with that <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic</hi> force that <hi>logic</hi> proffers us. All arts acknowledge that then only we know certainly, when we can define; for definition is that which refines the pure eſſence of things from the circumſtance. If therfore we can attain in this our Controverſy to define exactly what mariage is, wee ſhall ſoon lern, when there is a nullity thereof, and when a divorce.</p>
                  <p>The part therfore of this Chapter which hath bin heer treated, doth orderly and readily reſolv it ſelf into a definition of mariage, and a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:123241:14"/>
conſectary from thence. To the definition theſe words cheifly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute. <hi>It is not good, &amp;c. I will make, &amp;c.</hi> Where the conſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry begins this connexion <hi>Therfore</hi> informs us, <hi>Therfore ſhall a man,</hi> &amp;c. Definition is decreed by Logicians to conſiſt only of cauſes conſtituting the eſſence of a thing, What is not therfore among the cauſes conſtituting mariage, muſt not ſtay in the definition. Thoſe cauſes are concluded to be <hi>matter,</hi> and, as the Artiſt calls it, <hi>Form.</hi> But inaſmuch as the ſame thing may be a cauſe more waies then one, and that in relations and inſtitutions which have no corporal ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but only a reſpective beeing, the <hi>Form</hi> by which the thing is what it is, is oft ſo ſlender and undiſtinguiſhable, that it would ſoon confuſe, were it not ſuſtain'd by the efficient and final cauſes, which concurre to make up the form invalid otherwiſe of it ſelf, it will bee needfull to take in all the fowr cauſes into the definition. Firſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the material cauſe of matrimony is man and woman; the Author and efficient, God and their conſent, the internal <hi>Form</hi> and ſoul of this relation, is conjugal love ariſing from a mutual fitnes to the final cauſes of wedlock, help and ſociety in Religious, Civil and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic converſation, which includes as an inferior end the fulfilling of natural deſire, and ſpecifical increaſe; theſe are the final cauſes both moving the <hi>efficient,</hi> and perfeting the <hi>form.</hi> And although copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be conſider'd among the ends of mariage, yet the act therof in a right eſteem can no longer be matrimonial, then it is an effect of conjugal love. When love findes it ſelf utterly unmatcht, and juſtly vaniſhes, nay rather cannot but vaniſh, the fleſhly act indeed may continue, but not holy, not pure, not beſeeming the ſacred bond of mariage; beeing at beſt but an animal excretion, but more truly wors and more ignoble then that mute kindlyneſs among the heards and flocks: in that proceeding as it ought from intellective principles, it participates of nothing rational, but that which the feild and the fould equalls. For in human actions the ſoule is the agent, the body in a manner paſſive. If then the body doe out of ſenſitive force, what the ſoul complies not with, how can man, and not rather ſomthing beneath man be thought the doer.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed in the perſute of an accurat definition, it will a vail us ſomthing, and whet our thoughts, to examin what fabric heerof others have already reard. <hi>Paraeus</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> defines Mariage to be <hi>an indiſſoluble conjunction of one man and one woman to an individual and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123241:15"/>
converſation, and mutual benevolence, &amp;c.</hi> Wherin is to be markt his placing of intimat converſation before bodily benevolence; for bodily is meant, though indeed <hi>benevolence</hi> rather ſounds will then body. Why then ſhall divorce be granted for want of bodily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and not for want of fitnes to intimat converſation, when as corporal benevolence cannot in any human faſhion bee without this? Thus his definition places the ends of Mariage in one order, and eſteems them in another. His <hi>Tautology</hi> alſo of indiſſoluble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual is not to be imitated; eſpecially ſince neither indiſſoluble, nor individual hath ought to doe in the exact definition, beeing but a conſectary flowing from thence, as appears by plain Scripture, <hi>Therfore ſhall a man leav, &amp;c.</hi> For Mariage is not true mariage by bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing individual, but therfore individual, if it be true Mariage. No ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument but cauſes enter the definition; a Conſectary is but the effect of thoſe cauſes. Beſides, that Mariage is indiſſoluble, is not <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi> true; wee know it diſſoluble for Adultery, and for deſertion by the verdit of all Reformed Churches. Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> defines it <hi>an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual conjunction of one man and one woman, to communion of body and mutual ſociety of life;</hi> But this perverts the order of God, who in the inſtitution places meet help and ſociety of life before communion of body. And vulgar eſtimation undervalues beyond compariſon all ſociety of life and communion of minde beneath the communion of body; granting no divorce, but to the want, or miſcommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that. <hi>Hemingius,</hi> an approved Author, <hi>Melanchtons</hi> Scholler, and who next to <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> writes of divorce moſt like a Divine, thus compriſes, <hi>Mariage is a conjunction of one man and one woman lawfully conſenting, into one fleſh, for mutual helps ſake, ordain'd of God.</hi> And in his explanation ſtands punctually upon the conditions of conſent, that it be not in any main matter deluded, as beeing the life of wedloc, and no true marriage without a true conſent. <hi>Into one fleſh</hi> he expounds into one minde, as well as one body, and makes it the formal cauſe: Heerin only miſſing, while he puts the effect into his definition inſtead of the cauſe which the Text affords him. For <hi>one fleſh</hi> is not the formal eſſence of wedloc, but one end, or one effect of <hi>a meet help;</hi> The end oft times beeing the effect and fruit of the form, as Logic teaches: Els many aged and holy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies, and more eminently that of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> would bee no true mariage. And that <hi>maxim</hi> generally receiv'd, would be fals,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:123241:15"/>
that <hi>conſent alone, though copulation never follow, makes the mariage.</hi> Therefore to conſent lawfully into one fleſh, is not the formal cauſe of Matrimony, but only one of the effects. The Civil Lawyers, and firſt <hi>Juſtinian</hi> or <hi>Tribonian</hi> defines Matrimony a <hi>conjunction of man and woman containing individual accuſtom of life.</hi> Wherin firſt, individual is not ſo bad as indiſſoluble put in by others: And although much ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil might be made in the diſtinguiſhing between indiviſible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, yet the one tak'n for poſſible, the other for actuall, neither the one nor the other can belong to the eſſence of mariage; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when a Civilian defines, by which Law mariage is actually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc't for many cauſes, and with good leav, by mutual conſent. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where <hi>conjunction</hi> is ſaid, they who comment the <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> agree that conjunction of minde is by the Law meant, not neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of body. That Law then had good reaſon attending to its own definition, that divorce ſhould be granted for the breaking of that conjunction which it holds neceſſary, ſooner then for the want of that conjunction which it holds not neceſſary. And wheras <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningus</hi> a famous Lawyer excuſes individual as the purpos of Mariage, not always the ſucceſs, it ſuffices not. Purpos is not able to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the eſſence of a thing. Nature her ſelf the univerſal Mother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends nothing but her own perfection and preſervation; yet is not the more indiſſoluble for that. The <hi>Pandects</hi> out of <hi>Modeſtinus,</hi> though not define, yet well deſcribe Mariage, <hi>the conjunction of male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, the ſociety of all life, the communion of divine and human right:</hi> which <hi>Bucer</hi> alſo imitates on the fifth to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> But it ſeems rather to comprehend the ſeveral ends of Mariage, then to contain the more conſtituting cauſe that makes it what it is.</p>
                  <p>That I therefore among others (for who ſings not <hi>Hylas)</hi> may give as well as take matter to be judg'd on, it will be lookt I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce another definition then theſe which have not ſtood the tryal. Thus then I ſuppoſe that Mariage by the natural and plain order of Gods inſtitution in the Text may be more demonſtratively and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially defin'd. <hi>Mariage is a divine inſtitution joyning man and woman in a love fitly diſpos'd to the helps and comforts of domeſtic life. A divine inſtitution.</hi> This contains the prime efficient cauſe of Mariage; as for conſent of Parents and Guardians, it ſeems rather a concurrence then a cauſe; for as many, that marry are in thir own power as not; and where they are not thir own, yet are they not ſubjected beyond
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:123241:16"/>
reaſon. Now though efficient cauſes are not requiſite in a definition, yet divine inſtitution hath ſuch influence upon the <hi>Form,</hi> and is ſo a conſerving cauſe of it, that without it the <hi>Form</hi> is not ſufficient to diſtinguiſh matrimony from other conjunctions of male and female, which are not to be counted mariage. <hi>Joyning man and woman in a love, &amp;c.</hi> This brings in the parties conſent; until which be, the mariage hath no true beeing. When I ſay <hi>conſent,</hi> I mean not error, for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is not properly conſent: And why ſhould not conſent be heer underſtood with equity and good to either part, as in all other freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covnants, and not be ſtrain'd and cruelly urg'd to the miſcheif and deſtruction of both? Neither doe I mean that ſingular act of conſent which made the contract, for that may remain, and yet the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage not true nor lawful; and that may ceaſe, and yet the mariage both true and lawful, to their ſin that break it. So that either as no efficient at all, or but a tranſitory, it comes not into the definition. That conſent I mean which is a love fitly diſpos'd to mutual help and comfort of life; this is that happy <hi>Form</hi> of mariage naturally ariſing from the very heart of divine inſtitution in the Text, in all the former definitions either obſcurely, and under miſtak'n terms expreſt, or not at all. This gives mariage all her due, all her benefits, all her beeing, all her diſtinct and proper beeing. This makes a mariage not a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, a bleſſing not a curſe, a gift of God not a ſnare. Unleſs ther be a love, and that love born of fitnes, how can it laſt? unleſs it laſt how can the beſt and ſweeteſt purpoſes of mariage be attain'd, and they not attain'd, which are the cheif ends, and with a lawful love conſtitute the formal cauſe it ſelf of mariage, how can the eſſence thereof ſubſiſt, how can it bee indeed what it goes for? Conclude therfore by all the power of reaſon, that where this eſſence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is not, there can bee no true mariage; and the parties either one of them, or both are free, and without fault rather by a nullity, then by a divorce may betake them to a ſecond choys; if thir preſent condition be not tolerable to them. If any ſhall ask, why <hi>domeſtic</hi> in the definition? I anſwer, that becauſe both in the Scriptures, and in the graveſt Poets and Philoſophers I finde the properties and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of a wife ſet out only from domeſtic vertues; if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend furder, it diffuſes them into the notion of ſom more common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then matrimonial.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre of the definition; the <hi>Conſectary</hi> which flows from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:123241:16"/>
thence, and altogether depends theron, is manifeſtly brought in by this connexive particle <hi>Therfore;</hi> and branches it ſelf into a double conſequence; Firſt individual Society, <hi>therfore ſhall a man leav father and mother:</hi> Secondly conjugal benevolence, <hi>and they ſhall bee one fleſh.</hi> Which as was ſhewn, is not without cauſe heer mention'd, to prevent and to aboliſh the ſuſpect of pollution in that natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled act. Theſe conſequences therfore cannot either in Religion, Law, or Reaſon bee bound, and poſted upon mankind to his ſorrow and miſery, but receiv what force they have from the meetnes of help and ſolace, which is the <hi>formal</hi> cauſe and end of that definition that ſuſtains them. And although it be not for the Majeſty of Scripture to humble her ſelf in artificial <hi>theorems,</hi> and definitions, and <hi>Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> like a profeſſor in the Schools, but looks to be <hi>analys'd,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the logical induſtry of her Diſciples and followers, and to bee reduc't by them, as oft as need is, into thoſe <hi>Sciential</hi> rules, which are the implements of inſtruction, yet <hi>Moſes,</hi> as if foreſeeing the miſerable work that mans ignorance and puſillanimity would make in this matrimonious buſines, and endevouring his utmoſt to prevent it, condeſcends in this place to ſuch a methodical and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like way of defining, and conſequencing, as in no place of the whole Law more.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee have ſeen, and if wee be not contentious, may know what was Mariage in the beginning, to which in the Goſpel wee are referr'd; and what from hence to judge of nullity, or divorce, Heer I eſteem the work don; in this field the controverſie decided; but becauſe other places of Scripture ſeem to look averſly upon this our deciſion, although indeed they keep all harmony with it, and becauſe it is a better work to reconcile the ſeeming diverſities of Scripture, then the reall diſſentions of neereſt friends, I ſhall aſſay in three following Diſcourſes to perform that Office.</p>

                  <p>THat which is the only diſcommodity of ſpeaking in a cleer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the abundance of argument that preſſes to bee utter'd, and the ſuſpence of judgement what to chooſe, and how in the multitude of reaſon, to be not tedious, is the greateſt difficulty which I expect heer to meet with. Yet much hath bin ſaid formerly concerning this Law <hi>in the Doctrins of divorce;</hi> Wherof I ſhall repeat no more then what is neceſſary. Two things are heer doubted: Firſt, and that but of late, whether this bee a Law or no, next what this reaſon of <hi>uncleannes</hi> might mean for which the Law is granted; That it is a plain Law no man ever queſtion'd, till <hi>Vatablus</hi> within theſe hunder'd years profeſs'd Hebrew at <hi>Paris,</hi> a man of no Religion, as <hi>Beza</hi> deciphers him. Yet ſom there be who follow him, not only againſt the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all antiquity, both Jewiſh and Chriſtian, but the evidence of Scripture alſo, Malach. 2. 16. <hi>Let him who hateth put away ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> Although this place alſo hath bin tamper'd with, as if it were to be thus render'd, <hi>The Lord God ſaith, that hee hateth putting away.</hi> But this new interpretation reſts only in the autority of <hi>Junius;</hi> for neither <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor <hi>Vatablus</hi> himſelf, nor any other known Divine ſo interpreted before. And they of beſt note who have tranſlated the Scripture ſince, and <hi>Diodati</hi> for one, follow not his reading. And perhaps they might reject it, if for nothing els, for theſe two reaſons: Firſt, it introduces in a new manner the perſon of God ſpeaking leſs Majeſtic then he is ever wont; When God ſpeaks by his Profet, he ever ſpeaks in the firſt perſon; thereby ſignifying his Majeſty and omni-preſence. Hee would have ſaid, I hate putting away, ſaith the Lord; and not ſent word by <hi>Malachi</hi> in a ſudden faln ſtile, The <hi>Lord God ſaith that hee hateth putting away:</hi> that were a phraſe to ſhrink the glorious omnipreſence of God ſpeaking, into a kind of circumſcriptive abſence. And were as if a Herald in the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivment</hi> of a King, ſhould commit the <hi>indecorum</hi> to ſet his helmet ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and cloſe, not full fac't and open in the poſture of direction and command. Wee cannot think therfore that this laſt Profet would thus in a new faſhion abſent the perſon of God from his own words as if he came not along with them. For it would alſo be wide from the proper ſcope of this place: hee that reads attentively will ſoon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:123241:17"/>
perceav, that God blames not heer the Jews for putting away thir wives, but for keeping ſtrange Concubines, to the <hi>profaning of Juda's holines,</hi> and the vexation of thir Hebrew wives, v. 11. and 14. <hi>Judah hath maried the daughter of a ſtrange God:</hi> And exhorts them rather to put thir wives away whom they hate, as the Law permitted, then to keep them under ſuch affronts. And it is receiv'd that this Profet livd in thoſe times of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (nay by ſom is thought to bee <hi>Ezra</hi> himſelf) when the people were forc't by theſe two Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies to put thir ſtrange wives away. So that what the ſtory of thoſe times, and the plain context of the 11 verſe, from whence this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke begins, can give us to conjecture of the obſcure and curt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſms</hi> that follow, this Profet does not forbid putting away, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids keeping, and commands putting away according to Gods Law, which is the plaineſt interpreter both of what God will, and what he can beſt ſuffer. Thus much evinces that God there commanded divorce by <hi>Malachi,</hi> and this confirmes that he commands it alſo heer by <hi>Moſes.</hi>

For the ſame reaſons that induce them why it ſhould not bee a law, will ſtrair'n them as hard why it ſhould bee allow'd a cuſtom.

it be, as they make this of divorce to be, a cuſtom againſt nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt juſtice, againſt chaſtity, how, upon this moſt impure cuſtom tolerated, could the God of purenes erect a nice and preciſe Law, that the wife marryed after divorce could not return to her former husband, as beeing defil'd? What was all this following nicenes worth, built upon the leud foundation of a wicked thing allow'd? In few words then, this cuſtom of divorce either was allowable, or not allowable; if not allowable, how could it be allow'd? if it were allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all who underſtand Law will conſent, that a tolerated cuſtom hath the force of a Law, and is indeed no other but an unwritt'n Law, as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> calls it, and is as prevalent as any writt'n ſtatute. So that thir ſhift of turning this Law into a cuſtom wheels about, and gives the onſet upon thir own flanks; not diſproving, but concluding it to be the more firm law, becauſe it was without controverſy a granted cuſtom; as cleer in the reaſon of common life, as thoſe giv'n rules wheron <hi>Euclides</hi> builds his propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Thus beeing every way a Law of God, who can without blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my doubt it to be a juſt and pure Law. <hi>Moſes</hi> continually diſavows the giving them any ſtatute, or judgement, but what hee learnt of God; of whom alſo in his Song hee ſaith, Deut. 32. <hi>Hee is the rock, his work is perfet, all his waies are judgement, a God of truth and without iniquity, juſt and right is hee.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> teſtifies, the judgements of the Lord <hi>are true and righteous altogether.</hi> Not partly right and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrong, much leſs wrong altogether, as Divines of now adaies dare cenſure them. <hi>Moſes</hi> again of that people to whom hee gave this Law ſaith, Deut. 14. <hi>Yee are the childern of the Lord your God, the Lord hath choſen thee to bee a peculiar people to himſelf above all the nations upon the earth, that thou ſhouldſt keep all his Commandements; and be high in praiſe, in name, and in honour, holy to the Lord, Chap.</hi> 26. And in the fourth, <hi>Behold I have taught you ſtatutes and judgements eevn as the Lord my God commanded mee, keep therfore and doe them. For this is your wiſdom and your underſtanding in the ſight of Nations that ſhall hear all theſe Statutes and ſay, ſurely this great Nation is a wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding people. For what Nation is ther ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh to them? and what Nation that hath Statutes and Judgements ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as all this Law which I ſet before you this day?</hi> Thus whether wee look at the purity and juſtice of God himſelf, the jealouſy of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour among other Nations, the holines and moral perfection which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:123241:18"/>
hee intended by his Law to teach this people, wee cannot poſſibly think how he could indure to let them ſlugg &amp; grow inveteratly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under baſe allowances, &amp; whole adulterous lives by diſpenſation. They might not eat, they might not touch an unclean thing; to what hypocriſy then were they train'd up, if by preſcription of the ſame Law, they might be unjuſt, they might be adulterous for term of life? forbid to ſoile thir garments with a coy imaginary pollution, but not forbid, but countnanc't and animated by Law to ſoile thir ſoules with deepeſt defilements. What more unlike to God, what more like that God ſhould hate, then that his Law ſhould bee ſo curious to waſh veſtures; and ſo careles to leav unwaſht, unregarded, ſo foul a ſcab of <hi>Egypt</hi> in thir Soules? what would wee more? the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Lord are all pure and juſt: and if all, then this of Divorce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe hee hath found ſom uncleannes in her.</hi> That wee may not eſteem this law to bee a meer authorizing of licence, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes took it, <hi>Moſes</hi> adds the reaſon, for <hi>ſom uncleannes found.</hi> Som heertofore have bin ſo ignorant, as to have thought, that this <hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> means adultery. But <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who for having writ an excellent Treatiſe of Divorce, was wrote againſt by ſom burly ſtandard Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, perhaps of <hi>Cullen,</hi> or of <hi>Lovain,</hi> who calls himſelf <hi>Phimoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> ſhews learnedly out of the Fathers with other Teſtimonies and Reaſons, that <hi>uncleannes</hi> is not heer ſo underſtood; defends his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer work, though new to that age, and perhaps counted licentious, and fears not to ingage all his fame on the Argument. Afterward, when Expoſiters began to underſtand the Hebrew Text, which they had not done of many ages before, they tranſlated word for word not <hi>uncleannes,</hi> but <hi>the nakednes of any thing;</hi> and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that nakednes is uſually referr'd in Scripture to the minde as well as to the body, they conſtantly expound it any defect, annoyance, or ill quality in nature, which to bee joyn'd with, makes life tedious, and ſuch company wors then ſolitude. So that heer will be no cauſe to vary from the generall conſent of expoſition, which gives us free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God permitted divorce, for whatever was unalterably diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether in body or mind. But with this admoniſhment, that if the <hi>Roman</hi> law eſpecially in contracts and dowries left many things to equity with theſe cautions, <hi>exfide bonâ, quod aequius melius erit, ut inter bonos bene agier,</hi> wee will not grudge to think that God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not licence heer to every humor, but to ſuch remediles greevan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:123241:19"/>
as might move a good, and honeſt, and faithfull man then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, when it can no more bee peace or comfort to either of them continuing thus joyn'd. And although it could not be avoided, bat that men of hard hearts would abuſe this liberty, yet doubtles it was intended as all other privileges in Law are, to good men principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bad only by accident. So that the ſin was not in the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor ſimply in the action of divorce (for then the permitting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had bin ſin) but only in the abuſe. But that this Law ſhould, as it were, bee wrung from God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> only to ſerve the hard hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes, and the luſt of injurious men, how remote it is from all ſenſe, and law, and honeſty, and therfore ſurely from the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, ſhall abundantly be manifeſt in due order.</p>
                  <p>Now although <hi>Moſes</hi> needed not to adde other reaſon of this law then that one there expreſt, yet to theſe ages wherin Canons, and <hi>Scotiſms,</hi> and <hi>Lumbard</hi> Laws, have dull'd, and almoſt obliterated the lively Sculpture of ancient reaſon, and humanity, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit to heap reaſon upon reaſon, and all little enough to vindicat the whitenes and the innocence of this divine Law, from the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it findes at this day, of beeing a dore to licence and confuſion. When as indeed there is not a judicial point in all <hi>Moſes,</hi> conſiſting of more true equity, high wiſdom, and God-like pitty then this Law; not derogating, but preſerving the honour and peace of Mariage, and exactly agreeing with the ſenſe and mind of that inſtitution in <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt, if Mariage be but an ordain'd relation, as it ſeems not more, it cannot take place above the prime dictats of nature; and if it bee of natural right, yet it muſt yeeld to that which is more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and before it by elderſhip and precedence in nature. Now it is not natural that <hi>Hugh</hi> marries <hi>Beatrice,</hi> or <hi>Thomas Rebecca,</hi> beeing only a civill contract, and full of many chances, but that theſe men ſeek them meet helps, that only is natural; and that they eſpouſe them ſuch, that only is mariage. But if they find them neither fit helps, nor tolerable ſociety, what thing more natural, more original and firſt in nature then to depart from that which is irkſom, greevous, actively hateful, and injurious eevn to hoſtility, eſpecially in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal reſpect, wherin antipathies are invincible, and wher the forc't abiding of the one, can bee no true good, no real comfort to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if hee find no contentment from the other, how can he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:123241:19"/>
it from himſelf, or no acceptance, how can hee mutually accept? what more equal, more pious then to untie a civil knot for a natural enmity held by violence from parting, to diſſolv an accidental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of this or that man &amp; woman, for the moſt natural and moſt neceſſary diſagreement of meet from unmeet, guilty from guiltles, contrary from contrary? It beeing certain that the myſtical and bleſſed unity of mariage can bee no way more unhallow'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan'd, then by the forcible uniting of ſuch diſunions and ſeparations. Which if wee ſee oft times they cannot joyn or peece up to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friendſhip, or to a willing converſation in the ſame houſe, how ſhould they poſſibly agree to the moſt familiar and united amity of wedlock? <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> though dear friends and brethren in a ſtrange Country, choſe rather to part aſunder, then to infect thir friendſhip with the ſtrife of thir ſervants: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> joyn'd together by the Holy Ghoſt to a Spiritual work, thought it better to ſeparate when once they grew at variance. If theſe great Saints joynd by nature, friendſhip, religion, high providence, and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could not ſo govern a caſual difference, a ſudden paſſion, but muſt in wiſdom divide from the outward duties of a friendſhip, or a Collegueſhip in the ſame family, or in the ſame journey, leſt it ſhould grow to a wors diviſion, can any thing bee more abſurd and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then that they whom only error, caſualty, art or plot hath joynd, ſhould be compell'd, not againſt a ſudden paſſion but againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and radical diſcords of nature, to the moſt intimat and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating duties of love and imbracement, therin only rational and human, as they are free and voluntary; beeing els an abject and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile yoke, ſcars not brutiſh. And that there is in man ſuch a peculiar ſway of liking, or diſliking in the affairs of matrimony is evidently ſeen before mariage among thoſe who can bee freindly, can reſpect each other yet to marry each other would not for any perſwaſion. If then this unfitnes and diſparity bee not till after mariage diſcover'd, through many cauſes, and colours, and concealements, that may overſhadow; undoubtedly it will produce the ſame effects and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with more vehemence, that ſuch a miſtakn pair, would give the world to be unmarried again. And thir condition <hi>Solomon</hi> to the plain juſtification of divorce expreſſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 21. 23. Where hee rells us of his own accord, that a <hi>hated,</hi> or a <hi>hatefull</hi> woman, <hi>when ſhee is married, is a thing for which the earth is diſquieted and cannot
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:123241:20"/>
bear it;</hi> thus giving divine teſtimony to this divine Law, which bids us nothing more then is the firſt and moſt innocent leſſon of nature, to turn away peaceably from what afflicts and hazards our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; eſpecially when our ſtaying can doe no good, and is expos'd to all evil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is unjuſt that any Ordinance ordain'd to the good and comfort of man, where that end is miſſing, without his fault, ſhould be forc't upon him to an unſufferable miſery and diſcomfort, if not commonly ruin. All Ordinances are eſtabliſht in thir end; the end of Law is the vertu, is the righteouſnes of Law. And therfore him wee count an ill Expounder who urges Law againſt the intention therof. The general end of every Ordinance, of every ſevereſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very divineſt, eevn of Sabbath is the good of man, yea his temporal good not excluded. But marriage is one of the benigneſt ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God to man, wherof both the general and particular end is the peace and contentment of mans mind, as the inſtitution declares. Contentment of body they grant, which if it bee defrauded, the plea of frigidity ſhall divorce: But heer lies the fadomles abſurdity, that granting this for bodily defect, they will not grant it for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the mind, any violation of religious or civil ſociety. When as, if the argument of Chriſt bee firm againſt the ruler of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, Luk. 13. <hi>Thou hypocrite, doth not each of you on the Sabbath day loos'n his Oxe or his Aſſe from the ſtall, and lead him to watering, and ſhould not I unbind a daughter of Abraham from this bond of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</hi> it ſtands as good heer, yee have regard in mariage to the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of body, ſhould you not regard more the greevances of the mind, ſeeing the Soul as much excells the body, as the outward man excells the Aſs and more; for that <hi>animal</hi> is yet a living creature, perfet in it ſelf; but the body without the Soul is a meer ſenſeles trunck. No Ordinance therfore givn particularly to the good both ſpiritual and temporal of man, can bee urg'd upon him to his miſchief, and if they yeeld this to the unworthier part, the body, wherabout are they in thir principles, that they yeeld it not to the more worthy, the mind of a good man?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As no Ordinance, ſo no Covnant, no not between God and man, much leſs between man and man, beeing as all are, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the good of both parties, can hold to the deluding or making miſerable of them both. For equity is underſtood in every Covnant,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:123241:20"/>
eevn between enemies, though the terms bee not expreſt. If equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therfore made it, extremity may diſſolv it. But Mariage, they uſe to ſay, is the Covnant of God. Undoubted: and ſo is any covnant frequently call'd in Scripture, wherin God is call'd to witnes: the covnant of freindſhip between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> is call'd <hi>the Cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 20. The covnant of <hi>Zedechiah</hi> with the King of <hi>Babel,</hi> a Covnant to bee doubted whether lawfull or no, yet in reſpect of God invok't thereto, is call'd <hi>the Oath, and the Covnant of God,</hi> Ezech. 17. Mariage alſo is call'd the <hi>Covnant of God,</hi> Prov. 2. 17. Why, but as before, becauſe God is the witnes therof, Malach. 2. 14. So that this denomination adds nothing to the Covnant of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, above any other civil and ſolemn contract: nor is it more indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble for this reaſon then any other againſt the end of its own ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor is any vow or Oath to God exacted with ſuch a rigor, where ſuperſtition reignes not. For look how much divine the Covnant is, ſo much the more equal; So much the more to bee expected that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry article therof ſhould bee fairly made good, no fals dealing, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performing ſhould be thruſt upon men without redreſs, if the covnant bee ſo divine. But faith they ſay muſt bee kept in Covnant, though to our dammage. I anſwer, that only holds true, where the other ſide performs, which failing, hee is no longer bound. Again, this is true, when the keeping of faith can bee of any uſe, or benefit to the other. But in Mariage a league of love and willingnes, if faith bee not willingly kept, it ſcars is worth the keeping; nor can bee any delight to a generous minde, with whom it is forcibly kept: and the queſtion ſtill ſuppoſes the one brought to an impoſſibility of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as hee ought, by the others default, and to keep it formally, not only with a thouſand ſhifts and diſſimulations, but with open anguiſh, perpetual ſadnes and diſturbance, no willingnes, no cheerfulnes, no contentment, cannot bee any good to a minde not baſely poor and ſhallow, with whom the contract of love is ſo kept. A Covnant ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought to that paſſe, is on the unfaulty ſide without injury diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Law is not to neglect men under greateſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, but to ſee Covnants of greateſt moment faithfulleſt perform'd. And what injury comparable to that ſuſtain'd in a fruſtrat and fals dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Mariage, to looſe, for anothers fault againſt him, the beſt portion of his temporal comforts, and of his ſpiritual too, as it may fall out.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:123241:21"/>
It was the Law, that for mans good and quiet, reduc't things to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, which were at firſt in common; how much more Law-like were it to aſſiſt nature in diſappropriating that evil which by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper becomes deſtructive. But hee might have bewar'd. So hee might in any other covnant, wherin the Law does not conſtrain error to ſo dear a forfeit. And yet in theſe matters wherin the wiſeſt are apt to erre, all the warines that can bee, oft times nothing avails. But the Law can compell the offending party to bee more duteous. Yes, if all theſe kind of offences were fit in public to bee complain'd on, or beeing compell'd were any ſatisfaction to a mate not ſottiſh, or malicious. And theſe injuries work ſo vehemently, that if the Law remedy them not, by ſeparating the cauſe when no way els will paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, the perſon not releev'd betakes him either to ſuch diſorderly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or to ſuch a dull dejection, as renders him either infamous, or uſeles to the ſervice of God and his Country. Which the Law ought to prevent as a thing pernicious to the Common wealth; and what better prevention then this which <hi>Moſes</hi> us'd?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Law is to tender the liberty and the human dignity of them that live under the Law, whether it bee the mans right above the woman, or the womans juſt appeal againſt wrong, and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. But the duties of mariage contain in them a duty of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which to doe by compulſion againſt the Soul, where ther can bee neither peace, nor joy, nor love, but an enthrallment to one who either cannot, or will not bee mutual in the godlieſt and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileſt ends of that ſociety, is the ignobleſt, and the loweſt ſlavery that a human ſhape can bee put to. This Law therfore juſtly and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly provides againſt ſuch an unmanly task of bondage as this. The civil Law, though it favour'd the ſetting free of a ſlave, yet if hee prov'd ungratefull to his Patron, reduc't him to a ſervil condition. If that Law did well to reduce from liberty to bondage for an ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude not the greateſt, much more became it the Law of God to enact the reſtorement of a free born man from an unpurpos'd, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy bondage to a rightfull liberty for the moſt unnatural fraud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude that can be committed againſt him. And if that Civilian Emperour in his tide of <hi>Donations,</hi> permit the giver to recall his guift from him who proves unthankful towards him, yea, though hee had ſubſcrib'd and ſign'd in the deed of his guift, not to recall it though for this very cauſe of ingratitude, with much more equity doth <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:123241:21"/>
permit heer the giver to recall no petty guift, but the guift of himſelf from one who moſt injuriouſly &amp; deceitfully uſes him againſt the main ends and conditions of his giving himſelf, expreſt in Gods inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Although ther bee nothing in the plain words of this Law, that ſeems to regard the afflictions of a wife, how great ſo ever, yet Expoſiters determin, and doubtles determin rightly, that God was not uncompaſſionat of them alſo in the framing of this Law. For ſhould the reſcript of <hi>Antoninus</hi> in the Civil Law give releaſe to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants flying for refuge to the Emperours ſtatue, by giving leav to change thir cruel Maiſters, and ſhould God who in his Law alſo is good to injur'd ſervants, by granting them thir freedom in divers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not conſider the wrongs and miſeries of a wife which is no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Though heerin the counter ſenſe of our Divines, to me, I muſt confeſſe ſeems admirable; who teach that God gave this as a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Law, not for man whom he heer names, and to whom by name hee gives this power, but for the wife whom hee names not, and to whom by name hee gives no power at all. For certainly if man beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to injuries in mariage, as well as woman, and man be the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier perſon, it were a prepoſterous law to reſpect only the leſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; her whom God made for mariage, and not him at all for whom mariage was made.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Law of mariage gives place to the power of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: for wee hold that conſent of Parents not had may break the wedlock, though els accompliſht. It gives place to maiſterly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for the Maiſter might take away from an Hebrew ſervant the wife which hee gave him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. If it be anſwer'd that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of ſervants is no matrimony: tis reply'd, that this in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Roman</hi> Law is true, not in the <hi>Moſaic.</hi> If it bee added, ſhe was a ſtranger not an Hebrew, therfore eaſily divorc't, it will be anſwerd that ſtrangers not beeing <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and they alſo beeing Converts might bee lawfully maryed, as <hi>Rahab</hi> was. And her converſion is heer ſuppos'd; for an Hebrew maiſter could not lawfully give a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then wife to an Hebrew ſervant. However, the divorcing of an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh woman was as eaſy by the Law, as the divorcing of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and almoſt in the ſame words permitted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. Laſtly, it gives place to the right of warr, for a captiv woman law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maryed, and afterward not belov'd, might bee diſmiſt, only without ranſom. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. If mariage may bee diſſolv'd by ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:123241:22"/>
many exterior powers, not ſuperior, as wee think, why may not the power of mariage it ſelf for its own peace and honour diſſolv it ſelf, wher the perſons wedded be free perſons, why may not a greater and more natural power complaining diſſolv mariage? for the ends why matrimony was ordain'd, are certainly and by all Logic above the Ordinance it ſelf, why may not that diſſolv mariage without which that inſtitution hath no force at all? for the prime ends of mariage, are the whole ſtrength and validity therof, without which matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is like an Idol, nothing in the world. But thoſe former allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances were all for hardnes of heart. Be that granted, untill we come where to underſtand it better: if the Law ſuffer thus farr the obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a bad man, is it not more righteous heer, to doe willingly what is but equal, to remove in ſeaſon the extremities of a good man?</p>
                  <p>Eightly, If a man had deflowr'd a Virgin, or brought an ill name on his wife that ſhee came not a Virgin to him, hee was amerc't in certain ſhekles of Silver, and bound never to divorce her all his daies, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. which ſhews that the Law gave no liberty to divorce, wher the injury was palpable; and that the abſolute forbidding to divorce, was in part the puniſhment of a deflowrer, and a defamer. Yet not ſo but that the wife queſtionles might depart when ſhee pleas'd. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe this cours had not ſo much righted her, as deliverd her up to more ſpight and cruel uſage. This Law therfore doth juſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the privilege of an honeſt and blameles man in the matter of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from the puniſhment of a notorious offender.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Suppoſe it might bee imputed to a man, that hee was too raſh in his choyſe and why took hee not better heed, let him now ſmart, and bear his folly as he may; although the Law of God, that terrible law doe not thus upbraid the infirmities and unwilling miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of man in his integrity: But ſuppoſe theſe and the like proud aggravations of ſom ſtern hypocrite, more merciles in his mercies, then any literall Law in the vigor of ſeverity, muſt be patiently heard; yet all Law, and Gods Law eſpecially grants every where to error eaſy remitments, eevn where the utmoſt penalty exacted were no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. With great reaſon therfore and mercy doth it heer not torment an error, if it be ſo, with the endurance of a whole life loſt to all houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold comfort and ſociety, a puniſhment of too vaſt and huge dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for an error, and the more unreaſonable for that the like objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be oppos'd againſt the plea of divorcing for adultery; hee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:123241:22"/>
might have lookt better before to her breeding under religious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: why did hee not then more diligently inquire into her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, into what company ſhe kept? every glaunce of her eye, every ſtep of her gate would have propheci'd adultery, if the quick ſent of theſe diſcerners had bin took along; they had the divination to have foretold you all this; as they have now the divinity to puniſh an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror inhumanly. As good reaſon to be content, and forc't to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with your adultreſs, if theſe objecters might be the judges of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frailtie. But God more mild and good to man, then man to his brother, in all this liberty givn to divorcement, mentions not a word of our paſt errors and miſtakes, if any were, which theſe men object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their own inventions proſecute with all violence and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. For if the one bee to look ſo narrowly what hee takes, at the peril of ever keeping, why ſhould not the other bee made as wary what is promis'd, by the peril of looſing? for without thoſe promiſes the treaty of mariage had not proceeded. Why ſhould his own error bind him, rather then the others fraud acquit him? Let the buyer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, ſaith the old Law-beaten termer. Belike then ther is no more honeſty, nor ingenuity in the bargain of a wedloc, then in the buying of a colt: Wee muſt it ſeems drive it on as craftily with thoſe whoſe affinity wee ſeek, as if they were a pack of ſale men and complot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But the deceiver deceivs himſelf in the unproſperous mariage, and therin is ſufficiently puniſht. I anſwer, that the moſt of thoſe who deceiv, are ſuch as either underſtand not, or value not the true purpoſes of mariage; they have the prey they ſeek, not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet ſay it prove to them ſom croſs, it is not equal that error and fraud ſhould bee linkt in the ſame degree of forfeture, but rather that error ſhould be acquitted, and fraud bereav'd his morſel: if the miſtake were not on both ſides, for then on both ſides the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be reaſonable, if the bondage be intolerable; which this Law graciouſly determins, not unmindful of the wife, as was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted willingly to the common Expoſiters, though beyond the letter of this law, yet not beyond the ſpirit of charity.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Mariage is a ſolemn thing, ſom ſay a holy, the reſemblance of Chriſt and his Church; and ſo indeed it is where the perſons are truly religious; and wee know all Sacred things not perform'd ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely as they ought, are no way acceptable to God in thir outward formality. And that wherin it differs from perſonal duties, if they be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:123241:23"/>
not truly don, the fault is in our ſelves; but mariage to be a true and pious mariage is not in the ſingle power of any perſon; the eſſence whereof, as of all other Covnants is in relation to another, the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maintaining cauſes thereof are all mutual, and muſt be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſpiritual and temporal comforts. If then either of them cannot, or obſtinatly will not be anſwerable in theſe duties, ſo as that the other can have no peaceful living, or enduring the want of what he juſtly ſeeks, and ſees no hope, then ſtrait from that dwelling love, which is the ſoul of wedloc, takes his flight, leaving only ſom cold performances of civil and common reſpects, but the true bond of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if there were ever any there, is already burſt like a rott'n thred. Then follows diſſimulation, ſuſpicion, fals colours, fals pretences, and wors then theſe, diſturbance, annoyance, vexation, ſorrow, temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eevn in the faultles perſon, weary of himſelf, and of all action public or domeſtic; then comes diſorder, neglect, hatred, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrife, all theſe the enemies of holines and chriſtianity, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of theſe perſiſted in, a remediles violation to matrimony. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God who hates all faining and formality, wher there ſhould bee all faith and ſincerenes, and abhorrs to ſee inevitable diſcord, wher there ſhould be greateſt concord, when through anothers default, faith and concord cannot bee, counts it neither juſt to puniſh the innocent with the tranſgreſſor, nor holy, nor honourable for the ſanctity of mariage, that ſhould bee the unlon of peace and love, to be made the commitment, and cloſe fight of enmity and hate. And therfore doth in this Law, what beſt agrees with his goodnes, looſning a ſacred thing to peace and charity, rather then binding it to hatred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; looſning only the outward and formal tie of that which is already inwardly, and really brokn, or els was really never joyn'd.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, One of the cheif matrimonial ends is ſaid to ſeek a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed; but where an unfit mariage adminiſters continual cauſe of hatred and diſtemper, there, as was heard before, cannot chooſe but much unholines abide. Nothing more unhallows a man, more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepares him to the ſervice of God in any duty, then a habit of wrath and perturbation, ariſing from the importunity of troublous cauſes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abſent. And wher the houſhold ſtands in this plight, what love can ther bee to the unfortunat iſſue, what care of thir breeding, which is of main conducement to thir beeing holy. God therfore knowing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:123241:23"/>
how unhappy it would bee for children to bee-born in ſuch a family, gives this Law either as a prevention, that beeing an unhappy pair, they ſhould not adde to bee unhappy parents, or els as a remedy that if ther be childern, while they are feweſt, they may follow either parent, as ſhall bee agreed, or judg'd, from the houſe of hatred and diſcord, to a place of more holy and peaceable education.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, All Law is available to ſom good end, but the final pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of divorce a vails to no good end, cauſing only the endles ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of evil, and therfore this permiſſion of divorce was givn to the Jews by the wiſdom and fatherly providence of God; who knew that Law cannot command love, without which, matrimony hath no true beeing, no good, no ſolace, nothing of Gods inſtituting, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſo ſordid and ſo low, as to bee diſdain'd of any generous perſon. Law cannot inable natural inability either of body, or mind, which gives the greevance; it cannot make equal thoſe inequalities, it cannot make fit thoſe unfitneſſes: and where there is malice more then defect of nature, it cannot hinder ten thouſand injuries, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter actions of deſpight too ſuttle and too unapparent for Law to deal with. And while it ſeeks to remedy more outward wrongs, it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the injur'd perſon to other more inward and more cutting. All theſe evils unavoidably will redound upon the children, if any be, and the whole family. It degenerates and diſorders the beſt ſpirits, leavs them to unſettl'd imaginations, and degraded hopes, careles of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, their houſhold and their freinds, unactive to all public ſervice, dead to the Common-wealth; wherin they are by one miſhapp, and no willing treſpas of theirs, outlaw'd from all the benefits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of married life and poſterity. It conferrs as little to the honour and inviolable keeping of Matrimony, but ſooner ſtirrs up temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and occaſions to ſecret adulteries, and unchaſt roaving. But it maintaines public honeſty. Public folly rather, who ſhall judge of public honeſty? the Law of God, and of ancienteſt Chriſtians, and all Civil Nations, or the illegitimat Law of Monks and Canoniſts, the moſt malevolent, moſt unexperienc't, and incompetent judges of Matrimony?</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons, and many more that might bee alleg'd, afford us plainly to perceav, both what good cauſe this Law had to doe for good men in miſchances, and what neceſſity it had to ſuffer acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the hard heartednes of bad men, which it could not certainly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:123241:24"/>
diſcover, or diſcovering could not ſubdue, no nor indeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain without multiplying ſorrow to them, for whom all was indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd. The guiltles therfore were not depriv'd thir needful redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the hard hearts of others unchaſtiſable in thoſe judicial Courts, were ſo remitted there, as bound over to the higher Seſſion of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this, ther is a loud exception againſt this Law of God, nor can the holy Author ſave his Law from this exception, that it opens a dore to all licence and confuſion. But this is the rudeſt, I was almoſt ſaying the moſt graceles objection, and with the leaſt reverence to God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> that could bee devis'd: This is to cite God before mans Tribunal, to arrogate a wiſdom and holines above him. Did not God then foreſee what event of licence or confuſion could follow? did not hee know how to ponder theſe abuſes with more prevailing reſpects, in the moſt eevn ballance of his juſtice and purenes, till theſe correctors cameup to ſhew him better? The Law is, if it ſtirre up ſin any way, to ſtirre it up by forbidding, as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary excites another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. but if it once come to provoke ſin, by granting licence to ſin, according to Laws that have no other honeſt end, but only to permit the fulfilling of obſtinat luſt, how is God not made the contradicter of himſelf? No man denies that beſt things may bee abus'd: but it is a rule reſulting from many pregnant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, that what doth moſt harm in the abuſing, us'd rightly doth moſt good. And ſuch a good to take a way from honeſt men, for bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abus'd by ſuch as abuſe all things, is the greateſt abuſe of all. That the whole Law is no furder uſefull, then as a man uſes it lawfully, St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. And that Chriſtian liberty may bee us'd for an occaſion to the fleſh, the ſame Apoſtle confeſſes, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. yet thinks not of removing it for that, but bidds us rather <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty wherwith Chriſt hath freed us, and not bee held again in the yoke of bondage.</hi> The very permiſſion which Chriſt gave to divorce for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, may bee fouly abus'd, by any whoſe hardnes of heart can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fain adultery, or dares committ, that hee may divorce. And for this cauſe the Pope, and hitherto the Church of <hi>England,</hi> forbid all divorce from the bond of mariage, though for openeſt adultery. If then it bee righteous to hinder for the fear of abuſe, that which Gods Law notwithſtanding that caution, hath warranted to bee don, doth not our righteouſnes come ſhort of Antichriſt, or doe we not rather
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:123241:24"/>
heerin conform our ſelvs to his unrighteouſnes in this undue and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fear. For God regards more to releev by this Law the juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of good men, then to curb the licence of wicked men, to the cruſhing withall, and the overwhelming of his afflicted ſervants. He loves more that his Law ſhould look with pitty upon the difficulties of his own, then with rigor upon the boundleſſe riots of them who ſerv another Maiſter, and hinder'd heer by ſtrictnes, will break ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to wors enormities. If this Law therfore have many good reaſons for which God gave it, and no intention of giving ſcope to leudnes, but as abuſe by accident comes in with every good Law, and every good thing, it cannot be wiſdom in us, while we can content us with Gods wiſdom, nor can be purity, if his purity will ſuffice us, to except againſt this Law, as if it foſter'd licence. But if they affirm this Law had no other end, but to permitt obdurat luſt, becauſe it would bee obdurat, making the Law of God intentionally to proclame and enact ſin lawful, as if the will of God were becom ſinfull, or ſin ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then his direct and Law-giving will, the men would bee admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht to look well to it, that while they are ſo eager to ſhut the dore againſt licence, they doe not open a wors dore to blaſphemy. And yet they ſhall bee heer furder ſhewn thir iniquity; what more foul and common ſin among us then drnnkennes, and who can bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that if the importation of Wine, and the uſe of all ſtrong drink were forbid, it would both clean ridde the poſſibility of committing that odious vice, and men might afterwards live happily and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, without the uſe of thoſe intoxicating licors. Yet who is ther the ſevereſt of them all, that ever propounded to loos his Sack, his Ale, toward the certain aboliſhing of ſo great a ſin, who is ther of them, the holieſt, that leſs loves his rich Canary at meals, though it bee fetcht from places that hazard the Religion of them who fetch it, and though it make his neighbour drunk out of the ſame Tunne? While they forbid not therfore the uſe of that liquid Marchandiſe, which forbidd'n would utterly remove a moſt loathſom ſin, and not impair either the health, or the refreſhment of mankind, ſuppli'd many other wayes, why doe they forbid a Law of God, the forbidding wherof brings into an exceſſive bondage, oft times the beſt of men, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the wors? Hee to remove a Nationall vice, will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his cupps, nor think it concerns him to forbear the quaffing of that outlandiſh Grape, in his unneceſſary fullnes, though other men
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:123241:25"/>
abuſe it never ſo much, nor is hee ſo abſtemious as to intercede with the Magiſtrate that all matter of drunkennes be baniſht the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and yet for the fear of a leſs inconvenience unpardnably requires of his brethren, in thir extreme neceſſity to debarre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the uſe of Gods permiſſive Law, though it might bee thir ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and no mans indangering the more. Thus this peremptory ſtrictnes we may diſcern of what ſort it is, how unequal, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
                  <p>But it will breed confuſion. What confuſion it would breed, God himſelf took the care to prevent in the fourth verſe of this Chapter, that the divorc't beeing maried to another, might not return to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Husband. And <hi>Juſtinians</hi> law counſels the ſame in his Title of <hi>Nuptials.</hi> And what confuſion els can ther bee in ſeparation, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat, upon extrem urgency, the Religious from the irreligious, the fit from the unfit, the willing from the wilfull, the abus'd from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſer, ſuch a ſeparation is quite contrary to confuſion. But to binde and mixe together holy with Atheiſt, hevnly with helliſh, fitnes with unfitnes, light with darknes, antipathy with antipathy, the injur'd with the injurer, and force them into the moſt inward neernes of a deteſted union, this doubtles is the moſt horrid, the moſt unnatural mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the greateſt confuſion that can be confus'd?</p>
                  <p>Thus by this plain and Chriſtian <hi>Talmud</hi> vindicating the Law of God from irreverent and unwary expoſitions, I truſt, wher it ſhall meet with intelligible perufers, ſom ſtay at leaſt of mens thoughts will bee obtain'd, to conſider theſe many prudent and righteous ends of this divorcing permiſſion. That it may have, for the great Authors ſake, heerafter ſom competent allowance to bee counted a little purer then the prerogative of a legal and public ribaldry, granted to that holy ſeed. So that from hence wee ſhall hope to finde the way ſtill more open to the reconciling of thoſe places which treat this matter in the Goſpel. And thether now without interruption the cours of method brings us.</p>

                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:123241:26"/>
31, how can this in the vulgar and ſuperficiall ſenſe be a law of Chriſt, ſo farre from beeing writt'n in our hearts, that it injures and diſſallowes not onely the free dictates of nature and morall law, but of charity alſo and religion in our hearts. Our Saviours doctrine is, that the end, and the fulfilling of every command is charity; no faith without it, no truth without it, no worſhip, no workes pleaſing to God but as they partake of charity. He himſelfe ſets us an example, breaking the ſolemneſt and the ſtricteſt ordinance of religious reſt, and juſtify'd the breaking, not to cure a dying man, but ſuch whoſe cure might without danger have beene deſerr'd. And wherefore needes muſt the ſick mans bed be carried home on that day by his appointment, and why were the Diſciples who could not forbeare on that day to pluck the corne, ſo induſtriouſly deſended, but to ſhew us that if he preferr'd the ſlighteſt occaſions of mans good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the obſerving of higheſt and ſevereſt ordinances, hee gave us much more eaſie leave to breake the intolerable yoake of a never well joyn'd wedlocke for the removing of our heavieſt afflictions. Therefore it is that the moſt of evangelick precepts are given us in proverbiall formes, to drive us from the letter, though we love ever to be ſticking there. For no other cauſe did Chriſt aſſure us that whatſoever things wee binde, or ſlacken on earth are ſo in heaven, but to ſignifie that the chriſtian arbitrement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſupreme decider of all controverſie, and ſupreme reſolver of all Scripture; not as the Pope determines for his owne tyrany, but as the Church ought to determine for its owne true liberty. Hence <hi>Euſebius</hi> not far from beginning his Hiſtory, compares the ſtate of Chriſtians to that of <hi>Noah</hi> and the Patriarkes before the Law. And this indeede was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> tradition in the antient Church was counted nigh equall to the writt'n word, though it carried them at length awry, for want of conſidering that tradition was not left to bee impos'd as law, but to be a patterne of that Chriſtian prudence, and liberty which holy men by right aſſum'd of old, which truth was ſo evident, that it found en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance even into the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> when the point of tradition came to be diſcusſt. And <hi>Marinaro</hi> a learned <hi>Carmelite</hi> for approaching too neere the true cauſe that gave eſteeme to tradition, that is to ſay, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the Old and New Teſtament, the one punctually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing writt'n Law, the other guiding by the inward ſpirit, was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> as one that had ſpoken more worthy a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Collequie,</hi> then a generall councell. I omit many inſtances, many proofes and arguments of this kind, which alone would compile a juſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:123241:26"/>
and ſhall content me heer to have ſhew'n breifly, that the great and almoſt only commandment of the Goſpel, is to command nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the good of man, and much more no civil command, againſt his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil good. If we underſtand not this, we are but crackt cimbals, we do but tinckle, we know nothing, we doe nothing, all the ſweat of our toilſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obedience will but mock us. And what wee ſuffer ſuperſtitiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes us no thankes. Thus med'cining our eyes wee neede not doubt to ſee more into the meaning of theſe our Saviours words, then many who have gone before us.</p>

                     <hi>[It hath beene ſaid, whoſoever ſhall put away his wife.]</hi> Our Saviour was by the doctors of his time ſuſpected of intending to diſſolve the law. In this chapter he wipes off this aſperſion upon his accuſers, and ſhewes how they were the law brea kers. In every common wealth when it decayes, corruption makes two maine ſteps; firſt when men ceaſe to doe according to the inward and uncompell'd actions of vertue, caring only to live by the outward conſtraint of law, and turne the Simplicity of reall good, into the craft of ſeeming ſo by law. To this hypocritical honeſty was <hi>Rome</hi> declin'd in that age, wherein <hi>Horace</hi> liv'd and diſcover'd it to <hi>Quintius.</hi>

This brings in falſe and crooked interpretations to ecke out law, and invents the ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle encroachment of obſcure traditions hard to be diſprov'd. To both theſe deſcents the Phariſes themſelves were fall'n. Our Saviour therefore ſhews them both where they broke the law in not marking the divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, but onely the letter, and where they deprav'd the letter alſo with ſophiſticall expoſitions. This law of divorſe they had deprav'd both waies. Firſt, by teaching that to give a bill of divorſe was all the duty which that law requir'd, what ever the cauſe were. Next by running to divorſe for any triviall, accidentall cauſe; whenas the law evidently ſtayes in the grave cauſes of naturall and immutable diſlike. <hi>[It hath been ſaid</hi> ſaith he Chriſt doth not put any contempt or diſeſteeme upon the law

Our Saviour at no time expreſt any great deſire to teach the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and unteachable Phariſes; but when they came to tempt him, then leaſt of all. As now about the liberty of divorce, ſo another time about the puniſhment of adultery they came to ſound him, and what ſatisfaction got they from his anſwer, either to themſelves or to us, that might direct a law under the Goſpel, new from that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> unleſſe we draw his abſolution of adultery into an edict. So about the tribute, who is there can picke out a full ſolution, what and when we muſt give to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by the anſwer which he gave the Phariſes? If we muſt give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and all be <hi>Caeſars,</hi> which hath his image, wee muſt either new ſtamp our Coine, or we may goe new ſtamp our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads with the ſuperſcription of ſlaves in ſtead of freemen. Beſides it is a generall precept, not only of Chriſt, but of all other Sages, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the unworthy and the conceited who love tradition more then truth, but to perplex and ſtumble them purpoſely with contriv'd obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. No wonder then if they who would determine of divorce by this place, have ever found it difficult, and unfatisfying through all the ages of the Church, as <hi>Auſtine</hi> himſelfe and other great writers confeſſe. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is manifeſt to be the principal ſcope of our Saviour both here, and in the 5. of <hi>Mat.</hi> to convince the Phariſes of what they being evill did licentiouſly, not to explaine what others being good and blameleſſe men might be permitted to doe in caſe of extremity. Neither was it ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to talke of honeſt and conſcientious liberty among them who had abuſed legall and civil liberty to uncivil licence. We doe not ſay to a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant what we ſay to a ſonne; nor was it expedient to preach freedome to thoſe who had tranſgreſt in wantonneſſe. When we rebuke a Prodigal, we admoniſh him of thrift, not of magnificence, or bounty. And to ſchool a proud man we labour to make him humble, not magnanimous. So Chriſt to retort theſe arrogant inquiſitors their own, tooke the courſe to lay their hautineſſe under a ſeverity which they deſerv'd; not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them, or to make them judges either of the juſt mans right and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege or of the afflicted mans neceſſity. And if wee may have leave to conjecture, there is a likelyhood offer'd us by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his 4. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> whereby it may ſeeme very probable that the Phariſes had a private drifr of malice againſt our Saviours life in propoſing this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:123241:27"/>
and our Saviour had a peculiar aim in the rigor of his anſwer, both to let them know the freedome of his ſpirit, and the ſharpeneſſe of his diſcerning. <hi>This I muſt now ſhew,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian, Whence our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd this ſentence, and which way he directed it, whereby it will more fully appeare that he intended not to diſſolve Moſes.</hi> And there upon tells us that the vehemence of this our Saviours ſpeech was cheifly darted againſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Herodias.</hi> The ſtory is out of <hi>Joſephus: Herod</hi> had beene a long time married to the daughter of <hi>Aretas</hi> King of <hi>Petra,</hi> til hapning on his jorney towards <hi>Rome</hi> to be entertain'd at his brother <hi>Philips</hi> houſe, he caſt his eye unlawfully and ungueſtlike upon <hi>Herodias</hi> there, the wife of <hi>Philip,</hi> but daughter to <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> their common brother, and durſt make words of marrying her his Neece from his brothers bed. She aſſented upon agreement he ſhould expell his former wife. All was accompliſht, and by the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> rebuk't with the loſſe of his head. Though doubtleſſe that ſtaid not the various diſcourſes of men upon the fact, which while the <hi>Herodian</hi> flatterers, and not a few perhaps among the Phariſes endevout'd to defend by wreſting the law, it might be a meanes to bring the queſtion of divorce into a hot agitation among the people, how farre <hi>Moſes</hi> gave allowance. The Phariſes therefore knowing our Saviour to be a friend of <hi>Iohn the</hi> Baptiſt, and no doubt but having heard much of his Sermon in the Mount, wherein he ſpake rigidly againſt the licence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, they put him this queſtion both in hope to find him a contradicter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and a condemner of <hi>Herod;</hi> ſo to inſnare him within compaſſe of the ſame accuſation which had ended his friend; and our Saviour ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his anſwer, as that they might perceive <hi>Herod</hi> and his Adultreſſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not nam'd; ſo lively it concern'd them both what he ſpake. No wonder then if the ſentence of our Saviour ſounded ſtricter then his cuſtome was; which his conſcious attempters doubtleſſe apprehended ſooner then his other auditors. Thus much we gaine from hence to informe us, that what Chriſt intends to ſpeake here of divorce, will be rather the forbidding of of what we may not doe herein paſſionately and abuſively, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Herodias</hi> did, then the diſcuſſing of what herein we may doe reaſonably and neceſſarily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Is it lawfull for a man to put away his wife]</hi> It might be render'd more exactly from the Greeke, <hi>to looſen or to ſet free;</hi> which though it ſeeme to have a milder fignification then the two Hebrew words commonly us'd for divorce, yet Interpreters have noted, that the Greeke alſo is read in the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> for an act which is not without conſtraint. As when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſh</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:123241:28"/>
drove from his preſence <hi>David</hi> counterfeting madneſſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. the Greeke word is the ſame with this here, to put away. And <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> quotes <hi>Hilary</hi> rendering it by an expreſſion, not ſo ſoft. Whence may be doubted, whether the Phariſes did not ſtate this queſtion in the ſtrict right of the man, not tarrying for the wives conſent. And if our Saviour anſwer directly according to what was askt in the tearm of putting away, it may be queſtionable, whether the rigor of his ſentence did not forbid only ſuch putting away as is without mutuall conſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a violent and and harſh manner, or without any reaſon, but will, as the <hi>Tetrarch</hi> did. Which might be the cauſe that thoſe Chriſtian Emperours fear'd not in their conſtitutions to diſſolve mariage by mutuall conſent; In that our Saviour ſeemes here, as the caſe is moſt likely, not to condemne all divorce but all injury and violence in divorce. But no injury can be done to them who ſeeke it, as the <hi>Ethics</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſufficiently prove. True it is, that an unjuſt thing may be done to one though willing, and ſo may juſtly be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid'n: But divorce being in it ſelfe no unjuſt or evill thing, but only as it is joyn'd with injury, or luſt, injury it cannot be at law, if conſent be, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> erre not. And luſt it may as frequently not be, while charity hath the judging of ſo many private greevances in a misfortun'd Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, which may pard'nably ſeeke a redemption. But whether it be or not, the law cannot diſcerne, or examine luſt, ſo long as it walkes from one lawfull terme to another, from divorce to marriage both in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indifferent. For if the law cannot take hold to puniſh many actions apparently covetous, ambitious, ingratefull, proud, how can it forbid and puniſh that for luſt, which is but only ſurmiſ'd ſo, and can no more be certainly prov'd in the divorcing now, then before in the marrying. Whence if divorce be no unjuſt thing, but through luſt, a cauſe not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by law, as law is wont to diſcerne in other caſes, and can be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury where conſent is, there can be nothing in the equity of law, why di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce by conſent may not be lawfull: leaving ſecrecies to conſcience, the thing which our Saviour here aimes to rectifie, not to revoke the ſtatutes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> In the meane while the wotd <hi>To put away,</hi> being in the Gteeke, to looſen or diſolve, utterly takes away that vaine papiſticall diſtinction of divorce from bed, and divorce from bond, evincing plainly that both Chriſt and the Phariſes meane here that divorce which finally diſolves the bond and frees both parties to a ſecond marriage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[For every cauſe.]</hi> This the Phariſes held, that for every cauſe they might divorce, for every accidentall cauſe, any quarrell or difference
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:123241:28"/>
that might happ'n. So both <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> men who liv'd in the ſame age, explain; and the <hi>Syriac</hi> tranſlater, whoſe antiquity is thought pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> themſelves, reads it conformably <hi>upon any occaſion or pretence.</hi> Divines alſo generally agree that thus the Phariſes meant. <hi>Cameron</hi> a late writer much applauded, commenting this place not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diligently, affirmes that the Greeke prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> tranſlated unuſually (For) hath a force in it implying the ſuddenneſſe of thoſe Phariſaic di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces; and that their queſtion was to this effect, <hi>whether for any cauſe, whatever it chanc'd to be, ſtraight as it roſe, the divorſe might be lawfull.</hi> This he freely gives what ever mou'd him, and I as freely take, nor can deny his obſervation to be acute &amp; learned. If therfore we inſiſt upon the word of <hi>putting away,</hi> that it imports a conſtraint without conſent, as might be inſiſted, and may enjoy what <hi>Cameron</hi> beſtowes on us, that for every cauſe is to be underſtood, <hi>according as any cauſe may happen,</hi> with a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſpeedineſſe of thoſe divorces and that <hi>Herodian</hi> act e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, as is already brought us, the ſentence of our Saviour wil appeare nothing ſo ſtrict a prohibition as hath beene long conceiv'd, forbidding only to divorce for caſuall &amp; temporary cauſes, that may be ſoon ended, or ſoone remedied; &amp; likewiſe forbidding to divorce raſhly, &amp; on theſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den heate, except it be for adultery. If theſe qualifications may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as partly we offer them, partly are offer'd them by ſome of their own opinion, and that where nothing is repugnant why they ſhould not bee admitted, nothing can wreſt them from us, the ſevere ſentence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will ſtraight unbend the ſeeming frowne into that gentleneſſe and compaſſion which was ſo abundant in all his actions, his office and his doctrine, from all which otherwiſe it ſtands off at no meane diſtance.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:123241:29"/>
upon ſome rationall cauſe not difficult to be apprehended, being in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which equally concernes the meaneſt and the plaineſt ſort of perſons in a houſhold life. Our next way then will be to inquire if there bee not more reaſons then one, and if there be, whether this be the beſt and chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. That we ſhall finde by turning to the firſt inſtitution, to which Chriſt referrs our owne reading; He himſelfe having to deale with treacherous affailants, uſeth brevity, and lighting on the firſt place in <hi>Geneſis</hi> that mentions any thing tending to Marriage in the firſt chapter, joynes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the 24. verſe of the 2 chapter, omitting all the prime words between, which create the inſtitution, and containe the nobleſt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ends of Matrimony, without which attain'd, that conjunction hath nothing in it above what is common to us with beaſts. So likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in this very chapter, to the young man who came not tempting him, but to learne of him, asking him which commandments hee ſhould keepe, he neither repeates the firſt table, nor all the ſecond, nor that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he repeates. If heere then being tempted, hee deſire to bee the ſhorter, and the darker in his conference, and omitt to cite that from the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which all Divines confeſſe is a commentary to what he cites out of the firſt, the <hi>making them Male and Female;</hi> what are we to doe, but to ſearch the inſtitution our ſelves; and we ſhall finde there his owne authority giving other manner of reaſons why ſuch firme union is to bee in matrimony, without which reaſons their being male and female can be no cauſe of joyning them unſeparably: for if it be, then no Adultery can ſever. Therefore the prohibition of divorce depends not upon this reaſon heere expreſt to the Phariſes, but upon the plainer &amp; more eminent cauſes omitted heere and referr'd to the inſtitution; which cauſes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in a particular and caſuall Matrimony, this ſenſitive and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious cauſe alone can no more hinder a divorce againſt thoſe higher and more human reaſons urging it, then it can alone without them to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a copulation, but leaves it arbitrary to thoſe who in their chance of marriage finde not why divorce is farbidd them, but why it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them; and finde both here and in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that the forbidding is not abſolute, but according to the reaſons there taught us, not here. And that our Saviour taught them no better, but uſes the moſt vulgar, moſt animal and corporal argument to convince them, is firſt to ſhew us, that as through their licentious divorces they made no more of mariage then as if to marry, were no more then to be male and female, ſo hee goes no higher in his confutation; deeming them unworthy to be talkt with in a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:123241:29"/>
higher ſtraine, but to bee ty'd in marriage by the meere material cauſe thereof, ſince their owne licence teſtify'd that nothing matrimonial was in their thought but to be male and female. Next it might be don to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the brute ignorance of theſe carnall Doctors, who taking on them to diſpute of marriage and divorce, were put to ſilence with ſuch a ſlender oppoſition as this, and outed from their hold with ſcarce one quarter of an argument. That we may beleeve this, his entertainment of the young man ſoon after may perſwade us. Whom, though he came to preach eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life by faith only, he diſmiſſes with a ſalvation taught him by workes only. On which place <hi>Paraeus</hi> notes. <hi>That this man was to be convinc'd by a falſe perſwaſion; and that Chriſt is wont otherwiſe to anſwer hypocrites, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe that are docible.</hi> Much rather then may we thinke that in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling theſe tempters, he forgot not ſo to frame his prudent ambiguities and concealements, as was to the troubling of thoſe peremtory diſputants moſt wholſome. When therefore we would know what right there may be, in ill accidents, to divorce, wee muſt repaire thither where God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to teach his ſervants by the prime inſtitution, and not where we ſee him intending to dazle ſophiſters: Wee muſt not reade <hi>hee made them Male and Female,</hi> &amp; not underſtand he made them more intendedly <hi>a meet helpe</hi> to remove the evill of being <hi>alone.</hi> We muſt take both theſe together, and then we may inferre compleatly as from the whole cauſe why a man ſhall cleave to his wife, and they twaine ſhall be one fleſh: but if the full and cheife cauſe why we may not divorce, be wanting heer, this place may skirmiſh with the rabbies while it will, but to the true chriſtian it prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits nothing beyond the full reaſon of it's own prohibiting, which is beſt knowne by the inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>[Wherefore they are no more twaine, but one fleſh.]</hi> This is true in the generall right of marriage, but not in the chance medley of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular match. For if they who were once undoubtedly one fleſh, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come twain by adultery, then ſure they who were never one fleſh rightly, never helps meete for each other according to the plain preſcript of God, may with leſſe adoe then a volume be concluded ſtill twaine. And ſo long as we account a Magiſtrate no Magiſtrate, if there be but a flaw in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, why ſhould we not much rather count a Matrimony no Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, if it cannot be in any reaſonable manner according to the words of Gods inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[What therefore God hath joyned, let no man put aſunder.]</hi> But heare the chriſtian prudence lies to conſider what God hath joyn'd; ſhall wee ſay
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:123241:30"/>
that God hath joyn'd error, fraud, unfitneſſe, wrath, contention, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall lonelineſſe, perpetuall diſcord; what ever luſt, or wine, or witchery, threate, or inticement, avarice or ambition hath joyn'd together, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with unfaithfull, chriſtian with antichriſtian, hate with hate, or hate with love, ſhall we ſay this is Gods joyning?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Let not man put a ſunder.]</hi> That is to ſay, what God hath joyn'd; for if it be, as how oft we ſee it may be, not of Gods joyning, and his law tells us he joynes not unmachable things but hates to joyne them, as an abominable confuſion, then the divine law of <hi>Moſes</hi> puts them aſunder, his owne divine will in the inſtitution puts them aſunder, as oft as the reaſons be not extant, for which only God ordain'd their joyning. Man only puts aſunder when his inordinate deſires, his paſſion, his violence, his injury makes the breach: not when the utter want of that which lawfully was the end of his joyning, when wrongs and extremities, and unſupportable greevances compell him to disjoyne: when ſuch as <hi>Herod</hi> &amp; the phariſes divorce beſide law, or againſt law, then only man ſeparates, and to ſuch only this prohibition belongs. In a word, if it be unlawful for man to put aſunder that which God hath joyn'd, let man take heede it be not deteſtable to joyne that by compulſion which God hath put aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</p>

Yet as I have ſhewn poſitively that this law cannot bee abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, both by the words of our Saviour pronouncing the contrary, and by that unaboliſhable equity which it convaies to us, ſo I ſhall now bring to view thoſe appearances of ſtrength which are levied from this text to maintaine the moſt groſſe and maſſy paradox that ever did violence to reaſon and religion, bred onely under the ſhadow of theſe words, to all other piety or philoſophy ſtrange and inſolent, that God by act of law
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:123241:30"/>
drew out a line of adultery almoſt two thouſand yeares long: although to detect the prodigy of this ſurmiſe, the former booke ſet forth on this argument hath already beene copious. I ſhall not repeate much though I might borrow of mine own, but ſhall endeavour to adde ſomething either yet untoucht, or not largely anough explain'd Firſt it ſhal be manifeſt that the common expoſition cannot poſſibly conſiſt with chriſtian doctrine: next a truer meaning of this our Saviours reply ſhall be left in the roome. The receiv'd expoſition is, that God though not approving did enact a law to permit adultery by divorcement ſimply unlawfull. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit they feede with fond ſuppoſals that have not the leaſt footing in Scripture. As that the Jews learnt this cuſtome of divorce in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and therefore God would not unteach it them till Chriſt came, but let it ſtick as a notorious botch of deformity in the midſt of his moſt perfect and ſevere law. And yet he ſaith, <hi>Levit.</hi> the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>after the doings of Egypt ye ſhall not do.</hi> Another while they invent a ſlander (as what thing more bold then teaching Ignorance when he ſhifts to hide his nakednes) that the Jews were naturally to their wives the cruelleſt men in the world; would poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, braine, and doe I know not what, if they might not divorce. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if it were a fault heavily puniſht, to bring an evill report upon the land which God gave, what is it to raiſe a groundles calumny againſt the people which God made choiſe of? But that this bold interpretament, how commonly ſo ever ſided with, cannot ſtand a minute with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent reverence to God or his law, or his people, nor with any other maxim of religion, or good manners, might bee prov'd through all the heads and <hi>Topics</hi> of argumentation: but I ſhall willingly bee as conciſe as poſſible. Firſt the law, not onely the moral, but the judicial given by <hi>Moſes</hi> is juſt and pure; for ſuch is God who gave it. <hi>Harken O Iſrael,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, Dent.</hi> 4. <hi>unto the statutes and the judgements which I teach you, to doe them, that ye may live, &amp;c. ye ſhall not adde unto the word which J command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it, that ye may keepe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord your God which I command you.</hi> And onward in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Behold I have taught you ſtatutes and judgements, even as the Lord my God commanded me. Keepe therefore and doe them, for this is your wiſedome and your underſtanding. For what nation hath God ſo nigh unto them, and what-nation hath ſtatutes and judgements ſo righteous as all this law which I ſet before ye this day.</hi> Is it imaginable there ſhould bee among theſe a law which God allow'd not, a law giving permiſſions laxative to unmarry a wife and marry a luſt, a law to ſuffer a kind of <hi>tribunall</hi> adultery? Many
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:123241:31"/>
other ſcriptures might be brought to aſſert the purity of this judicial law, and many I have alleg'd before; this law therefore is pure and juſt. But if it permit, if it teach, if it defend that which is both unjuſt and impure, as by the common doctrine it doth, what thinke we? The three generall doctrines of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> law, are <hi>To live in honeſty, To hurt no man, To give every one his due.</hi> Shall the <hi>Roman civil</hi> law obſerve theſe three things, as the onely end of law, and ſhall a ſtatute be found in the civil law of God, enacted ſimply and totally againſt all theſe three precepts of nature and morality?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the gifts of God are all perfet, and certainely the law is of all his other gifts one of the perfeteſt. But if it give that outwardly which it takes away really, &amp; give that ſeemingly, which, if a man take it, wraps him into ſinne and damns him, what gift of an enemy can be more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deſtroying then this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Moſes</hi> every where commends his lawes, preferrs them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all of other nations, and warrants them to be the way of life and ſafety to all that walke therein, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. But if they containe ſtatutes which God approves not, and traine men unweeting to committ inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and adultery, under the ſhelter of law, if thoſe things bee ſin, and death ſins wages, what is this law but the ſnare of death?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the ſtatutes and judgements of the Lord, which without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception are often told us to be ſuch, as doing wee may live by them, are doubtles to be counted the rule of knowledge and of conſcience. <hi>For I had not known luſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but by the law.</hi> But if the law come downe from the ſtate of her incorruptible majeſty to grant luſt his boon, palpably it darkns and confounds both knowledge and conſcience; it goes againſt the common office of all goodnes and freindlineſſe, wich is at leſt to counſel and admoniſh; it ſubverts the rules of all ſober education; and is it ſelfe a moſt negligent and debauſhing tutor.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, if the law permit a thing unlawfull, it permitts that which elſe where it hath forbid; ſo that hereby it contradicts it ſelfe, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes it ſelfe. But if the law become a tranſgreſſor, it ſtands guilty to it ſelfe, and how then ſhall it ſave another; it makes a confederacy with ſin, how then can it juſtly condemne a ſinner? and thus reducing it ſelfe to the ſtateof neither ſaving nor condemning, it will not faile to expire ſolemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the Prophets in Scripture declare ſeverely againſt the decreeing of that which is unjuſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 20. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. But it was done, they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:123241:31"/>
ſay, for heardneſſe of heart; To which objection the Apoſtles rule, <hi>not to doe evill that good may come thereby,</hi> gives an invincible repuls; and here eſpecially, where it cannot be ſhewn how any good came by doing this evil, how rather more evil did not hereon abound; for the giving way to hardneſſe of heart hard'ns the more, and adds more to the number. God to an evil and adulterous generation would not <hi>grant a ſigne;</hi> much leſſe would he for their hardneſſe of heatt pollute his law with an adulterous permiſſion. Yea but to permitt evil is not to doe evil. Yes, it is in a moſt eminent manner to doe evil: where elſe are all our grave and faithfull ſayings, that he whoſe office is to forbid and forbids not, bids, exhorts, encourages. Why hath God denounc'd his anger againſt parents, maiſters, freinds, magiſtrates neglectfull of forbidding what they ought, if law the common father, maiſter, friend, and perpetuall magiſtrate ſhall not onely not forbidd, but enact, exhibit, and uphold with countnance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection a deede every way diſhoneſt, what ever the pretence be. If it were of thoſe inward vices, which the law cannot by outward conſtraint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but leaves to conſcience and perſwaſion, it had bin guiltleſſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilent: but to write a decree of that which can be no way lawfull, and might with eaſe be hinder'd, makes law by the doome of law it ſelfe acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory in the higheſt degree.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, it makes God the direct author of ſin, For although he bee not made the authour of what he ſilently permitts in his providence, yet in his law, the image of his will, when in plaine expreſſion he conſtitutes and ordaines a fact utterly unlawfull, what wants hee to authorize it, and what wants that to be the author?</p>
                  <p>Eightly, to eſtabliſh by law a thing wholy unlawfull and diſhoneſt, is an affirmation was never heard of before in any law, reaſon, philoſophy, or religion, till it was rais'd by inconſideratgloſſiſts from the miſtake of this text. And though the Civilians have bin contented to chew this opinion, after the canon had ſubdu'd them, yet they never could bring example or authority either from divine writt, or human learning, or human practice in any nation, or well-form'd republick, but only from the cuſtomary abuſe of this text. Uſually they allege the Epiſtle of <hi>Cicero</hi> to <hi>Atticus;</hi> wherein <hi>Cato</hi> is blam'd for giving ſentence to the ſcumme of <hi>Romulus,</hi> as if he were in <hi>Plato's</hi> common wealth. <hi>Cato</hi> would have call'd ſome great one into judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for bribery, <hi>Cicero</hi> as the time ſtood, advis'd againſt it. <hi>Cato,</hi> not to endammage the public treaſury, would not grant to the Roman Knights, that the <hi>Aſian</hi> taxes might bee farm'd them at a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:123241:32"/>
leſſe rate. <hi>Cicero</hi> wiſht it granted. Nothing in all this will bee like the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing of a law to ſinne: here are no lawes made, here onely the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of law is crav'd might be ſuſpended: between which and our queſtion is a broad difference. And what if human law givers have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they could not frame their lawes to that perfection which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, we heare of no ſuch confeſſion from <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the lawes of God, but rather all praiſe and high teſtimony of perfection given them. And although mans nature cannot beare exacteſt lawes, yet ſtill within the confines of good it may and muſt; ſo long as leſſe good is far anough from altogether evil. As for what they inſtance of uſury, let them firſt prove uſury to be wholly unlawfull, as the law allowes it; which learned men as numerous on the other ſide will deny them. Or if it be altogether unlawfull, why is it tolerated more then divorce? he who ſaid divorſe not, ſaid alſo <hi>lend hoping for nothing againe,</hi> Luk. 6. 35. But then they put in, that trade could not ſtand. And ſo to ſerve the commodity of inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable trading, uſury ſhall be permitted, but divorce, the onely meanes oft times to right the innocent, &amp; outrageouſly wrong'd, ſhall be utterly forbid. This is egregious doctrine, and for which one day charity will much thanke them. <hi>Beza</hi> not finding how to ſalve this perplexity, and <hi>Cameron</hi> ſince him, would ſecure us; although the latter confeſſes that to <hi>permit a wicked thing by law, is a wickedneſſe from which God abhorrs; yet to limit ſin, and preſcribe it a certaine meaſure, is good.</hi> Firſt this evaſion will not helpe heere; for this law bounded no man; he might put away whatever found not favour in his eyes. And how could it forbid to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, whom it could not forbidd to diſlike, or command to love. If theſe be the limits of law to reſtraine ſinne, who ſo lame a ſinner but may hoppe over them more eaſily then over thoſe <hi>Romulean</hi> circumſcriptions, not as <hi>Remus</hi> did with hard ſucces, but with all indemnity. Such a limiting as this were not worth the miſcheif that accompanies it. This law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not bounding the ſuppoſed ſinne, by permitting enlarges it, gives it enfranchiſement. And never greater confuſion, then when law and ſin move their land markes, mixe their territories, and correſpond, have intercourſe and traffic together. When law contracts a kindred and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality with tranſgreſſion, becomes the godfather of ſinne and names it Lawfull; when ſin revels and goſſips within the arcenal of law, plaies, and dandles the artillery of juſtice that ſhould be bent againſt her, this is a faire limitation indeede. Beſides it is an abſurdity to ſay that law can meaſure ſin, or moderate ſin; ſin is not in a predicament to be meaſur'd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:123241:32"/>
and modify'd, but is alwaies an exceſſe. The leaſt ſinne that is, exceeds the meaſure of the largeſt law that can bee good; and is as boundleſſe as that vacuity beyond the world. If once it ſquare to the meaſure of Law, it ceaſes to be an exceſſe, and conſequently ceaſes to be a ſinne; or elſe law conforming it ſelfe to the obliquity of ſin, betraies it ſelfe to be not ſtrait, but crooked, and ſo immediatly no law. And the improper conceit of moderating ſin by law will appeare, if wee can imagin any lawgiver ſo ſenſeleſſe as to decree that ſo farre a man may ſteale, and thus farre bee drunk, that moderately he may cozen, and moderatly committ adultery. To the ſame extent it would be as pithily abſurd to publiſh that a man may moderately divorce, if to doe that be intirely naught. But to end this moot, the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is manifeſt to fixe no limit therein at all, or ſuch at leſt as impeaches the fraudulent abuſer no more then if it were not ſet; only requires the diſmiſſive writing without other caution, leaves that to the inner man, and the barre of conſcience. But it ſtopt other ſins. This is as vaine as the reſt, and dangerouſly uncertain: the contrary to be fear'd rather, that one ſin admitted courteouſly by law, open'd the gate to another. However evil muſt not be don for good. And it were a fall to be lamented, an indignity unſpeakable, if law ſhould becom tributary to ſin her ſlave, and forc't to yeild up into his hands her awfull miniſter Puniſhment, ſhould buy out her peace with ſinne for ſinne, paying as it were her ſo many <hi>Philiſtian</hi> foreskins to the proud demand of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. But ſuppoſe it any way poſſible to limit ſinne, to put a girdle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that <hi>Chaos,</hi> ſuppoſe it alſo good; yet if to permitt ſin by Law bee an abomination in the eyes of God, as <hi>Cameron</hi> acknowledges, the evil of permitting will eate out the good of limiting. For though ſin be not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, there can but evil come out of evil; but if it be permitted &amp; decreed lawfull by divine law, of force then ſin muſt proceed from the infinit Good, which is a dreadfull thought. But if the reſtraining of ſinne by this permiſſion beeing good, as this author teſtifies, be more good then the permiſſion of more ſin by the reſtraint of divorce, and that God waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both theſe like two ingots in the perfet ſcales of his juſtice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence found them ſo, and others coming without authority from God, ſhall change this counter poiſe, and judge it better to let fin multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by ſetting a judicial reſtraint upon divorce, which Chriſt never ſet, then to limit ſin by this permiſſion, as God himſelfe thought beſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt it, it will behoove them to conſult betimes whether theſe their bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances be not fals and abominable; and this their limiting that which God looſen'd, and their looſning the ſinnes that he limited, which they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:123241:33"/>
confeſſe was good to doe: and were it poſſible to doe by law, doubtleſſe it would be moſt morally good; and they ſo beleeving, as we heare they doe, and yet aboliſhing a law ſo good and moral, the limiter of ſin, what are they elſe but contrary to themſelves? for they can never bring us to that time wherein it will not be good to limit ſinne, and they can never limit it better then ſo as God preſcrib'd in his law.</p>
                  <p>Others conceav it a more defenſible retirement to ſay this permiſſion to divorce ſinfully for hardneſſe of heart was a diſpenſation. But ſurely they either know not, or attend not what a diſpenſation meanes. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is for no long time, is particular to ſom perſons rather then generall to a whole people; alwaies hath charity the end, is granted to neceſſities and infirmities, not to obſtinat luſt. This permiſſion is another creatnre, hath all thoſe evils and abſurdities following the name of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, as when it was nam'd a law; and is the very <hi>antarctic pole</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt charity, nothing more advers, enſnaring and ruining thoſe that truſt in it, or uſe it; ſo leud and criminous as never durſt enter into the head of any Politician, Jew, or Proſelyte, till they became the apt Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of this canoniſtic expoſition. Ought in it, that can allude in the leſt manner to charity, or goodnes, belongs with more full right to the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an under grace and liberty, then to the Jew under law and bondage. To Jewiſh ignorance it could not be diſpenc'd, without a horrid imputation laid upon the law, to diſpence fouly, in ſtead of teaching fairly; like that diſpenſation that firſt polluted Chriſtendom with idolatry, permitting to lay men images in ſtead of bookes and preaching. Sloth or malice in the law would they have this calld? But what ignorance can be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the Jewes, who had all the ſame precepts about mariage, that we now: for Chriſt referrs all to the inſtitution. It was as reaſonable for them to know then as for us now, and concern'd them alike: for wherein hath the goſpel alter'd the nature of matrimony: All theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or many of them have bin furder amplify'd in <hi>the doctrine of divorce.</hi> And what <hi>Rivetus</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi> hath objected, or giv'n over as paſt cure hath bin there diſcuſst. Whereby it may be plain anough to men of eyes, that the vulgar expoſition of a permittance by law to an entire fin, what ever the colour may be, is an opinion both ungodly, unpolitic, unver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and void of all honeſty &amp; civil ſenſe. It appertaines therefore to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very zealous Chriſtian both for the honour of Gods law &amp; the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviours words, that ſuch an irreligious depravement no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may be ſooth'd and flatter'd through cuſtome, but with all diligence and ſpeed ſolidly refuted, and in the room a better explanation giv'n; which is now our next endeavour.</p>

                     <hi>[Moſes ſuffer'd you to put away, &amp;c.]</hi> Not commanded you, ſaies the common obſerver, and therefore car'd not how ſoon it were aboliſht, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſuffer'd; heerin declaring his annotation to be ſlight &amp; nothing law prudent. For in this place <hi>commanded and ſuffer'd</hi> are interehangeably us'd in the ſame ſenſe both by our Saviour and the Phariſes. Our Saviour who heer ſaith, <hi>Moſes ſuffer'd you,</hi> in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Moſes wrote you this command.</hi> And the Phariſees who heer ſay, <hi>Moſes commanded,</hi> and would mainly have it a command, in that place of <hi>Marke</hi> ſay <hi>Moſes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,</hi> which had made againſt them in their owne mouthes, if the word of <hi>ſuffering</hi> had weakn'd the command. So that <hi>ſuffer'd</hi> and <hi>commanded</hi> is heer taken for the ſame thing on both ſides of the controverſy: as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron</hi> alſo and others on this place acknowledge. And Lawyers know that all the precepts of law are devided into obligatorie and permiſſive, containing either what we muſt doe, or what wee may doe; and of this latter ſort are as many precepts, as of the former, and all as lawfull. Tutelage, an ordainment then which nothing more juſt, being for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Orfanes, the <hi>Juſtitutes</hi> of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> ſay <hi>is given and permitted by the civil law:</hi> and <hi>to parents it is permitted to chooſe and appoint by will the guardians of their children.</hi> What more equall, and yet the civil law calls this <hi>permiſſion.</hi> So likewiſe to <hi>manumiſe,</hi> to adopt, to make a will, and to be made an heire is call'd <hi>permiſſion</hi> by law. Marriage it ſelfe, and this which is already granted, to divorce for adultery, obliges no man, is but a permiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion by law, is but ſuffer'd. By this we may ſee how weakly it hath bin thought that all divorce is utterly unlawfull, becauſe the law is ſaid to ſuffer it: whenas to <hi>ſuffer</hi> is but the legall phraſe denoting what by law a man may doe or not doe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Becauſe of the hardneſſe of your hearts]</hi> Hence they argue that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he allowd it not; and therefore it muſt be aboliſht. But the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this will ſooner follow, that becauſe he ſuffer'd it for a cauſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in relation to that cauſe he allow'd it. Next, if he in his wiſedome, and in the midſt of his ſeverity allow'd it for hardneſſe of heart, it can be nothing better then arrogance and preſumption to take ſtricter courſes againſt hardnes of heart then God ever ſet an example and that under the Goſpel which warrants them to no judicial act of compulſion in this matter, much leſſe to be more ſevere againſt hardnes of extremity, then God thought good to bee againſt hardnes of heart. He ſuffer'd it, rather then worſe inconveniences; theſe men wiſer as they make themſelves, will ſuffer the worſt and hainouſeſt inconveniences to follow, rather then
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:123241:34"/>
they will ſuffer what God ſuffer'd. Although they can know when they pleaſe, that Chriſt ſpake only to the conſcience, did not judge on the civil bench, but alwaies diſavow'd it. What can be more contrary to the waies of God then theſe their doings. If they bee ſuch enemies to hardnes of heart, although this groundleſſe rigor proclaims it to be in themſelves, they may yet learne, or conſider that hardneſſe of heart hath a twofould acception in the Goſpel. One, when it is in a good man taken for infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and imperfection, which was in all the Apoſtles, whoſe weakneſſe only, not utter want of beleef is call'd hardnes of heart, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this hardneſſe of heart, the imperfection and decay of man from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal righteouſneſſe, it was that God ſuffer'd not divorce onely, but all that which by Civilians is term'd the <hi>ſecondary law of nature and of nations.</hi> He ſuffer'd his owne people to waſt and ſpoyle and ſlay by warre, to lead captives, to be ſom maiſters, ſom ſervants, ſom to be princes, others to be ſubjects, hee ſuffer'd propriety to divide all things by ſeverall poſſeſſion trade and commerce, not with out uſury; in his comon wealth ſome to bee undeſervedly rich, others to bee undeſervingly poore. All which till hardneſſe of heart came in, was moſt unjuſt; whenas prime Nature made us all equall, made us equall coheirs by common right and dominion over all creatures. In the ſame manner, and for the ſame cauſe hee ſuffer'd divorce as well as mariage, our imperfet and degenerat condition of neceſſity requiring this law among the reſt, as a remedy againſt intolerable wrong and ſervitude above the patience of man to beare. Nor was it giv'n only becauſe our infirmity, or if it muſt be ſo call'd, hardneſſe of heart could not endure all things, but becauſe the hardnes of anothers heart might not inflict all things upon an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon, whom far other ends brought into a league of love and not of bondage and indignity. If therefore we aboliſh divorce as only ſuffer'd for hardnes of heart, we may as well aboliſh the whole law of nations, as only ſufferd for the ſame cauſe; it being ſhewn us by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. that the very ſeeking of a mans right by law, and at the hands of a worldly magiſtrat, is not without the hardneſſe of our hearts. <hi>For why doe ye not rather take wrong,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>why ſuffer ye not rather your ſelves to be defrauded?</hi> If nothing now muſt be ſuffer'd for hardnes of heart, I ſay the very proſecution of our right by way of civil juſtice can no more bee ſuffer'd among Chriſtians, for the hardnes of heart wherwith moſt men perſue it. And that would next remove all our judiciall lawes, and this reſtraint of divorce alſo in the number; which would more then halfe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:123241:34"/>
end the controversy. But if it be plaine that the whole juridical law and civil power is only ſuffer'd under the Goſpel, for the hardnes of our hearts, then wherefore ſhould not that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffer'd, be ſuffer'd ſtill by the ſame reaſon?</p>
                  <p>In a ſecond ſignification hardnes of heart is tak'n for a ſtubborne reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to doe evil. And that God ever makes any law purpoſely to ſuch, I deny; for he voutſafes not to enter gov'nant with them, but as they fortune to be mixt with good men, and paſſe undiſcover'd; much leſſe that he ſhould decree an unlawfull thing only to ſerve their licentiouſnes. But that God <hi>ſuffers</hi> this reprobate hardnes of heart I affirm, not only in this law of divorce, but throughout all his beſt and pureſt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He commands all to worſhip in ſinglenes of heart according to all his Ordinances; and yet ſuffers the wicked man to performe all the rites of religion hypocritically and in the hardnes of his heart. He gives us generall ſtatutes &amp; privileges in all civil matters, juſt &amp; good of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet ſuffers unworthieſt men, to uſe them &amp; by themt, o proſecute their own right, or any colour of right, though for the moſt part malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, covetouſly, nigorouſly, revengefully. He allow'd by law the diſcreet father and husband to forbidd, if he thought fit, the religious vows of his wife or daughter: <hi>Num.</hi> 30. and in the ſame law ſuffer'd the hard heartednes of impious and covetous fathers or husbands abuſing this law to forbidd their wives or daughters in their offrings and devotions of greateſt zeal. If then God ſuffer hardnes of heart equally in the beſt laws as in this of divorce, there can be no reaſon that for this cauſe this law ſhould be aboliſht. But other lawes, they object, may be well us'd, this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. How often ſhall I anſwer both from the inſtitution of mariage, and from other general rules in Scripture, that this law of divorce hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe and charitable ends beſides the being ſuffer'd for hardnes of heart; which is indeed no end, but an accident happning through the whole law; which gives to good men right, and to bad men who abuſe right under falſe pretences, gives only ſufferance. Now although Chriſt expreſſ no other reaſons here, but only what was ſuffer'd, it nothing followes that this law had no other reaſon to be permitted but for hardnes of heart. The Scripture ſeldome, or never in one place ſets down all the reaſons of what it grants or commands, eſpecially when it talks to enemies and tempters. St <hi>Paul</hi> permitting mariage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, ſeems to permit even that alſo for hardnes of heart only, leſt we ſhould run into fornication; yet no intelligent man thence concludes mariage allow'd in the Goſpel
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:123241:35"/>
only to avoid an evill, becauſe no other end is there expreſt. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> of neceſſity ſuffer'd many to put away their wives for hardneſſe of heart; but enacted the law of divorce doubtles for other good cauſes, not for this only ſufferance. He permitted not divorce by law as an evil, for that was impoſſible to divine law, but permitted by accident the evil of them who divorc't againſt the lawes intention undiſcoverably This alſo may be thought not improbably, that Chriſt ſtirr'd up in his ſpirit againſt theſe tempting Phariſes, anſwer'd them in a certain forme of indignation uſual among good authors; wherby the queſtion, or the truth is not directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, but ſom thing which is fitter for them, who aske, to heare. So in the eccleſiaſtical ſtories one demanding how God imploy'd himſelf before the world was made, had a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer; that he was making hel for curious queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. Another (and <hi>Libanius</hi> the <hi>Sophiſt</hi> as I remember) asking in deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſom Chriſtian, what the Carpenter, meaning our Saviour, was doing, now that <hi>Julian</hi> ſo prevail'd, had it return'd him, that the Carpenter was making a coffin for the <hi>Apoſtat.</hi> So Chriſt being demanded maliciouſly why <hi>Moſes</hi> made the law of divorce, anſwers them in a vehement <hi>ſcheme,</hi> not telling them the cauſe why he made it, but what was fitteſt to be told them, that <hi>for the hardnes of their hearts</hi> he ſuffer'd them to abuſe it. And all beit <hi>Mark</hi> ſay not he ſuffer'd you, but <hi>to you he wrote this precept; Mark</hi> may be warrantably expounded by <hi>Mathew</hi> the larger. And whether he ſuffer'd, or gave precept, being all one as was heard, it changes not the <hi>trope</hi> of indignation, fitteſt account for ſuch askers. Next for the hardnes of <hi>your hearts to you he wrote this precept,</hi> inferrs not therfore for this cauſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he wrote it, as was parallell'd by other Scriptures. Laſtly, It may be worththe obſerving, that Chriſt ſpeaking to the Phariſes does not ſay in general that for hardnes of heart he gave this precept, but <hi>you he ſuffer'd,</hi> &amp; <hi>to you he gave this precept for your</hi> hardnes of heart. It cannot be eaſily thought that Chriſt heer included all the children of Iſrael under the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe tempting Phariſes but that he conceals wherefore he gave the better ſort of them this law, and expreſſes by ſaying emphatically <hi>To you</hi> how he gave it to the worſer, ſuch as the Phariſes beſt repreſented, that is to ſay for the hardnes of your hearts: as indeed to wicked men and hardn'd hearts he gives the whole law and the Goſpel alſo, to hard'n them the more. Thus many waies it may orthod oxally be underſtood how God or <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffer'd ſuch as the demanders were, to divorce for hardnes of heart. Whereas the vulgar expoſiter beſet with contradictions and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities round, and reſolving at any peril to make an expoſition of it, as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:123241:35"/>
there is nothing more violent and boiſtrous then a reverend ignorance in fear to be convicted, ruſhes brutely and impetuouſly againſt all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples both of nature, piety, and moral goodnes; and in the ſury of his literal expounding overturns them all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[But from the the beginning it was not ſo.]</hi> Not how from the beginning doe they ſuppoſe, that men might not divorce at all, not neceſſarily, not deliberatly except for adultery, but that ſom law, like canon law preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attacht them both before and after the flood, till ſtricter <hi>Moſes</hi> came, and with law brought licence into the world? that were a fancy indeed to ſmile at. Undoubtedly as to point of judiciall law, divorce was more permiſſive from the beginning before <hi>Moſes</hi> then under <hi>Moſes.</hi> But from the beginning, that is to ſay, by the inſtitution in Paradice it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that matrimony ſhould diſſolve for every trivial cauſe as you Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes accuſtome. But that it was not thus ſuffer'd from the beginning ever ſince the race of men corrupted, &amp; laws were made, he who will affirme, muſt have found out other antiquities then are yer known. Beſides we muſt conſider now, what can be ſo as from the beginning, not only what ſhould be ſo. In the beginning, had men continu'd perfet, it had bin juſt that all things ſhould have remain'd, as they began to <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve.</hi> But after that the ſons of men grew violent &amp; injurious, it alter'd the lore of juſtice, and put the goverment of things into a new frame. While man and woman were both perfet each to other, there needed no divorce; but when they both degenerated to imperfection, &amp; oft times grew to be an intolerable evil each to other, then law more juſtly did permitt the alienating of that evil which miſtake made proper, then it did the appropriating of that good which Nature at firſt made common. For if the abſence of outward good be not ſo bad as the preſence of a cloſe evil, &amp; that propriety, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by cov'nant or poſſeſſion, be but the attainment of ſome outward good, it is more natural &amp; righteous that the law ſhould ſever us from an intimat evil, then appropriate any outward good to us from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of nature. The Goſpel indeed tending ever to that which is perfeteſt, aim'dat the reſtorement of all things, as they were in the beginning. And therefore all things were in common to thoſe primitive Chriſtians in the Acts, which <hi>Ananias &amp; Sapphira</hi> dearly felt. That cuſtome alſo continu'd more or leſſ till the time of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> as may be read in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> which might be writt after that act of communion perhaps ſome. 40. yeares above a hunder'd. But who will be the man ſhall introduce this kind of common wealth, as chriſtianity now goes? If then mariage muſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:123241:36"/>
be as in the beginning, the perſons that marry muſt be ſuch as then were, the inſtitution muſt make good, in ſom tolerable ſort, what it promiſes toeeither party. If not, it is but madnes to drag this one ordinance back to the beginning, and draw down all other to the preſent neceſſity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition farre from the beginning even to the tolerating of extortions and opp reſſions.

Although we are not to ſeek, that the inſtitution it ſelfe from the firſt beginning was never but conditional, as all cov'nants are: becauſe thus and thus, therefore ſo and ſo; if not thus, then not ſo. Then moreover was perfeteſt to fulfill each law in it ſelfe; now is perfeteſt in this eſtate of things, to ask of charity how much law may be fulfill'd: els the fulfilling, oft times is the greateſt breaking. If any therefore demand, which is now moſt perfection, to eaſe an extremity by divorce, or to enrage and feſter it by the greevous obſervance of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable wedloc, I am not deſtitute to ſay which is moſt perfection (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſom who beleev they thinke favourably of divorce, eſteem it only venial to infirmity) Him I hold more in the way to perfection who forgoes an unfit ungodly &amp; diſcordant wedloc, to live according to peace &amp; love, &amp; Gods inſtitution in a fitter chois, then he who debarrs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the happy experience of all godly, which is peaceful converſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his family, to live a contentious, and unchritian life not to be avoided, in temptations not to be liv'd in, only for the fals keeping of a moſt unreal nullity, a mariage that hath no affinity with Gods intention, a daring phantaſm, a meer toy of terror awing weak ſenſes, to the lamentable ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of ruining themſelves, the remedy wherof God in his law voutſafes us. Which not to dare uſe, he warranting, is not our perfection, is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, our little faith, our timorous and low conceit of charity: and in them who force us, it is their masking pride and vanity, to ſeem holier &amp; more circumſpect then God. So far is it that we need impute to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, who thus divorces: ſince the rule of perfection is not ſo much that which was don in the beginning, as that which now is neareſt to the rule of charity. This is the greateſt, the perfeteſt, the higheſt commandment.</p>

                     <hi>[And I ſay unto you]</hi> That this reſtrictive denouncement of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts and refutes that permiſſive precept of <hi>Moſes,</hi> common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiters themſelves diſclaime: and that it does not traverſe from the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of conſcience to the courts of civil or canon law, with any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an rightly commenc't requires not long evincing. If Chriſt then did not heer check permiſſive <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor did reduce matrimony to the beginning more then all other things, as the reaſon of mans condition could beare, we would know preciſely what it was which he did, and what the end was of his declaring thus auſterely againſt divorce. For this is a confesſt oracle in law, that he who lookes not at the intention of a precept, the more ſuperſtitions he is of the letter, the more he miſinterprets. Was it to ſhame <hi>Moſes?</hi> that had beene monſtrous: or all thoſe pureſt ages of Iſrael, to whom the permiſſion was granted? that were as incredible. Or was it that he who came to abrogate the burden of law, not the equity, ſhould put this yoke upon a blameleſſe perſon, to league himſelfe in chaines with a begirting miſcheif, not to ſeparat till death? hee who taught us that no man puts a peece of new cloth upon an old garment, nor new wine into old bottles, that he ſhould ſow this patch of ſtrictnes upon the old appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of our frailty, to make a rent more incurable, when as in all other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments his doctrine ſtill charges, that regard be had to the garment, and to the veſſel, what it can endure; this were an irregular and ſingle peece of rigor, not onely ſounding diſproportion to the whole Goſpel, but outſtretching the moſt rigorous nervs of law and rigor it ſelfe. No other end therefore can bee left imaginable of this exceſſive reſtraint, but to bridle thoſe erroneous and licentious poſtillers the Phariſes; not by telling them what may bee done in neceſſity, but what cenſure they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve who divorce abuſively, which their Tetrarch had done. And as the offence was in one extreme, ſo the rebuke, to bring more efficaciouſly to a rectitude and mediocrity, ſtands not in the middle way of duty, but in the other extreme. Which art of powerfull reclaiming, wiſeſt men have alſo taught in their ethical precepts and <hi>gnomologies;</hi> reſembling it, as when wee bend a crooked wand the contrary way; not that it ſhould ſtand ſo bent, but that the overbending might reduce it to a ſtraitneſſe by its own reluctance. And as the Phyſician cures him who hath tak'n down poyſon, not by the middling temper of nouriſhment, but by the other extreme of <hi>antidote,</hi> ſo Chriſt adminiſters heer a ſharpe &amp; corroſive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt a foul and putrid licence; not to eate into the fleſh, but into the ſore. And knowing that our divines through all their comments make

no ſcruple, where they pleaſe, to ſoften the high and vehem ent ſpeeches of our Saviour, which they call <hi>hyperbolics,</hi> why in this one text ſhould they be ſuch crabbed <hi>maſorites</hi> of the Letter, as not to mollifie a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of literal rigidity, which they confeſſe to find often elſewhere in his manner of delivery, but muſt make their expoſition heer ſuch an obdurat <hi>Cyclops,</hi> to have but one eye for this text, and that onely open to cruelty and enthralment, ſuch as no divine, or human law before ever heard of. No, let the foppiſh canouiſt with his fardel of matrimonial caſes goe and be vendible where men bee ſo unhappy as to cheap'n him; the words of Chriſt ſhall be aſſerted from ſuch elementall notaries, and reſolv'd by the now-only lawgiving mouth of charity; which may be done undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by underſtanding them as followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife.]</hi> That is to ſay, ſhall ſo away as the propounders of this queſtion, the Phariſees were wont to doe and covertly defended <hi>Herod</hi> for ſo doing; whom to rebuke, our Saviour heer mainely intends, and not to determine all the caſes of divorce, as appeares by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Whoſoever ſhall put away, either violently without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſent for urgent reaſons, or conſpiringly by plot of luſt, or cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning malice, ſhall put away for any ſudden mood, or contingency of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement, which is not daily practice, but may blow ſoone over, and be reconcil'd, except it bee fornication; whoſoever ſhall put away raſhly, as his choler prompts him, without due time of deliberating, and thinke his conſcience diſcharg'd only by the bill of divorce giv'n, and the outward law ſatisfi'd; whoſoever laſtly ſhall put away his wife, that is a wife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, &amp; not in name only, ſuch a one who both can and is willing to bee a meet helpe toward the cheif ends of mariage both civil, and ſanctify'd, except fornication be the cauſe, that man, or that pair committ adulcery. Not he who puts away by mutuall conſent, with all the conſiderations and reſpects of humanity and gentleneſſe without malicious or luſtfull drift. Not he who after ſober and coole experience, and long debate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf puts away whom though he cannot love or ſuffer as a wife, with that ſincere affection that marriage requires, yet loves at leſt with that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and goodneſſe, as not to keepe her under a neglected and unwelcom reſidence, where nothing can be hearty, and not beeing, it muſt needs bee both unjoyous and injurious to any perceaving perſon ſo detain'd, and more injurious, then to be freely, and upon good termes diſmiſt. Nor doth hee put away adulterouſly who complaines of cauſes rooted in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable nature, utter unfitneſſe, utter diſconformity, not concileable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

not to be amended without a miracle. Nor hee who puts away an unquenſhable vexation from his boſom, and flies an evil then which a greater cannot befall human ſociety. Nor hee who puts away with the the full ſuffrage and applauſe of his conſcience, not relying on the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'n bill of law, but claiming by faith and fulnes of perſwaſion the rights and promiſes of Gods inſtitution, of which hee finds himſelfe in a miſtak'n wedlock defrauded.

Such an aſſociate he who puts away, divorces not a wife, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns a nullity which God never joyn'd, if ſhe be neither willing, nor to her proper and requiſite duties ſufficient, as the words of God inſtitute her.

For exceptions are not logically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't from a divers kind, as to ſay who ſo puts away for any naturall cauſe except fornication, the exception would want ſalt. And if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, who ſo for any cauſe what ever, they caſt themſelves; granting divorce for frigidity a naturall cauſe of their own allowing, though not heer expreſt, and for deſertion without infidelity when as he who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as they allow him for a deſertion, deſerts as well as is deſerted, and finally puts away, for another cauſe beſides adultery. It will with all due reaſon therefore be thus better underſtood, who ſo puts away for any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental and temporary cauſes, except one of them, which is fornication. Thus this exception finds out the cauſes from whence it is excepted, to be of the ſame kind, that is, caſuall, not continuall.</p>

                     <hi>[Saving for the cauſe of fornication.]</hi> The New Teſtament, though it be ſaid originally writt in Greeke, yet hath nothing neer ſo many <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms as Hebraiſms, &amp; Syriaciſms</hi> which was the Majeſty of God, not filing the tongue of Scripture to a Gentiliſh <hi>Idiom,</hi> but in a princely manner off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

to them as to Gentiles and Foreiners grace and mercy, though not in forein words, yet in a forein ſtile that might induce them to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; and though their calling were high and happy, yet ſtill to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods ancient people their betters, and that language the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi> language. He therefore who thinks to <hi>Scholiaze</hi> upon the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, though Greek, according to his Greek <hi>Analogies,</hi> and hath not bin Auditor to the oriental dialects, ſhall want in the heat of his <hi>Analyſis</hi> no accomodation to ſtumble. In this place, as the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Matth,</hi> reads it, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the cauſe of fornication,</hi> the Greek, ſuch as it is, ſounds it, except for the <hi>word, report, ſpeech, or proportion</hi> of fornication. In which regard with other inducements, many ancient and learned writers have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this exception as comprehending any fault equivalent and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to fornication But truth is, the Evangeliſt heer <hi>Hebraizes,</hi> taking <hi>word</hi> or <hi>ſpeech</hi> for <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> in the common eaſtern phraſe, meaning perhaps no more then if he had ſaid for fornication, as in this 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And yet the word is found in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Exodus</hi> alſo fignifying <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion;</hi> where the Iſraelites are commanded to doe their tasks, <hi>The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of each day in his day.</hi> A task we know is a proportion of work not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing abſolutely every day, but ſo much. Whereby it may be doubtfull yet, whether heer be not excepted not only fornication it ſelf, but other cauſes equipollent, and proportional to fornication. Which very word alſo to underſtand rightly, wee muſt of neceſſity have recours again to the Ebrew. For in the Greek and Latin ſenſe by fornication is meant the common proſtitution of body for ſale. So that they who are ſo exact for the letter, ſhall be dealt with by the <hi>Lexicon,</hi> and the <hi>Etymologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> too if they pleaſe, and muſt be bound to forbidd divorce for adultery alſo, untill it come to open whoredom and trade, like that for which <hi>Claudius</hi> divorc't <hi>Meſſalina.</hi> Since therfore they take not heer the word fornication in the common ſignificance, for an open exerciſe in the ſtews, but grant divorce for one ſingle act of privateſt adultery, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the word ſpeakes a public and notorious frequency of fact, not without price, we may reaſon with as good leav, and as little ſtraining to the text, that our Saviour on ſet purpoſe choſe this word <hi>Fornication,</hi> improperly appli'd to the lapſe of adultery, that we might not think our ſelvs bound from all divorce, except when that fault hath bin actually committed. For the language of Scripture ſignifies by fornication (and others beſide St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo expounded it) not only the treſpas of body nor perhaps that between maried perſons, unleſſe in a degree or quality as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:123241:38"/>
ſhameles as the <hi>Bordello,</hi> but ſignifies alſo any notable diſobedience, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable cariage of the wife to the husband, as <hi>Judg.</hi> the 192. Whereof at large <hi>in the Doctrin of Divorce. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 18 Secondly ſignifies the apparent alienation of mind not to idolatry, (which may ſeeme to anſwer the act of adultery) but farre on this ſide, to any point of will worſhip, though to the true God; ſome times it notes the love of earthly things, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures though in a right beleever, ſome times the leaſt ſuſpicion of unwitting idolatry. As <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 39. willſull diſobedience to any the leaſt of Gods commandements is call'd fornication. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 26, 27. A diſtruſt only in God, and withdrawing from that neernes of zeal and confidence which ought to be, is call'd fornication. We may be ſure it could not import thus much leſs then Idolatry in the borrow'd metaphor between God and man, unleſs it ſignifi'd as much leſs then adultery in the ordinary acception between man and wife. Adde alſo that there was no need our Saviour ſhould grant divorce for adultery, it being death by law, and law then in force. Which was the cauſe why <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſought to put away his betrothed wife privately, leaſt he ſhould make her an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of capitall puniſhment, as lernedeſt expounders affirm, <hi>Herod</hi> being a great zelot of the Moſaic law, and the Phariſes great maiſters of the text, as the woman tak'n in adultery doubtleſs had cauſe to fear. Or if they can prove it was neglected, which they cannot doe, why did our Saviour ſhape his anſwer to the corruption of that age, and not rather tell them of their neglect? If they ſay he came not to meddle with their judicatures, much leſs then was it in his thought to make them new ones, or that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce ſhould be judicially reſtrain'd in a ſtricter manner by theſe his words, more then adultery judicially acquitted by thoſe his words to the adultres. His ſentence doth no more by law forbidd divorce heer, then by law it doth abſolve adultery there. To them therefore, who have drawn this yoke upon Chriſtians from his words thus wreſted, nothing remaines but the guilt of a preſumption and perverſnes which will be hard for them to anſwer. Thus much that the word fornication is to be underſtood as the language of Chriſt underſtands it, for a conſtant alienation and diſaffection of mind, or for the continual practiſe of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and croſſnes from the duties of love and peace, that is in ſumm, when to be a tolerable wife is either naturally not in their power, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatly not in their will, and this opinion alſo is St. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> leaſt it ſhould hap to be ſuſpected of novelty. Yet grant the thing heer meant were only adultery, the reaſon of things will afford more to our aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:123241:39"/>
then did the reaſon of words. For why is divorce unlawfull but only for adultery? becauſe, ſay they, that crime only breaks the matrimony. But this, I reply, the inſtitution itſelfe gainſaies: for that which is moſt contrary to the words and meaning of the inſtitution, that moſt breaks the matrimony; but a perpetuall unmeetnes and unwillingneſſe to all the duties of helpe, of love and tranquillity is moſt contrary to the words and meaning of the inſtitution; that therefore much more breaks matrimony then the act of adultery though repeated. For this, as it is not felt, nor troubles him who perceaves it not, ſo beeing perceav'd, may be ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, ſoon amended, ſoon, if it can be pardon'd, may be redeem'd w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the more ardent love and duty in her who hath the pardon. But this naturall unmeetnes both cannot be unknown long, and ever after cannot be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if it be natural, and will not, if it be farregon obſtinat. So that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ought in the inſtant to be as great a breach as adultery, it gains it in the perpetuity to be greater. Next adultery does not exclude her other fitnes, her other pleaſingnes; ſhe may be otherwiſe both loving and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, as many adultreſſes be; but in this general unfitnes or alienation ſhe can be nothing to him that can pleaſe. In adultery nothing is given from the husband, which he miſſes, or enjoyes the leſs, as it may be ſuttly giv'n: but this unfitnes defrauds him of the whole contentment which is ſought in wedloc. And what benefit to him, though nothing be giv'n by the ſtealth of adultery to another, if that which there is to give, whether it be ſolace, or ſociety, be not ſuch as may juſtly content him? and ſo not only deprives him of what it ſhould give him, but gives him ſorrow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, which it did not ow him. Beſides is adultery the greateſt breach of matrimony in reſpect of the offence to God, or of the injury to man? if in the former, then other ſins may offend God more, and ſooner cauſe him to diſunite his ſervant from being one fleſh with ſuch an offender. If in reſpect of the latter, other injuries are demonſtrated therein more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to mans nature then the iterated act of adultery. God therfore in his wiſedom would not ſo diſpoſe his remedies, as to provide them for the leſs injuries, and not allow them for the greater. Thus is won both from the word fornication, &amp; the reaſon of adultery, that the exception of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce is not limitted to that act, but enlarg'd to the cauſes above ſpecify'd.</p>

                  <p>By this clauſe alone, if by nothing els, we may aſſure us, that Chriſt intended not to deliver heer the whole doctrin of divorce, but only to condemn abuſes. Otherwiſe to marry after deſertion, which the Apoſtle,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:123241:39"/>
and the reformed Churches at this day permitt, is heer forbid, as adultery. Be ſhe never ſo wrongfully deſerted, or put away, as the law then ſuffer'd, if thus forſak'n and expulſt, ſhe accept the refuge and protection of any honeſter man who would love her better, and give her ſelf in mariage to him, by what the letter guides us, it ſhall be preſent adultery to them both. This is either harſh and cruel, or all the Churches teaching as they doe the contrary, are loos and remiſs; beſides that the Apoſtle himſelfe ſtands deeply fin'd in a contradiction againſt our Saviour. What ſhall we make of this? what rather the common interpreter can make of it, for they be his own markets, let him now trie; let him trie which way he can wind in his <hi>Vertumnian</hi> diſtinctions and evaſions, if his canonical gabardine of text and letter do not now ſit too cloſe about him, and pinch his activity; which if I erre not, hath heer hamper'd it ſelfe in a ſpringe fitt for thoſe who put their confidence in Alphabets. <hi>Spanheim</hi> a writer of <hi>Evangelic doubts</hi> comes now and confeſſes that our Saviours words <hi>are to be limited beyond the limitation there expreſt and excepted beyond their own exception,</hi> as not ſpeaking of what happn'd rarely, but what moſt commonly. Is it ſo rare <hi>Spanheim,</hi> to be deſerted, or was it then ſo rare to put away injuriouſly, that a perſon ſo hatefully expell'd, ſhould to the heaping of more injury be turn'd like an infectious thing out of all mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fruition upon pain of adultery, as not conſiderable to the brevity of this halfe ſentence? Of what then ſpeakes our Saviour? <hi>of that colluſion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which was then moſt frequent among the Jews of changing wives and husbands, through inconſtancy and unchaſt deſires.</hi> Colluders your ſelves, as violent to this law of God by your unmercifull binding, as the Phariſes by their unbounded looſning! Have thouſands of Chriſtian ſouls periſht as to this life, and God knows what hath betided their conſciences, for want of this healing explanation, and is it now at laſt obſcurely drawn forth, only to cure a ſcratch, and leave the main wound ſpouting? <hi>Who ſo ever putteth away his wife except for fornication committeth adultery;</hi> That ſhall be ſpoke of all ages, and all men, though never ſo juſtly otherwiſe mov'd to divorce: in the very next breath, <hi>And who ſo marieth her which is put away committeth adultery,</hi> the men are new and miraculous, they tell you now <hi>you are to limit it to that age, when it was in faſhion to chop ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies; and muſt be meant of him who puts away with his wives conſent through the lightnes, and leudnes of them both.</hi> But what rule of Logic, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of reaſon is our commiſſion to underſtand the <hi>Anteeedent</hi> one way and the <hi>Conſequent</hi> another; for in that habitude this whole vers may be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:123241:40"/>
fider'd: or at leaſt to take the parts of a <hi>copulat axiom,</hi> both abſolutely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, and to ſay the firſt is abſolutely true, the other not, but muſt bee limited to a certain time and cuſtome; which is no leſſe then to ſay they are both falſe. For in this <hi>compound axiom,</hi> be the parts never ſo many, if one of them doe but falter, &amp; be not equally abſolute and generall, the reſt are all fals. If therefore, that <hi>he who marries her which is put away committs adultery,</hi> be not generally true, neither is it generally true that <hi>he committs adultery who puts away for other cauſe then fornication.</hi> And if the marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her which is put away muſt be underſtood limited, which they cannot but yeild it muſt, with the ſame limitation muſt be underſtood the putting away. Thus doth the common expoſition confound it ſelfe, and juſtify this which is heer brought; that our Saviour as well in the firſt part of this ſentence as in the ſecond, prohibited onely ſuch divorſes as the Jewes then made through malice or through plotted licence, not thoſe which are for neceſſary and juſt cauſes; where charity and wiſedome disjoyns, that which not God, but Error and Diſaſtre joyn'd.</p>
                  <p>And there is yet to this our expoſition, a ſtronger ſiding freind, then any can be an adverſary, unleſſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> be doubted, who repeating a command concerning divorce, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. which is agreed by writers to be the ſame with this of our Saviour, and appointing that the <hi>wife remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried, or be reconcil'd to her husband,</hi> leavs it infallible that our Saviour ſpake cheifly againſt putting away for caſual and choleric diſagreements, or any other cauſe which may with human patience and wiſedom be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, not hereby meaning to hale and daſh together the irreconcilable averſations of nature, nor to tie up a faultleſſe perſon like a parricide, as it were into one ſack with an enemy, to be his cauſeleſſe tormenter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner the length of a long life. Laſtly, let this ſentence of Chriſt bee underſtood how it will, yet that it was never intended for a judicial law, to be inforc'd by the Magiſtrat, beſides that the office of our Saviour had no ſuch purpoſe in the Goſpel, this latter part of the ſentence may aſſure us, <hi>And who ſo marrieth her which is put away committs adultery.</hi> Shall the exception for adultery belong to this clauſe or not? if not, it would be ſtrange, that he who marries a woman really divorc't for adultery, as Chriſt permitted, ſhould become an adulter by marrying one who is now no other mans wife, himſelf being alſo free, who might by this meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim her from common whordome. And if the exception muſt belong hither, then it followes that he who marries an adultreſſe divorc'd, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no adultry; which would ſoone diſcover to us what an abſurd and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:123241:40"/>
ſenſeles peece of injuſtice this would be, to make a civil ſtatute of, in penal courts: whereby the adultreſſe put away may marry another ſafely, and without a crime to him that marries her: but the innocent and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully divorc'd ſhall not marry again without the guilt of adultery both to her ſelfe and to her ſecond husband. This ſaying of Chriſt therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made a temporal law, were it but for this reaſon. Nor is it eaſie to ſay what coherence there is at all in it from the letter, to any perfet ſenſe not obnoxious to ſom abſurdity, and ſeems much leſſe agreeable to what ever els of the Goſpel is left us written; doubtles by our Saviour ſpok'n in that fiercenes and abſtruſe intricacy, firſt to amuſe his tempters, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh in general the abuſers of that Moſaic law; next to let <hi>Herod</hi> know a ſecond knower of his unlawfull act, though the Baptiſt were beheaded; laſt that his Diſciples and all good men might learne to expound him in this place, as in all other his precepts, not by the written letter, but by that unerring paraphraſe of Chriſtian love and Charity, which is the ſumme of all commands, and the perfection.</p>

                  <p>This verſe I adde, to leave no objection behind unanſwer'd: for ſome may thinke, if this our Saviours ſentence be ſo faire, as not commanding ought that patience or nature cannot brook, why then did the Diſciples murmur and ſay, <hi>it is not good to marry.</hi> I anſwer that the Diſciples had bin longer bred up under the Phariſaean doctrin, then under that of Chriſt, and ſo no marvel though they yet retain'd the infection of loving old li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious cuſtoms; no marvel though they thought it hard they might not for any offence that throughly anger'd them, divorce a wife, as well as put away a ſervant; ſince it was but giving her a bill, as they were taught. Secondly, it was no unwonted thing with them not to underſtand our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in matters farre eaſier. So that bee it granted their conceit of this text was the ſame which is now commonly conceiv'd, according to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall rate of their capacity then, it will not hurt a better interpretation. But why did not Chriſt ſeeing their error informe them? for good cauſe; it was his profeſt method not to teach them all things at all times, but each thing in due place and ſeaſon. Chriſt ſaid <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>that hee who had no ſword ſhould ſell his garment and buy one:</hi> the Diſciples tooke it in a manifeſt wrong ſenſe, yet our Saviour did not there informe them better. He told
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:123241:41"/>
them <hi>it was eaſier for a Camell to go through a needles eye,</hi> then a rich man in at heav'n gate. They were <hi>amaz'd exceedingly:</hi> he explain'd himſelfe to meane of thoſe <hi>who truſt in riches, Mark</hi> 10. <hi>They were amaz'd then out of meaſure,</hi> for ſo <hi>Marke</hi> relates it; as if his explaining had increas'd their amazement, in ſuch a plaine caſe, and which concern'd ſo neerely their calling to be inform'd in Good reaſon therefore, if Chriſt at that time did not ſtand amplifying, to the thick prejudice and tradition where in they were, this queſtion of more difficulty, and leſſe concernment to any perhaps of them in particular. Yet did he not omitt to ſow within them the ſeeds of a ſufficient determining, agen the time that his promis'd ſpirit ſhould bring all things to their memory. Hee had declar'd in their hearing not long before, how diſtant hee was from aboliſhing the law it ſelfe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce; hee had referr'd them to the inſtitution; and after all this, gives them a ſet anſwer, from which they might collect what was cleer anough, that <hi>all men cannot receive all ſayings,</hi> verſe 11. If ſuch regard bee had to each mans receiving of mariage or ſingle life, what can ariſe, that the ſame chriſtian regard ſhould not bee had in moſt neceſſary divorce? All which inſtructed both them and us, that it beſeem'd his Diſciples to learne the deciding of this queſtion, which hath nothing new in it, firſt by the inſtitution, then by the generall grounds of religion, not by a particular ſaying here or there, temper'd and level'd only to an incident occaſion, the riddance of a tempting aſſault. For what can this bee but weake and ſhallow apprehenſion, to forſake the ſtandard principles of inſtitution, faith, &amp; charity; then to be blanke &amp; various at every occurrence in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in a cold <hi>Spaſm</hi> of ſcruple, to reare peculiar doctrines upon the place; that ſhall bid the gray autority of moſt unchangeable and ſovran rules to ſtand by &amp; be contradicted. Thus to this Evangelic precept of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous difficulty, which for theſe many ages weakly underſtood, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently put in practice, hath made a ſhambles rather then an ordinance of matrimony, I am firme a truer expoſition cannot be given. If this or that argument heer us'd, pleaſe not every one, there is no ſcarſity of arguments, any halfe of them will ſuffice, Or ſhould they all faile, as Truth it ſelfe can faile as ſoon, I ſhould content me with the inſtitution alone to wage this controverſie, and not diſtruſt to evince. If any need it not, the happier; yet Chriſtians ought to ſtudy earneſtly what may be anothers need. But if, as mortall miſchances are, ſom hap to need it, let them be ſure they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe not, and give God his thanks, who hath reviv'd this remedy, not too late for them, and ſcowr'd off an inveterat miſexpoſition from the

                  <p>THis intimates but what our Saviour taught before, that divorce is no raſhly to be made, but reconcilement to be perſuaded and endevo'rd, as oft as the cauſe can have to doe with reconcilement, &amp; is not under the dominion of blameles nature; which may have reaſon to depart though ſeldomeſt and laſt from charitable love, yet ſomtimes from friendly, and familiar, and ſomthing oftner from conjugal love, which requires not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moral, but natural cauſes to the making and maintayning; and may be warrantably excus'd to retire from the deception of what it juſtly ſeeks, and the ill requitals which unjuſtly it finds. For Nature hath her <hi>Zodiac</hi> alſo, keepes her great annual circuit over human things as truly as the Sun and Planers in the firmament; hath her <hi>anomalies,</hi> hath her obliquities in aſcenſions and declinations, acceſſes and receſſes, as blameleſly as they in heaven. And ſitting in her planetary Orb with two rains in each hand, one ſtrait, the other loos, tempers the cours of minds as well as bodies to ſeveral conjunctions and oppoſitions, freindly, or unfriendly aſpects, conſenting ofteſt with reaſon, but never contrary. This in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no man of meaneſt reach but daily ſees; and though to every one it appeare not in the cauſe, yet to a cleare capacity, well nurtur'd with good reading and obſervation, it cannot but be plaine and viſible. Other expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition therefore then hath bin given to former places that give light to theſe two ſummary verſes, will not be needfull: ſave onely that theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are meant to thoſe maried who differ not in religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[But to the reſt ſpeake I, not the Lord; if any brother hath a wife that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not, and ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now followes what is to be done, if the perſons wedded be of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent faith. The common beleef is, that a chriſtian is heer commanded not to divorce, if the infidel pleaſe to ſtay, though it be but to vexe, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride, or to ſeduce the chriſtian. This doctrin will be the eaſie worke of a refutation. The other opinion is, that a chriſtian is heer conditionally
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:123241:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
permitted to hold wedloc with a misbeleever only upon hopes limited by chriſtian prudence, which without much difficulty ſhall be defended. That this heer ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> not by the Lord cannot be a command, theſe reaſ avouch. Firſt the law of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34. 16. <hi>Dent.</hi> 7. 3. 6. interpreted by <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> two infallible authors, commands to divorce an infidel not for the feare onely of a ceremonious defilement, but of an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious ſeducem ent, fear'd both in reſpect of the beleever himſelfe, and of his children in danger to bee perverted by the misbeleeving parent. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 24. 26 and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> thought this a convincing reaſon. If therefore the legal pollution vaniſhing have abrogated the ceremony of this law, ſo that a chriſtian may be permitted to retaine an infidel without uncleannes, yet the moral reaſon of divorcing ſtands to eternity, which neither Apoſtle nor Angel from heaven can countermand. All that they reply to this, is their human warrant, that God will preſerve us in our obedience to this command againſt the danger of ſeducement. And ſo undoubtedly he will, if we underſtand his commands aright; if we turn not this evangelic permiſſion into a legal, and yet illegal command: If we turne not hope into bondage, the charitable and free hope of gaining another, into the forc't and ſervil temptation of looſing our ſelves; but more of this beneath. Thus theſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> by common doctrin made a command, are made a contradiction to the morall law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not the law only, but the Goſpel from the law, and from it ſelfe requires even in the ſame chapter, where divorce between them of one religion is ſo narrowly forbidd, rather then our chriſtian love ſhould come into danger of backſliding, to forſake all relations how neer ſo ever, and the wife expreſly, with promiſe of a high reward, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. And he who hates not father or mother, wife, or children hindring his chriſtian cours, much more, if they deſpiſe or aſſault it, cannot be a Diſciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. How can the Apoſtle then command us, to love and continue in that matrimony, which our Saviour bids us hate, and forſake? They can as ſoon teach our faculty of reſpiration to contract and to dilate it ſelfe at once, to breath and to fetch breath in the ſame inſtant, as teach our minds how to doe ſuch contrary acts as theſe, towards the ſame object, and as they muſt he done in the ſame moment. For either the hatred of her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; her hatred to our religion will work powerfully againſt the love of her ſociety, or the love of that will by degrees flatter out all our zealous hatred and forſaking and ſoone enſnare us to unchriſtianly compliances.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In mariage there ought not only to be a civil love, but ſuch a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:123241:42"/>
love as Chriſt loves his Church; but where the religion is contrary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of converſion, there can be no love, no faith, no peacefull ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (they of the other opinion confeſs it) nay there ought not to be, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then in expectation of gaining a ſoul; when that ceaſes, we know God hath put enmity between the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent. Neither ſhould <hi>we love them that hate the Lord,</hi> as the Prophet told <hi>Jehoſaphat.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. And this Apoſtle himſelfe in another place, warns us <hi>that we be not unequally yokt with Infidels</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. for that there can be no fellowſhip, no communion, no concord between ſuch. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward commerce and civil intercours cannot perhaps be avoided; but true friendſhip and familiarity there can be none. How vainly therefore, not to ſay how impiouſly would the moſt inward and dear alliance of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or continuance in mariage be commanded, where true friendſhip is confeſt impoſſible. For ſay they, wee are forbidd heer to marry with an infidel, not bid to divorce. But to rob the words thus of their full ſenſe will not be allow'd them: it is not ſaid, enter not into yoke, but <hi>be not unequally yokt;</hi> which plainly forbids the thing in preſent act, as well as in purpoſe; and his maniteſt conclu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion is, not only that <hi>we ſhould not touch,</hi> but that having toucht, <hi>we ſhould come out from among them, and be ſeparat;</hi> with the promiſe of a bleſſing thereupon that <hi>God will receave us, will be our father, and we his ſons and daughters.</hi> v. 17. 18. Why we ſhould ſtay with an Infidel after the expence of all our hopes, can be but for a civil relation; but why we ſhould depart from a ſeducer, ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide the miſconſtruction of this place, is from a religious neceſſity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting. The wors cauſe therefore of ſtaying (if it be any cauſe at all, for civil government forces it not) muſt not overtop the religious cauſe of ſeparating, executed with ſuch an urgent zeal, &amp; ſuch a proſtrate humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> What God hates to joyn, certainly he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love ſhould continue joyn'd: it being all one in matter of ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to marry, or to continue maried with an Infidel, ſave only ſo long as we wait willingly, and with a ſafe hope. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore citing heer a command of <hi>the Lord Almighty,</hi> for ſo he terms it, that we ſhould <hi>ſeparate,</hi> cannot have bound us with that which he calls his own whether command or counſel that we ſhould not ſeparate.</p>
                  <p>Which is the fourth reaſon, for he himſelfe takes care leaſt we ſhould miſtake him, <hi>[But to the reſt ſpeak If not the Lord.]</hi> If the Lord ſpake not, then man ſpake it and man hath no Lordſhip to command the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: yet modern interpreters will have it a command maugre St.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:123241:43"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, they will make him a Prophet like <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to ſpeak the word of the Lord not thinking, nay denying to think; though he diſavow to have receav'd it from the Lord, his word ſhall not be tak'n, though an Apoſtle, he ſhall be born down in his own Epiſtle, by a race of expoſiters who preſume to know from whom he ſpake, better then he himſelfe. <hi>Paul</hi> depoſes that the Lord ſpeaks not this, they, that the Lord ſpeaks it: can this be leſs then to brave him with a full fac't contradiction? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to ſuch a violence as this, for I cannot call it an expounding, what a man ſhould anſwer I know not, unleſs that if it be their pleaſure next to put a gag into the Apoſtles mouth, they are already ſurniſht with a commodious audacity toward the attempt. <hi>Beza</hi> would ſeem to ſhun the contradictory by telling us that the Lord ſpake it not in perſon, as he did the former precept. But how many other doctrines doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> deliver which the Lord ſpake not in perſon, and yet never uſes this preamble but in things indifferent? So long as we receave him for a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God, for him to ſtand ſorting ſentences what the Lord ſpake in perſon, and what he, not the Lord in perſon, would be but a chill trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and his readers might catch an ague the while. But if we ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the grammatical <hi>Ellipſis</hi> regularly, and as we muſt in the ſam <hi>tenſe,</hi> all will be then cleer, for we cannot ſupply it thus, to the reſt I ſpeake, the Lord ſpake not, but I ſpeake, the Lord ſpeaks not. If then the Lord nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake in perſon nor ſpeakes it now, the Apoſtle teſtifying both, it follows duely, that this can be no command. Forſooth the fear is, leaſt this not being a command, would prove an evangelic counſel, &amp; ſo make way for ſupererogations. As if the Apoſtle could not ſpeak his mind in things indifferent, as he doth in fowr or five ſeveral places of this chapter with the like preface of not commanding, but that the doubted inconvenience of ſupererogating muſt needs ruſh in. And how adds it to the word of the Lord, (for this alſo they object) when as the Apoſtle by his chriſtian prudence guids us in the liberty which God hath left us to, without command? could not the ſpirit of God inſtruct us by him what was free, as well as what was not? But what need I more, when <hi>Cameron</hi> an ingenuous writer, and in high eſteem, ſolidly confutes the ſurmiſe of a command heer, and among other words hath theſe. That <hi>when Paul ſpeaks as an Apoſtle, he uſes this forme,</hi> The Lord ſaith, not I v 10. <hi>but as a privat man he ſaith,</hi> I ſpeak, not the Lord. And thus alſo all the prime fathers <hi>Auſtin, Jerom,</hi> and the reſt underſtood this place.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, The very ſtating of the queſtion declares this to be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:123241:43"/>
                     <hi>If any brother hath an unbeleeuing wife, and ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</hi> For the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> does not imply only her being pleas'd to ſtay, but his being pleas'd to let her ſtay; it muſt be a conſent of them both. Nor can the force of this word be render'd leſs, without either much negligence or iniquity of him that otherwiſe tranſlates it. And thus the Greek Church alſo and their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods underſtood it, who beſt knew what their own language meant, as appeares by <hi>Matthaeus Monachus</hi> an author ſet forth by <hi>Leunclauius</hi> and of antiquity perhaps not inferior to <hi>Balſamon</hi> who writes upon the canons of the Apoſtles; this Author in his chap. <hi>that mariage is not to be made with heretics,</hi> thus recites the ſecond canon of the 6. Synod, <hi>As to the Corinthians Paul determins, If the beleeving wife choos to live with the unbeleeving husband, or the beleeving husband with the unbeleeving wife. Mark</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how the Apoſtle heer condeſcends, if the beleever pleaſe to dwell with the unbeleever; ſo that if he pleaſe not, out of doubt the mariage is diſſolv'd. And I am perſwaded it was ſo in the beginning, and thus preach't.</hi> And thereupon gives an example of one, who though not deſerted, yet by the decree of <hi>Theodotus</hi> the Patriarch divorc't an unbeleeving wife. What therefore depends in the plain ſtate of this queſtion on the conſent and well liking of them both, muſt not be a command. Lay next the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the 11. v, to the twelf (for wherefore els is Logic taught us) in a <hi>diſcrete axiom,</hi> as it can be no other by the phraſe, <hi>The Lord ſaith, let not the husband put away his wife, But I ſay let him not put away a misbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wife;</hi> this ſounds as if by the judgement of <hi>Paul,</hi> a man might put away any wife but the misbeleeving; or els the parts are not <hi>diſcrete,</hi> or <hi>diſſentanie,</hi> for both conclude not putting away, and conſequently in ſuch a form the propoſition is ridiculous. Of neceſſity therfore the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this ſentence muſt be conceav'd, as underſtood, and ſilently granted, that although the Lord command to divorce an infidel, yet I, not the Lord command you? No, but give my judgement, that for ſom evangelic reaſons a chriſtian may be permitted not to divorce her. Thus while we reduce the brevity of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to a plainer ſenſe, by the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſupply of that which was granted between him and the Corinthians, the very logic of his ſpeech extracts him confeſſing that the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand lay in a ſeeming contrariety to this his counſel: and that he meant not to thruſt out a command of the Lord by a new one of his own, as one nail drives another, but to releaſe us from the rigor of it, by the right of the Goſpel, ſo farre forth as a charitable cauſe leads us on in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:123241:44"/>
hope of winning another ſoule without the peril of looſing our own. For this is the glory of the Goſpel to teach us that <hi>the end of the commandment is charity,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. not the drudging out a poore and worthleſſe duty forc't from us by the taxe, and taile of ſo many letters. This doctrine therefore can bee no command, but it muſt contradict the moral law, the Goſpel, and the Apoſtle himſelfe both elſe where, and heere alſo eevn in the act of ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>If then it be no command, it muſt remain to be a permiſſion, and that not abſolute, for ſo it would be ſtill contrary to the law, but with ſuch a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as breaks not the law, but as the manner of the Goſpel is, fulfills it through charity. The law had two reaſons, the one was ceremonial, the pollution that all Gentiles were to the Jewes; this the viſion of <hi>Peter</hi> had aboliſht, Acts 10. and clens'd all creatures to the uſe of a Chriſtian. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> underſtood not this, but fear'd leſt dwelling in matrimony with an unbeleever, they were defil'd. The Apoſtle diſcuſſes that ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with an Evangelic reaſon, ſhewing them that although God hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the law, not intending the converſion of the Gentiles, except ſome ſpecial ones, held them as polluted things to the Jew, yet now pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to call them in, he hath purify'd them from that legal uncleanneſſe wherein they ſtood, to uſe and to be us'd in a pure manner.</p>
                  <p>For ſaith he, <hi>The unbeleeving husband is ſanctifi'd by the wife, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving wife, is ſanctifi'd by the husband, elſe were your children uncleane; but now they are holy.</hi> That is, they are ſanctify'd to you, from that legal impurity which you ſo feare; and are brought into a neer capacity to be holy, if they beleeve, and to have free acceſſe to holy things. In the mean time, as being Gods creatures, a chriſtian hath power to uſe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their proper uſe; in as much as now, <hi>all things to the pure are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pure.</hi> In this legal reſpect therefore ye need not doubt to continue in mariage with an unbeleever. Thus others alſo expound this place and <hi>Cameron</hi> eſpecially. This reaſon warrants us onely what wee may doe without feare of pollution, does not binde us that we muſt. But the other reaſon of the law to divorce an infidel was moral, the avoiding of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement from the true faith. This cannot ſhrink; but remains in as full force as ever, to ſave the actuall chriſtian from the ſnare of a misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever. Yet if a Chriſtian full of grace and ſpirituall gifts finding the misbeleever not frowardly affected, feares not a ſeducing, but hopes rather a gaining, who ſees not that this morall reaſon is not viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by not divorcing, which the law commanded to doe, but better ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:123241:44"/>
by the excellence of the Goſpel working through charity. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the faithfull is ſeduc't, and the unfaithfull is either ſav'd, or with all diſcharge of love, and evangelic duty ſought to be ſav'd. But contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if the infirme Chriſtian ſhall bee commanded here againſt his minde, againſt his hope, and againſt his ſtrength, to dwell with all the ſcandals, the houſhold perſecutions, or alluring temptations of an infidel, how is not the Goſpel by this made harſher then the law, and more yoaking? Therefore the Apoſtle ere he deliver this other reaſon why wee need not in all haſt put away an infidel, his mind miſgiving him leaſt he ſhould ſeem to be the impoſer of a new command, ſtaies not for method, but with an abrupt ſpeed inſerts the declaration of their liberty in this matter.</p>

                     <hi>[But if the unbeleeving depart.]</hi> This cannot be reſtrain'd to locall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture only; for who knows not that an offencive ſociety is worſe then a forſaking.

                     <hi>[But God hath called us to peace.]</hi> To peace, not to bondage, not to brabbles and contentions with him who is not pleas'd to live peaceably, as mariage and chriſtianity requires. And where ſtriſe ariſes from a cauſe hopeleſſe to be allayd, what better way to peace then by ſeparating that which is ill joyn'd. It is not divorce, that firſt breaks the peace of family, as ſom fondly comment on this place, but it is peace already brok'n, which, when other cures fail can only be reſtor'd to the faultles perſon by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary divorce. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> heer warrants us to ſeeke peace, rather then to remain in bondage. If God hath call'd us to peace, why ſhould we not follow him, why ſhould we miſerably ſtay in perpetual diſcord under a ſervitude not requir'd?</p>

                     <hi>[For what knoweſt thou O wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy husband, &amp;c.]</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> having thus clear'd himſelfe, not to goe about the mining of our chriſtian liberty, not <hi>to caſt a ſnare upon us,</hi> which to doe hee ſo much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, returnes now to the ſecond reaſon of that law to put away an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, for feare of ſeducement, which hee does not heer contradict with a command now to venture that; but if neither the infirmity of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, nor the ſtrength of the unbeleever be fear'd, but hopes appearing that he may be won, he judges it no breaking of that law, though the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever be permitted to forbeare divorce, and can abide, without the peril of ſeducement, to offer the charity of a ſalvation to wife or husband, which is the fulfilling, not the tranſgreſſing of that law; and well worth the undertaking with much hazard and patience. For what knoweſt thou whether thou ſhalt ſave thy wife, that is, till all meanes convenient and poſſible with diſcretion and probability, as human things are, have bin us'd. For Chriſt himſelfe ſends not our hope on pilgrimage to the worlds end; but ſets it bounds beyond which we need not wait on a brother, much leſſe on an infidell. If after ſuch a time we may count a profeſſing Chriſtian no better then a heathen, after leſs time perhaps wee may ceaſe to hope of a heathen, that hee will turne chriſtian. Otherwiſe, to binde us harder then the law, and tell us wee are not under bondage, is meere mockery. If till the unbeleever pleaſe to part, we may not ſtirre from the houſe of our bondage, then certain this our liberty is not grounded in the purchas of Chriſt, but in the pleaſure of a miſcreant. What knowes the loyal husband whether he may not ſave the adultereſſe, he is not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bound to receive her. What knowes the wife but ſhee may reclaim her husband who hath deſerted her? yet the reformed Churches doe not enjoyn her to wait longer then after the contempt of an Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:123241:45"/>
Summons. <hi>Beza</hi> himſelfe heer befriends us with a remarkable ſpeech, <hi>what could be firmly conſtituted in human matters if under pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting grace from aboue, it ſhould be never lawfull for us to ſeeke our right.</hi> And yet in other caſes not leſſe reaſonable to obtain a moſt juſt and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remedy by divorce he turnes the innocent party to a taske of prayers beyond the multitude of beads and <hi>roſaries,</hi> to beg the gift of chaſtity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of an injurious mariage. But the Apoſtle is evident anough, <hi>we are not under bondage,</hi> truſting that he writes to thoſe who are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what bondage is, to let ſupercilious determiners cheat them of their freedome. God hath call'd us to peace, and ſo doubtleſſe hath left in our hands how to obtaine it ſeaſonably; if it be not our own choiſe to ſit ever like novices wretchedly ſervile.</p>
                  <p>Thus much the Apoſtle on this queſtion between Chriſtian and Pagan, to us now of little uſe; yet ſuppoſing it written for our inſtruction as it may be rightly apply'd, I doubt not but that the difference between a true beleever and a heretic, or any one truely religious either deſerted or ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king divorce from any one grosſly erroneous or profane may be referr'd hither. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeaves us heer the ſolution not of this caſe only, which little concernes us, but of <hi>ſuch like caſes,</hi> which may occurr to us. For where the reaſons directly ſquare, who can forbid why the verdit ſhould not be the ſame? But this the common writers allow us not. And yet from this text which in plaine words gives liberty to none unleſſe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an infidel, they collect the ſame freedom though the deſertion bee not for religion, which, as I conceive, they neede not doe; but may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtraining reduce it to the cauſe of fornication. For firſt they confeſſe that deſertion is ſeldome without a juſt ſuſpition of adultery: next it is a breach of mariage in the ſame kind, and in ſome ſort worſe: for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry though it give to another, yet it bereaves not al; but the deſerter wholly denies all right, and makes one fleſh twain, which is counted the abſoluteſt breach of matrimony, and cauſes the other, as much as in him lies, to commit ſin, by being ſo left. Nevertheleſſe thoſe reaſons which they bring of eſtabliſhing by this place the like liberty from any deſertion, are faire and ſolid: and if the thing be lawfull, and can be prov'd ſo, more waies then one, ſo much the ſafer. Their arguments I ſhall heer recite, and that they may not com idle, ſhall uſe them to make good the like free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to divorce for other cauſes; and that we are no more under bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to any hainous default againſt the main ends of matrimony, then to a deſertion: Firſt they allege that to <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. 8. <hi>If any provide not for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:123241:46"/>
thoſe of his own houſe, hee hath deny'd the faith, and is worſe then an Infidel.</hi> But a deſerter, ſay they, <hi>can have no care of them who are most his owne, therefore the deſerted party is not leſſe to bee righted againſt ſuch a one then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an infidel.</hi> With the ſame evidence I argue, that man or wife who hates in wedloc, is perpetually unſociable, unpeacefull, or unduteous, either not being able, or not willing to performe what the maine ends of mariage demand in helpe and ſolace, cannot bee ſaid to care for who ſhou'd bee deareſt in the houſe; therefore is worſe then an infidel in both regards, either in undertaking a duty which he cannot performe, to the undeſerved and unſpeakable injury of the other party ſo defrauded and betrai'd, or not performing what he hath undertaken, whenas he may or might have, to the perjury of himſelfe more irreligious then heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme. The blameleſſe perſon therefore hath as good a plea to ſue out his delivery from this bondage, as from the deſertion of an infidel. Since moſt writers cannot but grant that deſertion is not only a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal abſence, but an intolerable ſociety; or if they grant it not, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> grant it, with all as much leave as they grant to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large a particular freedom from paganiſme, into a general freedom from any deſertion. Secondly, they reafon from the likenes of either fact, <hi>the ſame loſſe redounds to the deſerted by a chriſtian, as by an infidel, the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of temptation.</hi> And I in like manner affirme that if honeſt and free per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be allow'd to know what is moſt to their owne loſſe, the ſame loſſe and diſcontent, but worſe diſquiet with continuall miſery and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation reſides in the company, or better call'd the perſecution of an unfit, or an unpeaceable conſort, then by his deſertion. For then the deſerted may enjoy himſelfe at leaſt. And he who deſerts is more favourable to the party whom his preſence afflicts, then that importunat thing which is and will be ever converſant before the eyes a loyal and individual vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for thoſe who ſtill rudely urge it no loſs to mariage, no deſertion, ſo long as the fleſh is preſent and offers a benevolence that hates, or is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated, I am not of that vulgar and low perſwaſion, to thinke ſuch forc'd embracements as theſe worth the honour, or the humanity of mariage, but farre beneath the ſoul of a rational and freeborne man. Thirdly they ſay, <hi>it is not the infidelity of the deſerter, but the deſertion of the infidel from which the Apoſtle gives this freedom;</hi> and I joyne that the Apoſtle could as little require our ſubjection to an unfit and injurious bondage preſent, as to an infidel abſent. To free us from that which is an evil by being diſtant, and not from that which is an inmate, and in the boſome
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:123241:46"/>
evil, argues an improvident and careles deliverer. And thus all occaſions, which way ſo ever they turn, are not unofficious to adminiſter ſomthing which may conduce to explain, or to defend the aſſertion of this book touching divorce. I complain of nothing, but that it is indeed too copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be the matter of a diſpute, or a defence, rather to be yeelded, as in the beſt ages, a thing of common reaſon, not of controverſie. What have I left to ſay? I fear to be more elaborat in ſuch a perſpicuity as this; leſt I ſhould ſeem not to teach, but to upbraid the dulnes of an age; not to commun with reaſon in men, but to deplore the loſs of reaſon from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: this only, and not the want of more to ſay, is the limit of my diſcours.</p>

                  <p>Although teſtimony be in Logic an argument rightly call'd <hi>inartificial,</hi> &amp; doth not ſolidly fetch the truth by multiplicity of Authors, nor argue a thing falſe by the few that hold ſo, yet ſeeing moſt men from their youth ſo accuſtom, as not to ſcanne reaſon, nor cleerly to apprehend it, but to truſt for that the names and numbers of ſuch, as have got, and many times undeſervedly, the reputation among them to know much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a vulgar alſo of teachers, who are as blindly by whom they fancy led, as they lead the people, it will not be amiſs for them who had rather liſt themſelves under this weaker ſort, and follow authorities, to take notice that this opinion which I bring, hath bin favour'd, and by ſom of thoſe affirm'd, who in their time were able to carry what they taught, had they urg'd it, through all Chriſtendom; or to have left it ſuch a credit with all good men, as they who could not bouldly uſe the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, would have fear'd to cenſure it. But ſince by his appointment on whom the times and ſeaſons wait, every point of doctrin is not fatall to be throughly ſifted out in every age, it will be anough for me to find, that the thoughts of wiſeſt heads heertofore, and hearts no leſs reverenc't for devotion have tended this way, and contributed their lot in ſome good meaſure towards this which hath bin heer attain'd. Others of them and modern eſpecially, have bin as full in the aſſertion, though not ſo full in the reaſon; ſo that either in this regard, or in the former, I ſhall be manifeſt in a middle fortune to meet the praiſe or diſpraiſe of beeing

ſomthing firſt. But I deferr not what I undertooke to ſhew, that in the Church both primitive and reformed, the words of Chriſt have bin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to grant divorce for other cauſes then adultery; and that the word <hi>fornication</hi> in mariage hath a larger ſenſe then that commonly ſuppos'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> in his firſt Apology writt'n within 50. yeares after St. <hi>Iohn</hi> dy'd, relates a ſtory which <hi>Euſebius</hi> tranſcribes, that a certain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Rome, the wife of a vitious husband, her ſelfe alſo formerly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, but converted to the faith, and perſuading the ſame to her husband, at leſt the amendment of his wicked life, upon his not yeilding to her daily entreaties and perſuaſions in this behalf, procur'd by law to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc't from him. This was neither for adultery, nor deſertion, but as the relation ſaies, <hi>Eſteeming it an ungodly thing to be the conſort of bed with him, who againſt the law of nature and of right ſought out voluptuous waies.</hi> Suppoſe he endeavour'd ſom unnaturall abuſe, as the Greek admitts that meaning, it cannot yet be call'd adultery; it therefore could be thought worthy of divorce no otherwiſe then as equivalent, or wors; and other vices will appear in other reſpects as much divorſive. Next tis ſaid her freinds advis'd her to ſtay a while; and what reaſon gave they? not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they held unlawfull what ſhe purpos'd, but becauſe they thought ſhe might longer yet hope his repentance. She obey'd, till the man going to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and from thence reported to grow ſtill more impenitent, not for any adultery or deſertion, wherof neither can be gather'd, but, ſaith the <hi>Martyr,</hi> and ſpeaks it like one approving, <hi>leſt ſhe ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his unrighteous and ungodly deeds, remaining in wedloc, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of bed and board with ſuch a perſon, ſhe left him by a lawfull divorce.</hi> This cannot but give us the judgement of the Church in thoſe pure and next to Apoſtolic times. For how els could the woman have bin permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or heer not reprehended; and if a wife might then doe this without reprooff, a husband certainly might no leſs, if not more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the ſame age writing his 4. book againſt <hi>Marcion</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes <hi>that Chriſt by his anſwer to the Phariſes protected the conſtitution of Moſes as his own, and directed the inſtitution of the creator,</hi> for I alter not his <hi>Carthaginian</hi> phraſe; <hi>he excus'd rather then deſtroi'd the conſtitution of Moſes; I ſay he forbidd conditionally, if any one therefore put away that he may marry another: ſo that if he prohibited conditionally, then not wholly; and what he forbadd not wholly, he permitted otherwiſe, where the cauſe cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for which he prohibited:</hi> that is when a man makes it not the cauſe of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:123241:47"/>
his putting away, meerly that he may marry again. <hi>Chriſt teaches not contrary to Moſes, the juſtice of divorce hath Chriſt the aſſerter: he would not have mariage ſeparat, nor kept with ignominy, permitting then a divorce,</hi> and gueſſes that this vehemence of our Saviours ſentence was cheifly bent againſt <hi>Herod,</hi> as was cited before. Which leavs it evident how <hi>Tertullian</hi> interpreted this prohibition of our Saviour; for wheras the text is, <hi>Whoſoever putteth away and marieth another,</hi> wherfore ſhould <hi>Tertullian</hi> explain it, <hi>Whoſoever putteth away that he may marry another,</hi> but to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his opinion that our Saviour did not forbidd divorce from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy yoke, but forbidd the malice or the luſt of a needles change and cheifly thoſe plotted divorces then in uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> in the next century teſtifies to have known certain who had the government of Churches in his time, who permitted ſom to marry, while yet their former husbands liv'd, and excuſes the deed, as don <hi>not without cauſe, though without Scripture,</hi> which confirms that cauſe not to be adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; for how then was it againſt Scripture that they maried again. And a little beneath, for I cite his 7. homily on <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>To endure faults wors then adultery and fornication, ſeems a thing unreaſonable,</hi> and diſputes therfore that Chriſt did not ſpeak by <hi>way of precept, but as it were expounding.</hi> By which and the like ſpeeches <hi>Origen</hi> declares his mind farre from thinking that our Saviour confin'd all the cauſes of divorce to actual adultery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lactantius</hi> of the age that ſucceeded ſpeaking of this matter in the 6. of his <hi>inſtitutions,</hi> hath theſe words. <hi>But leſt any think he may circumſcribe divine precepts, let this be added, that all miſinterpreting, and occaſion of fraud, or death may be remov'd, he commits adultery who marries the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc't wife, and, beſides the crime of adultery, divorces a wife that he may marry another.</hi> To divorce and marry another, and to divorce that he may marry another, are two different things; and imply that <hi>Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> thought not this place the forbidding of all neceſſary divorce, but ſuch only as proceeded from the wanton deſire of a future chois, not from the burden of a preſent affliction.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Councel of <hi>Eliberis</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> decreed the husband excommunicat, <hi>If he kept his wife being an adultreſs; but if he left her, he might after ten yeares be receav'd into communion, if he retain'd her any while in his houſe after the adultery known.</hi> The councel of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> in the year 314. decreed, that if the wife of any <hi>Laic</hi> were convicted of adultery, that man could not be admitted into the miniſtery: if after ordination it
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:123241:48"/>
were committed, he was to divorce her; if not, he could not hold his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. The councel of <hi>Nantes</hi> condemn'd in 7. yeares penance the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that would reconcile with an adultreſs. But how proves this that other cauſes may divorce? it proves thus; there can be but two cauſes why theſe councels enjoyn'd ſo ſtrictly the divorſing of an adultreſs, either as an offender againſt God, or againſt the husband; in the latter reſpect they could not impoſe on him to divorce; for every man is the maiſter of his own forgivenes; who ſhal hinder him to pardon the injuries don againſt himſelf? It follows therfore that the divorce of an adultreſs was commanded by theſe three councels, as it was a ſin againſt God; and by all conſequence they could not but beleeve that other ſins as hainous might with equal juſtice be the ground of a divorce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baſil</hi> in his 73. rule, as <hi>Chamier</hi> numbers it, thus determins, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce ought not to be, unleſſe for adultery, <hi>or the hindrance to a godly life.</hi> What doth this but proclaime aloud more cauſes of divorce then adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if by other ſins beſides this, in wife or husband, the godlines of the better perſon may be certainly hinder'd, and endanger'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> no leſs ancient, writing againſt Heretics, &amp; therefore ſhould himſelf be orthodoxal above others, acquaints us in his ſecond book <hi>Tom.</hi> 1, not that his private perſuaſion was, but that the whole Church in his time generally thought other cauſes of divorce lawful beſides adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as comprehended under that name; If, ſaith he, <hi>a divorce happ'n for any cauſe either fornication, or adultery, or any hainous fault, the word of God blames not either the man or wife marrying again, nor cutts them off from the congregation, or from life, but beares with the infirmity; not that he may keep both wives, but that leaving the former he may be lawfully joyn'd to the latter, the holy word, and the holy Church of God commiſerates this man, eſpecially, if he be otherwiſe of good converſation, and live according to Gods law.</hi> This place is cleerer then expoſition, and needs no comment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ambroſe</hi> on the 16. of <hi>Luke,</hi> teaches <hi>that all wedloc is not Gods joyning</hi> and to the 19. of <hi>Pro.</hi> That a <hi>wife is prepard of the Lord,</hi> as the old latin tranſlates it, he anſwers that the ſeptuagint renders it, <hi>a wife is fitted by the Lord, and temper'd to a kind of harmony; and where that harmony is there God joyns; where it is not, there diſſention reigns, which is not from God, for God is love.</hi> This he brings to prove the marrying of Chriſtian with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to be no mariage, and conſequently divorc't without ſin: but he who ſees not this argument how plainly it ſerves to divorce any untunable, or unattonable matrimony, ſees little. On the 1 to the <hi>Cor,</hi> 7, he grants a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:123241:48"/>
may leave her husband not for only fornication, <hi>but for Apoſtacy, and inverting nature, though not marry again; but the man may:</hi> heer are cauſes of divorce aſſign'd other then adultery. And going on he affirms, <hi>that the cauſe of God is greater then the cauſe of matrimony; that the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of wedloc is not due to him who hates the author thereof; that no matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is firm without devotion to God; that diſhonour don to God acquitts the other being deſerted from the bond of matrimony; that the faith of mariage is not to be kept with ſuch.</hi> If theſe contorted ſentences be ought worth, it is not the deſertion that breaks what is broken, but the impiety; and who then may not for that cauſe better divorce, then tarry to be deſerted? or theſe grave ſayings of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> are but knacks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jerom</hi> on the 19. of <hi>Matthew</hi> explains, that for the cauſe of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the <hi>ſuſpicion thereof a man may freely divorce.</hi> What can breed that ſuſpicion, but ſundry faults leading that way? by <hi>Jeroms</hi> conſent therfore divorce is free not only for actuall adultery, but for any cauſe that may encline a wiſe man to the juſt ſuſpicion therof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> alſo muſt be remember'd among thoſe who hold that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance offornication gives equal inference to other faults equally hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for which to divorce: &amp; therfore in his books to <hi>Pollentius</hi> he diſputes that <hi>infidelity, as being a greater ſin then adultery, ought ſo much the rather cauſe a divorce.</hi> And on the Sermon in the Mount, under the name of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication will have <hi>idolatry, or any harmfull ſuperſtition</hi> contain'd, which are not thought to diſturb matrimony ſo directly as ſom other obſtinacies and diſſaffections, more againſt the daily duties of that cov'nant, &amp; in the eaſtern tongues not unfrequently call'd fornication, as hath bin ſhew'n. <hi>Hence is underſtood,</hi> faith he, <hi>that not only for bodily fornication, but for that which draws the mind from Gods law, and fouly corrupts it, a man may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault put away his wife, and a wife her husband, becauſe the Lord excepts the cauſe of fornication, which fornication we are conſtrain'd to interpret in a general ſenſe.</hi> And in the firſt book of his <hi>retractations</hi> chap. 16. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts not this his opinion, but commends it to ſerious conſideration; and explains that he counted not there all ſin to be fornication, but the more deteſtable ſort of ſins. The cauſe of fornication therefore is not in this diſcours newly interpreted to ſignify other faults infringing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of wedloc, beſides adultery.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly the councel of <hi>Agatba</hi> in the year 506. can. 25. decreed, that <hi>if lay men who divorc't without ſome great fault, or giving no probable cauſe, therfore divorc't, that they might marry ſom unlawfull perſon, or ſom other

mans, if before the provinciall Biſhops were made acquainted, or judgement paſt; they preſum'd this, excommunication was the penalty.</hi> Whence it followes, that if the cauſe of divorce were ſom great offence, or that they gave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable cauſes for what they did, and did not therefore divorce that they might preſume with ſom unlawfull perſon, or what was another mans, the cenſure of Church in thoſe daies did not touch them.</p>
                  <p>Thus having alleg'd anough to ſhew after what manner the primitive Church for above 500. yeares underſtood our Saviours words touching divorce, I ſhall now with a labour leſs diſperſt, and ſooner diſpatcht, bring under view what the civil law of thoſe times conſtituted about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I ſay the civil law, which is the honour of every true Civilian to ſtand for, rather then to count that for law, which the <hi>pontificiall</hi> Canon hath enthrall'd them to, and in ſtead of interpreting a generous and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant law, made them the drudges of a blockiſh <hi>Rubric.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> pious Emperors both, ordain'd that <hi>as by conſent lawfull mariages were made, ſo by conſent, but not without the bill of divorce, they might be diſſolv'd; and to diſſolve was the more difficult, onely in favour of the children.</hi> We ſee the wiſedome and piety of that age one of the pureſt and learnedeſt ſince Chriſt, conceav'd no hindrance in the words of our Saviour, but that a divorce mutually conſented, might bee ſuffer'd by the law, eſpecially if there were no children, or if there were, carefull proviſion was made. And further ſaith that law (ſuppoſing there wanted the conſent of either) <hi>wee deſigne the cauſes of divorce by this moſt wholſom law; for as we forbid the diſſolving of mariage without juſt cauſe, ſo we deſire that a husband or a wife diſtreſt by ſom advers neceſſity, ſhould be freed, though by an unhappy, yet a neceſſary releefe.</hi> What dramm of wiſedome, or religion (for charity is trueſt religion) could there be in that knowing age, which is not virtually ſumm'd up in this moſt juſt law? As for thoſe other Chriſtian Emperours, from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt of them, finding thé Roman law in this point ſo anſwerable to the Moſaic, it might bee the likelieſt cauſe why they alter'd nothing to reſtraint, but if ought, rather to liberty, for the helpe, and conſideration of the weaker ſexe, according as the Goſpel ſeems to make the wife more equal to her husband in theſe conjugal reſpects then the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth. Therefore <hi>if a man were abſent from his wife foure yeares, and in that ſpace not heard of, though gon to warre in the ſervice of the Empire,</hi> ſhe might divorce, and mary another by the edict of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to <hi>Dalmatius. Co. l.</hi> 5. <hi>tit.</hi> 17. And this was an age of the Church both antient, and cry'd up ſtill for the moſt flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:123241:49"/>
in knowledge and pious government ſince the Apoſtles. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to this law of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> with this obſervation by the way, that ſtill as the Church corrupted, as the Clergie grew more ignorant, and yet more uſurping on the Magiſtrate, who alſo now declin'd, ſo ſtill divorce grew more reſtrain'd; though certainly if better times permitted the thing that worſe times reſtrain'd, it would not weakly argue that the permiſſion was better, and the reſtraint worſe. This law therefore of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi> wiſer in this then the moſt of his ſucceſſors though not wiſer then God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> reduc't the cauſes of divorce to a certain number which by the judiciall law of God, and all recorded humanitie were left before to the breſt of each husband, provided that the diſmiſſe was not without reaſonable conditions to the wife. But this was a reſtraint not yet come to extreames. For beſides adultery and that not only actual, but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by many ſignes there ſet down, any fault equally puniſhable with adultery, or equally infamous might bee the cauſe of a divorce. Which informes us how the wiſeſt of thoſe ages underſtood that place in the Goſpel, whereby, not the pilfering of a benevolence was conſider'd as the main and only breach of wedloc, as is now thought, but the breach of love and peace, a more holy union then that of the fleſh; and the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an honeſt perſon was regarded, not to bee held in bondage with one whoſe ignominy was infectious. To this purpoſe was conſtituted <hi>Cod. l.</hi> 5. <hi>tit.</hi> 17. and <hi>Authent. collat.</hi> 4. <hi>tit.</hi> 1. <hi>Novell.</hi> 22. where <hi>Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> added three cauſes more. In the 117. <hi>Novell.</hi> moſt of the ſame cauſes are allow'd, but the liberty of divorcing by conſent is repeal'd: but by whom? by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> not a wiſer, not a more religious emperor then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the former, but noted by judicious writers for his fickle head in making and unmaking lawes; and how <hi>Procopius</hi> a good hiſtorian, and a counſelor of ſtate then living deciphers him in his other actions, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly omitt. Nor was the Church then in better caſe, but had the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of a 100. declining yeare ſwept on it, when the ſtatute of <hi>conſent</hi> was call'd in; which as I ſaid, gives us every way more reaſon to ſuſpect this reſtraint, more then that liberty: which therfore in the reign of <hi>Justin</hi> the ſucceeding Emperor was recall'd, <hi>Novel.</hi> 140. &amp; eſtabliſht with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face more wiſe &amp; chriſtianly then for thoſe times, declaring the neceſſity to reſtore that <hi>Theodoſian</hi> law, if no other meanes of reconcilement could be found. And by whom this law was abrogated, or how long after, I doe not finde; but that thoſe other cauſes remain'd in force, as long as the Greek empire ſubſiſted, and were aſſented by that Church, is to bee read

in the Canons and edicts compar'd by <hi>Photius</hi> the Patriarch, with the avertiments of <hi>Balſamon,</hi> and <hi>Matthaeus Monachus</hi> thereon.</p>
                  <p>But long before thoſe dayes <hi>Leo</hi> the ſon of <hi>Baſilius, Macedo</hi> reigning about the yeare 886. and for his excellent wiſdome ſurnam'd the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> conſtituted <hi>that in caſe of madneſſe the husband might divorce after three yeares, the wife after</hi> 5. <hi>Conſtitut.

But if we reſpect this in matrimony, that it be contracted to the good of both, how ſhall he, who for ſome great evil feard, perſwades not to marry though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, not perſwade to unmarry, if after marriage a calamity befall? ſhould we bid beware least any fall into an evil, and leave him helpleſſe who by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane error is fall'n therein? This were as if we ſhould uſe remedies to prevent a diſeaſe, but let the ſick die without remedy.</hi> The reſt will be worth reading in the author.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have the judgement firſt of primitive fathers; next of the imperial law not diſallow'd by the univerſal Church in ages of her beſt authority; and laſtly of the whole Greeke Church and civil ſtate, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating their Canons and edicts together, that divorce was lawfull for other cauſes equivalent to adultery, contain'd under the word fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that the expoſition of our ſaviours ſentence heer alleg'd hath all theſe ancient and great aſſerters, is therefore neither new nor licentious, as ſome now would perſwade the commonalty; although it be neerer truth that nothing is more new then thoſe teachers themſelves, &amp; nothing more licentious then ſome known to be, whoſe hypocriſie yet ſhames not to take offence at this doctrine for licence; when as indeed they feare it would remove licence, and leave them but few companions.</p>

reſtriction of divorce need not be ſo deere to us, ſince the plauſible reſtraining of that, was in a manner the firſt looſning of Antichriſt; and as it were the ſubſtance of his eldeſt horn. Nor doe we leſs remarkably ow the firſt meanes of his fall heer in <hi>England</hi> to the contemning of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint by <hi>Henry</hi> 8. whoſe divorce he oppos'd. Yet was not that rigour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted anciently in ſpiritual Courts untill <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, who trod upon the neck of <hi>Frederic Barbaroſſa</hi> the Emperor, and ſummond our <hi>Henry</hi> 2. into <hi>Normandy</hi> about the death of <hi>Becket.</hi> He it was, that the worthy author may be known, who firſt actually repeal'd the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial law of divorce, and decreed this tyranous decree, that matrimony for no cauſe ſhould be diſolv'd, though for many cauſes it might ſeparate; as may be ſeen <hi>decret, Gregor. l.</hi> 4. <hi>tit.</hi> 19. and in other places of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Tomes. The main good of which invention, wherein it conſiſts who can tell? but that it hath one vertue incomparable, to fill all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom with whordomes, and adulteries beyond the art of <hi>Balaams</hi> or of divells. Yet neither can theſe, though ſo perverſe, but acknowledge that the words of Chriſt under the name of fornication allow putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for other cauſes then adultery both from <hi>bed and bord,</hi> but not from the <hi>bond;</hi> their only reaſon is, becauſe mariage they beleeve to bee a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But our Divines who would ſeem long ſince to have renounc'd that reaſon, have ſo forgot them ſelves, as yet to hold the abſurdity, which but for that reaſon, unleſſe there be ſome myſtery of Satan in it, perhaps the Papiſt would not hold. Tis true, we grant divorce for actual &amp; prov'd adultery, and not for leſſe then many tedious and unreparable yeares of deſertion, wherein a man ſhall looſe all his hope of poſterity, which great and holy men have bewail'd, ere he can be righted; and then perhaps on the confines of his old age, when all is not worth the while. But grant this were ſeaſonably don; what are theſe two caſes to many other, which afflict the ſtate of mariage as bad, and yet find no redreſſe? What hath the ſoule of man deſerv'd, if it be in the way of ſalvation, that it ſhould be morgag'd thus, and may not redeem it ſelfe according to conſcience out of the hands of ſuch ignorant and ſlothfull teachers as theſe, who are neither able nor mindful to give due tendance to that pretious cure which they raſhly vndertake; nor have in them the noble goodneſſe to conſider theſe diſtreſſes and accidents of mans life; but are bent rather to fill their mouthes with Tithe and oblation. Yet if they can learne to follow, as well as they can ſeeke to be follow'd, I ſhall direct them to a faire num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of renowned men, worthy to be their leaders, who will commend to them a doctrin in this point wiſer then their own, and if they bee not-impatient,

                     <hi>Felix Bidenbachius</hi> an eminent Divine in the Dutchy of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi> affirmes <hi>that the obſtinat refuſal of conjugal due is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cauſe of divorce,</hi> and gives an inſtance <hi>that the conſiſtory of that ſtate ſojudg'd.</hi>

                     <hi>Beza</hi> one of the ſtricteſt againſt divorce, denies it not <hi>for danger of life from a Heretic,</hi> or <hi>importunat ſolicitation to doe ought againſt religion:</hi> and counts it <hi>all one whether the heretic deſert, or would ſtay upon intolerable conditions.</hi> But this deciſion well examin'd will be found of no ſolidity. For <hi>Beza</hi> would be askt why, if God ſo ſtrictly exact our ſtay in any kind of wedloc, wee had not better ſtay and hazard a murdering for Religion at the hand of a wife, or husband, as he and others enjoyn us to ſtay and venture it for all other cauſes but that? and why a mans life is not as well and warrantably ſav'd by divorcing from an orthodox murderer, as a heretical? Againe, if deſertion be confeſt by him to conſiſt not only in the forſaking, but in the unſufferable conditions of ſtaying, a man may as well deduce the lawfulneſſe of divorcing from any intolerable conditions (if his grant bee good that wee may divorce thereupon from a heretic) as he can deduce it lawfull to divorce from any deſerter, by finding it lawful to divorce from a deſerting infidel. For this is plaine, if Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> permiſſion to divorce an infidel deſerter, inferre it lawfull for any malicious deſertion, then doth <hi>Beza's</hi> definition of a deſerter transferr it ſelfe with like facility from the cauſe of religion to the cauſe of malice, and proves it as good to divorce from him who intolerably ſtayes as from him who purpoſely departs; and leaves it as lawfull to depart from him who urgently requires a

wicked thing, though profeſſing the ſame religion, as from him who urges a heatheniſh or ſuperſtitious compliance in a different faith. For if there be ſuch neceſſity of our abiding, wee ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to abide the utmoſt for religion then for any other cauſe; ſeeing both the cauſe of our ſtay is pretended our religion to mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the cauſe of our ſuffering is ſuppos'd our conſtant mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to religion. <hi>Beza</hi> therfore by his owne definition of a deſerter juſtifies a divorce from any wicked or intolerable conditions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame religion then in a different.</p>

                     <hi>Aretius</hi> a famous Divine of <hi>Bern</hi> approves many cauſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce in his <hi>Problemes,</hi> and adds <hi>that the lawes and conſiſtories of Swizzerland approve them alſo.</hi> As firſt, <hi>adultery, and that not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al only, but intentional,</hi> all eging <hi>Matthew</hi> the fifth, <hi>Whoſoever looketh to luſt, hath committed adultery already in his heart. Wher by</hi> ſaith he, <hi>our Saviour ſhewes that the breach of matrimony may be not only by outward act, but by the heart and deſire; when that hath once poſſeſt, it renders the converſation intolerable, and commonly the fact followes.</hi> Other cauſes to the number of 9. or 10. conſenting in moſt with the imperial lawes, may bee read in the author himſelfe, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrs them <hi>to be grave and weighty.</hi> All theſe are men of name in Divinity, and to theſe if need were, might be added more. Nor have the Civilians bin all ſo blinded by the Canon, as not to avouch the juſtice of thoſe old permiſſions touching divorce.</p>

                  <p>Theſe authorities without long ſearch I had to produce, all excellent men, ſom of them ſuch as many ages had brought forth none greater: almoſt the meaneſt of them might deſerve to obtain credit in a ſingularity; what might not then all of them joyn'd in an opinion ſo conſonant to reaſon? For although ſom ſpeak of this cauſe, others of that, why divorce may be, yet all agreeing in the neceſſary enlargement of that textual ſtraitnes, leave the matter to equity, not to literal bondage, and ſo the opinion cloſes. Nor could I have wanted more teſtimonies, had the cauſe needed a more ſollicitous enquiry. But herein the ſatisfaction of others hath bin ſtudied, not the gaining of more aſſurance to mine own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion: although authorities contributing reaſon withall, bee a good confirmation and a welcom. But God, I ſolemnly atteſt him, with held from my knowledge the conſenting judgement of theſe men ſo late, untill they could not bee my inſtructers, but only my unexpected witneſſes to partial men, that in this work I had not given the worſt experiment of an induſtry joyn'd with integrity and the free utterance though of an unpopular truth. Which yet to the people of <hi>England</hi> may, if God ſo pleaſe, prove a memorable informing; certainly a benefit which was intended them long ſince by men of higheſt repute for wiſedome &amp; piety <hi>Bucer &amp; Eraſmus.</hi> Only this one autority more, whether in place or out of place, I am not to omitt; which if any can think a ſmall one, I muſt bee pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

it is no ſmaller then the whole aſſembl'd autority of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> both Church and State; and in thoſe times which are on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for the pureſt and ſincereſt that ever ſhon yet on the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this Iland, the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. That worthy Prince having utterly aboliſht the Canon Law out of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as his Father did before him, appointed by full vote of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, a Committy of two and thirty choſen men, Divines and Lawyers, of whom <hi>Cranmer</hi> the Archbiſhop, <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Walter Haddon,</hi> (not without the aſſiſtance of Sir <hi>John Cheeke</hi> the Kings Tutor a man at that time counted the learnedeſt of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; for piety not inferior) were the cheif, to frame anew ſom Eccleſiaſtical Laws, that might be in ſtead of what was abrogated. The work with great diligence was finiſht, and with as great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of that reforming age was receav'd; and had bin doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as the learned Preface thereof teſtifies, eſtabliſht by Act of Parlament, had not the good Kings death ſo ſoon enſuing, arreſted the furder growth of Religion alſo, from that ſeaſon to this. Thoſe laws, thus founded on the memorable wiſedome and piety of that religious Parlament and Synod, allow divorce and ſecond mariage <hi>not only for adultery or deſertion, but for any capital cnmity or plot laid againſt the others life, and likewiſe for evil and fierce uſage?</hi> nay the 12. Chap. of that title by plaine conſequence declares, <hi>that leſſer contentions, if they be perpetual, may obtaine divorce:</hi> which is all one really with the poſition by me held in the former treatiſe publiſht on this argument, herein only differing that there the cauſe of perpetual ſtrife was put for example in the unchangeable diſcord of ſom natures; but in theſe lawes intended us by the beſt of our anceſtors, the effect of continual ſtrife is determin'd no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt plea of divorce, whether the cauſe be naturall or wilfull.

Hence forth let them who condemn the aſſertion of this book for new and licentious, be ſorry; leſt, while they think to be of the graver ſort, and take on them to be teachers, they expoſe themſelves rather to be pledg'd up and down by men who intimatly know them, to the diſcovery and contempt of their ignorance and preſumption.</p>
