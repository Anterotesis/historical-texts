            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But all mans Faculties, yea thoſe of <hi>Reaſon, Conſideration, Science,</hi> &amp;c. all that diſtinguiſh Man from a Beaſt, are augmented by Learning, Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. leſſened by negligence, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. and quite nullified by mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</p>

               <p>If this ſuffice not, I adde, that an effect is by paſſion from the cauſe, as motion cannot be without paſſion from that which moveth: for take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cauſe, and the motion ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>tolle cauſam, tollitur effectus:</hi> Therefore quickneſs of wit cannot be without paſſion from heat &amp; drineſs: for over-power that hot and dry braine with moyſture and coldneſs, as may be with <hi>Opium,</hi> and the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and drineſs thereof ceaſeth, and dulneſs followeth.</p>
               <p>Further, even from my Oppoſites Aſſertions, I prove this Soule they ſo talke on, to be elemental, as <hi>Woolnor</hi> &amp; others, who aſcribe unto it an <hi>Aeriall Body:</hi> For whatſoever is <hi>Aeriall</hi> is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, elſe could it not be <hi>Aeriall:</hi>

               <p>And further, experience tells us; If the former <hi>Brain-pan</hi> be hurt, the <hi>Senſes</hi> are hindered, but the <hi>Cogitation</hi> remaineth ſound.</p>
               <p>If onely the <hi>Middle-pan</hi> be harmed, the <hi>Cogitation</hi> is maimed; but the <hi>Seat of Senſe</hi> keepes all the <hi>five Senſes</hi> whole: If any hurt befall both to the <hi>Former</hi> and <hi>Middle-pan,</hi> both <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Cogitation</hi> decay</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Hinder-pan</hi> be diſordered onely, the <hi>Memorie</hi> alone, and neither <hi>Senſe</hi> nor <hi>Cogitation</hi> receive harme.</p>
               <p>So that in veritie, Man is but a Creature whoſe ſeveral parts and members are endowed with proper natures or Faculties, each ſubſervient to other, to make him a living Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

Creature; whoſe degrees or excellences of natural Faculties make him in his kind more excellent then the Beaſts: So that though <hi>Parey</hi> and others do ſo excellently ſet forth his ſeveral endowments, or properties of his ſeveral members, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that thoſe Faculties together are a Being of themſelves immortal: For as the members cannot be perfect members without them, ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be faculties without their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and ſeparation cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſtruction of both: As attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or heat is the propertie of fire, which cannot be, if fire ceaſe; nor fire be, if it ceaſe: and as well may we ſay the heat of the fire continueth, after the fire is dead out, as thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties when their Body is dead: for ſpoile one, ſpoile both; kill one, kill both; this is in that, and that is in this: The <hi>Form</hi> is ſo in the <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Matter</hi> ſo in the <hi>Form,</hi> as thereby, and not elſe, is an <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> or <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Entitie</hi>: And their <hi>Being</hi> is in this <hi>Union,</hi> and their <hi>Union</hi> is in this <hi>Being:</hi> So that, take away <hi>Form,</hi> and

               <p>But ſuppoſe on the contrary, <hi>one</hi> could conſiſt without the <hi>other,</hi> as they ſay the <hi>Soul</hi> can without the <hi>Body</hi>; then <hi>one</hi> may be generated without the <hi>other, Soul</hi> without <hi>Body,</hi> and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their prepoſterous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, it is not unnatural for a Woman to bring forth a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that hath neither fleſh, blood nor bones, inſtead of a Child.</p>
               <p>Or if <hi>one Be</hi> without the <hi>other,</hi> as <hi>Form</hi> without <hi>Matter; Maſſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> without the <hi>Facultie conceptive</hi>: then ſhould all corpulent Subſtances be as infinite as God, without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

and <hi>Be</hi> of themſelves, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Gods: But I hope all grant both impoſſible: Therefore they muſt as well <hi>end</hi> together, as <hi>begin</hi> together; and <hi>begin</hi> together as <hi>end</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Moreover, experience further tels us, that they neither can <hi>Be,</hi> nor conſiſt without other: For if Nature be deprived more or leſs in her work of conception, of her due, (her <hi>Forms</hi> or conceptions being by her power <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative</hi> or conceptive, or her Formed <hi>Faculties</hi> by her Facultive <hi>Formes</hi>) her Effect is accordingly: If membrally impedited, a membral impediment; if totally impedited, a total fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> in <hi>Both</hi>: For he that is borne without any member, hath neither <hi>Form</hi> nor <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> thereof at all; or with any membral imperfection, that part hath not its perfection either of <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Facultie:</hi> ſo cometh it that ſome are <hi>borne Fooles,</hi> and never can be wiſe: Therefore their original <hi>Being</hi> muſt be together. And that their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end is together, we ſee, that the <hi>Eye</hi> is no <hi>Eye</hi> without the <hi>Sight</hi>; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39354:9"/>
                  <hi>Sight</hi> no <hi>Sight</hi> without the <hi>Eye:</hi> and ſo of all the other <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Faculies e minore ad majus.</hi> Wherefore, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bral perfection is not ſo much in <hi>ſhape</hi> as in <hi>virtue</hi>; and <hi>virtual perfection</hi> not ſo much in Maſſe as in due <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and both joyntly make <hi>natural perfection,</hi> which is the gift of <hi>God,</hi> or Natures general <hi>inſtinct:</hi> So, as one can by no means <hi>be</hi> without the other, ſo one cannot <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For could there be a <hi>Facultive ſubſiſtence</hi> (as that of the Soul is made) without its body; then a man might live when his head were cut off.</p>
               <p>Further, this <hi>Facultive</hi> Gift, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures endowment, can no more be ſaid to be a ſubſiſtent living Spirit, without its Receptacle, then the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames without the Sun, which are the gift or propertie of the Sun.

without <hi>God</hi> be ſo many ſeveral <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>; for in that ſence they are not communications, but abſolute <hi>Beings of themſelves</hi>; for betwixt <hi>Facultie</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> is a <hi>Relation</hi> to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as betwixt <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> to <hi>Fatherhood</hi>; neither without other, nor it without both: and to ſay not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as this fancy of the <hi>Soul</hi> importeth, that there may be a <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Subſiſtance</hi> without its <hi>Subject</hi>; then Natures ſeveral <hi>Faculties</hi> muſt not be the ſeveral communications of <hi>One Being,</hi> but ſo many abſolute irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>Beings of themſelves:</hi> So that this Doctrine of the <hi>Soul</hi> implyeth, no <hi>God</hi>; if a <hi>God,</hi> ſo many ſeveral <hi>Gods</hi> as <hi>Faculties:</hi> and if but <hi>ONE,</hi> then it <hi>chops</hi> that <hi>ONE ſmaller then herbs to the pot:</hi> Therefore <hi>Facultie</hi> ceaſeth with its <hi>Subject,</hi> or with the <hi>Subject</hi> God <hi>gathereth to himſelf</hi> the <hi>power,</hi> and yet his <hi>power</hi> no more by <hi>retraction,</hi> then leſs before by <hi>communication</hi>; and ſo but <hi>One Being,</hi> in whom all things <hi>are,</hi> or one <hi>Ens Entium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, thoſe ſeveral <hi>Faculties</hi> cannot be united or comprehended
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39354:10"/>
in one <hi>body,</hi> but by the ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame <hi>body</hi>; for we ſee, if the member decay, the <hi>Facultie</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes: Therefore their unite ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance muſt be terminated <hi>membrally</hi> in the <hi>body:</hi> And if it were poſſible they could ſubſiſt, ſeparated from their members; then in that ſeparation their <hi>Being</hi> could not be conjunct or <hi>unite,</hi> for want of that which tyed them together, <hi>the ſeveral members:</hi> And ſo, if any <hi>Being,</hi> ſo many ſeveral <hi>Beings</hi> as ſeveral <hi>Faculties:</hi> if any <hi>Soul,</hi> ſo many ſeveral <hi>Souls:</hi> a <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticke Soul,</hi> a <hi>Rational Soul,</hi> a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative Soul,</hi> a <hi>Seeing Soul,</hi> a <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul,</hi> a <hi>Smelling Soul,</hi> a <hi>Taſting Soul,</hi> a <hi>Touching Soul</hi>; with divers other <hi>Souls</hi> of all ſorts and ſizes.</p>
               <p>And further, that thoſe <hi>Faculties</hi> are thus in their <hi>Subjects,</hi> and are not without them, (as <hi>accidens non eſt ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi in ſubjecto,</hi>) we ſee, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and grow with their <hi>Subjects,</hi> and perfect together: For a Child is totally proportionated (as <hi>Adam</hi> when <hi>God formed</hi> him of the Earth) before the <hi>vitall Facultie</hi> be actual,

                  <hi>Major</hi> proved two ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt,</p>
               <p>If that which is matter, be not compounded of the four elements, then that which is no matter muſt be compounded of them, elſe no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition at all; and beſides the four elements, there is nothing elſe to compound with, or to make this or that matter or thing of.</p>
               <p>But no matter is uncapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for of nothing comes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</p>
               <p>Therefore, that which is matter, is compounded of the four ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Secondly,</p>
               <p>If matter created be not Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, then the Heavens and the Earth, with the things therein contained, which are infallibly <hi>Matter Created,</hi> are void of the elemental properties, to wit, heavineſs, lightneſs, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39354:14"/>
thinneſs; heat, coldneſs; moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, dryneſs.</p>
               <p>But experience teacheth, that the Heaven and the earth, with the things therein contained, are not void of thoſe properties, but are eſſentially conſiſtent thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Matter created muſt needs be elementary.</p>
               <p>And ſo whole man being matter created, is elemental, finite, and mortal: and ſo ceaſeth from the time of the grave, till the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Argument diſproving any actual immortality to be in fallen Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be an immortal Soul (as is imagined) in man, then it muſt be neither hot nor dry, nor cold nor moyſt; neither thick nor thin, nor heavy nor light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all ſuch compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in fallen nature, are mortal and finite, (as before proved,) for they are elemental.</p>
               <p>But every thing in nature muſt be one or ſome of thoſe, or all thoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for in nature nothing can be, but it muſt be hot or dry, cold or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39354:14"/>
moyſt, thick or thin, heavy or light; for of thoſe radical Qualities the whole creation conſiſteth: that is not a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is not compoſed thereof. If there can be any thing in Nature void of thoſe qualities, let it be named, where it is, how it can be, what and whereof it is, and that ſhall be called the immortal Soul; but ſuch a thing to be in nature, is paſt Imagination, yea, abſolutely impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Therefore, no immortality in fallen man: as he is wholly elemental, ſo is he wholly diſſoluble: Every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement returnes to its Centre; his earthly part unto the earth, his moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture or watery part unto the water; his warmth or firy part, to the ſeat of fire, his airy part unto the air: and thus the compoſition Man returneth to his ſimples, and ſo ceaſeth from his Being; and is become as before that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or elemental conception: Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how it was before he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, conceived, or born; and even ſo is it with him when he is dead: for as before his conception, he was in his elements; even ſo after his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39354:15"/>
death he returneth to the ſame, and hath no more being, nor otherwiſe, after death, then before life: and ſo there is no more time to him after his death to the Reſurrection, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſition of his elements, then there was to him from the creation to his birth, which is none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is not partly immortal as well as mortal, doth ceaſe from life or Being from the time of the grave till the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>But man is not partly immortal as well as mortal.</p>
               <p>Ergo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minor</hi> proved.</p>
               <p>That which is partly immortal, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortal, hath two lifes or Beings.</p>
               <p>But man hath not two beings or lifes.</p>
               <p>Therefore, man is not partly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, partly mortal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> proved, and firſt the <hi>Major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If that which is partly mortal, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immortal, have not two lifes or Beings, then that being muſt be all a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39354:15"/>
mortal being [and then whole man dies] or elſe all an immortal being, [&amp; then whole man lives for ever] or elſe his fleſh is no more part of him, then a tree is part of an houſe; and ſo when the Heads-man chopt off the Biſhop of <hi>Caterburies</hi> head, he cut off no part of the man:</p>
               <p>Therefore, man muſt either be all mortal, or all immortall; or that which is partly mortal, partly immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, muſt have two beings or lifes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minor</hi> proved, to wit, that man hath not two lifes or beings.</p>
               <p>If there be two diſtinct lifes or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in man, then one creature is two creatures; for the diſtinction of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is the diſtinction of creatures.</p>
               <p>But for one creature to be two creatures, is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> there cannot be two beings in man.</p>
               <p>That the diſtinction of beings is the diſtinction of creatures, I prove thus.</p>
               <p>If the diſtinction of beings be not the diſtinction of creatures, then a man is a Bull, a Beare, a Lion, a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39354:16"/>
Dragon, &amp;c. yea, all things is one thing, and one thing is all things.</p>
               <p>But man is not a Bull, a Bear, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. Therefore, the diſtinction of Beings is the diſtinction of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The conſequence proved.</p>
               <p>If my being did not diſtinguiſh me from an owl and a woodcock, and thy being the ſame; then an owl and a woodcock were both writer and reader.</p>
               <p>But an owl and a woodcock is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writer nor reader:</p>
               <p>Therefore the diſtinction of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings muſt needs be the diſtinction of creatures.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is impoſſible for one man to have two Beings, except one man be two men. Therefore, if he have not two beings, he hath either none, or but one; and if but one, that muſt be all mortall, or all immortal: For contraryes cannot poſſibly be in one object. Now if he be all mortal, then he muſt all die; if all immortal, then he muſt all live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but our dying natures witneſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39354:16"/>
againſt that: therefore this muſt be the ſum of all, That whole man is mortal.</p>
               <p>Therefore well ſaies <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Anima,</hi> that the Soul and Body of man are both one; which, ſaith Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Marcellina</hi> and <hi>Anapſychia,</hi> was the opinion of the greateſt part of the Weſterne Churches. And Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> in his four Books of the original of Souls, leaves the queſtion undecid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; neither dares he raſhly determine any thing. And his ſecond Book of Retractions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 56. doth witneſs that he continued in that opinion to his death.</p>

               <head>Chap. II. Conſiderations from the Creation, Fall, and Reſurrection of man, diſproving the Opinion of the Soul, imagining the better part of man immortal; and proving him, as a reaſonable creature, wholly mortal.</head>
               <p>HAving had ſome conſideration concerning the ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in hand, from the Dictates of Nature and Reaſon; let us repair to the unerring rule of the Scriptures, to ſee how this mortality is either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or diſproved thereby.</p>
               <p>And firſt, we may conſider that the Scripture ſaith, that when God had molded, formed, and compleatly proportionated <hi>Adam of the duſt of the ground, he breathed in his face the breath of life, and man became a living Soul,</hi> Gen. 2.7. Here, firſt, we are to conſider that we are not to ſpeak of Man, as the title or word man may
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39354:17"/>
be aſcribed to the humane ſhape or carcaſſe, as in this place it ſeemeth it is, by way of diſtinction from other forms; but of ſuch an humane ſhape or carcaſſe as is a living ſoul: and ſo alwayes when we ſpeak or treat of man in this point of difference, we are not to mean his carcaſe in humane form or ſhape onely, but as he is a rational living ſoul in that form, and ſo call'd man: for the text aſcribeth the title of <hi>Man</hi> to him, both before and after the breathing in his face the breath of life; and man became a living Soul: therefore that living Soul was Man. That which was formed or made of the earth, became a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul, or creature, by the breathing [or communicating] the breath of life [a communicative rational, Faculty, or property of life in his kinde.] That liveleſs Lumpe became a living ſoul; and not ſuch a living ſoul, another creature, a diſtinct being of it ſelf, was infuſed into that formed matter, that had its Being before that Infuſion, and can be when the body ceaſeth, as is vulgarly ſuppoſed. That which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39354:18"/>
was breathed before it was breathed, was not a living ſoul; but that which was breathed upon, became the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul; no living ſoul was aſcribed to man, before that: ſo that man was formed, and man became a living ſoul, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 Cor. 15.45. <hi>The firſt man Adam was made a living Soul,</hi> which was his natural body, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. of whom was the woman, both innocent, free from ſin, and ſo from <hi>Death</hi> and mortality: For <hi>the wages of Sin is Death, Romans</hi> 6.23. therefore before ſin there could be no death; but <hi>as by one man ſin entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</hi> even <hi>ſo death by ſin,</hi> Rom. 5.12. and <hi>by the offence of one man, Judgement came upon all men unto death,</hi> verſ. 18. and 1 Cor. 15.21. <hi>by man came death:</hi> therefore man was created free from the power of death, ſo to continue; but in the day he did eat the forbidden fruit, he became mortal: and as he was made a living ſoul, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. ſo by tranſgreſſion a dying ſoul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17 that is, <hi>in dying to die</hi>; or by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming mortal, be diſſolved, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39354:18"/>
to what he was, <hi>the duſt, Gen.</hi> 3.19. namely, his Elements. Thus Man was gloriouſly immortal, yet no longer a Creature incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, then during innocent: For (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.) God ſaid, <hi>Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thou ſhalt ſurely dye</hi>; or, <hi>dying thou ſhalt die:</hi> that is, thy immortality ſhall be changed for mortality: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be made mortal; not apart of thee, but <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye, even whole man, without the leaſt exception of any, the worſt or nobleſt part of him, unleſs God had a mental reſervation: but even the ſame <hi>Thou</hi> that liveſt, <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt ſurely die: <hi>that muſt die wherein was life</hi>: then ſurely if he had an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul, which is the life of the body, that muſt be made mortal. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all which, is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That what of</hi> Adam <hi>was immortal through Innocency, was to be mortaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But whole</hi> Adam (quatenus Animal rationale) <hi>was in Innocency immortal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:39354:19"/>
                  <hi>Ergo, all, and every part, even whole Man, was lyable to Death by Sin:</hi> And ſo conſequently, if <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>then</hi> ſuch an indefinable thing in him, &amp; of him, without which he was not Man, (as is vulgarly ſuppoſed, and zealouſly mein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Church of <hi>Rome, England,</hi> &amp;c.) as an Angelical <hi>Spirit,</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could, nor can be ſubject to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: Then he had that he had not; which made him be what he was not: he ſinned with that, with which he could not; which made him fall when he did not: for if <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and <hi>that</hi> not, <hi>it</hi> was no part of him; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> was a living Soul, when he was not. And if <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned with that which he had not, he ſinned with that with which he could not; which made him fall when he did not: which <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peepe</hi> in impoſſible: For if <hi>Adam</hi> was mortalized, and <hi>That</hi> not, <hi>It</hi> was no part of him; this they muſt confeſs or elſe the otheer follows.</p>
               <p>Now whereas many from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>God's breathing into man the breath of life, and he became a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul,</hi> conceive an Angelical En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39354:19"/>
a ſupernatural, ſpiritual, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Exiſtence to be couched in the fleſh, or mens corpulency; whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth not depend on it, but is proper and peculiar to it ſelf: let ſuch know, that ſo weake is the ground from whence it is concepted, that by the ſame reaſon the like may be ſaid of fiſh, birds, and beaſts; for the breath of life, and a living ſoul, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to them, as well as to man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.21. to which read the margent in <hi>R. Jatran,</hi> compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>And to every beaſt of the earth, and to every Foul of the Aire, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth; wherein there is a living ſoul</hi>: ſee the margent.</p>
               <p>This being thus cleared and proved from <hi>Adams Creation</hi> and <hi>Innocency</hi>; let us proceed to his <hi>Fall, Reſtitution,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi>; who eating of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit,</hi> God fulfilled his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Curſe</hi> upon him, ſaying, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19.) <hi>In the ſweate of thy face ſhalt thou eate bread, till thou return unto the Ground; for out of it waſt thou taken: for Duſt thou art, and unto Duſt thou
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39354:20"/>
ſhalt return.</hi> Here he is plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed of all his immortality; he muſt to <hi>Duſt,</hi> without the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any being thereafter, either of part or whole, till the <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> for then, and not before, Mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is in <hi>Actual Being,</hi> whoſe beatitude and infelicity comes through Faith and infidelity. So that Death reduceth this <hi>productio Entis ex Non-ente ad Non-entem,</hi> returnes Man to what he was before he was; that is, <hi>not to Be: Pſal.</hi> 115.47. <hi>the Dead praiſe not the Lord, neither they that goe downe into ſilence:</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.4. <hi>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to the Earth, in that</hi> very Day <hi>his thoughts periſh.</hi> (ſee more, <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8.) But Chriſt the ſecond man <hi>Adam,</hi> who is made a quicking Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. at the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> reſtoreth this non-ented Entitie to an everlaſting <hi>Being,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.42. <hi>It is ſowne in corruption, it is raiſed in incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Mortality</hi> is derivated to all <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie: <hi>The firſt man</hi> (qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus homo) <hi>is of the Earth earthly:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:39354:20"/>
as is the earthly, ſuch are they that are earthly:</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47, 48.) But the Earth of which Man <hi>is,</hi> is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ſhall be <hi>burnt up</hi> with fire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. Therefore whole Man is corruptable: for <hi>as in Adam all dye,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22.) <hi>even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive</hi>; what fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhall be raiſed by <hi>Chriſt</hi>; what was mortalized by the <hi>earthly Man,</hi> ſhall be immortalized by the <hi>Heavenly man</hi>: wherefore <hi>All,</hi> not a part of Man was mortalized by <hi>Adam</hi>; or elſe onely the fallen part muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; and not the whole man: for no more of man then fell, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; and if the body onely fell, and his formal part (his ſoul) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued immortal, then that part of man (his body onely) was purchaſed, not his conſtitutive or better part, his Soul: So that the bodies onely of the Reprobate, according to this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhall be damned; for nothing of <hi>Adam,</hi> but what fell of <hi>Adam,</hi> can be made lyable to condemnation; and what of him ſtood, ſhall ſtand, as well as the <hi>Angels</hi> that never fell:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39354:21"/>
But <hi>in Chriſt we are compleat, Col.</hi> 2.10. Therefore in <hi>Adam</hi> totally fallen.</p>
               <p>Further: If <hi>Adams fall</hi> was not a compleat change of his whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, from immortality to abſolute mortality of the whole; then <hi>in the day that he did eate</hi> (the forbidden Fruit,) <hi>he did not ſurely die</hi>; for <hi>He</hi> implyes his Man-hood, (and my very <hi>Oppoſites</hi> confeſs the Soul the very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Being of Man-hood:) and [<hi>in the day</hi>] and [<hi>ſurely dye</hi>] imply Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution as well as Tranſgreſſion to be then; for both have equally relation to <hi>the Day: In the Day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye</hi>: ſo as well may we ſay, he did not <hi>eate,</hi> as did not <hi>die That Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if nothing dyed, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mortal, but his Body; then that dyed, &amp; his Soul lived, that is, muſt be as it was at firſt, before God breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life into it, that is, a <hi>dead corps,</hi> and indeed was never other, if the Soul were a diſtinct <hi>Being</hi> of ſelf, and all life in it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Body but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to it, whereby it performeth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:39354:21"/>
all motion and action (as <hi>Nemeſius</hi> on <hi>Mans Nature, p.</hi> 266. with others, maintain:) And thus it muſt needs follow, that this death threatned was a meer <hi>Scar-crow,</hi> even nothing at all; for <hi>He,</hi> that is, his conſtitutive part (his Soul) continued immortal, and unchanged, and uſed his body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally, as it did before the <hi>Tranſgreſſion.</hi> And if it be anſwered; It became ſinful and ſubject to ſin, and ſo of final Condemnation in Hell at the length: I Reply; That before he ſinned, he was ſubject to ſin, or elſe he could not have ſinned, for <hi>quicquid est in actu, prius fuit in poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>; and if the <hi>wages of ſin be death,</hi> then he muſt be of neceſſity ſubject to <hi>death</hi> the effect, as well as ſin the cauſe, at the ſame time: And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the Souls poſſibilty of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning being producted into Actual ſin, the Soul muſt have its <hi>wages,</hi> Actual mortality. Further, if the Souls Death be onely that of Hell; ſo then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal or efficient cauſe deepeſt in the Tranſgreſſion was leſs puniſhed, then the inſtrument, the Body being but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:39354:22"/>
the Souls inſtrument whereby it acts and moves: as if a Magiſtrate ſhould hang the <hi>Hatchet,</hi> and ſpare the Man that beat a mans brains out with it: and ſo the Soul ſuffer the <hi>laſt death,</hi> and ſcape the <hi>firſt:</hi> which is as prepoſterous, as, if this <hi>Death</hi> ſhould be received before this <hi>Life.</hi> Moreover: Condemnation in Hell is not properly, but remotely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Adams Fall</hi>; For properly Condemnation is the wages of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,</hi> or unbeliefe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of <hi>Beliefe:</hi> So that none can be condemned into Hell, but ſuch as are actually guilty of refuſing <hi>Chriſt</hi>; becauſe immortality or the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> cannot be by Propagation or Succeſſion, as mortality from <hi>Adam</hi> to his Iſſue; and ſo the Child, though temporally, yet ſhall it not eternally be puniſhed for his Fathers ſin, but his Condemnation ſhall be of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>If the Soul (as they ſay) be the very life, or have all life in it ſelf, and the body but its inſtrument; then the body now hath no more life in it,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39354:22"/>
then when it is reduced to the earth; but is as dead as a dore-naile: And ſo at the Reſurrection cannot be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from death; for that which never had life, cannot be raiſed from death; and the union of it to the Soul at the Reſurrection they Fabulate on, is but an addition of corpulency or groſs matter to the Soul; which in truth is no Reſurrection at all from the dead, no more then the reſtoration of fleſh loſt by Famine, ſickneſs, &amp;c. For Reſurrection from the death, is not the addition of groſs matter to life; but the Reſtoration of life from death: So that the reſtitution of loſt fleſh now to the ſoul, is in quality as much a Reſurrection from the dead, as the addition of the whole body to the ſoul at the Laſt day; which is to ſay with the Sadduces, <hi>there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> from the dead. But the Soularies, I know, are loth to be branded for Sadduces; which how they will avoid, I cannot ſee: for if the ſoul live ſeparated from the body, the body cannot be raiſed from the dead, except the body had a life of its
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39354:23"/>
own, differing from that of the ſoul; and ſo a man muſt have two lives (as they ſay a Cat hath nine:) the one mortal, the other immortal; and at the Reſurrection have two immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities. If the ſoul be of a diſtinct being from the body, and ſinned as the body, and thereby incurred the condemnation of Hell; then muſt the ſoul have a particular redemption from thence, as the body from the grave; or elſe it muſt periſh there for ever: And if Chriſt redeemed us from thence, then he muſt ſuffer the ſame eternal Torments; that is, the worme of conſcience, deſpaire, everlaſting chains of darkneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But thoſe he never ſuffered, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> to <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo.</p>
               <p>If you urge, that in his agony and ſweating of blood, he ſuffered equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Torments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might be ſaid to ſuffer eternal toments, though he was never perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in hell; then may we as well ſay, that by his agony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paine equivalent to death, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:39354:23"/>
therefore might be ſaid to have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the death of the grave, though perſonally he had never been in the grave: for there is a greater equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency betwixt thoſe ſufferings and the grave, then betwixt his ſweating of blood and the torments of the damned Spirits in hell.</p>

And it is in vaine for my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites to ſay it is meant of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent matter onely; for they make the Soul the <hi>very manhood:</hi> and none that enter therein, enter by halfes and peecemeal: and this is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. <hi>And no man hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man, which is in Heaven.</hi>

               <p>Hence it is plain, that during this Death Man is void of actual Being:

much fruit:</hi> compared to 1 Cor. 15. <hi>Thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened, except it die.</hi> Therefore the ſoul not dying (as the Soularies fabulate) nor falling into the ground, muſt abide alone, and cannot bring forth fruit at the Reſurrection, but muſt abide a bare ſoul without a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and the body having no life in it, falling into the ground, cannot die, (for both vegetative, ſenſitive, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional life is aſcribed to the ſoul) but muſt likewiſe abide alone, and cannot be quickned; which is a flat denyal of the Reſurrection: yet though fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally the Soularies thus deny the Reſurrection, yet verbally they ſay there is a reſurrection; which muſt needs be a ſtrange one, and as ridiculous as ſtrange, ſtated after their Imagination: For the ſoul not fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ground, nor dying, muſt needs abide alone: therefore if the body be raiſed after their conception, man would be divided into two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalities, and both alone; one might be in the North, the other in the South; the ſoul in one place, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39354:29"/>
the body in another; yea, the ſoul in Hell, and the body in Heaven: for the body by their grounds is as innocent from ſin, as the knife wherewith a man is ſtabed is free from murther; and the ſoul as guilty of all ſin, as the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is of the murther: &amp; the Scripture condemneth the guilty, &amp; ſaveth the innocent; adjudgeth one for heaven, and the other for hell. O monſtrous Reſurrection!

               <p>I Anſwer, that both the foregoing and ſubſequent matter deny ſuch an Interpretation, or conſequence: for before, wiſhing to be <hi>clothed with our Houſe from Heaven,</hi> on which is this expreſſion of <hi>being preſent with the Lord,</hi> he expounds, that his meaning is thereby, <hi>that mortality might be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of life</hi>; or as he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53. <hi>that this corruptable</hi> (man)

                  <hi>might put on incorruption, and this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal put on immortalty</hi>: And the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing matter of the ſaid words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid down as the reaſon or ground why he ſo ſpake, prove, that by his [<hi>preſence with the Lord</hi>] he meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but his ſtate after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: for ſaith he, <hi>We muſt all appear before the iudgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one,</hi> &amp;c, verſ. 1.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, This is of the ſame nature, therefore muſt have the ſame Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: for <hi>Paul</hi> did not preach one thing to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and the contrary to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Beſides, ſuch manner of expreſſions are not contradictory to this mortalitie: for though there be long time to the <hi>Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> till the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> there is none to the <hi>Dead:</hi> for from <hi>Adams death</hi> to his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> at the end of the World, will be to him, as the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye to the <hi>Living:</hi> yea,

the twinkling of an eye to the living, is more time, then a thouſand, yea ten thouſand yeares is to the dead: For <hi>Being</hi> onely commenſurates with Time, or length of days: <hi>not to Be,</hi> cannot poſſibly be capable thereof: So that the <hi>Livings</hi> tedious <hi>anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> expectation of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>end of their faith,</hi> is not a <hi>twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to the <hi>grave</hi>: the <hi>livings Future</hi> is the <hi>deads Preſent:</hi> Therefore, it is well figurated in <hi>Scripture</hi> by <hi>ſleepe,</hi> as, <hi>ſlept with his Fathers,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.43. <hi>fallen aſleepe in Chriſt,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And by <hi>Soul</hi> in that of <hi>Job</hi> is meant, his <hi>conſcience</hi>; whoſe ſeate is in the <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>memorative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</hi> Therefore, the uſe of the word <hi>Soul</hi> in thoſe places, doth not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39354:34"/>
prove ſuch a thing in man as is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: For in <hi>Scripture</hi> it is variouſly uſed upon various occaſions. It is put for the <hi>Stomack.

               <p>Therefore, from thoſe places thoſe parts may as well be proved ſo many Souls, or Spirits of immortalitie, as from thoſe where it is put for <hi>breath</hi> or <hi>life,</hi> it's <hi>Being</hi> be proved, or ſuch an immortal exiſtence to be in the body.</p>
               <p>But to this Objection might be added Chriſts raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others from the dead: and it would make a very good plea for Purgatory, Becauſe from hell there is no return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from heaven none could be thankful to be called again: and it cannot be ſuppoſed that Chriſt would work miracles for any, for which they ſhould not have cauſe to be thankful to him: and therefore theſe perſons

raiſed from the dead, if they ſhall be ſuppoſed to have immortal Souls, their return muſt needs be from ſome one of the Popes ſuppoſed <hi>Lymbocs</hi> or other.</p>

               <p>If it be Queſtioned, where then the Devils are?</p>
               <p>Obſerve, they are but Creatures, and ſuch as are fallen from their <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly manſions,</hi> therefore, within the <hi>Sublunarie</hi> compaſs; ſo that as the Earth is the proper place for ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and groſs bodies; and the Devils being more ſubtile and aiereal, may be referred to the aire; and not without ground from <hi>Scripture:</hi> for <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. the Devil is called <hi>the Prince of the power of the aire:</hi> ſo that their caſting into Hell, muſt be the aire: and Hell may as well be put for the aire in thoſe places, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the grave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their <hi>priſon,</hi> or place of cuſtody, as the grave to the dead. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. 'tis ſaid, <hi>he was caſt into the earth, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This premiſed, <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> not yet; well might Ignorance ſtraine it ſelf into ſuch incertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits about the place of it's Being,

and it not as yet: Some have feigned it in <hi>Mount Aetna,</hi> ſome in the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fire,</hi> which is betwixt the <hi>upper Region</hi> of the <hi>Aire</hi> and the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi>; ſome to be in the <hi>Caves of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>Conduits of the Sea</hi>; ſome onely in the <hi>Sea,</hi> as <hi>Archer</hi> in his <hi>Perſonal reign of Chriſt</hi> mentions, becauſe the Devils were caſt into the <hi>Swine,</hi> which <hi>ran violently down a ſteep place into the Sea, Mar.</hi> 5.3. ſurely, they might as well ſay, they have Milſtones about their neckes, becauſe it is alſo ſaid, <hi>Better a milſtone were tyed about his necke, and he caſt into the bottom of the ſea:</hi> for the one followeth no more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Some ſay, it is in the Earth, equally ſo far diſtant from the ſurface, as Heaven is above it: as <hi>Phillips,</hi> &amp;c. and this he labours to confirme with <hi>Scripture</hi>: as <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.4. <hi>The way of life is above to the wiſe, that he may depart from Hell beneath:</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. <hi>That in the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth:</hi> i. e. in Hell, ſaith he.

               </p>
               <p>But thoſe and ſuch like places which literally ſeem to import Hell, conclude the thing no more, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther literal expreſſions prove God to have corpulent eyes, eares, hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but are expreſſions after the manner of men, to ſhew the grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of condition betwixt the wicked and the righteous, the one the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt debaſement, the other the extreameſt exaltation; which could not be better figurated to ſence, then by Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>And in particular thus: The firſt, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24. is literal or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which interpretation can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>canonicall</hi> nor <hi>rational</hi>; for thereby wiſe men muſt not tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, but muſt walke upon the <hi>Aire,</hi> or upon the <hi>water,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> upon the <hi>Sea, (Mat.</hi> 14.25, 29.) and there onely the way of life: for it ſaith, <hi>their way is above.</hi> For
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39354:40"/>
the ſecond; as, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. that is both <hi>prophetical</hi> and <hi>figurative,</hi> to ſhew how in proceſs of time all Degrees ſhall ſubject to <hi>Chriſt: Angels, Men, Beaſts, Devils,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are thus literally expreſſed to ſence, by <hi>Heaven, Earth, under the Earth</hi>; or <hi>Angels</hi> that are higheſt in dignitie, and ſo caeleſtial; <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>ſublunars</hi> the middle, and ſo terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; <hi>Devils and Death</hi> the loweſt, and ſo ſubterreſtrial.</p>
               <p>The third, as <hi>Luke</hi> 16. is <hi>paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:</hi> (of which more anon) and it ſeems by this, if Hell be ſo deep in the Earth, the <hi>Damned</hi> have wonderful good eyes, to ſee through the earths groſs body, and the Heavens 12. Spheares into the Coelum Empyreum, to ſpy <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; or elſe Heaven muſt be there too, even in the centre of the Earth: this is the conſequence of ſuch <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> Arguments. And the 4. or laſt, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31.18. is akin to thoſe: for, it is but to ſhew, how that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> in the hight of his pride and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was brought to confuſion, which in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39354:40"/>
the 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> is expreſſed by, <hi>In the day when he went down into the grave</hi>; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, to the pit</hi>; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>into Hell:</hi> all which ſhew but the ſudden death and utter confuſion of <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Army: and at the utmoſt, Hell here can be but put for death, or the grave; and not for any ſuch place of torment.</p>
               <p>Object. 9. <hi>Such a one caught up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third Heavens: how that he was caught up into Paradiſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.2, 4. <hi>there Paradiſe is put for the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And to this compare Chriſts An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the thiefe upon the Croſs: This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe: Therefore, Paradiſe is the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the place for the ſouls of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whither the Thiefes ſoul went that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt was not there that day himſelf; for he was three days and three nights in the grave after his death: during which time, all the ſoul he had, was there detayned by death, as is evident by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.31. for if it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:39354:41"/>
were not ſo, then Chriſts humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taſted of death (not wholly) but partially onely, and thereby wrought not a whole, but a partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to humane nature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſoul, the moſt conſiderable part thereof, dyed not, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal (as is fancied:) which if true, Then believers will not be <hi>compleat</hi> in or by Chriſt, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirms them to be, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. having immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality onely to their bodies by Chriſt, but not to their ſouls, theſe being immortal before. And then <hi>Chriſt by the Goſpel brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light,</hi> onely for the bodyes of men, and not for their ſouls, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. and then believers at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection will have two ſeveral and diſtinct lives and immortalities; the one of their ſouls, by nature; and the other of their bodyes, by Chriſt: which is abſurd to imagine.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the Thiefe's ſouls was <hi>that day</hi> with Chriſts Soul in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, a place of glory and exaltation; Then humane nature had reward and exaltation before Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:39354:41"/>
or his conqueſt over death, even whil'ſt the Salvation of all man-kind was in ſuſpence, yea, and before its juſtification; for <hi>Chriſt dying for our ſins, roſe again for our juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. And further, if Chriſts ſoul was that day in Paradiſe, then the Apoſtles Creed may be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as untrue, which together with Scripture affirms, that Chriſt that day was both <hi>dead and buried</hi>; neither of which can be true, if his ſoul (the principaleſt part of his humanity) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alive, and aſcended that day into Paradiſe. Beſides, if that fancy had been true, then it ought, and without doubt ſhould have been put as an Article of the Creed, to have been believed by all Chriſtians; and had been as neceſſary a point to have been known and believed by them, as any other Article there put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Object. 10. <hi>But the meaning of the words may be, that the thiefes Soul was that day in Paradiſe with the God-head, and not with Chriſts Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſo, then this will follow,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:39354:42"/>
namely, that the theifs humane nature was exalted before Chriſts humane nature; which will contradict St. <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 1.18. where he ſaith, that Chriſt was <hi>the firſt born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence:</hi> and Chriſts own reward &amp; exaltation went not before, but followed after (as an effect of) his ſufferings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over death, as many Scriptures do witneſs: For <hi>when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, he ſat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>we ſee Jeſus was made a little lower then the Angels, for the ſuffering of death, Crowned with glory and Honour,</hi> Heb. 2.9. Chriſt <hi>being found in the faſhion of a man, humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs: wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given Him a name above every name,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 2.8, 9. And no man in his wits can be ſo ſenſleſs, as not to underſtand his Reſurrection to intervene his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and this his exaltation.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſince the God-head is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verywhere, how could the Thiefe be abſent from it anywhere?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:39354:42"/>Wherefore by no means may it be granted that the thiefe was in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice that day, or can be there before his reſtoration or Reſurrection; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he were or can be there with his broken leggs: for Chriſt ſaid not <hi>Thy Soul,</hi> but <hi>Thou,</hi> i. e. <hi>Thou Theife,</hi> or <hi>Thou man</hi> ſhalt be with me: And he that can make a Thiefe of him in the ſence for which he ſuffered, or a man either, without his body, is a better work-man then I know any.</p>
               <p>And if the ſoul (as they ſay) have all life in it ſelf, and it not ſubject to death, and be the humanity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Man; and the corpulent matter, the bulke of the body, be but an inſtrument whereby the ſoul acts and moves, and all the action and motion of the body be meerly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; then neither Chriſt nor the Malefactor died that day, nor can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man (as man) die: for thereby his Man-hood, that which makes him man, his Soul, is made immortal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubject to death: But the Scripture ſpeaking of the reſurrection of Chriſt, (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.31.) ſaith, <hi>His ſoul was not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:39354:43"/>
left in Hell, neither his fleſh did ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>: and <hi>Acts</hi> 8.33. <hi>For his life is taken from the earth:</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8. <hi>He was cut off out of the Land of the living.</hi> All which could not be, by the fabulous conceit of the ſoul: for the firſt place (as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.31.) doth ſhew, that not onely his fleſh, but life and being was ſubject or conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by death: and the ſecond, <hi>it was taken from the earth,</hi> ſhews it returned thither, elſe could it not be raiſed from thence: the third, <hi>he was cut off out of the land of the living,</hi> ſhews no life remained in the ſoul; for if his ſoul retained his life, and entered Paradiſe, which the Soularies make to be the Land it ſelf of the living; he never dyed: But <hi>his ſoul</hi> (even all the ſoul he had) <hi>was made an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin,</hi> yea, <hi>he poured it out unto death,</hi> Iſa. 53.10, 12. Therefore, this opinion of the ſoul cannot ſtand in competition with the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, but flatly denyeth his death: So that from the expreſſion of <hi>This day ſhalt thow be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> a preſent Soulary enterance
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:39354:43"/>
into glory cannot be wreſted under or without the denyal of his death.</p>
               <p>Object. 11. It is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>That Chriſt entered</hi> into heaven it ſelf; <hi>what's that, but the third heaven or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, into which Saint</hi> Paul <hi>was caught up, before mentioned, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the Thiefes ſoul entered the day of his death?</hi>

               <p>Object. 12. In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. Peter <hi>ſaith that it is</hi> an Inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and undefiled, <hi>and</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, reſerved in heaven for the Saints: <hi>and S.</hi> Paul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ſays, it is</hi> eternal in the heavens: <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it being for the Saints enjoyment, the ſouls of the Saints preſently after death, muſt aſcend to enjoy it; elſe can they not enjoy it at all: we nowhere read that their bodyes ſhall at any time aſcend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there ſaith, It is <hi>eternal in the heavens,</hi> but ſaith not that it is eternally there: for Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the 13 <hi>verſ.</hi> of the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> ſaith, that it is to be brought thence to the Saints, at the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, (and not that the Saints ſhall be taken up to it:) and this will not be ſo brought down to them for their enjoyment, till after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and when the new Heavens, and the new Earth, are created; as is evident in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1, 2, 3. and <hi>When
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39354:44"/>
mortality is ſwallowed up of life, then,</hi> and not till then, <hi>ſhall</hi> the Saints be clothed with this their houſe from Heaven, as <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame place, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 4. declares.</p>
               <p>Object. 13. By faith, Enoch was tranſlated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>And</hi> Elijah <hi>went to heaven in a whirlewind,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This no way contributes any thing to the fancy of the ſoul in a Paradice, but rather altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the conceit: for <hi>Elijah</hi> left his mantle, not his body behind him, when he aſcended; and <hi>Enoch</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo wholly taken up.</p>
               <p>And therefore, Chriſt in the ſpeech of the Theifs being with him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, did not intend that preſent day, but at the time of his coming into his Kingdome, he ſhould be there with him (according to the theifes peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) which Kingdome was not then ſhortly to be expected, but is yet to come; nor will it be, until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſts coming again in the clouds, with power and great Glory, as is evident, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.11, 12, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.27, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:39354:45"/>Beſides, if Chriſt himſelf was that day in Paradice, a place of glory, he was there unglorified, or elſe being there glorified, he afterward became unglorified again: for ſo he told <hi>Mary</hi> he was after his Reſurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. neither of which can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be imagined. And it is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, that many errors are grounded upon miſ-tranſlations of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; &amp; this place, though the genuine ſignification of the words thereof be rendred, yet may it be reputed within the nature of miſ-tranſlation: for we have manifeſtly cleared, that the ſenſe of [<hi>this day thou ſhalt be with me in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe</hi>] cannot, as it is vulgarly taken, ſtand with the foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or with ſolid reaſon: Therefore there muſt be ſome fault in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Text; which if narrowly examined may appear: for if the words in the Original be thus rendered, <gap reason="foreign">

copies onely in the tranſpoſition of a comma, incident to tranſcribing and printing, and then the objection from hence vaniſheth; i. e. <hi>To day I tell thee</hi>; not, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe</hi>: And well might he uſe that expreſſion, [<hi>I tell thee this day</hi>] as a trial of the ſincerity of his faith; for if he could believe in him that day, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time of his ſufferings, he ſhould be with him in paradiſe; or when he ſhould appeare in his Kingdome, he ſhould appeare with him in glory: or thus, [<hi>I tell thee to day, Thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe</hi>] is as if he ſhould ſay, I tell thee this day, which is the day of my ſuffering and of thy converſion, that as ſure as this is the Day, ſo ſure thou ſhalt be ſaved, or be with me at my coming into my Kingdome: where the atteſtation of [<hi>This Day,</hi>] is as an aſſurance, pledge, or witneſs of Chriſts mercy towards him, and as a tryal of his faith therein.

               <head>CHAP. V. Of procreation, how from thence this Mortality is proved.</head>
               <p>IT is ſuppoſed (as I conceive) by none, that what naturally proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from Man ſimply by the courſe of nature, can be immortal, but muſt firſt taſte of mortality: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are two ſorts of <hi>Opinions</hi> to maintaine this Heatheniſh Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the ſoul, whereon it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie is grounded, which I ſhall chiefly encounter: the one, that it is created, and infuſed at the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo onely Gods worke. The other, that it is concepted by the woman through the concurrence of the ſeed of both ſexes, but not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by the courſe of nature, but by the ſupernatural and extraordinarie aſſiſtance or efficacie of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception more then in other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and ſo partly mans, and partly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:39354:50"/>
Gods worke. But that I may utterly demoliſh the ſtructure of this Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall turn up the foundation of each kinde in it's place: But firſt I ſhall ſpeak a word or two in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Procreation</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>That whole man is generated by man, Obſerve: That as the whole Tree is potentially in the ſeed, and actually in time ſpringeth from it; or as many graines of wheat are in one graine virtually, and perfectly actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in time: ſo in the ſeed of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is whole man potentially, and wholly actual in time; or all <hi>Adams</hi> ſucceſſion, which in time are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, were wholly in him, life and limbes, or as 'tis more common, ſoul and body. So that whatſoever in time is actual by procreation, it was at firſt potentially wholly in it's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Generatum ſequitur natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram generantis (he begat a ſon in his own image, Gen.</hi> 5.3.) is not not onely philoſophically, but Theologically true, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Job</hi> 4.14 There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mortal <hi>Adam</hi> muſt beget mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39354:51"/>
children in his own likeneſs, ſoul and body, except the ſoul was no part of his likeneſs: For that which is immortal cannot generatively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that which is mortal, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that which is born of the fleſh is</hi> (as it ſelf is, corruptable mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table) <hi>fleſh, John</hi> 3.6. ſo then by this mortal fleſh cannot be generated an immortal ſpirit, or ſoul that can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by it ſelf diſſolved from the fleſh; for if it ſhould, in that act it ſhould go beyond it ſelf, which is impoſſible; and thereby more ſhould be done by man and woman in generation, then God did or could do in the creation; for he neither did, or could create any thing greater, purer, or more excellent of nature then himſelf, and ſuch as could ſubſiſt without him. But if this doctrine be true, (as <hi>Woolner</hi> in his <hi>Original of the ſoul</hi> averreth) fleſhly man by a fleſhly generation, or mixture of the ſeed of both Sexes doth beget or conceive ſomething greater, purer, and more excellent then himſelf; an immortal ſubſtance, an Angelical entitie, <hi>the Soul,</hi> that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39354:51"/>
can ſubſiſt without the fleſh by which it is: which is as fire without light, earth without heavineſs, groſſeneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be, by which they are: and further, the <hi>Effect</hi> to be <hi>prior dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate,</hi> precedent to the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> as if a man becauſe a creature, ſhould be before his Creator. But if it be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that the ſoul is generated by the ſoul, as the body by the body; I anſwer, then there muſt be <hi>He</hi>-ſouls and <hi>She</hi>-ſouls: for without Sexes is no generation.</p>
               <p>But now to the firſt ſort, who ſay it is by infuſion, or as the ſaying is, <hi>Creando infunditur, &amp; infundendo crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception there is corruption or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, according the proverb, <hi>Corruptio unius eſt generatio alterius:</hi> ſo that if it be by conceiving or creating infuſed, and by infuſion concepted or created, that is as much to ſay, it is made in the marring, and mar'd in the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or, infus'd in the marring, and mar'd in the infuſion: whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that it is neither conceived,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:39354:52"/>
created, nor infuſed; neither made, nor mar'd: but muſt be, if it be, no man knows what, or how; whether an Angel, a Beaſt, or a Monſter, any thing, or nothing: Riddle me, riddle me what's this? a Soul! a Soul! <hi>creando infunditur, &amp; infundendo crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if the ſoul be a creature infuſed, then Chriſt did not take the whole man-hood from the ſeed of the woman, but worſe then a bare brutiſh body, a dead carcaſs: But Chriſt was made of the ſeed of the woman according to the fleſh, <hi>Ram.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. and was as we are, ſin excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 14.15. and this our Image he received wholly from the woman: Therefore receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his whole humanity from her, the ſoul can be no infuſed creature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That which brake the Serpents head was Chriſts humanity: But the ſeed of the woman brake the Serpents head.</p>
               <p>Ergo.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If we conſiſt of ſoul and body, and are not men without both,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:39354:52"/>
and receive not our ſouls from him, but are dayly created: Then <hi>Adam</hi> is the father of no man, 2. Chriſt cannot be the <hi>Son of man,</hi> and ſo no Saviour, becauſe thereby his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, conſtitutive part, even that which ſhould make him man, could not be by the ſeed of the woman. 3. So a man is as much a father of <hi>fleas</hi> and <hi>lice,</hi> which receive their matter from him, as of his children. 4. Whereas God bleſſed man, and bid him, as the reſt of the creatures in their kinde, fill the Earth in his kinde with men: then he commanded him to do more then he had given him power for: and ſo to content nature, and ſupply her imbecility to obey, is forced to a daily creation. 5. Then God finiſhed not the Creation in ſixe dayes, but reſted before he had done creating.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If the ſoul be infuſed, it muſt be at the conception, or after the conception: If at the conception, then every abortive conception hath an immortal ſpirit in it, and muſt riſe again: If after, then there is growth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:39354:53"/>
before there is life, which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; for the ſoul is made the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as well as the motive, ſenſitive or rational part: and if this immortal ſpirit be ſomething elſe, then we are not conceived perfect men; and as we are conceived, ſo are we born, <hi>trees, brutes,</hi> or I know not what, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are made men, if we be men at all: and ſo Infants that die in the wombe, or in the birth, are little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then trees, and worſe then beaſts.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If the ſoul be not generated with the body, but a creature infuſed into a dead body, for they ſay, the ſoul is <hi>forma formans,</hi> that giveth life and motion to the body: Then it is lawful to be a <hi>Nigromancer</hi>; for <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancie</hi> is nothing but putting a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into a dead body, and ſo it is but an imitation of God, and God the onely <hi>Nigromancer,</hi> and all the men in the word but <hi>Nigromatnick Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> whoſe ſpirits when they have done the worke for which they were put into the bodies, deſert them, as other conjured Ghoſts do.</p>
               <p>Seventhy, It is granted that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:39354:53"/>
conſidered meerly ſenſitive cannot ſin, and that the body is but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or as the pen in the hand of a Writer, to the Soul, whereby it acts and moves: Therefore, if the Soul come immediately from God, or there be an immediate worke of his in it's production, then of neceſſity, that immortal thing, and not our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fleſh, is Author of all ſin, and it onely prone to all ſin, and not the fleſh, no more then a conduit, though a meet inſtrument to convey water, is the author, or fount of water, or prone to ſpring: And ſo Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand is the cauſe of all ſin, that man had better been without this ſoul; for it muſt needs be ſome damnable wicked ſpirit, or ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that God puts in him; for ſuch as the fruit is, ſuch muſt the tree be: but the fruit is damnably wicked: Therefore, the Soul muſt be ſome damnable wicked thing: No marvel then if Reprobates muſt needs ſin and be damned, ſince God <hi>infuſes</hi> ſuch a <hi>malignant Soul,</hi> that counſels them with <hi>Jobs</hi> wife to <hi>curſe God, and die,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:39354:54"/>
yea ſuch a one as wholly workes out their condemnation: This is as if a man ſhould break his horſes legs, and then knock out his brains for halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If it be ſaid the ſoul comes pure from God, and it is the body that corrupteth it; I anſwer, that this to excuſe God one way, makes him like the tyrant <hi>Mezentius,</hi> that bound liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to dead bodyes, till the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and corruption of the ſtinking corps had killed them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the mind may ſin without the Action of the body, but not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without the mind, for a man may covet in his mind, and not act with his body, and yet ſin; but if he do with his body, and not conſent with his mind, he ſinneth not: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a man may accidentally and ignorantly kill a man by a blow, which was never intended or aimed at him, and yet he not guilty of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but if he intend it in his mind, though he never do it, he is guilty: Therefore the body may be made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by the ſoul, but not the ſoul by the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:39354:54"/>Now to the other kinde, who ſay, that this ſupernatural worke by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is effected by Gods ſpecial ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aſſiſtance, operating or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to this natural aptitude, in whoſe mutual concurrence this immortal ſubſtance is concepted, and in concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion united to the fleſh, the whole in the whole, and the whole in every part.</p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer, that there is no more ſpecial ſupernatural efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God in mans procreation then in other creatures, but that ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gift or natural inſtinct to every kinde of creature given in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to produce it's kinde, whether vegetative, ſenſitive, or rational, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.38. for the gift or bleſſing is all one and the ſame, and alike unto all according to their kindes, as appeares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.22. God bleſſed the <hi>Fowls</hi> and <hi>Fiſh,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the Seas, and let the Fowles multiply in the Earth:</hi> And verſ. 28. the ſelf-ſame he ſpeaks of man and woman, <hi>And God bleſſed them, and ſaid unto
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:39354:55"/>
them, be fruitful, and repleniſh the earth</hi>; and by this bleſſing, or Natures gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct equally unto all, men and all other creatures continue their multiplications and procreations: So that the <hi>Fowles, Fiſh,</hi> &amp;c. have as great and ſpecial aſſiſtance as man in their conceptions and procreations, equally mediate and natural: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if by mans conception an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical immortal Soul is producted, ſo likewiſe is there the like in other creatures. The reſult of all which is this, that as Fiſh, Birds, and Beaſts each in their kinde procreate their kinde without any tranſcendency of nature: So man in his kinde begets man, corruptable man begets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is corruptable, not halfe mortal, halfe immortal; halfe Angel, halfe man, but compleat man totally mortal: for through mortal organs immortality cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, or therein poſſibly reſide.</p>
               <p>If it be ſcrupled, that this deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hope of our faith; I Anſwer, It doth but remove it from a falſe principle to a true, from a deceitful
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:39354:55"/>
fancy to an infallible object, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: For though I aſcribe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing actually to nature, but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet potentially I aſcribe incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: as to the kernel of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a Tree may not actually, yet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially be aſcribed: So I grant, that nature produceth the <hi>Seed,</hi> to which when ſhe hath done her ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary worke, even all that ſhe can do, and in all things tranſient finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her courſe, even from that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeed Chriſt ſupernaturally raiſeth an incorruptable body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.36. <hi>Thou foole, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die: it is ſowen in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſowen a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body:</hi> Therefore nothing of man can be immortal, but what firſt hath ſeen corruption.

               <p>Moreover, <hi>Woolner</hi> in his Treatiſe on the <hi>Soul, pag.</hi> 115. ſaith, <hi>That the more ſpiritual parts, and chiefly the Soul is</hi> (but partly mediately, partly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately) <hi>conceived at the firſt inſtant, or union of the ſeed of both Sexes: For by it</hi> (pag. 127. he ſaith,) <hi>the corporeal parts are prepared and perfected:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it muſt of neceſſity be at the <hi>firſt inſtant, or elſe no conception:</hi> And pag. 129. <hi>That all Souls, as well of Beaſts, as of men, are eſſentially as perfect at the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:39354:57"/>
firſt inſtant of conception as ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> And pag. 97. he ſaith, <hi>The Soul can live without the body, and cannot be corrupted by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That then it followeth, If a woman miſcarry, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that very inſtant, that the Soul of that <hi>Effluction</hi> or unſhapen deformed peece of <hi>congealed blood</hi> being immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, muſt needs continue its immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; and that <hi>Effluction</hi> as well as perfect bodyes, ſhall be raiſed again: for if degrees of corporal perfection hinder, then thoſe that are born im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, as without legges, armes, or hands, or any other member, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are, they ſhall never be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſo out of the compaſs of Chriſts death: and though it ſhould be granted, that Chriſts death is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed an <hi>Embryo,</hi> yet that ſouls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality cannot be nullified; for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality once begun, muſt never have an end: and he ſaith, <hi>it cannot ſuffer with the fleſh:</hi> therefore, if not with the whole maſs of mans corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency grown to it's full perfection, much leſs with an <hi>Embryo,</hi> that is ten
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:39354:57"/>
times leſs imperfect and invalid: for he ſaith, <hi>it is as perfect at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as ever afterwards:</hi> therefore, it muſt be ſaved or damned (if there be any for others) but no man knows how or which way, except it can be proved, Chriſt dyed for bare ſouls, ſouls without bodies; which will puzzle the cunningeſt ſoul that ever was made in the marring, and mar'd in the making.</p>
               <p>Further it is objected, <hi>Creatures propagated out of kinde, as by buggery; as, Apes, Satyres,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are ſuppoſed, are not endowed with reaſonable ſouls:</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, <hi>ſouls are created immediately, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of neceſſity, Gods ſuperficient power is joyned to the propagation thereof</hi>:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As I will not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm they have <hi>rational ſouls,</hi> ſo will I not altogether deny it: For in man it is ſome <hi>organical</hi> deficiency more or leſs, that is the cauſe, that ſome men are leſs <hi>rational</hi> then others; for ſome have abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of wiſedome, and ſome are meer fools: and in children, whoſe <hi>Organs</hi> are not come to perfection,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39354:58"/>
there is not ſo much as there is in an <hi>Ape:</hi> This premiſed, why in ſome meaſure, as far as by thoſe improper <hi>Organs</hi> can be expreſſed, may they not be <hi>rational,</hi> though not in the ſame degree as is capable of God, as well as Infants who are as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable <hi>pro tempore</hi> as <hi>Apes?</hi> But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, it will be replyed, that then <hi>Chriſt dyed for Apes, as well as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi> I anſwer, Chriſt dyed not for the rational part ſeparated from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, nor the material from the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, if there ſhould be ſuch <hi>Buggery-births,</hi> or if by that unnatural courſe they ſhould meet in one, (which is impoſſible, for the bleſſing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating any thing in its kinde, is to the kinde) for that neither, but for the natural production by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of both Sexes legitimate from <hi>Adam,</hi> and not ſuch unnatural by-blowes: As for births out of kinde, they come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the <hi>Curſe,</hi> and cannot any wayes claime priviledge in the <hi>Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> but muſt expect with <hi>Thornes, Briers,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Vermine,</hi> and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:39354:58"/>
                  <hi>Filth</hi> which breedeth on corruption, to be done away, when <hi>mortality is ſwallowed up of life.</hi> For all other <hi>Creatures</hi> as well as man ſhall be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delivered from Death at the Reſurrection: my Reaſons and grounds for it be theſe. Firſt, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the curſe in <hi>Adam</hi> would extend further then the bleſſing in Chriſt, contrary to the Scriptures: <hi>For as in Adam all dye, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>For the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Rom.</hi> 6.23. Therefore, <hi>Death</hi> coming upon all the Creatures by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> no death being before ſin, life ſhall come upon all by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, the Beaſts were not given man to eat in the <hi>Innocency,</hi> but to all fleſh wherein was <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Living Soul.</note> 
                  <hi>breath of life was given the green herbe for meat:</hi> Therefore, the death of the Beaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was part of the <hi>Curſe,</hi> and ſo to be done away by Chriſt. Thirdly, If the other Creatures do not riſe again, then Chriſt ſhall not <hi>conquer death,</hi> but when it is ſaid, <hi>O
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:39354:59"/>
Death where is thy ſting, O grave where is thy victory?</hi> it will be anſwered, In Beaſts, becauſe they are ſtill captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under its bondage: But <hi>as by one man death entered into the world,</hi> Rom. 5.12. <hi>and by man came Death, by man ſhall come reſurrection from Death; and the laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death, and</hi> Death <hi>ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 54. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death ſhall not retain them, but they muſt be delivered out of its Jawes. Fourthly, theſe enſuing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do clearly prove it: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, to the 23. <hi>All things were created by him and for him, whether they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven: and be not removed away from the hope of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which yee have heard, and which was preached to every Creature under Heaven:</hi> And <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go yee into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature:</hi> that is, <hi>Glad Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> life and Reſurrection from the bondage of corruption to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Chriſt: therefore, is he ſaid to be the <hi>Firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> that's <hi>born,</hi> or raiſed <hi>from
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:39354:59"/>
the Dead:</hi> ſo that thoſe whereof he is the Firſt, muſt follow, that is, every creature, elſe could he not be the <hi>Firſt-born from the Dead</hi> of them all. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. after the diſſolution of all things, he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I make all things New:</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> reckoning up <hi>Men, Cattel, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou takeſt away their breath, and they die; thou ſendeſt forth thy ſpirit, and reneweſt the face of the Earth:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. ſpeaking of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> ſaith, <hi>as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed:</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, in the <hi>New Earth the Wolfe and the Lambe ſhall feed together, and the Lion ſhall eate ſtraw like a Bullocke:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21. <hi>The earneſt expectation of the Creature wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the manifectation of the ſons of God: For the Creature was made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to vanitie, not willingly, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope: becauſe the Creature it ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God: for we know that the whole Creation groaneth, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:39354:60"/>
in pain till now.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> or <hi>Glad Tydings</hi> is unto all; all are under hope, and all things, <hi>men, beaſts, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall be made new, or reſtored at the Reſurrection; and ſo <hi>Death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> and <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of life:</hi> or <hi>Death having given up her dead, ſhall be caſt into the Lake, Rev.</hi> 20.13, 15. Thus much by the <hi>by</hi>: Now to our matter in hand.</p>
               <p>But be it granted, that thoſe births are not endowed with <hi>reaſonable ſouls,</hi> yet doth it not follow, that <hi>God createth immediately the ſoul, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately aſſiſteth nature in it's production more then the body:</hi> for this is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance out of kind<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, therefore cannot expect the bleſſing of the kinde, but be as it ſelf is, <hi>unnatural and curſed:</hi> for to the kinde is required Sexes of the kinde, &amp; thereto God hath given the bleſſing to beget its kinde, as well for man to beget perfect man, as for the beaſts to beget perfect beaſts; ſo that whatſoever is born of man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, is man, though one be ennobled with more excellencys then another. A <hi>born Fool</hi> would have been a better
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:39354:60"/>
inſtance; for if to them <hi>rational Souls</hi> were denyed, it might be thought, Nature naturally begetteth meer irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, brutiſh inhumane bodies, and rationality, or humanity, is a meer ſupernatural worke. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch a cavil, I anſwer, that by the <hi>Soularies</hi> grounds there can be no <hi>born fooles</hi>: Infants new born, yea an <hi>Embryo</hi> ſhould be as actually <hi>rational</hi> as men of ripeneſs of years; for they ſay, the <hi>ſoul</hi> is rationality it ſelf, and that rationality is no more of the body, then inke is of the pen; and the ſoul is abſolutely perfect at the firſt inſtant, yea 'tis <hi>forma formans:</hi> therefore, <hi>naturam expellas, furca licet uſque recurres,</hi> it is made action, which cannot but appeare, for all action is apparent: and they ſay it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſpirit, therefore cannot ceaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if not ceaſe, it muſt ſhew it ſelf: Now why are not Infants then as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional as others? nay, let me ask one <hi>Queſtion,</hi> If this endleſs ſoul be <hi>forma formans,</hi> the maker of our bodyes, why have we not endleſs bodies? for <hi>omne tale generat tale,</hi> every like
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:39354:61"/>
brings forth its like; ſo then, if one be immortal, the other muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; if one mortal, the other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Secondly, I anſwer, that though ſome are fooles from their birth, yet it doth not follow, that Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand is required to mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, but rather the contrary: for imperfections in a thing argue the mediate generation thereof; becauſe no imperfection of any kinde can come immediately from the hand of God: imperfections are accidental, or from the curſe: therefore not of creation, but of procreation.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing all this while we have had to do with this immortal Soul, we cannot find, or the <hi>Soularies</hi> tell what it is: ſuch likewiſe is its reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for if we ask where it is? they <hi>ſlap us i'th'mouth</hi> with a <hi>Riddle; tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte,</hi> the whole in the whole, and the whole in every part: that is, the whole immortal Soul in the whole body, and the whole Soul wholly in every part of the body. To which I anſwer, that this extends immortality or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:39354:61"/>
of death to the body; for if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality be in every part, then no part of man, from the crown of the head to the ſoal of the foot can be excepted; ſo <hi>we are all Soul all over, and every part a whole Soul immortal:</hi> So that it muſt either be held to be <hi>ubiquitarie,</hi> which is an <hi>Attribute</hi> peculiar to God; or elſe multiplicable by a corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diviſion: and ſo, were a man min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into <hi>Atomes,</hi> cut into innumerable bits, there would be ſo many innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able whole Souls, elſe could it not be wholly in every part.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IN ſome ancient Chronicles of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>we read of King</hi> Druis, <hi>ſo addicted to learning, that a Sect of Philoſophers ſucceeded him, named,</hi> Druides; <hi>and that this King, the better to encourage his Subjects without dread of death to fight his battles, taught them that their Souls were immortal, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death. Hence as ſome think, came the opinion, that the Souls of men are immortal: but others conceive it to have another riſe, namely, The general Doctrine of the Philoſophers, being, That Vertue was to be rewarded, and Vice puniſhed; and theſe uſually ſeeing
<pb facs="tcp:39354:67"/>
Men to die without either puniſhment or reward, and being ignorant of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, taught thence, that mens Souls (after death) remained alive, to receive the ſame: yet this was contrary to the judgement of many of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who nevertheleſs deemed men to be wholly mortal, as is cleerly proved by</hi> Pliny, <hi>in the 55</hi> chap. <hi>of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of his</hi> Natural Hiſtory; <hi>where treating of Ghoſts, or Spirits of Men departed, he ſaith thus:</hi> viz. After men are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, great diverſitie there is in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what is become of their Souls and Ghoſts, wandering ſome this way, and others that; but this is generally held, that in what eſtate they were before men were born, in the ſame they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main when they are dead: for neither Body nor Soul hath any more ſence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our dying day, then they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of their nativity: but ſuch is the folly and vanity of men, that it extendeth ſtill even to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture time; yea, and in the very time of death flattereth it ſelf, with fond imaginations, and dreaming of I know not what life after this: for ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb facs="tcp:39354:67"/>
immortality to the Soul; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deviſe a certain transfiguration thereof: and there be again, who ſuppoſe that the Ghoſts ſequeſtred from the Body have ſence; whereupon they do them honour and worſhip, making a God of him that is not ſo much as a man: as if the manner of mens breathing differed from that in other living Creatures; or as if there were not to be found many other things in the world, that live much longer then men; and yet no man judgeth in them the like immortality. But ſhew me what is the ſubſtance and body, as it were of the Soul by it ſelf? what kinde of matter is it apart from the body? where lieth her cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that ſhe hath? how is her ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how is her hearing performed? what toucheth ſhe? nay, what doth ſhe at all? how is ſhe imployed? or if there be in her none of all this, what goodneſs can there be without the ſame? but I would know, where ſhe ſetleth, and hath her abiding place after her departure from the body? And what an infinite multitude of
<pb facs="tcp:39354:68"/>
Souls like ſhadows, would there be in ſo many ages as well paſt as to come? Now ſurely thoſe be fantaſtical fooliſh and childiſh toyes; deviſed by men that would fain live alwayes, and never make an end.</p>
