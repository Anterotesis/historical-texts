            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wit hath his dregges, as well as wine, Diuinitie his drosse. Expect some Tares in the Treatise of Teares. Farre vnable are my dimme Ospray eyes, to looke cleerely against the sunne of Gods truth. An easie matter is it for any man, to cut me (like a Diamond) with mine owne dust.</p>
            <p>A young imperfect practitioner am I in Christs schoole. Christ accepteth the will for the deede. VVeake are my deedes, great is my will. O that our deedes onely should bee seene, and our will die inuisible. Long hath my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded will (renowned Madam,) been addressed to adore you. But words to that my resolued will, were negligent seruants. My woe-infirmed wit, conspired against me with my fortune. My im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent care-crazed stile, cast off his light wings, and betook him to wodden stilts. All agilitie it forgot, and graueld it selfe in grosse braind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie. Now a little is it reuiued, but not so reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that it hath vtterly shooke off his danke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mourning garment. VVere it effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, in my soule-infused lines, I would shewe that I perfectly liued, and in them your praises should liue: whereas now onely amongst the dead I liue in them, and they dead all those that
<pb facs="tcp:13421:3"/>
looke vpon them. That which my Teare-stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed pen, in this Theologicall subiect hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, is no more but the course-spun webbe of discontent: a quintessence of holy complaint, extracted out of my true cause of condolement.</p>
            <p>Peruse it iudiciall Madam, and something in it shall you finde that may pierce. The world hath crowned you for Religion, pietie, bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, modestie, and sobrietie: (rare induments in these retchlesse daies of securitie.) Diuers wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deseruing Poets, haue consecrated their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to your praise. Fames eldest fauorite, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Spencer,</hi> in all his writings hie prizeth you. To the eternizing of the heroycall family of the <hi>Careys,</hi> my choisest studies haue I tasked. Then you, that high allied house, hath not a more deere adopted ornament. To the supportiue perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of your canonized reputation, wholly this book haue I destined. Vouch safe it benigne hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitie in your Closet, with slight enteruiew at idle houres: and more polished labours of mine ere long shall salute you. Some complete history I will shortly goe through with, wherein your perfections shall bee the chiefe argument. To none of all those maiesticall wit fore-stalling
<pb facs="tcp:13421:4"/>
worthies of your sexe, my selfe doe I apply but you alone. The cunning courtship of faire words, can neuer ouer-worke mee to cast away honor on anie. I hate those female braggarts, that contend to haue all the Muses begge at their dores: and with Doues, delight euermore to look themselues in the glasse of vaine-glorie, yet by their sides, weare continually Barbary purses, which neuer ope to any but pedanticall Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites.</p>
            <p>Diuine Ladie, you I must and will memorize more especially, for you recompence learning extraordinarily. Pardon my presumption, lend patience to my prolixitie, and if anie thing in all please, think it was compiled to please you. This I auouch, no line of it was laide downe, without awfull looking backe to your frowne. To write in Diuinitie I would not haue aduentured, if ought else might haue consorted vvith the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate grauitie of your iudgement. Your thoughts are all holy, holy is your life: in your heart liues no delight but of Heauen. Farre be it I shold proffer to vnhallow them, with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane papers of mine. The care I haue to worke your holy content, I hope God hath ordained, to

A hundred vnfortunate farewels to fantasticall Satirisme: In those vaines here-to-fore haue I mispent my spirit, and prodigally conspir'd against good houres. Nothing is there now so much in my vowes, as to be at peace with al men, and make submissiue amends where I haue most displeased.</p>
            <p>As the Title of this Booke is <hi>Christs Teares,</hi> so be this Epistle the Teares of my penne. Many things haue I vainly set forth, whereof now it repenteth me.

Into some spleanatiue vaines of wantonnesse, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I foolishly relapsed, to supply my priuate wants: of them no lesse doe I desire to be absolued then the rest, and to God and man doe I promise an vnfained conuersion.</p>
            <p>To a little more wit haue my increasing yeeres reclaimed mee then I had before: Those that haue beene peruerted by any of my workes, let them reade this, and it shall thrice more benefit them.

brought their name to bee a by-word of terror to the Kingdomes round about them; Their Riuers ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Milke and Honie, their Garners were filled to the brim: euery man had wel-springs of Oyle and Wine in his house, and finally, there was no complaint heard in their streets.</p>
            <p>The time of fruite drew neere, wherein much was to be required of them to whom much was giuen: hee sent his seruants, the Prophets, to demand his rent, or tribute of thansgiuing at their hands. Some of them they beat, others they killed, others they stoned, and this was all the thanksgiuing they returned. And then he sent other Prophets or Seruants more then the first, and they did the like vnto them: yet could not all this cause him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed rashly vnto reuenge. <hi>The Lord is a God of long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and suffering:</hi> nor will he draw out his sword vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly in his indignation. Stil did he loue them, because once he had loued them, and the more their ingratitude was, the more his grace abounded: hee neglected the death of his seruants, in comparison of the saluation of them he accounted his Sons. He excused them himselfe vnto himselfe, and sayd: Peraduenture, they tooke not these my seruants I sent, for my Seruants, but for sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and deceiuers, and therupon entreated them so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteously: I will send my only naturall Sonne to them, whom they (being my adopted Sonnes) cannot chuse but reuerence and listen to. This his naturall Sonne was <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> whom hee sent from Heauen to perswade with these Husband-men: Hee sent him not with a strong power of Angels, to punish their pride and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude as he might: He sent him not roially trained and accompanied like an Embassador of his greatnes, nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13421:7"/>
gaue he him any Commission to expostulate proudly of iniuries, but to deale humbly, and meekly with them, and not to constraine but to entreat them. He sent his owne only Sonne alone, like a sheepe to the slaughter, or as a Lambe should be made a Legate to the Wolues. When he came on earth, what was his behauiour? Did he first shew himselfe to the chiefe of these Husband-men the Scribes &amp; Pharisies? Did he take vp any stately lodging according to his degree? Was he sumptuous in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, prodigal in his fare, or haughty in his looks, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors wont to be? None of these: Instead of the Scribes and Pharisies, he first disclosed himselfe to poore Fishermen: for his stately lodging, he tooke vp a Cribbe or a Manger, and afterward the house of a Carpenter: His attire was as mean as might be, his fare ordinary, his looks lowly. He kept company with Publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the very out-cast of the people; yet in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was he not idle, but made all he spake or did prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to his Embassie.</p>
            <p>If any Noble-man (though neuer so highly discended) should come alone to a King or Queene in Embassage, without pompe, without followers, or the apparell of his state, who would receiue him, who would credite him, who would not scorne him? It was necessary that Christ (comming thus alone from the High-commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all Soueraignties, the controller of all Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers) should haue some apparant testimony of his excellencie. According to the vanity of man, he thought it not meete to place his magnificence in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boast, as in the pride of shame, which is apparell, or in the multitude of men after him, for so met vvicked <hi>Esau</hi> his Brother <hi>Iacob.</hi> but in working miracles aboue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13421:8"/>
the imagination of man, and in preaching the Gospell with power and authority; VVhereby, after hee had throughly confirmed himselfe, to be the owner of the Vineyards true Sonne, and that these ill Hus-bandmen the Iewes, should haue no credible or truth-like excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left them, (that they tooke him for a counterfeit or colourable practiser:) he went into their chiefe assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and there (to the High-priests &amp; Heads of their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues) freely deliuered his message, declared from whence he came, gently expostulated their ill dealing, desired them to haue care of themselues: told them the danger of their obstinacy, and wooed them (with many faire promises) to repent and be conuerted. All this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed not, they set him at nought, as they reiected his Fathers other Seruants the Prophets: Wherefore his last refuge was, to deale plainly with them, and explaine to the full what plagues and warres were entring in at their gates, for their disloyaltie and doggednesse.

In the 13. of <hi>Luke,</hi> hee telleth how often he had beene an intercessor for the repriue of their punishment. The Husband-man which is my Father (sayth he) hath come many yeeres together to a Figge-tree in his Vineyard, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund fruite of it, and found none. What hath hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from cutting it downe but I, who haue tooke vpon me to be the dresser of the Vineyard: and desired him to spare it this yeere, and that yeere, and I would
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13421:8"/>
prune it, dung it, and digge round about it, and then if it brought not forth fruit, let him deale with it as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Almost this 30. yeere haue I prun'd it, dung'd it, digd round about it: that is, reproued, preached, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted with all the wooing words I could, endeuouring to mollify, melt, and pierce your hearts, yet all will not serue; my prayers and my paines, in stead of bringing foorth repentance in you, bring forth repentance in my selfe.</p>
            <p>As I sayd before, no remedy, or signe of any breath of hope, was left in their Common-wealths sinne-surfetted body, but the malady of their incredulity, ouer-maistred heauenly phisick. To desperate diseases must desperate Medicines be applide. When neither the white-flagge or the Red which <hi>Tamburlaine</hi> aduaunced at the siedge of any Citty, would be accepted of, the black-flag was set vp, which signified there was no mercy to be looked for: and that the misery marching towards them was so great, that their enemy himselfe (which was to execute it) mournd for it. Christ, hauing offered the Iewes the white-flag of forgiuenes and remission, and the red-flag of shedding his blood for them, when these two might not take effect, nor work any yeelding remorse in them, the black-flagge of confusion and desolation was to succeede for the obiect of their obduration.</p>
            <p>This black-flagge is waued or displayed in the 23. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> where directing his speech to his Disciples and the multitude, against the Scribes &amp; Pharisies that were the Princes of the people, he first vrgeth the infamous disagreement of their liues and their doctrines: which that it should breed no scandalous back-slyding in the harts of his Hearers, he inserteth this caution, <hi>Do as they</hi>

            <p>Then on the sodaine starting backe, as ouer-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the words he had sayd, and condemning himselfe (in his thought) for being so bitter: he presently vvee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and excuseth it in these tearmes, that it was not his fault but theirs, <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent vnto thee.</hi> That is, which are guilty of all the accusations my Father in this time would not in pitty lay against thee: yea, feared to be cruel in once suspecting of thee, though now they are proued, <hi>How often would I have gathered thy Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the Henne gathereth her Chickins together vnder her wings, and ye would not?</hi> How often would I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokt, reduced, and brought you into the right way, <hi>But you would not?

Thy prayers are friuolous vnto God, if thou deniest to heare God: He must first heare God, that will be heard of God.

Promise not vnto thy selfe too many yeeres trauailing in the way: Thinke not that thou shalt euer liue: thy way may be cut off ere thou bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: a thousand casualties may cut thee off in the way.

How thinkest thou, is there any earthly Iudge would spare thee or for-beare thee as I haue done?

In which regard, least he shold looke into him selfe, and so repent, hee will not let him see with his owne eyes, but lendeth him other eyes of despaire or security to see withall. If of security, then either hee perswades him there is no God, and that Religion is but subtile Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuers policy, (to keepe silly fooles in awe with scare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowes:) or that if there be a God, he is a wise God, and like a wise Counsailer, troubles not himselfe with euery vaine twittle twattle, of this man, or that man, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders wherefore we are made, and beares with vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Yea (which is horrible) hee sootheth him vp, that if God would not haue had him sinne, hee would neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue giuen him the partes or the meanes to sinne with. If he be a whore-maister, hee remembreth him how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> went in to his mayde <hi>Hagar:</hi> How <hi>Lot</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted incest with his Daughters: How <hi>Dauid</hi> lay with <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seba,</hi> and slew <hi>Vrias:</hi> And how I (my selfe) woulde not let the woman that had committed adultery bee stoned to death, but bidde her goe home to her house in peace &amp; sinne no more. If he be a drunkerd, <hi>Noah</hi> was drunke, the fore-named <hi>Lot</hi> was drunke, and <hi>Dauid</hi> (mencioned before likewise) made <hi>Vrias</hi> drunke; Yet all these were <note place="margin">This vvas long after Christs teares ouer Ierusalem.</note> men that God delighted in.</p>

               <hi>If hee bee a periurd person, why</hi> Peter <hi>for-swore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thrise, Ioseph</hi> swore by the life of <hi>Pharao, Dauid</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:13421:20"/>
swore, <hi>God doe so and so to mee, if</hi> I <hi>leaue to Nab ill yet ere night, one to pisse against the walls.</hi> Yet when <hi>Naballs</hi> wife <hi>Abigall</hi> (vnwitting to her husband) brought him a lyttle refreshing, his humour was pacified, his oth was dispenst with. A great many more allegations hath hee to this end, which heere to recite, were to weapon presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and saue the diuell a labour in seducing. Murther, theft, (what not) hath his texts to authorise him. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth profite, but peruerted may hurt, Scripture as it may be literally expounded, and sophistically scande, may play the Harbinger as well for Hell as Heauen, and sooner feedes Despaire then Fayth. Hath not the diuel his Chappell close adioyning to Gods Church? Is hee not the ambitious Ape of GODS Maiesty? And as he hath his Tabernacle (O <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> in thy Temple, so, hath not hee his Oracle or <hi>Tripos</hi> in his Temple at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> with as great (if not greater) sacrifices, oblations &amp; offerings then are in Gods Temple? Will hee not take vpon him to worke miracles, cure diseases, &amp; be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light, that is, preach the Gospell as I doe. Speake I in thunder or visions, hee speaketh in thunder and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Eclipse I the Sunne and Moone, hee will Eclipse Sunne, Moone, and starres. Send I one good-Angel out, he will send out two ill. In conclusion, in any thing hee will imitate me, but humility; and by humillity only, my Children are knowne from the diuells. Pride is that by which the diuell holdes his kingdome, he had nere been a diuell, if he had not beene too proude to be an Angell. Enuy breedes pride, and pryde breeds enuy: There is none can vp-hold enuy, but he must vp-hold pryde, nor can true pryde liue, if it hath nothing to enuy at; If it haue nothing so great as it selfe to ayme at, there is no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13421:20"/>
man vnder it hath any pryde or prosperity, but it enuies and aymes at.</p>
            <p>The Sunne, though it can endure no more Sunnes but it selfe, yet it can take in good part to haue more Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets besides it selfe, but pryde can endure no Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, no equals, no ascendants, no sprigs, no grafts, no likely beginnings. Any thing but vertue it can tollerate to thriue, and that it is too-to afrayd of. Marke a Tyrant when you will, and hee first extirpates the adherents to vertue. Vertue is thrise more inuocating for honor then ambition. What was the diuels first practise in Paradice, but to destroy vertue in <hi>Adam,</hi> and so by steps to destroy him, by destroying vertue in him? Whome slew <hi>Caine,</hi> but his iust or vertuous brother <hi>Abel?</hi> He was afrayd the comparison of his iustnes or vertue, would make him incomparably vgly in Gods presence. Whom hated <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi> and layd waite for, but his vpright brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by his vertue hee had ouer-reacht him in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of his byrth-right (Did not <hi>Saul</hi> persecute <hi>Dauid,</hi> onely because GOD lou'd him? So through-out the whole course of the Scriptures, Vertue purchaseth En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, and her possessors neuer escape briery scratches.</p>
            <p>But as before, so once more I will assertionate, Vertue hath no enimy but pryde. I my selfe haue no enemy but Pryde which is the <hi>Summun genus</hi> of sinne, and may well be a conuertible name with the diuell, for the diuell is nought but pryde, and pryde is an absolute diuell. But for pryde, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> ere this had <hi>gathered it selfe vnder my wing:</hi> Forsooth she disdained to be taught &amp; instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by such a meane-titled man as I. But for pryde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> the first World had not beene deluged. But for pride, there had beene no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13421:21"/>
of Monarchies. If <hi>Pharao</hi> had not beene so proud that hee would not let your fore-fathers goe, (but kept them in despight of me,) I had neuer plagued him as I did.</p>
            <p>The reason I deceiu'd you <hi>Hierosolomites</hi> &amp; Iewes, (in not comming in pride vnto you, in not taking the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and triumph of mine eternity,) was, because I would not partake with the diuell, in the pompe and glory of this World, which is proper to him. Did not he (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the first brute of my Gospell) hoyse me vp vnto an exceeding high mountaine, and shewed me all the Kingdomes of the world, and the glories of them, and sayd, <hi>All these wil I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship mee?</hi> When I came to <hi>Abraham</hi> in his Tent, and to <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> accompanied with another Angel, I tooke vppon me no pompous shape. It is debasement and a punishment to me, to inuest and enrobe my selfe in the dregs and drosse of mortallity. I would resemble the similitude of the meanest, to gather the meanest vnto me.</p>
            <p>I came to call sinners to repentance, poore sinners, beggerly sinners, blind sinners, impotent sinners, as wel as rich sinners, noble sinners, potentate sinners, to repen tance. With me there is no respect of persons, the Kings blood attainted of conspiracie against mee, is more base then the caytiues or pesants. What was <hi>Abraham,</hi> (but that he honoured mee,) I should out of his loynes mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply a Monarchy. There is no cripple or lazer by the high-way side, but would haue honoured me more then the progeny of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if I had but bestowed the thousand part of the propitiousnes I haue bestowed on the progeny of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Shall a man call any cripple or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13421:21"/>

I haue called you (that often haue beene Beggers and Beads-men vnto me, for blessings,) &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly supplicationd you, to accept of my largesse I lauisht, but you cryde, Auaunt hypocrite, thy proferd ware is odious, we'le haue nothing to doe with an Innouater.</p>
            <p>What hath immortality to doe with mucke? Had my Father no employment for mee, but to sende me to scrape on a dung-hill for Pearle, where nothing will thriue but Toade-stooles? Was thought-exceeding glorification, such a cloyance and cumber vnto me, that I must leaue it: as <hi>Archesilaus</hi> ouer-melodied, and too-much melowed &amp; sugred with sweet tunes, turned them aside, and caused his eares to be new relished with harsh, sower and vnsauory sounds? O no, when I left Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to liue on earth, I left perpetuall-springing Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to sleepe on Beddes of Ise, in the Frozen-zone, the throne of Winter. My super-aboundant loue to men on earth, was all the solace I proposed to my selfe on earth. <hi>Vbi cuiusque animus est, ibi animat:</hi> where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans minde is, there his mirth is.</p>
            <p>Myrth was to me no mirth, whyles thou wert not <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi> vnto mee. No more then I haue <hi>gatherd</hi> thee, can I <hi>gather</hi> thee: <hi>As a Henne gathereth her Chickins, so would I haue gathered thy Children.</hi> The Henne clocketh her Chickins, I would haue clocked and called them by my preaching; The Henne shieldeth them, and fighteth for them against the Puttocke, I would haue shielded them, and secured them against that slie Puttocke sathan. I would haue fought for them, vvith hell, the diuell, and al infernality. The Henne; after she hath clocked &amp; called

her chickins, keepeth them warme vnder her soft downe, walleth them in with her winges, and watcheth for them whiles they sleepe. After I had called you (my children or chickens) vnder my winges, which is, into my Church I would haue beene a stronger wall vnto you, then the wall of the Tower of <hi>Babell,</hi> which (as Writers affirme) <note place="margin">Herodot.</note> was the eight part of a mile thick, I would haue sette an Angell (with a fiery sword) in your gate, to keepe out your enemies; Still would I (with the heat and warmth of my Spirit) haue cherisht and encreast the strength and growth of your fayth, and keep it from beeing dead and cold; My vigilance should haue sentineld for all your sleepes: neither the terror by night, nor the Arrow of temptation that flieth by day, should haue frighted you. Sathan (whom you now hold for such a subtile vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner) should haue beene your foole, and your iesting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocke, and a feare-bugge to your Babes only. All things should haue prosperd and gone wel which you had taken in hand. <hi>Happy is that man that sitteth in the shaddow of the winges of the almighty:</hi> vnhappy are you, that haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sought to dwell in the shaddow of death, then vnder the shaddow of the winges of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Ierusalem, Ierusalem, that killest my Prophets and stonest them</hi> I <hi>sent vnto thee: How often would</hi> I <hi>haue gathered thy children together, as a Henne gathereth her Chickins vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her winges, but you woulde not.</hi> What is more tender then a Henne ouer her Chickins?

Knew you what a fearefull thing it were, to liue (as Out-lawes) from the winges of my Church, to let ritches, promotion, or any worldly respect hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you, from being gathered into the vnity of my body, and communion of Saints, you would vndoubtedly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all and follow me.</p>

            <p>Those that made excuses, and came not to the wedding when they were bidden, the King sent forth his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and destroyed them, and burnt vp their Citties.

            <p>Not <hi>Abrahams</hi> sonnes are you, but the sonnes of bloud, for in nothing you imitate <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that he (hauing no more saue one onely sonne) would haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd him: so GOD hauing no more but one onely Sonne, you lyein waite to crucifie and sacrifice him. For thine owne destruction (disgraded daughter of <hi>Syon)</hi> thou lyest in waite, in laying waite for mee: that which I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13421:26"/>
hunger and thirst after, is thy saluation in my destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I am enamoured of my Crosse, because it is all ages blessing: not a nayle in it but is a necessary Agent in the Worlds redemption.</p>
            <p>Holy Crosse, <hi>Adams</hi> of spring, onely holines, I grieue that vpon thee I can spend none of my God-head as wel as my Humanity, to glorify the more this great exploit. For the desolating and disinheriting of hell haue I that reserued, none but the God of heauen may leade capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity captiue, and returne Conquerour from that dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geonly Kingdome. Strange it is (ó <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> that I should be able to conquer and forrage hell, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conquer, or bring vnder thee to my obedience. To speake troth, (as in my lips is no guile) thou art not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee conquéred, or haue the host of thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons subdued by me, that hast admitted of a baser con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, which is the diuell, after whom I can succeede with no honour.</p>
            <p>The Romaines (not I) shall conquer thee, and <hi>leaue thy house desolate vnto thee:</hi> who being Heathens, and not knowing God, are a degree of indignity inferiour to the diuell, for he knowes God, and with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling acknowledgeth him. Wouldst thou with feare and trembling haue fled to mee for refuge against the diuell and the Romanes, when I would haue <hi>gathered</hi> thee, both the Diuell and the Romanes (at one instant) had bene subdued to thine hand. But vnder my standard <hi>thou wouldst not,</hi> thou scornedst to <hi>gather</hi> thee, <hi>therefore shall thy house be left desolate vnto thee:</hi> therefore shall Gods house <hi>bee left desolate vnto thee.</hi> Maiesticall Temple, on whose Pinacle once I was tempted, thou and I (one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another) must perish, for no fault of our owne, but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13421:26"/>
for the sinnes of this people.</p>
            <p>No profite but disprofite, shall the scattered ashes of thy obsequies bring vnto them, nor shall they, like the ashes of me the true Phoenix, liue againe: neuer shall thy body (like mine) be raised againe. Raced and defaced shalt thou be, as thou hadst neuer bene. Haply Caues for wilde-beasts (many yeares together) thou maist affoord, but the Lord of Hostes shall abandon thee, the King of Israel shall abiure thee. By <hi>Herod</hi> (a man of bloud) thou wert last builded, and in bloud shalt thou be buried. O let mee embrace thee while thou yet standest, and I am not translated: hereafter (perhaps) nere may I haue the opportunity to embrace thee. This present houre that is granted, I will put out to Vsury. On thy Alablaster out-side, with scalding sighes and dimming kisses, a greater dew will I raise, then lies vpon sweaty Marble a little before raine.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes these stones looke shining and smyling vpon mee, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> frownes like a Shee-beare seeking her whelpes. These stones start not out of their assigned places, but still retaine their imposed first proportion: from me (her foundation) long agoe hath <hi>Ierusalem</hi> star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, out of those limits and bounds I assigned her hath she started, her order she hath broken; my building she hath subuerted; no forme or face of my workemanship is visible in her. But yet, were nothing but her face and out-side deformed, it were some-what, her in-side is worst of all: her Heart, her Lungs, her Liuer, &amp; her Gall, alare carioniz'd and contaminated with surfeits of selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. Her owne heart she eateth, and disgesteth into the draught with riot and excesse.</p>
            <p>Poore Temple, long mightst thou stand, and not haue

a stone of thee disquieted till the Iudgement day, if those to whom thou belongest, were not ten-times branded in the fore-head for Reprobates, not with the marke of the Lambe, but the Lyon, who (roring) seeketh whom he may deuoure. Distressefully am I diuided from thee; my soule (when it shall be diuided from mee) will not endrench mee in so much dolour as thou doost. The zeale of thee distraughteth me, and some essentiall part of my life seemeth to forsake me and droppe from mee, when I thinke of thy diuastation. Nothing so much doth macerate and mad mee, as that all the sky-perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming prayers, and profuse sacrificatory expences of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand oblationers, should not haue force to vphold thee. Desolation, for no debt of sin shalt thou extend on this Temple, that thou hast to extend against it, extend against me, for it is my Fathers habitation. It will but augment his indignation against this Citty, and do thee no good to driue him out of house and home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue him no sanctified mansion vpon earth. Let there bee one peculiar Treasury of supplications and vowes vndestroyed and vnpillaged.</p>
            <p>O Father, bee this House more high-pryzed to thee then Paradice; More worship and adoration hast thou had in it then in Paradice. There thou setst a fiery-armed Gardant to repulse insolent inuaders: set some garison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the gate of thy Tabernacle, to oppugne the dispossessors of thy Diety: thou canst not heare me, I pray for them whose sinnes sue against me. Thou hast decreed (in thy secret iudgement) <hi>There house shall bee left desolate vnto them:</hi> Thou hast decreed I shall be left desolate on the Crosse, and cry, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, lamasabach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thani,</hi> vnayded or vnregarded.

            <p>My wings, her gray-headed sturdy disobedience hath now cleane vnpinioned and broken, so that (though I would) I cannot <hi>gather</hi> her.

God forbid I should be so <hi>Luciferous</hi> passionatiue-ambitious, to take vpon mee the full blast of this <hi>desolatiue-trumpet</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a weake breath or two I will writhe into it, and with a hoarse sound, (such as fitteth farre-spent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guorment) manifest as it were in a dead-march, her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely interment.</p>
            <p>Forty yeares were expired after our Lords lifting vp into Heauen, when the Temple-boasting Iewes, (elate in their owne strength) began to pretend a wearines of the Romane regiment, and coueted to raigne entire Lords, ouer the Lords that raign'd ouer them. <hi>Eleazer,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Anani</hi> the High-priest, was the first that seminariz'd this hope of signiorizing and freedome amongst them. Proudly he controlled <hi>Agrippa</hi> &amp; all the other Lieftenants, droue them from their dignities to <hi>Rome</hi> to seeke succour and rescue, and swayed ouer the multitude, as the King and Father of their liues. In the meane-while, the Element was ouer-hung with prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies. GOD thought it not enough to haue threatned them by his Son, but he emblazond the aire with the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13421:32"/>
of his terror. No Starre that appeared but seemd to sparkle fire. The Sun did shine all day, as it is wont at his Euening going downe. The Moone had her pale-siluer face iron spotted with freckle-imitating bloud-sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: and for her dim frosty circle, a blacke inky-hood embayling her bright-head.</p>
            <p>Ouer the Temple (at the solemne feast of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer) was seene a Commet most coruscant, streamed &amp; tayled forth, with glistering naked swords, which in his mouth, (as a man in his hand all at once,) he made sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance as if hee shaked and vambrasht. Seauen daies it continued, all which time, the Temple was as cleare &amp; light in the night as it had beene noone-day. In the <hi>Sanctum sanctorum,</hi> was heard clashing and hewing of Armour. Whole flockes of Rauens, (with a fearefull croking cry,) beate, fluttred, and clasht against the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. A hideous dismall Owle, (exceeding all her kind in deformity and quantity,) in the Temple-porch built her nest. From vnder the Altar, there issued penetrating plangorus-howlings, and gastly dead-mens grones. A goodly young Heyfer, hal'd thither for a burnt offering, being knockt downe and ready to be drest, miraculously calued a Lambe.</p>
            <p>The sacrificing kniues that diu'd into her entrailes, wold afterwards by no meanes be cleansed, but from her bloud (as from mans bloud) tooke vnto them an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable rust. In the feast of Weekes, in the inner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of the Temple was heard one stately stalking vp and downe, and exclaiming with a terrible base hollow voice, <hi>Migremus hinc, Migremus hinc, è Templo emigre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> Let vs go hence, Let vs go hence, out of this Temple let vs hie vs. What should I ouer-blacke mine

Inke, perplex pale Paper, rumatize my Readers eyes, with the sad tedious recitall, of all the prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting signes of their ruine. Stories haue lost and tyred themselues in this Story. Should I but make an Index to any one Writer of them, it would aske a Booke alone. Some few abreuiated alleagements I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe with, and so passe on-ward to more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary matter.</p>
            <p>Aboue, and besides, the Propheticall apparitions, in, ouer, &amp; about the Temple, in the Citty there happened no lesse note-worthy praedictions. The East gate thereof which was all yron, and neuer wont to be opened vnder twenty men together, (the dry rusty creeking of whose hookes and gymmes as it was in the opening, might be heard a mile off,) now, of the owne accord, burst wide ope, and being ope, was twise more hard then before to be shut. A base mechanicall fellow there was, sprung out of the mud of the Communalty, who for foure yeares together before the warres begunne, went cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp and downe, <hi>Woe to Ierusalem and the Sanctuary thereof, Woe to euery liuing thing that breatheth therein,</hi> The wars once entred, he got him on the wals, and often re-iterating his stale-worne note, adde thereunto, <hi>Woe, and thrice woe to my selfe,</hi> and with that, start a stone out of an Engine in the Campe and stopt his throate. Many monstrous birthes at this instant were brought foorth: in diuers places of the Citty sprung vp founts of bloud. The Element euery night was embattailed with Armed men, skirmishing and conflicting amongst themselues; &amp; the Emperiall Eagles of <hi>Rome,</hi> were plainly there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played to all mens sight. A burning sword also was set forth, visibly bent against the Citty. The strangest and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13421:33"/>
horriblest tempests of thunder and lightning had they that euer was heard of.</p>
            <p>The Earth left to be so friutfull as it wont. No season but it exceeded his stinted temperature. Euery thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled against kind, as thinking scorne to accommodate themselues to their vses, that had so rebelled against the Lord. For all this, there was no man that would <hi>gather</hi> himselfe, no man that would depart from the ill worke he had in hand. <hi>Ambulabant vt caeci quia Domino peccaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> Their eies were ouer-filmed or blinded, because they obeyed not their Maker.</p>
            <p>NOw is the time that all Riuers must runne into the Sea, that whatsoeuer I haue in wit or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, must be drayned to the delineament of wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse.</p>
            <p>The Romanes like a droue of Wild bores, roote vp and forrage fruitfull <hi>Palestine.</hi> That which was called the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> is now vnhallowed with their Heathen swords. Wherefore you Pilgrims, that spend the one halfe of your daies in visiting the <hi>Land of Promise,</hi> and weare the plants of your feete, to the likenesse of withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red rootes, by bare-legd processioning (from a farre) to the Sepulchre, vngainefully you consume good houres, for no longer was <hi>Iudea</hi> a Land of Promise, then her Temple stood. <hi>Vespasians</hi> inuasion hath prophaned it: a Mount of dead bodies ouer that Sepulchre is raised, which you perigrinate to adore; that Sepulchre you see, is but a thing built vp by <hi>Saracens</hi> to get mony with, and beguile votiue Christians. They delude your super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and make it their tributary slaue.</p>
            <p>No Hog-sty is now so pollutionate as the earth of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:13421:34"/>
and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Our Sauiours steps are quite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified in them, and trodden out of sent, by the irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ouer-trampling of the Romanes. A new story of flesh-manured earth haue they cast vpon it, and made it no more the walke of Saints and Prophets, but a poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nurcery of Beasts of pray and Serpents.</p>
            <p>O God, enlarge mine inuention and my memory, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and feelingly, to rehearse the disornamenting of this mother of Citties.</p>
            <p>Vnderstand that before the arriuall of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> there were in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> three factions. <hi>Eleazers,</hi> which was the fundamentiue and first, <hi>Iehochanans</hi> next, and <hi>Schimeons</hi> the last. <hi>Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Iehochanan,</hi> the vngodliest that euer God made, <hi>Schimeon</hi> except, (and hee might well haue beene Schoole-maister to <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Iudas,)</hi> hee was such a grand <hi>Keysar</hi> of cut-throtes. From the noblest of the Iewes discended, but his Nobility ere he came to it, by his degenerate conditions he forfeited. A man hee was that made a mockery of all Lawes and Religion, and any thing which Authority forbad, most greedily would embrace: thinking, as the best Pastures are hedged in, the best Orchards wald about, the best Mettals hutcht vp, so there was nothing excellent but was forbidden, and whatsoeuer was forbidden, was excellent. For malice or hatred, he would not stab or murder men so much, as against he had iust occasion to stab or murder, to keepe his hand in vre. Hee held it as lawfull for him, (since all labouring in a mans vocation is but getting,) to get wealth as well with his sword by the High way side, as the Laborer with his Spade or Mattocke, when all are but yron; besides, as there is none hath any wealth which he getteth not from another, so deem'd he it as free for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13421:34"/>
him as another, to get from other men; concluding, as there no better tittle to a Kingdome then conquest, so there is no better claime vnto wealth, then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of a strong hand to compasse it. Adultery, Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Drunkennesse, no sin, but he would defend and offend in.</p>
            <p>For the multitude of these and other his abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, banisht he was, and longer in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> might he not roust: wherefore no possibility had hee to preuent beggery, or redeeme his estate, but by proclaiming (in all places where he came) the trade he profest: The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of his Proclamation was this. That if there were any, that had dudgen-old coughing miserly Fathers they could not endure: If there were any that had repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning victual-scanting Maisters, tyrrannizing neuer-the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse for their work: If there were any, that were Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-craz'd, and dead and buried in debt, and knew not which way to rise out of it, let them repaire to him, and till Doomes-day they should haue a protection. Yea, if there were euer a good fellow that lou'd a Harlot as his life, would haue Letters-patents to take purses, had a desire to kill and not be hang'd, would sweare and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare for single-money, and had not so much as a crum of conscience to put in his pottage, let him or them what ere, resort vnder his standard, and their humors should be maintained.</p>
            <p>Twenty thousand of these dreggy lees of <hi>Libertines</hi> hiu'd vnto him in a moment, whom he cleped the <hi>Flower of Chiluary:</hi> for they feared no man, &amp; cared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for God nor the Diuell. With them he burnt the greene Corne in the fields, pluckt downe Barnes and Store-houses, stubd vp Orchards and Vine-yards, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13421:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made desolate hauocke where euer he came.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (after much slaughter and spoyle) with this his Out-law Army he reacht, &amp; there enter-leagued himselfe with <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Iehochanan.</hi> The first thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ioyning they did, was the displacing of the <hi>Sanhadrtn,</hi> which were the Iudges, and three-score and tenne Elders, and sharing the gouernèment equally amongst them. Then the Sacrifice they silenced, put the High-priest to death, and conuerted the Temple to an Armory. Long could they not agree, but as Empery ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth no mate-ship, so did they enuy one another, made heads against one another, mutually skirmisht with one another. Their enemies were without, but within lurkt the plague that went through stitch.</p>
            <p>Twenty thousand in one day, the internal ciuil sword eate vp. The <hi>Edomites</hi> let in by <hi>Iehochanan,</hi> of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest Cittizens, slew eight thousand and fiue hundred in one night. Heere begins the <hi>desolation</hi> Christ prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, within and without vengeance bestirreth her; within it raged most, for within sinne raigned most. Let mee suddainely waxe old and woe-wrinkle my cheekes before their time, by describing the deplored effectes of their sinnes within. First, for the <hi>desolation</hi> of their ceremoniall Religion, some-thing I haue said already, but the summe of all was this, that if any Priest approcht neere the Altar, the bloud of him and his offering was blended together. The reuerent Ephods were made the slaughter-mens Aprons: many venerable Leuites they bound to the Altar by the haire of their beardes. The Vessels of the house of the Lord, they put to vile vses. Not any consectated thing but they arrested and made booty of. Yong children, whom their mothers led
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13421:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in their hands along with them, to the Temple to offer, (inhumaine to be told,) they tooke and mercilesse cast into the sacrificatory flame, and on the same Altar (after they were consumed) most sacriligiously rauisht their Mothers. Some men (whom they could not otherwise draw into their danger) they would inuite to treaty in the Temple, saying; There is the Tabernacle of the Lord, there is the Arke of his presence, there if we shold draw our blades, it were abhomination vn-remissible. Why distrust you vs? suppose you vs to be without GOD? carry wee not the couenant of our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> in our loines as well as you? By him that ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Temple wee sweare, and all mysticall riches thereof, you shall depart thence vnmolested. Who so on their oaths, or their words affianst them, were sure to wash the pauement with the best iuice of their breasts.</p>
            <p>Not onely those that came to offer, but those that but offred to kneele in the Temple, they ran through. The Marble flore of it they made so slippery, with their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respited, and not so much as Saboth-ceased bloud-shed, and bowel-clinging fat of them that were slaine, that a man might better swimme then walke on it. The place without the Citty where they carried their dung, and buried the entrailes of Beasts, halfe so pestilently stunck not, as that stuncke with dung-hils of dead-bodies. The entry of the Court of the Lord, was changed to a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Lake of bloud. The siluer gates of the Temple, no more were gates for deuoute worshippers to enter in at, but slimy flood-gates for thicke iellied gore to sluce out by. Who hath seene a Vaulte vnder a Church full of dust-died sculs, and rusty dead-mens bones, might (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13421:36"/>
that grosse streame of gore a little was turn'd aside, and the bloud dryed vp,) rightly allude the Temple thereunto: for now it was no more a prayer-prospering House, but a pudly Vault of dead-mens bones, and cast out bodies kneaded to durt. Her Alablaster wals were all furred &amp; fome-painted, with the bespraying of mens braines dung out against them. Her high roofe was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-colourd with mounting drops of bloud, that se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>'d by soaking into it, to seeke for passage to heauen.</p>
            <p>The siedge growing hot, the seditious hearts some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what quailed, and then they made shew as they would correct themselues, as they would renounce their tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous tyranies; And whereas lately before, they had depriued the High-priest both of life and office, now (dissemblingly remorsed) they would needs in all hast, in his roome set vp another, and by lots he should be chosen. The lot fell vpon a Plow-man, or Carter, one <hi>Pani</hi> the sonne of <hi>Peniel,</hi> and hee (not-with-standing his ignorant basenesse, and base rudenesse) as in a mockery, was instal'd in that dignity.</p>
            <p>It is not my intent to runne a right out-race, through all the accidents of their reprobation, onely that which I lay downe, is to shew how vnfallibly Christs words were fulfilled, as touching their tenne times merrited desolation. Iudge all those that haue sence of misery, ere they haue occasion to vse it in discerning their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, whether this were not desolation or no. The Lord at one time visited their Citty with those foure ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall plagues, Fire, Famine, Pestilence, and the Sword. First for fire, thus he visited it: There were a thousand &amp; foure hundred Store-houses, filled vp to the top with victuall, Corne, Wine, and Oile, sufficient to maintaine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13421:36"/>
two hundred thousand men for twenty yeares, all which by the Seditious was set on fire, and consumed in one day. Diuers gorgeous buildings they enflamed to smoke out their rich owners, &amp; many goodly streets end-longs to the very earth they encindred: for nothing but to haue more roome to bicker in.</p>
            <p>Euery corner of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> had a voyce heard in it as in <hi>Ramah,</hi> of weeping, mourning, &amp; great lamentation. Scarce could one friend in commoning heare another, for the howling, wringing of hands, sobbing and yelling of men, women, and children. Heere lay they halfe dead, bayting and bathing in their wounds, and roaring and eare-rentingly exclaiming, for some melting-hearted man, to come and rid them out of their lingring liuing death, and slay them out-right. The sons, daughters, and seruants of the Elders thus vniustly massacred, went crying vp and downe the Citty like mad-men, with eies and hands to heauen extended, <hi>Iustice Lord, Iustice Lord, Iustice, against the vniust depriuers of our friends and maintainers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Seditious order, that if there were any man noted to be of more wealth then other, him they pickt a quarrell against, and accused of treason to their Sanctuary, and sending letters to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> False witnesses they had in pay a Campe royal. <hi>Schimeon</hi> wold not see them vnproudied in that case. Not onely he that mourned, but he that did not seeme to reioyce at the Martyrdom of those iust men, was dismist the same way. Not a few (in their mindes benummed with the massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous monstrousnesse of this quicke Marshal-law) made themselues graues, and went into them aliue. The chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of <hi>Iordan</hi> was so ouer-burdened and charged with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13421:37"/>
dead carkasses, that the waters contended to wash their hands of them, and lightly leapt ouer their bankes, as shunning to mixe themselues with so many millions of murders: but after many daies abstinence from their proper entercourse, (obseruing they must liue for euer banisht from their bounds, except they made some rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them,) they recollected their liquid forces, and putting all their wauy shoulders together, bare the whole shole of them before them, as farre as the Sea of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had there beene at that time a Red-sea new to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, the bloud (that like a Riuer from a Mountaine foote, flowed forth of <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> would haue made it rich in surges, and sufficient to wracke many ships. Euen as <hi>Iordan,</hi> so the Brooke <hi>Cedron,</hi> and the waters of <hi>Schilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> in like sort were choked. As dead Cats and Dogs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Buts of Sacke and Muscadine are throwne, (for their fiery strength to feed on,) so into Wels and Cesternes were dead Corses (innumerable) throwne, for their blacke waters to feede on. From the fury of the Sword, let me discend to Famine and the Pestilence, the two latter plagues of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In giuing them sutable phrase, had I the command of a thousand singular wits, I should bankroute them all in description. Plucke vp a good courage mine infant pen, and wearily struggle (as well as thou maist) through this huge word-dearthing taske.</p>
            <p>The Store-houses burnt, the siege hard plyed, the waste of victuals great, the husbanding of them none at all: there fell such an infestuous vnsaciable famine amongst them, that if all the stones of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had ben bread, and they should haue tyred on them, yet would
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13421:37"/>
they haue bene behind hand with their appetite. Their watry wesands were like to leape out of their mouthes for meate, and in their crawling vp to seeke passage, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to haue bene seaz'd on by their iawes for sustenance. Like an ouer-hanging Rocke eaten in with the tide, or Death that is nere picturd, but with an vpper chap only, so did their propendant breast-bones imminent-ouer-canopy their bellies.</p>
            <p>So many men as were in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> so many pale raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone ghosts you would haue thought you had seene. Euen through their garments their rake-leane ribbes appeared. Their sharpe embossed Anckle bones, turnd vp the earth like a Plow-share, when in going their feete swarued. The empty Aire they would catch at in steed of meate, like as a Spaniell catcheth at a flie; the very dust they gnasht at as it slew, and their owne armes and their legs they hardly for-bare. Their teeth they would grinde one against another, to a white pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like meale. The durty mosse on the pentisses of their houses, they gnawde off most greedily. Not a weede sprung vp, but (ere it aspired halfe to his growth,) by them it was weeded and rauenously rauncht vp. All the bushes and boughes, within, or round about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were hewed downe and feld, for men (like briute beasts) to brouze on.</p>
            <p>Within twelue mile compasse of the Citty, where there were wont to be the most <hi>Elizian-like</hi> gardens, and flower-gilded fields vnder heauen, what for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes and them, was there not now left a crop of any Gourde or greene thing. The Sedetious &amp; the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would come running into the Cittizens houses, and taking them by the bosomes, cry aloud, Giue vs meate,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13421:38"/>
Giue vs meate by the Lord we will haue meate: rob, steale, runne into the Tents of our enemies for meat for vs, or wee will make meate of you and your children. Mens Cellars and Garrets for meat they searcht. If there were but the bloud of any thing spilt on the ground, like hungry dogs they would licke it vp. Rats, Mise, Weafels, Scorpions, were no common mens iunckets.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this scarcity, had any but a dish full of Corne left to send to the Mil, they were afraid to send it, for feare they should set all <hi>Ierusalem</hi> together by the cares for it. Wherefore in their low vnder earth Vaults, they digd lower Caues, which couering with bordes, and formally pauing ouer, there they eate their Corne vnground (closely,) because they would not be circumuented.</p>
            <p>Exceeding rich <hi>Magnificos</hi> stole victuall one from another, and would lie in waite a whole weeke together to intercept but a chypping. The Father stole from the Sonne, and oftentimes tore the meate out of his mouth; the Sonne could scarce refraine from biting out his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers throate-boule, when he saw him swallow downe a bit that he died for. The Mother lurcht from them both, her yong weaned Children (famisht for want of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment) sastned their sharpe edged gums on her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and would not let them go, till she pluckt the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell out of her owne maw to put into theirs. Hee that then had had a Kingdome, would haue giuen it for a crust of bread.</p>
            <p>Not a Butterflie, Grashopper, Worme, Neuet or Canker, but was persecuted, and sought out to satisfie emptinesse. You should haue seene a hundred together, fighting &amp; scrambling about a dead Horse. Sometimes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13421:38"/>
they would send their children farre out of the Citty to gather rootes and hearbes, thinking that the Romans carried more honourable mindes then to execute their vtmost on them: but all was one, for they spared neither yong nor old. Many Noble-men, eate the Leather of their Chariots as they rid. <hi>Miriam</hi> a Matron of great port, and of high lynage discended (hauing her receipt of digestion almost closed vp with fasting) after she had sustained her life a large space, by scraping in chaffe and muck-hils for beasts dung, and that meanes forsaking her, she had no other refuge of fosterment, she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained (for her liues supportance) hauing but one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sonne, to kill him and roast him.</p>
            <p>Mothers of <hi>London,</hi> (each one of you to your selues) doe but imagine that you were <hi>Miriam,</hi> with what heart (suppose you) could ye go about the cooquery of your owne children. Not hate but hunger, taught <hi>Miriam</hi> to forget mother-hood. To this purport conceit her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with herselfe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It is better to make a Sepulchre for him in mine owne body, then leaue him to be lickt vp by ouer-goers feete in the streete. The wrath of GOD is kindled in euery corner of the Citty, Famine hath sworne to leaue no breathing thing in her Wals; without the Wals, the Sword more vsurpeth then Famine. Our enemies are mercilesse, for we haue no eies to see our owne misery. Not they alone besiedge vs, but our sinnes also. Fire and Famine afflict vs. We haue where-with-all to feed Fire and Famine, but not where-with to feede our selues and our children. My sonne, my sonne, I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue thee, I haue Gold and Siluer to giue thee, but not a pairing of any repast to preserue thee. My son, my son,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13421:39"/>
why should I not kill famine by killing thee, ere Famine in excruciating thee, kill mee. O my deere Babe, had I in euery limbe of mee a seuerall life, so many liues as I haue limbes, to Death would I resigne, to saue thine one life. Saue thee I may not though I should giue my soule for thee. The greatest debt I haue bound thee to mee with, is by bearing thee in my wombe: Ile binde thee to mee againe, in my womb Ile beare thee againe, and there bury thee ere Famine shall confound thee: I will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swathe thy breast with my sharpe knife, and breake ope the bone-walled prison where thy poore heart is lockt vp to be pined; Those Chaines and Manacles of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptiue bowels (where-with thy soule is now fetterd,) will I free it from. I will lend Death a false key to enter into the closet of thy breast.</p>
               <p>Euen as amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> there is a certaine peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that when any of their Kins-folkes are sicke, saue charges of Physicke, and rather resolue (vnnaturally) to eate them vp, then day-diuersifying Agues, or bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyling surfets, should fit meale feede on them: so do I resolue, rather to eate thee vp my sonne, and feed on thy flesh royally, then inward emperishing Famine should too vntimely inage thee. Would God, as the men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> were not able distinctly to pronounce <hi>Shibbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,</hi> so I could not distinctly pronoune this sweet name of <hi>My sonne:</hi> it is too sweet a name to come in slaughters mouth. Though <hi>Dauid</hi> sung of mercy and iudgement together, yet cannot I sing of cruelty and compassion together; remember I am a Mother, and play the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse both at once. O therefore in my words do I striue to be tyrannous, that I may be the better able to enact with my hands. Sildome, or neuer, is there any that doth

Be prest mine hands (as Iaile-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding officers) to see executed, whatsoeuer your superior tongue-slaying Iudge shall decree. Embrawne your soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin'd enclosure with Adamantine dust, that it may draw nothing but steele vnto it.

My sight put not on yeares-dimnesse so soone as it would haue done, onely trusting thou shouldst seale it vp when Death had dusked it. My beauty-creasing cares, and frowne-imitating wrinkles, were wholy buried in the monumentall graue, which I (misdeeming) deemed thy sword might dig me. All these my airy-bodied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, Famine hath dispersed. I must enter thee, thou canst not entombe me.

            <p>As touching the Pestilence, some short peroration is now to succeed. Of it there died more then a hundred thousand during the time of the siedge. Out of the least gate of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (which was that towards the Brooke <hi>Cedron,)</hi> were carried forth to buriall, a hundred fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand, a hundred and eight persons: all which were of the Nobles, Gentlemen, and substantialest men of the Iewes. Many fled to <hi>Titus,</hi> who when they came to meate, could eate none of it, but dyed with the very sight thereof. Of those that fled, a great number swallowed vp their Gold and their Iewels, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleerely escaped) they sought amongst their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But when by the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and <hi>Arabians, (Titus</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:13421:42"/>
mercenary Souldiers) it was perceiued, they slew them out-right, and ript their bowels for their gold, and so left them to the Eagles and Rauens. Two thousand by this couetise slept their last. The Princes of the Iewes, (which <hi>Titus</hi> as submissioners and succour-suers had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to mercy,) he straightly examined on their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and fidelity, how many were dead in the Citty since he first beleagured it: &amp; the number was giuen vp, (namely of such as were carried forth at all gates to be buried, and were slaine in battell,) seuen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, fiue hundred, seuenty and fiue, besides many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands that in the streetes and Temple lay vnburied, and were cast downe into the Brooke <hi>Cedron.</hi> The whole Bil (when the siege was concluded) came to eleuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand, all which in foureteene monthes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortuned.</p>
            <p>Sixeteene thousand <hi>Titus</hi> led prisoners to Rome, (those omitted which vnder <hi>Eleazers</hi> conduct peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.) The <hi>Sanctum sanctorum</hi> was set on fire, and the Priestes therein smothered. All the Antique buildings were burnt and beaten downe. Of <hi>Dauid, Salomon,</hi> or the old Kings of Israell, was there no Trophy remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, no stone but discituate. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was left, not as <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but a naked plot of ground; And as it was said of <hi>Priams</hi> Towne, <hi>Iam seges est, vbi Troia fuit,</hi> now is that a Corne-field, that was erst called <hi>Troy:</hi> So that is now a Mount of stones, that in yeares past was intituled <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

            <p>O <hi>Ierusalem, Ierusalem,</hi> what shall I say to thee more but Christ fore-told <hi>thy House should be left desolate vnto thee:</hi> and loe, as he fore-told it is falne out.</p>
            <p>Of all thy gates that were plated ouer with siluer,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13421:43"/>
is there not so much as one nayle remaining. Thy streets were paued with Marble, and thy houses ietted out with Iaphy and Cedar: that pauement, those houses, thy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation (like dust engrauen Letters) is quite abrased and plowed vp. Thine enemies on thy Sanctury tooke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, (beholding the glory of it) thou took'st none. <hi>Titus</hi> (an Infidell) vnderstanding the multitude of thy prophanations and contumacies, was affraid (hauing entred thee) to stay in thee, saying: <hi>Let vs hence, least their sinnes destroy vs.</hi> Nothing thou feared'st, in Old-wiues fables thou beleeued'st: with Th'almudisticall dreames (that thy Temple after her destruction should be built vp in a day) thy selfe thou deludest. And whereas thou hadst a Prophecy that thy Sanctuary should not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, till out of thy quarters sprung a Monarch of the whole Earth, thou wert blinded, and wantedst the sence, in <hi>Vespasian</hi> to picke out his expletement. For hee, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Iudea</hi> but as a subiected Generall to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, by his owne Souldiers (against his will) was there consecrated Emperour: and so out of thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, or quarters, departed he, leauing his sonne <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> behind him to sacke thee.</p>
            <p>See with how many deceits thou art circumuented, for calling Christ a circumuenter and deceiuer. For <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him and his Prophets,</hi> and vsing such great in-iustice <note place="margin">Math. 27. 25.</note> to S. <hi>Iames</hi> (his Cosen according to the flesh,) <hi>Iosephus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Eusehus</hi> agree all those plagues were laid vpon thee. But to the imprecation ascribe I it rather, where-with when <hi>Pilate</hi> washed his hands, thou cursedst thy selfe, saying: <hi>His bloud be vpon vs, and our children.</hi> Inhumane policy another cause I coniecture.

The reasons, hereafter, I will open in some other discourse, treating wholy of those matters.</p>
            <p>The chiefe reason of thy confusion, was the ripenesse of thy sinnes, which were seeded for want of Gods put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his sicle into them. <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> If I were to describe Hell, some part of thy <hi>desolation</hi> description would I borrow, to make it more horror-some. Eleuen hundred thousand, for these few words, <hi>but thou wouldst not,</hi> most wretchedly lost their liues. If but one line <hi>(thy House shall be left desolate vnto thee)</hi> included all this, what doth the whole Scripture include? Not a peece of a line in it that talkes of the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, but by a hundred thousand parts more importeth. It is a quiuer of short Arrowes, which neuer shew their length till they be full shot out, a ball of Wilde-fire round wrapt vp together, which burneth not but cast forth, a close winded clue, conducting those that deale vnaduisedly with it, into the Minotaurs Laborinth of paine euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
            <p>I would wish no man to be too milde in expounding it. It hath more edges to smite with then it shewes: It is not sely in operation, though it be simple in apparance. <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> not all thy seuenty <hi>Esdrean</hi> Cabalizers, who traditionately from <hi>Moyses</hi> receiued the Laws interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, could euer rightly teach thee to diuine of the crucified <hi>Messias.</hi> The Scripture thou madest a too-to compound Cabalisticall substance of, by canonizing such a multifarious Genealogie of Comments.</p>

HEtherto stretcheth the prosecution of thy <hi>desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Now to <hi>London</hi> must I turne mee, <hi>London</hi> that turneth from none of thy left-hand impieties.

            <p>O Pride, of all Heauen-relapsing premunires the most fearefull: thou that ere this hast disparradiz'd our first Parent <hi>Adani,</hi> and vnrightuouz'd the very Angels, how shall I arme mine elocution, to breake through the rankes of thy bily stumbling blocks. After the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> thou being thrust out of house and home, and not knowing whither to betake thee) at hap hazard embarkedst for <hi>England.</hi> Where hearing rich <hi>London</hi> was the ful-streamed wel-head, vnto it thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedst, and there hast dwelt many yeares, begetting sons and daughters. Thy sonnes names are these, Ambition,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13421:44"/>
Vaine-glory, Atheisine, Discontent, Contention. Thy daughters, Disdaine, Gorgeous-attire, and Delicacy. O had <hi>Antwerpe</hi> still flourished, that thou hadst nere come hither to mis-fashion vs, or that there were any Citty would take thy children to halfes with vs.</p>
            <p>Thy first sonne Ambition, is waxt a great Courtier, and maketh him wings of his long Furies haire, to flie vp to Heauen with: hee hath a throne raysed vp vnder his heeles in euery start-vp he treads on. His backe ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieth colours with the Sunne. The ground he thinketh extremely honoured and beholding to him, if he blesse it but with one humble looke. Nothing he talks on but kentals of Pearle, the conquering of <hi>India,</hi> and fishing for Kingdomes. Fame he makes his God, and mens mouthes the limite of his conscience. So many greater as there are then himselfe, so many griefes he hath. The deuill may command all his heart and soule, if hee will rid him but of one riuall. Hee that but crosseth him in the course of his ascension, either killeth him out-right, (if he be aboue his reach) or is sure (kill hee not first) in the end to kild by him.</p>
            <p>Poore men he looks should part with all their goods, to haue him but take knowledge of them; Hee seekes to get him a Maiesty in his frowne, and doe some-thing to seeme terrible to the multitude. Euen curtesie and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility he peruerteth to pride, where hee cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise pray. Hath no childe of pride so many disciples as this tip-toe Ambition. Why call I him Ambition, when he hath changed his name vnto Honor? I meane not the honour of the field, (Ambitions onely enemy) which I could wish might be euer, and onely, honourably, but Brokerly blowne vp honour, honour by anticke fawning
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13421:45"/>
fidled vp, honour bestowed for damned deserts.</p>
            <p>Of this kind of honour is this Elfe (we call Ambition) compacted. Yet will I not say, but euen in the highest noblest birth, and honourablest glory of Armes, there may be Ambition. <hi>Dauid</hi> was ambitious when he caused the people to be numbred. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> eate grasse for his Ambition. <hi>Herod</hi> was Ambitious, when in Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall apparell he spoke to the people.

In this discouery thirty yeares were spent, from his Consul-ship, to the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Saturnius,</hi> when God-wot poore man, twenty yeares good before they returned, he was all to be-poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarded in the Senate house, and had the dust of his bones in a brasen vrne (no bigger then a bowle) barreld vp, whom (if he had liued) all the Sea, and Earth, and Aire, would haue beene too little for.</p>
            <p>Let the ambitious man stretch out his limbes neuer so, he taketh vp no more ground (being dead) then the Beggar. <hi>London,</hi> of many ambitious busie heades, hast
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13421:45"/>
thou beheld the rising and downe falling. In thy stately Schoole are they first tutord in their Art. With exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thou first exaltest them, and stil lifts them vp, til thou hast lifted vp their heads on thy gates.</p>
            <p>What a thing is the heart of man, that it should swell so bigge as the whole world. <hi>Alexander</hi> was but a little man, yet if there had beene a hundred Worlds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, his heart would haue comprised them. Did men consider wherof they were made, and that the dust was their great Grand-mother, they would be more humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate and deiected; Of a britler mettal then Glasse, is this we call Ambition made, and to mischaunces more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. Glasse with good vsage may be kept and continue many ages. The dayes of man are numbred, threescore and tenne is his terme, if he liue any longer, it is but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and sorrow.</p>
            <p>Glasse feareth not sicknes, nor old age, it gathereth no wrinkles with standing. It hath not so many that scoute and ly in waite for his end as Ambition: for hee (as all man-kind) is continually liable to a million of mischan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; besides, a legion of diseases lingering about him. Admit none of those meet with him, Time with his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle wil be sure not to misse him. A man may scape a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, a blow, a fall, a wild-beast: he cannot escape his last destiny. External daungers (such as these be) euery one is circumspect and careful to auoide; Not any one pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in his thought, how to auoid the death that growes inward.</p>
            <p>From the rich to the poore (in euery street in <hi>London)</hi> there is Ambition, or swelling aboue their states: the rich Cittizen swels against the pride of the prodigall Courtier; the prodigal Courtier swels against the welth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13421:46"/>
of the Cittizen. One Company swells against another, and seeks to intercept the gaine of each other: nay, not any Company but is deuided in it selfe. The auncients, they oppose themselues against the younger &amp; suppress them and keepe them downe all that they may. The young men, they cal them dotards, and swel &amp; rage, and with many othes sweare on the other side, they will not bekept vnder by such cullions, but goe good and neere to out-shoulder them.</p>
            <p>Amongst their Wiues is like warre. Well did <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> in the second of Phisickes, call sinnes Monsters of nature, for as there is no Monster ordinarily reputed, but in a swelling or excesse of forme, so is there no sinne but is a swelling or rebelling against God. <hi>Sinne</hi> (sayth <hi>Augustine) is either thought, word or deed, opposite to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall will of God.</hi> Then if all sinnes be opposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against God, surely ambition (which is part of the diuels sin) cannot but be the cherrishing of open enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie against God: and so immediate I conclude, that so many ambitious men as are amongst vs, so many open enemies God hath.</p>
            <p>Ambition is any puft-vp greedy humour of honor or preferment. No puffing or swelling vp in any mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but is a sore, when the soule doth swell with ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both soule and body (without timely phisicke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) will smart full sore for it. Humilitie was so hard a vertue to beate into our heads, that Christ pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely came downe from heauen in his owne person to teach it vs, and continued thirty yeers together, nothing but preaching and practising it here vpon earth. The foolish things of the world, (saith <hi>Paul)</hi> God chooseth, and not the hauty or ambitious in conceite. God might <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:13421:46"/>
haue chosen Kings and Emperours, or the Scribes and Pharisies to be his Disciples, but foolish Fisher-men he chose.</p>
            <p>In worldly policy he vsed a foolish course to win cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to his doctrine: but foolish is the worldly policy, that onely from the diuell borrowes his instance. Christ chose them, whom the diuell scorned to looke so lowe as to tempt, in whose harts he had not yet laid one stone of his building. They were the onely fit men to receiue the impression of his Spirit. Whether it bee a blessing or no, giuen to all Fisher-men (for the Apostles sakes) I know not, but surely there is no one trade (in their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) liues so faithfully &amp; painfully as Fishermen, that in their apparell or diet lesse exceede. Hee that should haue told the diuell. Christ would cast his nets amongst Fisher-men, he would haue laught him out of his coate for a cockscombe. What reason, what likelihood was there, was he borne in a Fisher-towne? was he allied ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Father or the Mother to Fisher-men, Nay, how should he come almost in all his life to heare of a Fisher-man? Tush, tush, hee will be altogether in the Temple amongst the Doctors, the High-priests and the Elders: them will I ply, and way-lay against him.</p>
            <p>To their vnbeliefe I will lend arguments. They haue the seedes of ambition rooted in their hearts already. I wil put in their heads, that he commeth to destroy their Law and their Temple, and turne them all out of their stately chaires of authority: and this (I thinke) wil tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle them thorowly against him.</p>
            <p>Simple diuell, Christ deceiued thee, and only in this he deceiued thee, that thou imaginedst his pride &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be like thine, and neuer lookst for him amongst
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13421:47"/>
Netmenders. I dare sweare for thee, thou wouldst haue sooner sought for him amongst Carpenters. But when thou foundst how thou wert ouer-reacht, I thinke thou rann'st to them (from one to another) with cap in hand, to request them to betray him. And euery one shak't thee off churlishly but <hi>Iudas,</hi> and on him hadst thou not had power, but that he carried the purse. It is a hard thing for him that carries the purse, (that hath money and golde at commaund) not to be mou'd with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> had you beene any thing but beggerly Fisher-men, and that you had euer liu'd but a hungerd and colde by the Sea-side, or once come into the great Townes where Ambition sits in her Maiestie, and bewitcheth all eyes, (before Christ met with you,) the diuell had caught hold of you. For your sakes all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your profession shall fare the worse. Beware Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher-men, the diuell owes you an old grudge, hee takes you for daungerous men. Till your predecessors the Apostles so went beyond him, he neuer suspected you, he neuer tempted you: now hee will sooner tempt you, and be more busie about you then Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>Those that will shunne Ambition, (for which the wrath of God hangeth heauy ouer this our Cittie,) must with-drawe their eyes from vanities, haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing still to put them in minde where of they are made, and whether they must. My young nouice (what euer thou be) not yet crept out of the shell, I say vnto thee as the Prophet sayd to the King of Israell, <hi>Caue ne eas in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum illum, nam ibi insidiae sunt:</hi> Beware thou comest not in that place, for there thou art beset; So beware thou
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13421:47"/>
comest not to the Court, or to <hi>London,</hi> for there thou shalt be beset. Beset with ambition, beset with vanitie, beset with all the sinnes that may be. The way to know Ambition when it inuades thee, is to obserue and watch thy selfe when thou first fallest into a selfe-loue: if selfe-loue hath seazed on thee, shee will stand on no meane tearmes, nor be content to liue as a common drudge. None (in any case) must stand in her light, the Sun must shine on none but her. Whatsoeuer a man naturally desires, is Ambition. <hi>Quod habere non vis est valde bonum, quod esse non vis hoc est bonum.</hi> There is nothing is not Ambition, but that which a man would not haue, or would not be. <hi>Hauing foode and clothing,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> willeth <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> vs) <hi>let vs be content:</hi> what more we require to content, is Ambition. What more then the contented blessed state of an Angell the diuell gap't after, was that which cast him out of Heauen. Wee are sent in warfare into this world, to beare armes and sight it out with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels chiefe Basso, Ambition. Vnder Christs standard we march, hee is our Leader, small is his Armie, and but a handfull in comparison of the others: his outwarde pompe simple, his prouision (in sight) slender or none at all.</p>
            <p>If vpon these cousiderations (as distrusting his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,) we shall grow in mislike with him, and reuolt to Ambition his enemy, and betray him, shal we euer look him in the face more, or will he euer after acknowledge vs? O no, not only he shall forsake vs, but that rich bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Basso, Ambition: (like a wise Prince that will trust no Traytours.) As soone as euer they are come neere him, downe the hill they climbed vp to him, shall hee headlong reuerse them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:13421:48"/>
Euen in this dilatement against Ambition, the diuel seekes to set in a foote of affected applause, and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fames Ambition in my stile, so as he incited a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Philosophers (in times past,) to prosecute their ambition of glory, in writing of glories contemptible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. I resist it and abhorre it, if any thing be here pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that may pierce or profite, heauenly Christ (not I) haue the praise. <hi>London</hi> looke to Ambition, or it will lay thee desolate like <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Onely the ambitious shaking off the yoke of the Romans, was the bane of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> The dust in the streets (being come of the same house that we are of, and seeing vs so proud and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,) thinks with her selfe, why should not she, that is discended as well as we, raise vp her plumes as wee doe. And thats the reason shee borrowes the winges of the wind so oft to mount into the ayre: and many times she dasheth her selfe in our eyes, as who would say, Are you my Kinsmen and will not know me? O what is it to bee Ambitious, when the dust of the streete (when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth her) can be Ambitious.</p>
            <p>The Iewes euer when they mourned, rent their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as it were to take reuenge on them for making them proude and Ambitious, and keeping them all the while from the sight of their nakednesse. Then they put on Sack-cloth, and that Sack-cloth they sprinkled ouer with dust, and ouer-whelmed with ashes, to put God in mind, that if he should arm his displeasure against them, he should but contend with dust &amp; ashes: and what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or prayse could they afford him? <hi>Shall the dust praise thee</hi> (sayth <hi>Dauid) or those that goe downe to the pit glorifie thee?</hi> Besides, it signified, that whereas they had lifted themselues aboue their creation, and forgot by whom
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13421:48"/>
and of what they were made, now they repented and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their first image; In al prostrate humility they confest, that the breath of the Lord, (as easie as the wind disperseth dust) might disperse them, and bring them to nothing. Did Ambition afford vs any content, or were it ought but a desire of disquiet, it were some-what.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Augustine,</hi> now I call to minde the tale of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, in the sixt Chapter of thy sixt booke of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, where describing thy selfe to be a young man, puft vp with the Ambition of that time, thou wert chosen to make an Oration before the Emperour, in which, (hauing toyled thy wirs to their highest wrest,) thou thought'st to haue purchast Heauen and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Comming to pronounce it, thy tongue (like <hi>Orpheus</hi> strings) drewe all eares vnto it: the Emperour thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly pleasedst, because thou exceedingly &amp; hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically praisedst. Admiration encompast thee, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation stro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e to be as eloquent as thou in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. But what was all this to the purpose, the Bladder was burst that had so long swelled, winde thou spents, and nought but winde thou gainedst. For good words, good words were returned thee: like one that gaue <hi>Augustus</hi> Greeke verses, and he for his reward gaue him Greeke verses againe. The heauen thou dreamedst of, being attained, seemed so inferior to thy hopes, that it cast thee headlong into hell; Home againe (in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy) with thy companions thou returnedst, where by the way in a greene Meddow, thou espiedst a poore drunken Begger (his belly being full) heighing, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dauncing, fetching strange youthfull friskes, and taking care for nothing. With that thousighedst,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13421:49"/>
and entredst into this discourse with thy companions.</p>
            <p>O what is Ambition, that it should not yeeld so much content as beggery? Miserable is that life where none is happy but the miserable. Trauel &amp; care for welth, riches and honor, is but care &amp; trauel for trauel and care. Mad and foolish are wee, who watch and study how to vexe our selues, and in hunting after a vaine shadow of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hunt and start vp more and more causes of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This Begger hath not burnt candles al night a month together as I haue done, he hath made no Oration to the Emperor to day, and yet hee is merry: I that haue poor'd out mine eies vpon books, and wel-ny spit out all my brain at my tongues end this morning, am dumpish, drousy, and wish my self dead: and yet if any man should ask me if I would willingly die, or exchange my state with the Begger, I feare I shold hardly condiscend. Such is my ambition, such is my foolish delight in my vnrest.</p>
            <p>Hee hauing but a little money, and a few dung-hill rags clouted together on his backe, hath true content, I (with my grieuous heart-breakings and painfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots,) haue laid to ouer-take it, and canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. Hee is io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund, I am ioylesse: hee secure, I fearefull. There is no learning or Arte leading to true felicity, but the Arte of beggery. Vngratefull knowledge, that for all the body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wasting industry I haue vsed in thy compasment, hast not blest me so much as this Begger. I hauing thee, hee wanting thee, is preferred in harts-ease before mee. No delight or hearts-ease receiued I from thee, for I haue spoke not to teach, but to please. Vild double-fac't Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that art good for nothing but to fatten sinne with thy flattery, that callest it giuing immortality, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou magnifiest vices for vertues, and challengest great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13421:49"/>
of Kings and nobility for dissembling: heere I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thee as the Parasite of Arts, the whorish pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of imperfections, and onely Patronesse of sinne.</p>
            <p>To this scope (reuerend <hi>Augustine)</hi> tended thy plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue speech, though I haue not exprest it in the same words: but the operation in thee it brought forth, was that from the meditation of beggerly content, thou wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedst (by degrees) into the depth of the true heauenly content. O singular worke contriued by weake meanes. O rarely honoured beggery, to be the instrument of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling so rich a soule. O faithlesse and peruerse genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (saith Christ vnto vs as hee said to the Iewes,) how <note place="margin">Math. 17</note> long shall I be with you, how long shall I suffer you, ere my miracles work in you the like meditation. All of you are ambitious of much prosperity, long life and many daies for your bodies: none of you haue care of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie of your soules.</p>
            <p>There is a place in the Ile of <hi>Paphos</hi> where there neuer fell raine: there is a place within you called your hearts, where no drops of the dewe of grace can haue accesse; Your daies are as swift as a Post, yea swifter then a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers shuttle, they fly and see no good thing: yet flie you swifter to hell then they. <hi>Veniunt anni vt eant,</hi> (sayth <hi>Austine) non veniunt vt stant,</hi> yeers come that they may trauell on, and not stand still: passing by vs they spoile vs, and lay vs open to the tiranny of a cruell enemy, Death. O if we loue so this miserable and finite life, how ought we to loue that celestial and infinite life, where we shall enioy all pleasures so plentifull, that Ambition shal haue nothing ouer-plus to worke on.</p>
            <p>Here we labour, drudge and moyle, yet for all our labouring, drudging and moyling, cannot number the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13421:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things we lacke. Wee are neuer long at ease, but some crosse or other afflicteth vs. As the earth is compassed round with waters, so are we (the inhabitants thereof) compassed round with woes. Wee see great men die, strong men die, witty men die, fooles die, rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, poore Artificers, Plowmen, Gentlemen, high men, low men, wearish men, grosse men, and the fairest complexiond men die, yet we perswade our selues wee shall neuer die. Or if we do not so perswade our selues, why prepare we not to dy? VVhy doo we raigne as Gods on the earth that are to be eaten with wormes? Should a man with <hi>Zerxes,</hi> but enter into this conceite with himselfe, that as he sees one old man caried to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, so within threescore yeeres, not one of all our gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steting Courtiers, not one of all our faire Ladies, not one of all our stout Souldiers and Captaines, not one of al this age throughout the world should be left, what a dampe and deadly terror would it strike. Temples of stone and Marble decay and fall downe, then thinke not Ambition to out-face death, that art but a Temple of flesh. <hi>Diues</hi> died and was buried, <hi>Lazarus</hi> died and was buried, brasen-fore-head Ambition, thou shalt die and be buried. King or Queen what-euer, thou shalt die and be buried.</p>
            <p>Alas, what madde hare-brain'd sots are we, wee will take vp a humour of Ambition which we are not able to vphold, and know assuredly (ere many yeeres) we must be throwne downe from: yet come what will, (at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures) we will go thorowe with it; Wee will be Gods and Monarchs in our life, though we be diuels af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. Ouer and ouer I repeat it double and treble, that the spirit of monarchizing in priuate men, is the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13421:50"/>
spirit of <hi>Lucifer.</hi> Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>Hee that will be greatest amongst you, shal be the least:</hi> so say I, that he which will be the greatest in any state, or seeketh to make his posterity greatest, shall be the least; The least accounted of, the least reuerenced, (for none that is get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ambitious, but is generally hated.) His posterity (though he establish them neuer so) shall not hold out. Fooles shal squander, in an houre, all the auarice of their ambitious wise Auncesters.</p>
            <p>Ambition, on the sands thou buildst, regard thy soule more then thy sons &amp; daughters: let poore men gleane after thy Cart, cast thy bread vpon the Waters. Thy greedines of the World, teacheth the diuell to be gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of thy soule. He accuseth his spirits and vpbraideth them of sloth by thee, saying: Mortall men in these and these many yeeres, can heape together so manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and what is it that they haue a minde to, which they get not into their hands: but you Drones and Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, (that in celerity &amp; quicknes shold out-start them,) ly sleeping &amp; stretching your selues by the harth of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, and haue no care to looke about for the encrease of our Kingdome. Heauen gate is no bigger then the eye of a needle, yet ambitious worldly men (hauing their backs like a Cammels, bunched with cares, and betrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with bribes and oppressions,) thinke to enter in at it.</p>
            <p>Ambition, Ambition harken to me, there will bee a blacke day when thy Ambition shall breake his necke, when thou shalt lie in thy bed as on a Racke, stretching out thy ioints: when thine eyes shall start out of thy head, and euery part of thee be wrung as with the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chollick. In midst of thy fury and maladie, when thou
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13421:51"/>
shalt laugh and trifle, folter with thy tongue, rattle in thy throat, be busie in folding and doubling the clothes, and seratching and catching whatsoeuer comes neere thee: then (as the possessed with the Calentura,) thou shalt offer to leape, and cast thy selfe out of the top of thine house, thou shalt burst thy bowels and crack thy cheeks in striuing to keepe in thy soule; When thou shouldst look vp to Heauen, thou shalt be ouer-looking thy Wil, and altering some clause of it, when thou shouldst bee commending thy spirit.</p>
            <p>In thy life hast thou sought more then what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, therfore at thy death shalt thou neglect that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Ambition, (like <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> thou knowest not the time of thy visitation: for thou hast sought in this world to gather great promotions vnto thee, and not gather thy selfe vnder Christs wing, <hi>Thy house shal be lest desolate vnto thee.</hi>

            <p>A speciall branch of this Ambition is Auarice, as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or couetise there is nothing that so engenders Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.

            <p>This is the course now a dayes euery one taketh to bee rich: being a young Trader, and hauing of olde
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13421:52"/>
Mumpsimus (his auaritious Maister) learned to bee his Crafts-maister, for a yeere or two he is very thrifty, and husbandly he paies &amp; takes as duly as the clock strikes, he seemeth very sober and precise and bringeth all men in loue with him. When he thinketh he hath thorowly wrung himselfe into the Worlds good opinion, and that his credite is as much as he will demaund, hee goes and tries it, and on the Tenter-hookes stretches it. No man he knoweth but he will scrape a little Booke curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of, two or three thousand pound (perhaps) makes vp his mouth. When he hath it all in his hands, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or two he reuels it, and cuts it out in the vvhole cloath.</p>
            <p>Hee falls acquainted with Gentlemen, frequents Ordinaries and Dicing-houses dayly, where when some of them (in play) haue lost all their mony, he is very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent at hand, on their Chaines, or Bracelets, or Iewels, to lend them halfe the value: Now this is the nature of young Gentlemen, that where they haue broke the Ise and borrowed once, they will come againe the second time; and that these young foxes knowe, as well as the Begger knowes his dish. But at the second time of their comming, it is doubtfull to say whether they shall haue money or no. The world growes hard, and wee all are mortal, let them make him any assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce before a Iudge, and they shal haue som hundred pounds <hi>(per co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence)</hi> in Silks and Veluets. The third time if they come, they shall haue baser commodities: the fourth time Lute strings and gray Paper; And then I pray pardon mee, I am not for you, pay me that you owe mee and you shal haue any thing.</p>
            <p>When thus this young Vsurer hath thrust all his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13421:52"/>
pedlary into the hands of nouice heyres, and that hee hath made of his 3. thousand, nine thousand in Bonds and Recognisances, (besides the strong faith of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures) he breakes, and cries out amongst his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, that he is vndone by trusting Gentlemen; his kind heart hath made him a begger: and warnes all men (by his example) to beware how they haue any dealings with them. For a quarter of a yeere or thereabouts, he slips his neck out of the coller, and sets some graue man of his kindred, (as his Father-inlaw or such like,) to goe and report his lamentable mischaunce to his Creditors, and what his honest care is to pay euery man his owne as farre as he is able. His Creditors (thinking all is Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel he speaks, and that his state is lower ebbed then it is,) are glad to take any thing for their owne: so that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as three thousand pound is due, in his absence al is satis-fied for eight hundred, (his Father-inlaw making them belieue he laies it out of his owne purse.)</p>
            <p>All matters thus vnder-hand discharged, my young Merchant returnes, and sets vp fresher then euer he did. Those Bonds and Statutes he hath, hee puts in sute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. For a hundred pound commodity, (which is not forty poand money,) he recouers by relapse, some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound a yeere. In three Tearmes, of a banqrout he wexeth a great landed man, and may compare with the best of his Company. O intollerable Vsury not the Iews (whose peculiar sinne it is,) haue euer committed the like.</p>
            <p>What I write is most true, and hath beene practised by more then one or two. I haue a whole Booke of young Gentlemens cases lying by me, which if I should set foorth, some graue Auntients (within the hearing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13421:53"/>
of Bow-bell) would bee out of charity with me. How euer I flie from particularities, this I will proue, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in any Citty (since the first assembly of societies) was euer suffered such notorious cosonage and villa ny, as is shrouded vnder this seauentie-fold vsury of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is a hundred parts more hatefull then Conny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catching: it is the Nurse of sinnes, without the which, the fire of them all would be extinguisht, and want mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to feed on.</p>
            <p>Poets talke of enticing Syrens in the Sea, that on a sunny-day lay forth their golden trammels, their Iuory necks, and their siluer breasts to entice men, sing sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, glance piercingly, play on Lutes rauishingly; but I say, There is no such Syrens by Sea as by Land, nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as men: those are the Syrens, that hang out their shining Silkes and Veluets, and dazle Prides eyes with their deceitfull haberdashry. They are like the Serpent that tempted <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, who wheras God stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, what trees and fruites he should eate on, and goe no further, he entic'd him to breake the bondes of that stint, and put into his head what a number of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pleasures he should reape thereby; So wheras care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Fathers send their children to this Citty, in all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-like qualities to bee trained vp, and stint them to a moderate allowance, sufficient (indifferently hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded) to maintaine their credite euery way, and profit them in that they are sent hither for: what doo our couetous Cittie blood-suckers, but hire Pandars, and professed parasiticall Epicures, to close in with them, and (like the Serpent) to alienate them from that ciuill course vvherein they vvere setled. Tis ryot and misgouernment, that must deliuer them

ower into their hands to be deuoured.</p>
            <p>Those that here place their children to learne witte, and see the world, are like those that in <hi>Affrick</hi> present their children (when they are first borne) before Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents: which if the children (they so present) with their very sight scare away the Serpents, then are they legitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, otherwise they are Bastards. A number of poore chyldren &amp; sucklings (in comparison) are in the Court, and Innes of Court, presented to these Serpents, and stinging Extortioners of <hi>London,</hi> who neuer flye from them, but with their tayle winde them in, and sucke out their soules without scarring their skinne. Whether they be legittimate or no, that are so exposed to these Serpents, I dare not determine, for feare of enuie; But sure legitimately (or as they shold) they are not brought vp, that are manumited from their parents awe, as soone as they can goe and speake.</p>

            <p>O Country Gentlemen, I wonder you doe not lay

your heads together and put vp a generall supplication to the Parliament, against those priuy Canker wormes &amp; Catterpillers. Which of you all but (amongst them) hath his Heyre cosend, fetcht in, and almost consumed past recouery; Besides, his minde is cleane transposed from his originall, all deadly sinne he is infected with, all diseases are hanging about him.</p>
            <p>If one tice a Prentise to robbe his Maister, it is fellony by the law; nay, it is a great penalty, if he do but relieue him and incourage him, beeing fled from his Maisters obedience and seruice: and shall we haue no Law for him that ticeth a sonne to robbe his Father? Nay, that shall robbe a Father of his sonne, robbe God of a soule? Euery Science hath some principles in it, which must be belieued, and cannot be declared. The principles and practises of vsury exceed declaration, belieue them to be lewder then penne can with modesty expresse; enquire not after them, for they are execrable. <hi>De rebus male ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitis, non gaudebit tertius heres,</hi> Ill gotten goods neuer trouble the third heyre. <hi>Euery plant</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>my heauenly father hath not planted, shall be rooted out.</hi> Plant they neuer so their posterity with the reuenewes of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, since God hath not planted them, they shall be ruin'd and rooted out.

            <p>
               <hi>Augustine</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his second Booke of Confessions, pittifully complaineth how heynously he had offended when he was a young man, in leading his companions to rob a Peare-tree in their next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Orchard: <hi>Amaui perire O Domine,</hi> (he exclaimes) <hi>amaui perire, amaui defectum turpis animae et desiliens a Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamento:</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:13421:54"/>
               <hi>malitie me caeusa nulla esset nifimalitia:</hi> I loued to perish (O Lord,) I loued to perrish, in my vngratious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse I delighted (foule of soule that I was) and quite sly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Firmament: of my malice there was no cause but malice. Of the stealing and beating downe of a few Peares, this holy Father makes such a burdenous matter of conscience, as that he counted it his vtter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and back-slyding from the Firmament: Vsurers make no conscience of cosoning and robbing men of whole Orchards, of whole fields, of whole Lordships; Of their malice and theft, there is some other cause then malice, which is Auarice.</p>
            <p>If the stealing of one Apple in Paradise, brought such an vniuersall plague to the world, what a plague to one soule will the robbing of a hundred Orphans of their possessions and fruite-yards bring? In the Country the Gentleman takes in the Commons, racketh his Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts, vndoeth the Farmer. In <hi>London</hi> the Vsurer snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vp the Gentleman, giues him Rattles and Babies for his ouer-rackt rent, and the Commons he tooke in, he makes him take out in commodities. None but the Vsurer is ordained for a scourge to Pride and Ambition. Therefore it is that Bees hate Sheepe more then any thing, for that when they are once in their wooll, they are so intangled that they can neuer get out. Therfore it is that Courtiers hate Merchants more then any men, for that being once in their bookes, they can neuer get out. Many of them carry the countenances of Sheep, looke simple, goe plain, were their haire short, but they are no Sheep, but Sheep-byters: their wooll or their wealth, they make no othervse of but to snarle and enwrap men with. The law (which was instituted to redresse wrongs
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13421:55"/>
and oppressions,) they wrest contrarily, to oppresse and to wrong with. And yet thats not so much wonder, for Law, Logique and the Swizers, may be hir'd to fight for any body; and so may an Vsurer (for a halfepeny gaine) bee hyred to bite any body. For as the Beare cannot drinke but he must byte the water, so cannot hee coole his auaritious thirst, but hee must plucke and bite out his Neighbours throate.</p>

No men so much as Vsurers, coueteth the deuill to bee great with; He is called <hi>Mammon,</hi> the God or Prince of this World: that is, The God and Prince of Vsurers and Penny-fathers. Nay more, euery Vsurer of himselfe is a deuill, since this word <hi>Daemon,</hi> signifieth nought but <hi>Sypiens,</hi> a subtile worldly Wise-man.</p>
            <p>When a Legion of deuils (in the Land of the <hi>Gargi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens)</hi> were cast forth of two men that came out of graues, they desired they might goe into hogs or swine, (which are Vsurers,) many of those Hogges or Swine, they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into the Sea: many of our hoggish Vsurers the deuill tumbles for gaine into the Sea. Vsurers (with the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13421:55"/>
draffe of this world) so feede and fatten the deuils, that now they almost passe not of possessing any man else. The Iewes were all Hogges, that is, Vsurers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there had beene no diuine restraint for it, yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe would haue dissawded them from eating Swines-flesh, that is, from feeding on one another. The Prodigall-childe in the Gospell, is reported to haue fed Hogges, that is, Vsurers, by letting them beguile him of his substance.</p>
            <p>As the Hogge is still grunting, digging &amp; wrooting in the mucke, so is the Vsurer still turning, tossing, digging, and wrooting in the muck of this world; like the Hog he carries his snoute euer-more down-ward, and nere looks vp to Heauen.</p>
            <p>Christ sayd, <hi>It was not meete the childrens bread should be taken from them and giuen vnto dogges,</hi> no more is it meete, that the childrens lyuing and substance should be taken from them and giuen vnto Hogges. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>We must not doe euill that good may come of it:</hi> there is no euill which a hoggish Vsurer will not doe, so that goods <note place="margin">Rom, 3.</note> or profit may come of it.

no more but seeke and it is yours, knocke and it shall be opened. With lesse sure (I assure you) is the kingdome of Heauen obtained, then a sute for a Pension or office to an earthly King, which though a man hath 20. yeares followed, and hath better then three parts and a halfe of a promise to haue confirmed, yet if hee haue but a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an enemy in the court, it is casheird and non-suted. God will not be corrupted, he is not partiall as man is, he hath no Parasites about him, hee seeth with his owne eyes, and not with the eyes of those that spake for bribes. Hee is not angry, or commands vs to bee driuen backe when we are importunate: but hee commands vs to bee importunate, and is angry if we be not importunate. In the Parable of the godlesse Iudge and the importunate Widdow, hee teacheth that importunity may get any thing of him.</p>
            <p>So in the similitude of the man that came to his friend at midnight, to desire him to lend him three loaues, and his friend aunswered him.

How much more shall our GOD giue vs what wee aske, that asketh no other treuage at our handes for giuing, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and thanksgiuing. We must hunger and thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter righteousnes, and we shall be satis-fied.

all the beasts of the field) hungering &amp; thirsting after righteousnesse hold his peace? Would God euer haue encouraged him with a blessing to hunger and thirst, but that the extremity of hunger and thirst, might driue him to the extreamity of importunity and prayer. <hi>I cryed vnto the Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid) and he heard me:</hi> Hee did not coldly, bashfully, or formally onely, cry to the Lord, as not caring whether hee were heard or no, but hee cryed vnto him with his whole hart: euen to the Lord he cryed, and he heard him. <hi>Ezekias</hi> cryed vnto the Lord, and he heard him.

            <p>Vsurers, you are none of these cryers vnto God, but those that hourely vnto God are most cryde out against. God hath cryde out vnto you by his Preachers, GOD hath cride out vnto you by the poore; Prysoners on their death-beds haue cride out of you: and when they haue had but one houre to intercessionate for their soules, and sue out the pardon of their numberlesse sins, the whole part of that howre (sauing one minute, when in two words they cryde for mercy,) haue they spent, in crying for vengeance against you. After they were dead, their Coffins haue beene brought to your doores in the open face of Cheapside, and ignominious Ballads made of you, which euery Boy would chaunt vnder your nose: yet will not you repent, nor with all this crying be awaked out of your dreame of the Diuell and <hi>Diues.</hi> Therefore looke that when on your death-beddes you
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13421:58"/>
shall lye, and crye out of the Stone, the Strangullion &amp; the Gout, you shall not be heard, your paine shall be so wrastling, tearing, and intollerable, that you shall haue no leisure to repent or pray: no nor so much as lift vppe your hands, or think one good thought.

            <p>As the deuill in the second of <hi>Iob,</hi> being asked from whence he came, answered, <hi>From compassing the earth,</hi> so you being askd at the day of iudgement, from whence you come, shall answer; From compassing the Earth, For Heauen you haue not compast or purchast, therfore shall Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire be your portion. <hi>Euery man shall receiue of God according to that in his body he hath wrought.</hi> If in your bodies you haue done no good works, of God you shall receiue no good words.

Good deedes deriued from faith, are Rampiers or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes raised vp against the deuill: he that hath no such Bulwarke of good deedes to resist the deuills battery, cannot chuse but haue his soules-citty soone raced.</p>
            <p>Good deeds are a tribute which we pay vnto God for defending vs from al our ghostly enemies, &amp; planting his peace in our consciences. In stead of the ceremoniall Lawe, burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices, (which are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,) God hath giuen vs a new Law, To loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that is, to shew the fruites of loue, which are good deedes to one another.

            <p>From Ambition and Auarice, his suborner, let mee progress to the second son of Pride, which is, Vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13421:60"/>
This Vaine-glory, is any excessiue pride or delight which we take in things vnnecessarie; Much of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is it of Ambition, but it is not so dangerous, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant about so great matters as Ambition. It is (as I may call it) the froth &amp; seething vp of Ambition. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition that cannot containe it selfe, but it must hop and bubble aboue water. It is the placing of praise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne in contemptible things. As he that takes a glory in estranging himselfe from the attyre and fashions of his owne Country. Hee that taketh a glory to weare a huge head of haire like <hi>Absalom.</hi> He that taketh a glory in the glistering of his apparell and his perfumes, and thinks euery one that sees him, or smels to him, should be in loue with him. He that taketh a glory in hearing himselfe talke, and stately pronouncing his words. Hee that taketh a glory to bring an oath out with a grace, to tell of his cosonages, his surfetings, and drunkennesse, and whoredomes. He that (to be counted a Caualeir, and a resolute braue man) cares not what mischiefe hee do, whom he quarrels with, kils or stabbes.</p>
            <p>Such was <hi>Pausanias</hi> that kild <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for fame or vaine-glory. So did <hi>Herostratus</hi> burne the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> (whereof I talkt in the leafe before,) to get him an eternall vaine-glory. The Spaniards are wonderfull vaine-glorious. Many Souldiers are most impatient vaine-glorious, in standing vpon their honor in euery trifle, &amp; boasting more then euer they did. They are vaine-glorious also in commending one another for murders and braules: which (if they weighed aright) is the most ignominy that may be. By a great oth they wil sweare, he is a braue, delicate, sweet man, for he kild such &amp; such a one: as if they should say, <hi>Caine</hi> was a braue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate

               </gap>ians are odde fantastick vaine-glorious. There is vaine-glory in building, in banqueting, in being Diogenicall and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: in voluntary pouerty and deuotion. Great is their vaine-glory also, that will rather reare themselues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Marble, then monuments of good deedes in mens mouthes. In a word, as <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>Non est Domine in quo gloriaripossim, sed in Cruce Domini Iesu Christi:</hi> There is no true glory, all is vain-glory, but in the Crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ. The lewes vaine-glory and presumptuous confidence in their Temple, was one of the chiefe sinnes that pluckt on their <hi>desolation.</hi> In that Chapter where our Sauiour gaue iudgement ouer <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> how bitterly did he inueigh against the hypocrisie and vaine glory of the Scribes and Pharisies.</p>
            <p>Let vs examine what this hypocrisie and vaine-glorie was he inueighed so against, and see if there be any such amongst vs here in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, he accuseth them, <hi>Of binding heauie burdens and</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:13421:61"/>
               <hi>too grieuous to bee borne, and laying them on other mens shoulders, and not moouing them with one finger themselues.</hi> That is as much to say, as States of a Country should make burdenous Lawes, to oppresse and keepe vnder the Communalty, and looke seuerely to the obseruation of them, but would keepe none of them them-selues, nor will not so much as deigne with one finger to touch them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The did all their workes to bee seene of men,</hi> So doe they that will doe no good worke, but to be put in the Chronicles after their death: so doe they that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely wil seeme the most precise iusticiaries vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but priuately mittigate their sentence for mony &amp; <note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> gyfts, <hi>which blind the wise, &amp; subuert the words of the iust.</hi> The especiall thing Christ in the Pharisies reproueth that they did to be seene of men, was the wearing of their large <hi>Philactaries.</hi> Those <hi>Philactaries</hi> (as S. <hi>Ierom</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ierom on the 23. of Mathew.</note> sayth) were broade peeces of Parchment, whereon they wrote the tenne commaundements, and folding them vp close together, bound them to their fore-heade, and so wore them alwaies before their eyes, imagining thereby they fulfilled that which was said: <hi>they shall bee alwaies immoucable before thine eres.</hi> That which they had alwaies vaine-gloriously before their eies, that haue we alwaies vaine-gloriously in our mouthes, but seldom or neuer in our harts. Neuer was so much professing, &amp; so little practising, so many good words, and so few good deeds.</p>
            <p>The third obiection against the Pharisies, was, <hi>That they loued the highest places at feastes, the chiefe seates in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and greeting in the Market-place:</hi> Which is as much to say, as that they were arrogant, haughty min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13421:62"/>
and insolent: that they had no spyrite of humility or meekenesse in them; They were besotted with the pryde of their owne singularity, they thought no man worthy of any honour but themselues. By intrusion and not standing on curtesie, they gotte to sitte highest at Feastes, and be preferr'd in Assemblies: which appeareth by that which followeth some few verses after: <hi>For who soeuer will exalt himselfe, shall be brought lowe, and whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will humble himselfe, shal be exalted.</hi> Which inferreth, that they did intrude or exalt themselues, and were not exalted other-wise: therefore they should be humbled or brought low. Diuers like Pharasies haue wee, that will proudly exalt themselues.</p>
            <p>After this, our Sauiour breathes out many woes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. First, <hi>For shutting vp the Kingdom of heauen from before men, and neither entring themselues, nor suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring those that would to enter.</hi> Next, <hi>For deuouring wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes houses vnder pretence of long prayers.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>For compassing Sea and Lande to seduce.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>For their false and fond distinction and interpretation of othes.</hi> Fiftly <hi>For tithing mynt and Anise seeed and commin, &amp; leauing weightier matters of the law, iudgement, mercy, and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, foreslowed: for straining at a Gnat, and swallowing a Camell.</hi> Sixthly <hi>For making cleane the outside of the cuppe or the platter, when within they were full of bribery and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</hi> Seauenthly <hi>For they were like vnto whited toombes, which appeare beautifull outward, but within are full of dead mens bones, and all filthines.</hi> Eightly, <hi>For they built the Toombes of the Prophets, and garnisht the sepulchers of the righteous, whose doctrine they refused to be ruled by.</hi> Which of all these eyght woes but we haue incurred.</p>
            <p>Peculiarly apply them I will not, for feare their refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13421:62"/>
might be offensiue: but let euery one that is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in any of them, apply them priuately to himselfe, least euery childe in the streete apply them openly to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London</hi> looke to thy selfe, for the woes that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> are pronounced to theee. Thou transgressing as grieuously as shee, shalt be punished as greuously. Fly from sinne, take no pride nor vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it: for pride or vaine-glory in sinne, is a horrible sinne, though it be without purpose to sinne. Ah what is sinne that we should glory in it? To glory in it is to glory that the deuill is our father. Dooth the Peacocke glory in his foule feete? Dooth he not hang downe the tayle when he lookes on them? Doth the Buck (hauing be filtht himselfe with the female,) lift vp his hornes and walke proudly to the lawnes? O no, he so hateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) by reason of the stinch of his commixture,) that all drouping and languishing into some solitary Ditche he with-drawes himselfe, and takes soyle, and batheth till suck time as there fall a great shoure of rayne, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughly washed &amp; clensed, he posteth back to his food.</p>
            <p>Of the Peacock, of the Buck, nor any other bruit beast can we be taught to loath our filth, but (contrary to nature,) farre worse then brute beastes, wee are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored <note place="margin">Aug. lib 3. de lib. arbit.</note> of the fauour of it. <hi>Omne vitium eo ipso quod vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium est, contra naturam est.</hi> Euery vice as it is a vice is contrary to nature. Takes the deuil a vain-glory or pride that he is exiled out of heauen? No, hee rueth, hee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, he enuies God, men and Angells, that they should liue in the kingdome of light, and hee in the vallie of darknesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:13421:63"/>
What cowarde is there that will brage or glory hee was beaten and disarmed. If wee had the witte to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the basenesse of sinne, or from what abiect Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it is sprung, wee would hate it as a Toade, and flye from it as an Adder. Not without reason haue many learned Writers, called it Bestiall, for it is all deriued &amp; borrowed from Beastes. Pride and inflamation of hart, we borrow from the Lyon, auarice from the Hedghog, luxury, ryot, and sensuality from the Hogge: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we call a leatcherous person, a boarish companion. Enuy from the Dogge, Ire or wrath from the Wolfe, gluttony or gurmandise from the Beare, and lastly sloth from the Asse. So that as vvee apparraile our selues in Beastes skinnes, in selfe same sort we clothe our soules in their skinnes. But if wee did imitate ought but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of Beasts, (or of the best Beastes, but the worst Beastes,) it were some-what: if we had any sparke or taste of their perfections, wee were not so to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. We haue no sparke, no taste, we are nothing but a compound of vncleanes.</p>
            <p>Let vs not glory that wee are men, who haue put on the shapes of Beastes. Thrice blessed are Beastes that die soone, and after this life feele nohell; Woe vnto vs, we shall, if wee appeare to God in the image of beastes, and soone redeeme not from sathan the image of our creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath stolne from vs. O singuler subtilty of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, so to sweeten the poyson of our perdition, that it shold be more relishsome and pleasant vnto vs, then the nectarized <hi>Aquacaelestis</hi> of water-mingled blood, sluced from Christs side. We glory, in that we are in the high-way to be throwne from glory: Wee will not heare our Folders or Sheepehearps, that would gather vs to glory.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13421:63"/>
Our Lord rode vppon at Asse when he gouerned the lawes, vnder the Law (in comparison of vs,) we are the vnbroken-Colt, (including the Gentiles,) which hee commaunded (with the Asse) to be brought vnto him. This thousand and odde hundred yeeres hath he beene breaking vs to his hand, and now, (when he had thought to haue found vs fitte for the saddle,) we are wilder and further of then euer we were. Wee kicke and winche, and will by no meanes endure his managing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (though vtterly wearied with both) better he estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of his old obstinate slow Asse, the Iewes, (which therfore he cast off, for they had tir'd him with continual beating,) then of the vntoward Colt, (vs the Gentiles) that will not be bridled.</p>
            <p>Ambition and vain-glory, make vs beare vp our necks stifly, and bend our heads backward from the reyne, but age will make vs stoope thrice more forward, and warpe our backs in such a round bundle, that with declyning, our snoutes shall digge our graues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> thou needst not bee ambitious, thou needst not be vaine-glorious, for ere this thou hast been bowed and burdned till thy backe crackt. As the Israelites were tenne times led into captiuity, so seauen times hast thou beene ouer-runne and conquered. In thy strength thou boasts, God with the weake confoundeth the strong. The least lifting vp of his hand, makes thy men of warre fall backward. Say thou art walled with Seas, how easie are thy walls ouer-come? Who shall defende thy walls if the ciuill sworde waste thee? With more enemies is not <hi>India</hi> besette then thou art. Vngratefully hath God giuen thee long peace and plenty, since whereas warre can but breed vices, thy peace and plenty hath begotte
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13421:64"/>
more sinnes, then warre ouer hearde of, or the Sunne hath <hi>Atoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet learne to leaue of thy vaine-glory, that God may glory in thee. Learne to despise the world, despise vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, despise thy selfe, to despise despysing, and lastly, to despise no man. If you be of the world, you will affect the vaine-glory of the world: if you be not of the world, looke for no glory but contempt from the world. It lies in your election to draw lots, whither you will bee heyres of the glory eternall, or enioy the short breath of vaine-glory amongst men.</p>
            <p>The third sonne of Pride, is Atheisme, which is when a man is so timpaniz'd with prosperity, and entranced from himselfe, with Wealth, Ambition, and Vaine-glory, that he forgets he had a Maker, or that there is a Heauen aboue him which controules him. Too much ioy of this world hath made him drunke. I haue read of many, whom extreame ioy &amp; extreame griefe hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to runne mad; so with extreame ioy runnes he mad, he waxeth a Foole and an Idiote, and then hee sayes in his hart, <hi>There is no God.</hi> Others there be of these soule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benummed Atheists, who (hauing so farre entred in bold blasphemies, and Scripture-scorning ironies against God, that they thinke, if God be a God of any iustice and omnipotence, it cannot stand with that his iustice &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, to suffer such despight vnpunished,) for their onely refuge, perswade them-selues there is no God, and with their prophane wits innent reasons, why there should be no God.</p>
            <p>In our Sauiours time there were <hi>Saduces,</hi> that denied the Resurrection; what are these Atheists but Saducaean sectaries that deny the resurrection? They belieue they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13421:64"/>
must die, though they beleiue not the Deity. By un meanes may they auoyde what they will not admitte. Io the very houre of death, shal appeare to them a God and a deuill. In the very houre of death, to Atheisticall <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> (who mockingly called all Christians <hi>Gallileans,)</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a grizly shaggy-bodied deuill, who for all (at his sight) he recantingly cryed out, <hi>Vicisti, Galilaee, vicisti.</hi> Thine is the day, thineis the victory ô man of <hi>Galilee,</hi> yet would it not for-beare him or giue him ouer, till it had stript his soule foorth of his fleshie rinde, and tooke it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him.</p>
            <p>Those that neuer heard of God or the deuill in their life before, at that instant of their transmutation, shall giue testimony of them.</p>
            <p>This I assure my selfe, that how-euer in pride of minde, (because they would be different in paradoxisme from all the world,) some there be that fantasie phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall probabilities, of the Trinities vnexistence, yet in the inmost recourse of their consciences, they subscribe to him, and confesse him.</p>

Hee can neuer climbe to the toppe of it, which refuseth to climbe by these steppes. No knowledge but is of God. Vnworthy are wee of heauenly knowledge, if we keepe from her any one of her hand-maydes. Logique Rhethorique, History, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, Musicke, Poetry, all are the handmaydes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity. She can neuer be curiously drest, or exquisitely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht, if any one of these be wanting.</p>
            <p>God delighteth to be magnified in all his Creatures, especially, in al the excellentest of his creatures. Artes are the excellentest of his creatures, not one of them <note place="margin">Psal. 148.</note> but descended from his Throne. What saith <hi>Dauid? Praise the Lord Sunne &amp; Moone, praise him ye bright starrs, praise him heauen of heauens, &amp; waters that be aboue the heauens.</hi> That is praise the Lord Metaphusicall Philosophy, which art conuersant in all these matters: Into the maiesty and glory of the Sunne and Moone, thou seest, the bright
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13421:73"/>
Starres predominance and moouing, thou knowest the heauen of heauens, and waters that be aboue the heauens (in part though not at large) thou comprehendest: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praise him in all these. Take occasion (preachers in your sermons) from the wonders and secrets these to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, to extoll his magnificent name, and by humaine artes abstracts to glorifie him. <hi>Prayse yee the Lord</hi> (thus <hi>Dauid</hi> proceeds) <hi>yee Dragons and all deepes, Fyre, Hayle, Snow and vapours, stormy winds and tempests execute his word. Mountaines &amp; hilles, fruitfull trees and all Cedars, Beasts and Cattell: creeping thinges and fethered foules, Princes and Iudges of the world, young men and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, old men and Children, prayse yee the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is lawfull to execute his word, that is in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his word by similitudes and comparisons, drawne from the nature &amp; property of all these, to laud and amplifie the eternity of his name. Christ hee drew comparisons from the hayres of a mans head, from Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes, from Fig-trees, from Sparrowes, from Lillies and a hundred such like. Wee (in this age) count him a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Deuine, that alledgeth any illustration out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Authors, &amp; makes not all his sermons conclout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of scripture.</p>
            <p>Scripture we hotch-potch together, and do not place like pearle and Gold-lace on a garment, heere and there to adorne, but pile it, and dung it vp on heapes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vse or edification. We care not how we mispeake it so wee haue it to speake. Out it flies East and West; though we loose it all it is nothing, for more haue we of it, then we can well tell what to do withall. Violent are the most of our pack-horse Pulpit-men in vomiting, their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13421:73"/>
duncery. Their prechings seeme rather pestilentiall fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies then any thing els. They writhe Texts like waxe, and where they enuy, Scripture is their Champion to scold, and though a whole month together so they should scold they would not want alegations to cast in one anothers teeth. <hi>Non fuit sic a principio,</hi> I wis it was not so in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church but in our Church euery man wilbe a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, euery man will bee Lord and King ouer the flocke that hee feedes, or else hee will famish it: This is erring from my scope of the true vse of scripture I am to talke.</p>
            <p>Scripture if it be vsed otherwise then as the last seale to confirme any thing, if it bee triuially, or without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, cald vnto witnesse, it is a flat taking of the name of God in vaine. The phrase of Sermons as it ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the scripture, so heed must be taken that their whole Sermons seem not a banquet of broken fragments of scripture: that it be not vsd but as the corner stone to close vp any building; That they gather fruit and not leaues, proofes and not phrases onely out of the Bible. As in battaile we vse the weapons &amp; Engins of al Nations so embattelling our selues against sin, we must vse the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; arts of al Nations. Scripture must be reserud as the last volley of the victory. It is the great Ordnance which must play vpon our enemies, in the end and cheife hazard of the fight. If we refuse with <hi>Demosthenes</hi> to reserue alour weighy argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts til the latter end, like the French-men, we shal fight valiantly at the first, but quaile in the midst.</p>
            <p>Scripture is the chiefe power of GOD to saluation. Generals in a pitcht field, will not thrust forth their cheife power first. By little, and little, they will trayne, their enemy out of order with light onsets. Hee that will ascend, must from the low valleys creepe vp. higher
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13421:74"/>
and higher; with one caper or iumpe, is not the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Theology to be sealed. This is it I contend, that Stars haue their thrones of illumination allotted them in the Firmament, as well as the Sunne &amp; Moone: that humane writers haue their vse of reprouing vices, as wel as the Scriptures. It is an easie matter to praise God, in that wherein he hath placed the especiall state-house of his praises. He which out of the barrainest, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest parts of his Lords dominion, shall accumulate and leuy to his Treasury, a greater tribute then he hath out of his richest Prouinces, shall he not (of all other) doe him the most remunerablest seruice? Malicious and maleuolent are they, that will exclude any one Arte, or Athenian or Roman Author, any one creeping worme or contemptible creature, from bearing witnes of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> alleadged diuers verses out of Heathen Poets, as out of <hi>Epemenides, Aratus, Menander, Theocritus:</hi> nay, what place is it in the Scripture, where the holy Ghost doth not stoope himselfe to our capacities, by humane Metaphors &amp; similitudes. Our Atheist we haue in hand, with nothing but humane reasons will bee rebutted. Vaunt you yee speake from the holy Ghost neuer so, if you speake not in compasse of his fiue sences, he wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise you, and floute you. He hearing euery one (that in the Pulpit talkes affectedly, coldly, crabbedly or absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) say, He talkes from the mouth of God, makes both am obloquy of Gods mouth and the Ministrie. But ill shall his scoffes prosper with him; When he thinkes he hath won the greatest prize to his wit, in putting downe God, God in iudgement shall arise and reproue him. At the day of death, and at the day of iudgement, hee shal reproue him, sight-killingly with his clusterd brows,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13421:74"/>
and clowde-begetting srownes, he shall teach him, both that he is, and what he is.</p>
            <p>Reuerend Ecclesiasticall Fathers, and other speciall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled Church substitutes, you it concerneth, your king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (by these Atheists) is called in question, in calling Gods kingdome in question. Prosecute with all your authority, these <hi>Prophirtan</hi> deriders. Imitate the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who committed <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> to prison, and but for <hi>Pericles,</hi> had put him to death, for writing but a booke of the Moones eclipses, after by them she was receiued for a Goddesse. If they so far pursued the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of a feigned Goddesse, be you twise as zealous, in reuenging the disparagement of the true &amp; euer-liuing God.</p>
            <p>Proclaime disputations, threaten punishments, bee vehement in your Sermons: whatsoeuer you write or speake, intend it against Atheisme. Atheisme hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer-spread vs, our ouer-throw, your ouer-throw it wil be, except (in time) you preuent it. Fall <hi>England,</hi> fare-well peace, woe-worth our Weale and tranquilitie, if Religion bids vs fare-well. Our house shall be left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate vnto vs, for Christ of vs is left desolate and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>The fourth sonne of Pride, is Discontent, which whomsoeuer it throughly enhabiteth, it carrieth cleane away to extreames. If it light on a poore man that hath no meanes to prosecute it, it cutteth him off presently. If on a man of puissance, (be he not more then mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted circumspect,) to him and his family it is no lesse fatall. Generally it is grounded on pride, as when a man taketh vnto him a minde aboue his birth or fortune, and is not able to goe through with it. When hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13421:75"/>
to prize him selfe thus great, and so great, &amp; some man (as proud as himselfe) comes and vnder-bids him, and out-braues him. And thirdly when on iust demerrits hec hath builded but meane hopes, and those not only dy in the dust, but his iustdemerits, indignly, draw vnto him vniust hatred. For such is great mens manner, any one that is troublesome to them, or that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to, and cannot well recompence, they come to hate deadly.</p>
            <p>There is a discontent proceeding from a naturall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly humor, or caused by surfeit or misdiet. Some by ouer-studdying come to be discontent and dogged. I haue knowne many, whom shrewd or light huswiues to their wiues, vnthrift obstinate children, sutes in Law o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruled by letters from aboue, haue caused to languish and droope away in discontent. The fruites of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent are bannings, cursings, secret murmurrings, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, murder, iniustice, all which are high treasonous trespasses against God.</p>
            <p>The deuill is the father of Discontent, One of the greatest miseries of the damned, shall be discontent. No thing so much prouoketh God to iudgement as discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Hee destroyed the children of Israell whiles the meate was in their mouthes, in the Wildernes, for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murring or being discontent: their discontent was sayd to afflict him. <hi>Many a time and oft haue they afflicted mee euen from my youth vp,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid,</hi> in Gods person, speaking of their repining at the waters of strife. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whosoeuer is discontent with any crosse or calamity the Lord layeth vppon him aflicteth God, and must looke for speedy confusion. Nothing in this life reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth he so much as it. Hence it is so many stabbe, hang,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13421:75"/>
and drowne themselues, and thereby endaunger their owne soules beyond mercy. It is the grieuousest sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence God can pronounce against man, as to be his own Executioner: whereby it appeareth, that Discontent is the grieuousest sinne that man can commit.</p>
            <p>When did you euer heare of any but the disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, that offered violence to himselfe? What is the sinne against the holy Ghost, (which <hi>Augustine</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be nothing, but <hi>Desperatio morientis,</hi> to giue vp a mans soule in despaire,) but a special branch of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Wherefote did our Saniour thunder forth such a terrible woe against the causers of offence, or discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but that it was the most heynous scourge-procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring transgression of all others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionas</hi> the Lords annointed Prophet, for he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and grudged when he should haue beene sent vnto <hi>Niniui,</hi> had a torment like hel (for the time) inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon him. In the Whales belly, full of horror, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, stinch and darknes, three dayes and three nights he was shut. Hardly can God abstaine from throwing any man downe into Hell, that is vpbraidingly discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. As the merry man (of all other,) best thriueth in that he goes about, so the discontented man (of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) is most fore-spoken, and vnluckie in his enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Few discontented men shall you obserue, that giue vp the ghost in their beds.</p>
            <p>There is a Discontent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to Pride, which is most pleasing to God: which is, when a man grieues, &amp; is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, because he cannot chuse but sin &amp; rebel against God. Also when he is wearied, and discontent with the vanities of the world. So was the <hi>Preacher,</hi> when he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Vanity of vanities, &amp; all thing is vanitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:13421:76"/>
There is a tollerable Discontent likewise, which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> had, when they complained that the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of Robbers did prosper, and they were in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that prouokt God. But so little of this true discontent is there in <hi>London,</hi> that (almost) there is no content in it, but in robbing and prouoking God. <hi>Sin is no sin,</hi> (saith an auncient Father,) <hi>except it be voluntary, and we take a content in committing it.</hi> Who is there that oppresseth, committeth adultery, is prodigall, sweareth or forswea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but taketh a content in committing it? There we place content, where we should take vp discontent, and there are wee discontent, were wee should repose our whole gladnes and felicity. We are discontent, if wee heare our sinnes ript vp sharply. We are discontent, if we be detained in the seruice of God, but half an houre extraordinary. We are discontent, if we be constrained to giue to the poore. Euery man here in <hi>London,</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with the state wherein he liues. Euery one see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to vndermine another. No two of one trade, but as they are of one trade, enuy one another. Not two conioined in one office, but ouerthwart &amp; emulate one another, and one of them vndoes what the other hath done.</p>
            <p>The Court is the true kingdom of discontent. There Pride raigning most, Discontent cannot chuse but be a hanger on. No conspiracie, or warre (ciuil or outward) but first springeth from discontent. What makes a number of our wanton wiues in <hi>London,</hi> conspire the deaths of their old doting husbands, but the discontent of a death-cold bed? Discontent makes Hereticks. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content is the cause of al the Traytors beyond Sea. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, caused <hi>Ierusalems</hi> house to be left desolate vnto
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13421:76"/>
her. Discontent (O <hi>London,)</hi> will be thy destitution, if thou takest not the better heede.</p>
            <p>The fift Sonne of Pride, is Contention, which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the youngest sonne hee hath, is harder to be yoked or kept in, then any of the other fowre. It is euer in Armes, neuer out of brabblements. Look what Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Vaine-glory, Atheism, Discontent, shal consult or deuise, it enacteth, and goes thorow with. It is the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers liuing, the Hereticks food, the Swizers house and Land. No Crowne but he challengeth a share in. No Church but he will be of. On words, amphibologies, equiuocations, quiddities and quantities, he stands. He hunteth not after truth, but strife. He coueteth not so much to ouer-come, as contend.</p>
            <p>These two little words, <hi>Ex</hi> and <hi>Per,</hi> (as <hi>Cornelius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> hath obserued,) held the Greeke &amp; Latine Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches play, many yeeres together; they litigiously deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whether the holy Ghost proceeded of the Father and the Sonne, or not of the Son, but of the Father by the Sonne. So this word <hi>Nisi</hi> in this sentence, <hi>Nisi manducaueritis carnem,</hi> set all the Counsaile of <hi>Basil</hi> in an vprore. This word <hi>Donec,</hi> as, <hi>Ioseph non agnouit vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem suam donec, Ioseph</hi> knew not his wife <hi>vntill,</hi> caused the <hi>Antidicomariatans,</hi> and <hi>Eludians,</hi> to denie the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall virginity of the Virgine <hi>Mary.</hi> With a thousand such errors, Contention raiseth his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Our Diuines in these dayes, (though they yet retaine many contentions of the olde Churches,) haue found out certaine new ones of their owne. They contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout standing and sitting, about forms and substances, about prescription and confusion of prayers. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, <hi>An ater sit contrarius albo,</hi> whether it bee better to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13421:77"/>
weare a white Surplesse, or a black gowne, in ministring the Sacraments? Which is like the conflict in Rome, betwixt the <hi>Augustine</hi> Fryers and the vulgar Chanons, whether <hi>Augustine</hi> did weare a blacke Weede vpon a white Coate, or a white Weede vpon a black Coate. Like the Geometritians, they square about points and lines, and the vtter shew of things. As, this point is too-long, this point is too-short, this figure is too-much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, this line runnes not smooth, this syllogisme lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth. As Preachers, they labour not to speake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but intricately. In stead of Bread, they giue the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their Ministery, stones to throw at one another: and in stead of Fish, Serpents to sting one another. In the 13. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> the Sower that went foorth to sow, scattered some seede by the high-way side, which the Foules of the ayre peckt vp: not vnlike to them, whose Hawkes and Field-sports, peck vp all the seeds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity that should be sowne in their hearts; and a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of others, whose eyes the Foules of the valley pecke out, before the seede of saluation can haue any rooting in their soules.</p>
            <p>Other seede the Sower scattered amongst stones, and the Sunn e arising, it withered for want of earth, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling these stony streetes of <hi>London,</hi> where nothing will spring vp but oppression, auarice, and infidelitie. Other seede he disperst amongst thorns, and the thornes crept aloft and choked it. To those thornes I compare these thorny Contentioners, that choake the Word of God, with foolish controuersies, and friuolous questions. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the spirit led our Sauiour aside into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be tempted, so are there wicked spirits of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention amongst vs, that leade men aside into the woods
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13421:77"/>
and solitary places, to be tempted. Let any (be he the veriest block-head vnder heauen,) raise vp a faction, and he shall be followed and supported. Englishmen are all for innouation, they are cleane spoiled if once in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeers, they haue not a new fashion of religion. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Vitia sunt ad virtutem occasio,</hi> Contention is the occasion of seeking out the truth: but our Contentions (for the most part) are the seeking to prooue truth, no truth, after she is once found out: and preferring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability before manifest verity. We will not try her by her Peeres, (which are the best expositors,) and auncient Fathers, but by the literall Law, either not expounded, or new expounded, without any Quest of Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals or Cannons.</p>
            <p>Were it not that in reprouing Contention, I might hapely seeme contentious, I would wade a little farther in this subiect. Yet it were to no end, since fire the more it is stirred vp, the more it burneth: and heresy, the more it is stird &amp; stroue with, the more vntoward it is. Nought but sharp discipline is a fit disputant with snarling Scis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques. The Israelites, for they rooted not out the remnant of the Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ile Nations from amongst them, they were as goades in their sides, and thornes in their nostrils: so if we root not out these remnants of Scisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques from amongst vs, they will be as goades in our sides, and thornes in our nostrils. <hi>Melius est vt pereat v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, quam vt pereat vnitas:</hi> It is better that some few pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, then vnity perish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London,</hi> beware of Contention, thou art counted the nursing-mother of Contention. No Sect or Schism but thou affordest Disciples to. If thou beest too greedie of innouation and contention, the sword of inuasion and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13421:78"/>
ciuill debate, shall leaue thy house desolate vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Now come I to the Daughters of Pride, whereof Disdaine is the eldest.</p>
            <p>Disdain is a vice, in comparison of which, Ambition is a vertue. It is the extream of Ambition. It is a kind of scorne, that scorneth to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to any other thing. None are more subiect vnto it then faire women, for they disdaine any one should bee held as faire as they. They disdaine any should go before them, or sit aboue them. They disdaine any should be brauer then they, or haue more absolute pennes entertained in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses then they. This woman disdains any but she, should carry the credit of wit: another, that any should sing so sweet as shee; a third, that any should set forth the port and maiesty, in gate and behauiour like vnto her. Onely for disdaine and preheminence, their Husbands and their Loues, they draw sundry times into neuer-da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted quarrels.</p>
            <p>Such disdaine and scorne was betwixt the wiues of <hi>Iacob, Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> because the one had children, and the other none. Such disdaine was betwixt <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar.</hi> There was a disdain of shouldring amongst the Disciples, who should be greatest. <hi>Iosephs</hi> Brethren, disdained their Father should loue him better then he did them. <hi>Diues</hi> disdained <hi>Lazarus.</hi> In <hi>London,</hi> the rich disdaine the poore. The Courtier the Citizen. The Citizen the Countriman. One Occupation disdaineth another. The Merchant the Retayler. The Retayler the Craftsman. The better sort of Craftsmen the baser. The Shoomaker the Cobler. The Cobler the Carman. One nyce Dame, disdaines her next neighbour should haue that furniture to her house, or dainty dish or deuise,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13421:78"/>
which she wants. Shee will not goe to Church, because shee disdains to mixe her selfe with base companie, and cannot haue her close Pue by her selfe. She disdaines to weare that euery one weares, to heare that Preacher which euery one heares. So did <hi>Ierusalem</hi> disdain Gods Prophets, because they came in the likenesse of poore men. Shee disdained <hi>Amos,</hi> because he was a keeper of <note place="margin">Amos. 1.</note> Oxen, as also the rest, for they were of the dregges of the people; But their disdaine prosperd not with them, their house for their disdaine, was left desolate vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London,</hi> thy house (except thou repents) for thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, shall be left desolate vnto thee.</p>
            <p>The second Daughter of Pride, is Gorgeous attire. Both the Sonnes and Daughters of Pride, delight to go gorgeously. As <hi>Democritus</hi> set vp his brasen shield a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sunne, to the intent that (continually gazing on it,) he might with the bright reflection of his beamy radiation, feare out his eyes, and see no more vanities, so set they their rich embroidered sutes against the Sun, to dazle, daunt and spoile poore mens eyes that looke vpon them. Like Idols, not men, they apparrell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Blocks and stones by the Panims and Infidels, are ouer-gilded, to be honored and worshipped: so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-gilde they themselues, to bee more honored and worshipped.</p>
            <p>The women would seeme Angels here vpon earth, for which (it is to be feared) they will scarce liue with the Angels in heauen. The end of Gorgeous attyre, (both in men and women,) is but more fully to enkindle fleshly concupiscence, to assist the diuel in lustful temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Men thinke that women (seeing them so sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13421:79"/>

            <p>Euer since <hi>Euah</hi> was tempted, and the Serpent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with her, women haue tooke vpon them, both the person of the tempted, and the tempter.

Vnto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their great Grand-mother <hi>Euah,</hi> they seek to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, in being tempted and tempting. If not to tempt, and be thought worthy to be tempted, why dy they and diet they their face with so many drugs as they do, as it were to correct Gods work-manship, and reprooue him as a bungler, &amp; one that is not his crafts Maister? Why ensparkle they their eyes with spiritualiz'd distillations? Why tip they their tongues with <hi>Aurum potabile?</hi> Why fill they vp ages frets with fresh colours?

            <p>Iust to Dinner they will arise, and after Dinner, goe to bedde againe, and lie vntill Supper. Yea, sometimes (by no sicknes occasioned) they will ly in bedde three dayes together: prouided euery morning before foure a clock, they haue their broths, and their cullises, with Pearle and Gold sodden in them.

Their feete are not so well framed to the Measures, as are their eies to moue and bewitch. Euen as Angels are painted in Church-windowes, with glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous golden fronts, besette with Sunne-beames, so beset they their fore-heads on either side, with glorious bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed gleamy bushes; which rightly interpreted, should signifie beauty to sell, since a bush is not else hanged forth, but to inuite men to buy. And in <hi>Italy,</hi> when they sette any Beast to sale, they crowne his head with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and be-deck it with gaudy blossoms, as full as euer it may stick.</p>
            <p>Their heads, with their top and top gallant Lawne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baby caps, and Snow-resembled siluer curlings, they make a plaine Puppet stage of.

In their curious Antick-wouen garments, they imitate and mocke, the Wormes and Adders that must eate them.

Whiles the good Angel of mercy, stirres about the blood-springing Poole of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, haste thou to bathe in it.

Their habitations they make so resplendent and pleasurable on earth, that they haue no mind to goe to heauen. Into heauens pleasures they cannot see, for their eyes are dazled with terresti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all delights. Those that will haue their harts thorowly enflamed, with the ioies of the world to come, must place no ioy in this world, nor frame to themselues any obiect that may too much content.

On the bare ground thou lodgedst, and with abstinence and want of sleepe, lookedst pale and wan. This didst thou to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy insurrectiue masse of corruption.

It is not prayer alone may kill the olde man in vs, either it must be sanctified and assisted with fasting &amp; abstinence, or it cannot cast out a spirit of such might.

I see reuelling, dauncing, and banqueting til midnight. I see a number of wiues cockolding their husbands, vnder pretence of going to their next neighbours labour. I see Gentlewomen, baking in their painting on their faces, by the fire, and burning out many pounds of Candle in pinning their treble rebaters, when they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow the snuffe of a light in looking on anie good Book.

So if they be imprisoned or carried to Bridewell for their baudrie, they giue out they suffer for the Church.</p>
            <p>Great cunning doe they ascribe to their Art, as the discerning (by the very countenance) a man that hath Crownes in his purse: the fine closing in with the next Iustice, or Aldermans deputy of the warde: the winning loue of neighbours round about, to repell violence, if haply their houses should be enuirond, or any in them proue vnruly, (being pilled and pould too vnconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.)

Either you do not, or wil not descend into their deep iugling legerdemaine. Any excuse or vnlikely pretext goes for paiment. Set vp a shop of incontinencie who so will, let him haue but one letter of an honest name to grace it.

            <p>Consider but what lothsome things are engendred of the excesse of it, and how the soule (which was made to mount vpward,) in the heate of it descends downward. Sinne enough of your selues (women) haue you, you need haue no sinne put into you.

            <p>There is a certaine kind of good sloth, as to be slowe to anger, slowe to iudgement, slowe to reuenge. But there is a sloth vnto iudgement, which is also an il sloth. As when a poore mans cause hangs so long in Court ere it can be decided, that through the Iudges sloth he is vndone with following of it.

            <p>Our dogges are fed with the crumbes that fall from our Tables. Our Christian brethren are famisht, for want of the crumbes that fall from our Tables.

You ought to possesse no more, then will moderatly sustaine your house and your family. Christ gaue all the victual he had, to those that flocked to heare his Sermons. We haue no such promise-founded plea at the day of al flesh

as that in Christs name we haue done alms-deeds. How would we with our charity sustaine so many mendicant orders of Religion, as we heretofore haue, and as now at this very houre beyond Sea are, if we cannot keepe and cherish the casuall poore amongst vs? Neuer was there a simple liberall relieuer of the poore, but prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in most things he went about.

            <p>No thanks-worthy exhibitions, or reasonable pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will you contribute to maymd Souldiors, or poore Schollers, as other Nations doe, but suffer other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with your discontented poore, to Arme themselues against you.

All the Abbey-lands that were the abstracts from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent almes, now scarce affoord a meales meate of almes. A penny bestowed on the poore, is abridged out of house-keeping. All must bee for their children that spend more then all. More prosperous children should they haue, were they more open handed.

            <p>In the time of <hi>Gregory Nasianzene,</hi> (if wee may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite Ecclesiasticall records) there sprung vp the direful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest mortality in Rome, that man-kinde hath beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: scarce able were the liuing to bury the dead, and not so much but their streets were digged vp for graues; Which this holy Father (with no little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserate hart-bleeding) beholding, commanded all the Clergie (for he was at that time their chiefe Bishop) to assemble in praier &amp; supplications, and deale forcingly beseeching with God, to intermit his fury and forgiue them. For all this not any whit is abated, hee tooke no pitty on them. There-with that reuerend Pastor, (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced to hell in his thoughts for the distresse of his people,) caused al the Citizens, young and old, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led foorth their houses, and attende him in a howling procession. Vp and downe the streetes, from one end of the Citty to the other hee led them, and Preachers (as Captains ouer multitudes) were set to direct and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in their Inuocations and Orizons. Foure daies together in this feruent exercise he detained them.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13421:97"/>
In those places where the mortality raged most, a stande would hee make halfe a day, and with reiterated solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and prostrate voyce-crazing vehemencie, breake ope a broade clowde-dispersing passage, to the throne of mercy.</p>
            <p>The foure dayes concluded, and that with their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing clamors, and breast-embolning sighes, they had enforced a sufficient breache in the Firmament, there appeared a bright sunne-arraied Angell, standing with a reaking bloody sword in his hand, in the chiefe gate of their Citty, which (they comming neere) in all their sights, on his arme hee wiped and put vp: and (in that very instant) throughout the Citty, the plague ceased. Some (peraduenture) may take exceptions against the certainty hereof, but if we will authorize any thing in the Romaine or Ecclesiasticall histories, we must ascribe truth as well vnto this. I would see him that could giue me any other reason but this, of the building of the yet extant gate and Castle of S. <hi>Angelos,</hi> on both which, the Angell with his sworde drawne is artificially engrauen. True, or not true, the example can doe no harme: Wee will not be too hasty to imitate it.</p>
            <p>In stead of humbling our selues after this manner, and wearying God with our cryes and lamentations, wee fall a drinking and bousing, &amp; making iestes of his frowning castigation. As Babes smyle and laugh in their sleepe, so wee (surprised with a lethargy of sinne,) do nothing but laugh and iest in the midst of our sleepie security. Wee scoffe and are iocund, when the sworde is ready to goe through vs. On our wine-benches we bidde a <hi>Fico</hi> for tenne thousand Plagues.</p>

            <p>O no, foolish men you erre, though long life on earth be a blessing, yet it followes not by contradiction, that GOD curseth all those whose daies hee shortens. Many except their dayes were shortned, would neuer be saued. Many in their prime and best yeares, are raught hence, because the world is vnworthy of them, and they are more worthy of heauen, then the world. The good King <hi>Iosias,</hi> was taken away in his youth. Our Sauiour was taken vp in his best youthly age.

as this worde of three sillables <hi>Eternall,</hi> includeth, an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coan of yncke would it draw dry to describe it. Hell is a circle which hath no breakings of, or discontinuing. Hence blasphemous Witches and Coniurers, when they raise vp the deuill, draw a ringed circle all-about him, that hee should not rush out and oppresse them: as also to humble &amp; debase him, in putting him in mind by that circle, of the eternall circle of damnation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath confined and shut him. What dullards and blocke-heads are wee, that hearing these tearmes of hell and eternall, so often souned in our eares, sound them so shallowly, or if we sound them as we shold, are no more confounded with them? It should seeme we are not too much terrified with them, when for an houres pleasure, (which hath no taste of true pleasure in it,) we will dare them both to their vtmost.</p>

            <p>O if there were no heauen, mee thinkes (hauing that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13421:100"/>
vnderstanding we ought,) we should forbeare to sinne, if it were but for feare of hell. Our Lawes, with nothing but proposed penalty, from offending cohibite vs, they allow no reward to their temperate obseruants: Gods Lawes, (proposing both exceeding rewarde and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding penalty,) are euery day violated and enfringed. Eyther wee suppose him, not able to execute his Lawes, or that (like one of Romes Epicure Emperors,) he more fauoureth their breakers then obeyers: aduauncing men sooner for oppugning then obseruing them. Farre is he from that mad-braine fondnesse, of his Lawes he is not onely not carelesse, but iealous and zealous, and to the fourth generation pursueth their neglecters.</p>
            <p>None of them he pardons, though for a space he may respite. If he delayeth or respiteth, his delaying or respy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is but to fetch vp his hand hyer, that he may let it fal on them heauier. His deferring, is the more to infer. Of no ill payment shall he complaine, that hath the wages of his wickednes held from him in this world, to receiue them by the whole summe in Hell. Could the least and sencelessest of our sences, into the quietest corner of hel, be transported in a vision but three minutes, it would breed in vs such an agasting terror, and shyuering mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of it, that to make vs more wary of sinne-meriting it, we would haue it painted in our Gardens, our banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting houses, on our gates, in our Gallaries, our Closets; our bed-chambers.</p>
            <p>Againe were there no hell but the accusing of a mans owne conscience, it were hell, and the profundity of hell to any sharpe transpercing soule, that had neuer so little inckling of the ioyes of heauen, to be seperate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them;

Our best methode to preuent this excluding, or seperating fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods presence, is heere on earth (what so euer we goe about,) to thinke we see him present. Let vs fancy the firmament as his face, the all-seeing Sun to be his right eye, and the Moone his left, (although his eyes, are farre more fiery pointed and subtile,) that the Starres are but the congemmed twincklings of those his cleare eyes, that the windes are the breath of his nostrils, and the lightning &amp; tempests the troubled action of his ire: that his frownes bring forth frost &amp; snowe, and his smiles faire weather: that the Winter is the image of the first world, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was vnparadized, &amp; the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fostering Summer, the representation of the seede of womans satis-fying, for the vnfortunate fruite of life which he pluckt. Who is there entertayning these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine allusiue cogitations, that hath not God vnremoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his memory. He that hath God in his memory, and aduaunceth him before his eyes euer-more, will bee bridled and pluckt backe, from much abusion and besti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alnesse.

In the presence of his Prince, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutest misliuer that lyues, wil not offend or misgouerne himselfe: how much more ought we, (abyding alwaies in Gods presence,) precisely to straighten our pathes?

Purblind <hi>London,</hi> neither canst thou see that God sees thee, nor see into thy selfe. How long wilt thou clowde his earthly prospect, with the misty night of thy mounting iniquities. Therefore hath he smitten thee and strooke thee, because thou wouldest not belieue he was present with thee. He thought if nothing els might moue thee to looke backe, at least thou wouldest looke back to thy striker. Had it not beene, so to cause thee to looke back and repent, with no crosse or plague would he haue visited, or sought to call thee. He could haue been reuenged on thee superaboundantly at the day of thy dissolution, and soules generall Law-day, though none of thy children or allies, by his hand had beene sepulchred. His hand I may well terme it, for on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are arested with the Plague, is the print of a hand seene, and in the very moment it first takes them, they feele a sensible blow giuen them, as it were with the hand of some stander by. As Gods hand wee will not take it, but the hand of fortune, the hand of hot weather the hand of close smouldry ayre.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine coniectures haue wee had, that wee are reuolted from God, and that our ruine is not farre of. In diuers places of our Land, it hath rained blood, the ground hath been remoued, and horrible deformed births con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Did the Romans take it for an ill signe, when their Capitoll was strooken with lightning, how much more ought <hi>London,</hi> to take it for an ill signe, when her chiefe steeple is stroken with lightning?

No prosperity lasteth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. The Lord by a solemne oath bound himselfe to the Iewes, yet when they were obliuious of him, it pleased him to forget the couenant he made with their forefathers; and left their Citty desolate vnto them.

Ah thou preseruer of men, why hast thou set vs vp as a mark against thee? Why wilt thou breake a leafe driuen to and fro with the winde, and pursue the dry stubble?
