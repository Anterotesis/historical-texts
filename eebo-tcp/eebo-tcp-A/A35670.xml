            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>O Reſtes,</hi> upon his arrival from <hi>Greece,</hi> is drawn by ſympathy to take up his ſtation with ſo good a Friend as you are. He could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have made a choice that the world would have eſteem'd more preferable and more illuſtrious. But, he judges not as the world judges. The Title of Friend is to him more atractive than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Court of Honour; nay, he eſteems it too more glorious. Virtue, Good Senſe and Greatneſs of mind are requir'd to make a Friend; and where-ever he meets with thoſe qualities he finds true Nobility. In you, indeed, he makes
<pb facs="tcp:48909:3"/>
choice of a Perſon who derives no glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title from his Father, but who inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from him the trueſt Honour, that of an unblemiſh'd Character, the Character of an upright frank, underſtanding, ſincere man. One who has greatneſs of mind enough to know that he was not born for himſelf, and who loves Mankind, the noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, of which he was made a member. One who is conſtantly true to himſelf, and conſtantly juſt to others, and always eaſie both to himſelf and others, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Strangers, dear to his Friends, and good to his very Enemies. As ſuch he viſits you, aſſur'd before-hand of his kind Reception, tho more upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his generous friendſhip, than any other merit he brings. <hi>I am,</hi>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MY chief deſign in writing the following Poem was to contribute my Mite towards the being ſerviceable to the publick. And I thought I could not do that more effectually than by endeavouring to enflame the Minds of an Audience with the Love of ſo noble a Virtue as Friendſhip. For all Communities owe their proſperity to their being united amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and derive their ruin from Faction and Inteſtine Diſcord. The misfortunes of <hi>England</hi> have always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from particular perſons loving themſelves too much, and others too little, and taking too little care of the publick, and too much of themſelves. He who is generous enough to love his Friend, has greatneſs of mind enough to ſerve his Country: The Virtues have always been inſeparable, and never was there an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Friend, but he was a good Patriot.</p>
            <p>The ſubject that I choſe in order to my deſign has been handled by ſeveral; yet the Fable or Plot is intirely my own. I conſider, that the Writing of good Verſes may make a man a good Verfifyer, but 'tis the forming a Fable alone, that can make a Poet. I therefore han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled it with all the Care, and with all the Art which I was capable of beſtowing on it; I chiefly took care to form it as regularly as poſſibly I could, that is, as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, as Decently, as Greatly, and as Virtuouſly; and to make it more agreeable, I endeavoured to reconcile Variety to Regularity: For Irregularity in the Drama, like Irregularity in Life, is downright extra vagance, and extravagance both upon the Stage, and in the World is always either Vice or Folly, and is often both.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time I am far from thinking that any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Rules can make amends for want of Genius, I have the leſſon of my Maſter too conſtantly in my mind, to be guilty of ſuch a miſtake.</p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:48909:4"/>
               <l>Ego nec Studium ſine divite vena,</l>
               <l>Nec rude quid proſit video ingenium alterius ſic</l>
               <l>Altere poſcit opem res &amp; conjurat amice.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here we ſee it is the opinion of <hi>Horace</hi> that the Rules ſignifie nothing without Genius; but here we ſee it is his opinion too that Genius ſignifies nothing without the Rules. <hi>Milton</hi> as to this latter point was exactly of <hi>Horace</hi>'s mind. <hi>Milton,</hi> who is perhaps the greateſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that has appear'd in the world for theſe ſeventeen hundred years, declares that Genius without the Rules is deſpicable. In the little Treatiſe of Education which he has writ to Mr <hi>Hartlib,</hi> he tells him that he would have his young Students learn ſomething of Poetry. <q>I mean not (ſays he) the proſody of a Verſe, but that ſublime art which in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Poeticks, in <hi>Horace, &amp;c.</hi> teaches what the laws are of a true Epick Poem, what of a Dramatick, what of a Lyrick, what Decorum is, which is the grand Maſter-piece to obſerve. This would make them ſoon perceive what deſpicable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures our common Rhymers and Play-Writers are, and ſhew them what Religious, what Glorious and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent uſe might be made of Poetry, both in Divine and in Humane things.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That the preſent Tragedy is more Regular than moſt of our Tragedies are, I have ſome grounds to believe. Whether there is in it what is requir'd on the account of Genius, muſt be determin'd by the knowing Impartial Reader; that is, whether the Paſſions are touch'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Expreſſions are worthy of the Paſſions, and whether there reigns throughout it that majeſtick Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which makes the pleaſure of Tragedy.</p>
            <p>For I declare here ſolemnly that it was never my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſatisfie thoſe who expect to be entertain'd with what they call fine things; I know a great deal better what the nature of my Art and the ſimplicity of the Drama demands, than to leave what the neceſſity of the action requires, whoſe vehement motion alone can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame an audience, and hunt for Impertinent Common-place
<pb facs="tcp:48909:4"/>
Wit. As often as I write I ſhall endeavour to adapt my Sentiments to my Characters and to my Incidents, and make my Expreſſions fit for my Sentiments, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all fine reflections to be written by half Wits, and approv'd of by half Criticks. But to return to the Rules from which I digreſs'd; I had not ſaid ſo much of them, but that I find it is the daily practice of our Empiricks in Poetry to turn our two Theatres into down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Mountebanks Stages, to treat <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> with as contemptuous arrogance, as our Medicinal Quacks do <hi>Galen</hi> and the great <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make the Rules, that is, Nature and Right Reaſon, as ridiculous and contemptible as the Rules have made their Writings.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the following Tragedy has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been eſteem'd ſo noble, that it has prevail'd upon the Writers of ſeveral Ages, and of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to entertain the publick with it. It was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought upon the <hi>French</hi> Stage by one Monſieur <hi>de la Grange,</hi> and, as he tells us in his Preface, with extraordinary ſucceſs. Tho he ſeems to me to have treated this ſubject without Force and without Art, yet I am very apt to believe him, becauſe its greatneſs might very well ſuſtain it. It was brought upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage by <hi>Pacuvius</hi> about the time of the great <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio:</hi> And we find from the little Treatiſe that <hi>Cicero</hi> has left us of Friendſhip, the wonderful effect that that Tragedy had upon the minds of the <hi>Romans.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Qui clamoris</hi> (ſays <hi>Lelius</hi> in that Treatiſe) <hi>tota cavea nuper, hoſpitis &amp; Amici mei Marci Pacuvii fuerunt in nova fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula, cum ignorante rege uter eorum eſſet Oreſtes, Pylades Oreſtem ſe eſſe diceret ut pro illo necaretur; Oreſtes autem, ita ut erat, Oreſtem ſe eſſe perſeveraret?</hi> What ſhouts of applauſe ran lately through the whole Pit at the new Play of my Gueſt and Friend <hi>Pacuvius;</hi> when the King inquiring which was <hi>Oreſtes, Pilades</hi> affirm'd it was he, that he might be ſacrific'd in his ſtead; but <hi>Oreſtes</hi> perſever'd in the contrary.</q> About four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before that, and above two thouſand years before our time, it was brought upon the <hi>Athenian</hi> Stage
<pb facs="tcp:48909:5"/>
by <hi>Euripides;</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were certainly the moſt ingenicus, and moſt delicate people that ever were in the world, were not only charm'd, but raviſh'd with it. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who in his little Treatiſe of Poetry drew his Rules from his conſtant obſervation of what had ſucceeded upon the <hi>Athenian</hi> Stage, is every where in that Treatiſe ſpeaking of the <hi>Iphigenia</hi> in <hi>Tauris.</hi> He gives himſelf the trouble of laying down the general Plan of it: He commends the Diſcovery of <hi>Iphigenia</hi> to <hi>Oreſtes.</hi> He extols the incidents, as admirably contriv'd for exciting Compaſſion and Terror. In ſhort, he is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſpeaking of that Tragedy and the <hi>Oedipns</hi> of <hi>Sophecles.</hi> Theſe conſiderations gave me encouragement to try how it would do upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Theatre: And from the firſt repreſentations I expected all the ſucceſs that I could reaſonably deſire, I never in my life at any Play took notice of a more ſtrict attention, or a more profound ſilence. And there was ſomething like what happen'd at the Repreſentation of <hi>Pacuvius</hi> his Tragedy. For upon <hi>Oreſtes</hi> diſcovering his paſſion to <hi>Iphigenia</hi> in the fourth Act, there ran a general murmur through the Pit, which is what I had never ſeen before. But after three or four repreſentations, ſeveral people, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time had wholly abandon'd themſelves to the Impreſſion which Nature had made on them, began to ſtudy how to be diſcontented by Art; and repented heartily at having been pleas'd with what <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> had been pleas'd before. But if they anſwer, that they were diſpleas'd at my defects, and not at thoſe beauties which ſo juſtly pleas'd the Ancients, and which pleaſe the Moderns; to that I reply, that by univerſal confeſſion they were more touch'd by the fourth and fifth Acts than they were by the ſecond. Now the fourth and fifth Acts are entirely my own, and the ſecond is almoſt entirely <hi>Euripides.</hi> Yet this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act made little impreſſion on them after the firſt repreſentations. Is it that they were reſolv'd all at once to ſet up for being more Refin'd than the <hi>French,</hi> more Diſcerning than the <hi>Romans,</hi> and more Delicate than the <hi>Athenians!</hi> I deſire them to conſider what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations
<pb facs="tcp:48909:5"/>
they have here of late given, and what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations they have been forc'd to retract, and then they may anſwer the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Of all the Objections which have been made, but two appear to me to be of any moment. The firſt relates to the firſt Scene of the Play, which objection is univerſal; and therefore muſt be ſolid. The ſecond belongs to the laſt Scene of the Play, and has been made by perſons of extraordinary merit, and who have a hundred great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, of which their exalted Rank and exalted Birth are the leaſt. The objection is this, That <hi>Oreſtes</hi> upon diſcovering <hi>Iphigenia</hi> to be his Siſter ſhews too much joy for a Lover. But I deſire them, with all the profound Reſpect that is due to them, that I may ſay three words in my Defence, and deſire that they would not upon a tranſient reflection condemn me for a thing which I have been conſidering for a year. A perſon of <hi>Oreſtes</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> may very well be ſuppos'd to love his Miſtreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> own ſake: And how very natural is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of grief, into which the ſight of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> thrown him, a Danger by him believ'd unavoidable, ſhould be turn'd into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>tuous tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports of Joy upon the firſt view of her Deliverance? He ſaw very well that this Diſcovery was the only thing that could have deliver'd her, unleſs he would have parted with his Honour to ſave her. Beſides, he had from the very beginning eſteem'd and admir'd the Queen, as he declares in the third Act. She had twice in one day given him his Life and his Liberty, to which ſhe had added his Friends Life and Liberty; ſhe had given him the diſpoſal of her ſelf and her Subjects, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd an Empire on him. And what Impreſſion muſt not ſuch Generoſity make upon the ſoul of a generous man? And how far might it not go, upon a diſcovery that muſt immediately cool the violence of his former love into the calmneſs of fraternal affection? Beſides, conſider the circumſtances of that aſtoniſhing Diſcovery. A young Princeſs, whom he and all <hi>Greece</hi> believ'd to have been inhumanely murder'd at the Altar of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Aulis,</hi> a Princeſs who had been at ten years of age the
<pb facs="tcp:48909:6"/>
admiration of her Country, the joy of her Relations, and the darling of the Prince her Brother; a Princeſs, whoſe unfortunate Beauty and untimely Fate all <hi>Greece</hi> with him had lamented, and look'd on it as one of the deplorable deeds, Hereditary to the Race of <hi>Tantalus:</hi> this very Princeſs was twelve years after beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, beyond all hope, and almoſt beyond all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, diſcover'd by this very Brother to be alive in <hi>Tauris,</hi> and diſcover'd in the wonderful moment, in which that very diſcovery ſav'd her from periſhing in ſo remote a Country, at the Altar of the ſame Goddeſs. Judge if ſuch an aſtoniſhing diſcovery as this could have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other effect in nature upon the mind of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> than what I have given it in this Tragedy? A diſcovery, which not only ſav'd his deareſt Siſter, and made happy his deareſt Friend, but reconciled him perfectly to the Queen, oblig'd her to abandon the fatal Image to him, and ſo fulfill'd the command of Heaven, and appeas'd the Infernal Powers, and reſtor'd him to his former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd as briefly as I could to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this objection, out of reſpect to the perſons who made it. For the reſt I leave them to be anſwer'd by the Reader. If they are ſolid, nothing that I can ſay can o'rethrow them, and if they are not founded on Reaſon, they will be ſure to fall of themſelves. For all opinions are ſure to change, and prejudice and malice are ſure to dye; only Reaſon is always the ſame, and only Truth is immortal.</p>
            <p>The general ſucceſs of the following Poem has been neither diſpicable nor extraordinary. I have pleas'd thoſe whom I deſir'd to pleaſe, and the reſt will one day follow. But let the Writers value themſelves upon Fortune, who have nothing elſe to rely on. To which of her ſcribbling Favourites has ſhe not been kind, has ſhe not been coming? But ſhort have been her fantaſtick favours, her affections fleeting, and general contempt, a terrible reverſe, has follow'd. 'Tis my Ambition to owe my Succeſs to Reaſon, and not to Chance, to pleaſe the moſt judicious and the beſt of men, and ſo to pleaſe for ever.</p>
