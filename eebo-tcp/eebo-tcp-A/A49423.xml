            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb n="1" facs="tcp:43200:2"/>
            <head>Mr. HOBBES his Opinion
about Liberty and Necessity,
sent in a Letter to the DUKE
of NEWCASTLE.</head>
            <p>FIrst, I conceive, that when
it cometh into a man's
mind to do, or not to do, some
certain Action, if he have no
time to deliberate the doing of
it or abstaining, necessarily
followeth the present Thought
he had of the good or evil
Consequence thereof to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
As, for Example, in sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Anger, the Action should
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43200:3"/>
follow the Desire of Revenge;
in sudden Fear, the Thought
of Escape. Also when a man
had time to deliberate, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates
not, because never
any thing appeared that should
make him doubt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
the Action follows
his opinion of the Goodness or
Harm of it: these Actions I
call Voluntary; my <hi>Lord</hi> (if I
understand him right) calleth
them Spontaneous. I call them
Voluntary, because those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which follow immediately
the last Appetite are voluntary;
and here where is one onely
Appetite, that one is the last.
Besides, I see it's reasonable to
punish a rash Action, which
could not be justly done by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43200:3"/>
man to man, unless the same
were voluntary. For no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of man can be said to be
without Deliberation, though
never so sudden, because it is
supposed he had time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
all the precedent time
of his life, whether he should
do that kind of Action or not.
And hence it is, that he that
killeth in a sudden passion of
Anger, shall nevertheless be
justly put to death, because all
the time wherein he was able
to consider whether to kill
were good or evil, shall be
held for one continual Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
and consequently
the Killing shall proceed from
Election.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I conceive, when
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43200:4"/>
a man deliberates whether he
shall do a thing or not do it,
that he doth nothing else but
consider whether it be better
for him to do it or not to do it;
and to consider an Action is to
imagine the Consequences of
it both good and evil. From
whence it is to be inferred,
That Deliberation is nothing
else but alternate Hope and
Fear, or alternate Appetite, to
do or quit the Action of which
he deliberateth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I conceive, that
in all Deliberations, that is to
say, in all alternate succession
of contrary Appetites, the last
is that which we call the Will,
and is immediately before the
doing of the Action, or next
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43200:4"/>
before the doing of it become
impossible. All other Appetites
to do and to quit, that come
upon a man during his Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
are usually called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and Inclinations, but
not Will, there being but one
Will, which also in this case
may be called the Last Will,
though the Intention change
often.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that those Actions
which a man is said to do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Deliberation, are said to be
voluntary, and done upon
Choice and Election: so that
voluntary Action, and Action
proceeding from Election, is
the same thing: and that of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Agents, 'tis all one to
say, he is free, and to say, he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43200:5"/>
hath made an end of delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I conceive Liberty
to be rightly defined in this
manner. <q>Liberty is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of all the impediments
to Action, that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the natural and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal
quality of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</q>
As, for Example, the
Water is to be seen descend
freely, or to have liberty to
ascend up the channel of the
River, because there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment;
and though the
Water cannot ascend, yet men
say it never wants the liberty
to ascend, but the power or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
because the impediment
is in the nature of the Water,
and intrinsecal. So also we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43200:5"/>
say, He that is tyed, wants li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to go, because that the
impediment is not in him, but
in his Bonds; whereas we say
not so of him that is sick or
lame, because the impediment
is in himself.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I conceive, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
taketh beginning from
it self, but from the action of
some other immediate Agent
without it self; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when first a man hath an
Appetite or Will to something,
to which immediately before
he had no Appetite nor Will, the
cause of his Will is not the Will
it self, but something else not
in his own disposing. So
that whereas it is out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy,
of voluntary Actions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43200:6"/>
the Will is a necessary cause,
and by this which is said the
Will is also caused by other
things which it disposeth not;
it followeth, that voluntary
Actions have all their necessary
causes, and therefore are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, I hold That to
be a sufficient Cause, to which
nothing is wanting that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the producing of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
the same also is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Cause. For if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that a sufficient Cause shall
not bring forth the Effect, then
there wanteth somewhat which
was needful to the producing
of it, and so the Cause was not
sufficient: but if it be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that a sufficient Cause
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43200:6"/>
should not produce the effect,
then is a sufficient cause a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
cause. For it is said to
produce an effect necessarily,
that cannot but produce it.
Hence is manifest, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is produced, hath had a
sufficient cause to produce it,
else it had not been. And
therefore also Voluntary Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are necessitated.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I hold that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
definition of a Free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
namely, That a Free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
is that which, when all
things are present which are
needful to produce the effect,
can nevertheless not produce
it, implies a contradiction, and
is Nonsense; being as much as
to say, the Cause may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43200:7"/>
that is, necessary, and yet
the Effect not follow. My Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</p>
            <p>For the first 5 points, where
it is explicated. 1. What Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneity
is. 2. What Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is. 3. What Will, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension,
and Appetite, is.
4. What a Free Agent is.
5. What Liberty is. There can
be no other proof offered, but
every mans own Experience
by reflection on himself, and
remembring what he useth to
have in his mind, that is, what
he himself meaneth when he
saith, an Action is Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
a man Deliberates, such is
his Will, that Agent or Action
is Free. Now he that so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth
upon himself, cannot
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43200:7"/>
but be satisfied that Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the considering of the
good and evil Sequels of the
Action to come: that by Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneity
is meant Inconsiderate
Proceedings, or else nothing
is meant by it: that Will is the
last act of our Deliberation:
that a Free Agent is he that
can do if he will, and forbear
if he will: and that Liberty is
the Absence of External Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.
But to those that
out of custom speak not what
they conceive, but what they
hear; and are not able, or will
not take the pains to consider
what they think, when they
hear such words, no argument
can be sufficient, because Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and Matter of Fact is not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43200:8"/>
verified by other mens Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but by every mans own
Sense and Memory. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
how can it be proved
that to love a thing, and to
think it good, is all one, to a
man that does not mark his
own meaning by those words?
Or how can it be proved that
Eternity is not <hi>Nunc stans</hi> to
a man that says these words by
custom, and never considers
how he can conceive it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his mind? Also the
6th. point, that a man cannot
imagine any thing to begin
without a Cause, can no other
way be made known, but by
crying how he can imagine it;
but if he try, he shall find as
much reason (if there be no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43200:8"/>
Cause of the thing) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it should begin at one
time as an other; that is, he
hath equal reason to think it
should begin at all times, which
is impossible; and therefore
he must think there was some
special Cause why it began
then, rather than sooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or else that it began ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but was Eternal.</p>
            <p>For the 7th. point, that all
Events have necessary Causes,
it is there proved in that they
have sufficient Causes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
let us also in this place
suppose any Event never so ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual,
as the throwing (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
<hi>Ambs-ace</hi> upon a Pair
of Dice, and see if it must not
have been necessary before it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43200:9"/>
was thrown; for seeing it was
thrown, it had a beginning,
and consequently a sufficient
Cause to produce it, consisting
partly in the Dice, partly in
outward things, as the posture
of the parts of the Hand, the
measure of Force applied by
the Caster, the posture of the
parts of the Table, and the like.
In summe, there was nothing
wanting which was necesari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
requisite to the producing
of that particular Cast, and
consequently that Cast was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
thrown; for if it had
not been thrown, there had
wanted somewhat requisite to
the throwing of it, and so the
Cause had not been sufficient.
In the like manner it may be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43200:9"/>
proved, that every other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
how contingent soever it
be, is produced necessarily;
which is that that my L. Bishop
disputes against. The same
also may be proved in this
manner: Let the case be put
(for example) of the Weather;
'tis necessary that to morrow
it shall rain, or not rain; if
therefore it be not necessary it
shall rain, it is necessary it shall
not rain; otherwise there is
no necessity that the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
[It shall rain or not rain]
should be true. I know there
be some that say, it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be true, that one of
the two shall come to pass, but
not singly that it shall rain;
which is as much as to say,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43200:10"/>
one of them is necessary, yet
neither of them is necessary;
and to seem to avoid that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
they make a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that neither of them is true
<hi>determinatÃ¨,</hi> but <hi>indeterminatÃ¨:</hi>
which distinction either signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
no more but this, <hi>One of
them is true but we know not
which,</hi> and so the Necessity
remains though we know it
not; or if the meaning of the
distinction be not that, it hath
no meaning, and they might
as well have said, One of them
is true <hi>TytiricÃ¨,</hi> but neither of
them <hi>TupatulicÃ©.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last thing, in which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
consisteth the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
namely, that there is
no such thing as an Agent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43200:10"/>
which when all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Action are present, can
nevertheless forbear to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it, or (which is all one)
that there is no such thing as
Freedom from Necessity, is
easily inferred from that which
hath been before alledged; for
if it be an Agent, it can work,
and if it work, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting of what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to produce the Action,
and consequently the Cause of
the Action is sufficient, and if
sufficient, then also necessary,
as hath been proved before.</p>
            <p>And thus you see how
the inconveniences, which his
Lordship (Bishop <hi>Bramhal</hi>) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth,
must follow upon the
holding of Necessity, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43200:11"/>
and the Necessity it
self demonstratively proved.
To which I could adde, if I
thought it good Logick, the
inconvenience of denying Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
as that it destroyeth
both the Decrees and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of God Almighty:
for whatsoever God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to bring to pass by
Man as an Instrument, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth
shall come to pass, a man,
if he have Liberty, (such as
his Lordship affirmeth) from
Necessitation, might frustrate,
and make not to come to pass;
and God should either not
foreknow it, and not decree
it, or he should foreknow such
things should be as shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be, and decree that which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43200:11"/>
shall never come to pass.</p>
            <p>This is all that hath come
into my mind touching this
question since I last considered
it, and I humbly beseech your
Lordship to communicate it
onely to my Lord Bishop: and
so praying God to prosper
Your Lordship in all Your
Designs, I take leave, and
am (my most Noble and most
Obliging <hi>Lord</hi>)</p>

            <p>ARguments seldom work on
men of Wit and Learning,
when they have once engaged
themselves in a contrary Opinion;
if any thing do it, it is the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the Cause of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
which is this. Pious men
attribute to God Almighty, for
Honours sake, whatsoever they see
is Honourable in the world, as
Seeing, Hearing, Willing, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Justice, Wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
deny him such poor things as
Eyes, Ears, Brains, and other
Organs, without which we
Worms neither have nor can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such Faculties to be, and
so far they do well. But when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43200:12"/>
they dispute of Gods Actions Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically,
then they consider
them again as if he had such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and in that manner as we
have them, this is not well; and
thence it is they fall into so many
difficulties. We ought not to
dispute of God's Nature, he is no
fit subject for our Philosophy.
True Religion consisteth in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Christ's Lieutenants,
and in giving God such Honour
both in Attributes and Actions,
as they in their several Lieutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
shall ordain.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
Upon A
LETTER
Of
Mr. T. Hobbs to the Duke of
NEWCASTLE,
Which he calls His Opinion
about Liberty and Necessity.</head>
            <p>THE Design of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or (as he himself
speaks in one part of it) that
in which the whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43200:14"/>
consists, is, That Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Agents do always act ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
or (which is all one)
act without liberty, that is,
from necessity. And this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of his is first set down
in 8 Points, and then (as the
Title of the next Part im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
so many Reasons to
those Points. The first Point
is, That <hi>by Spontaneity is meant
Inconsiderate Proceeding, &amp;c.
without Deliberation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I call this the first Point,
not because I find Spontaneity
described here, but because at
the entrance of his Reasons he
declares that to be his design.
It's true that he saith some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the Bishops Opinion
concerning it, but very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43200:14"/>
as he had cause; for he
shall not find among any that
maintain the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Spontaneous and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Actions, that Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neity
consists in Inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Indeliberation, as he
would have it, when he says it
must mean that or nothing.
Whereas indeed his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
would be as well content
it should mean nothing as
that. For Inconsideration is
the privation and want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
where it should and
ought to have been, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in
Agents of Reason and Will;
for we do not say that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Agents, that have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Will, do act inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.
For when the Water
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43200:15"/>
doth <hi>sponte fluere,</hi> and the Fire
<hi>calefacere,</hi> we cannot say they
do it inconsiderately, or for
want of that Deliberation, of
which they are not capable;
for you might as well say, they
act so for want of Reason: and
if want of Reason and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
makes an Action
spontaneous, then all violent
Actions would be spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for they also want Reason
in all natural Agents, as that
the Water ascends for want of
Reason and Deliberation.</p>
            <p>And therefore the next time
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> means to play the
Philosopher about Necessity
and Liberty, I shall advise him
to take better notice of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and difference between
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43200:15"/>
Spontaneous and Voluntary
Actions. Men call those Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Actions, as the word
it self imports, that proceed
from the Will, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) voluntary
Agents; and those spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that proceed from the fixt
unchangeable nature of (<hi>i.e.</hi>)
from natural Agents. If Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> knew not this difference,
let him learn't against another
time; if he did know it, it had
been the part of a good Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
to have took notice
of it, and when he would
prove that Spontaneous and
Voluntary are all one, to make
instance in such Actions as are
in that more appropriate and
special sence called Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
such as I nam'd before,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43200:16"/>
the Water's flowing, and the
Fire's heating, and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that they are also Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
that is, do follow the last
Will of the Water and Fire,
(for so, Voluntary, is defined.)
Now if no man in his right
wits will either say that these
are Voluntary, or gainsay
their being Spontaneous, (<hi>i.e.</hi>)
that they do <hi>sponte agere;</hi> it
must of necessity follow, first,
That there is a manifest diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between those sorts of
Actions; and secondly, That
it is necessary that those things
which differ, for more distinct
knowledge, should have given
them also different Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and thirdly, That none
are of themselves more apt,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43200:16"/>
though they may sometimes be
used promiscuously, than those
of Voluntary and Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>But for so much as I have
already taken notice of in the
first Point, whether he be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in the Bishop, or I in
him, it makes not much either
for or against the principal
question of Liberty; for I find
no mention of Spontaneity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
that there need any
enquiry of the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of it.</p>
            <p>But for voluntary Actions,
because we have often use of
them in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
it will be better worth
the labour to examine what
they are defined to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:43200:17"/>
Those Actions that follow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
the last Appetite are
Voluntary.</p>
            <p>I should acknowledge this
Definition, if the word [last]
did not corrupt it, which
makes it either false or frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
For if he supposes it to be
the last Will before it be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
it is false, for it becomes
rather the Last by being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
or if that Will be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be followed because
it is last, it is also false; for the
Action follows the Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the Will, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the last Will: for the
Will is last because it is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not followed because it is
last. It's not First or Last that
makes a thing willed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43200:17"/>
it is good, or seems so.
Or if there be a sence in which
it is not false, it is yet frivolous.
As if a man should say out of a
deep contemplation and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Nature, <q>No man
dyed ever of any Disease
but the last he was sick of.
No man ever drank a whole
Glass of Wine but the last
when he drank it.</q> If the
word [last] carries no force in
it, either to make the Disease
more malignant, or the Wine
more pleasant; such Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though they have a
truth in them, will go for no
better than ridiculous: so [last]
which adds nothing to the
Will, might have been left out
in the Definition. And yet I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43200:18"/>
am content it should stand
there still, untill you see more
cause to remove it, as perhaps
you may when we come to the
third point; for there we are
promised to hear more of the
same matter, a point set apart
of purpose to shew the nature
of the Will and Inclinations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Point is the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Deliberation.</hi> Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is nothing but Alternate
Hope and Fear, or Alternate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to do or quit the Action.</p>
            <p>It's a strange impropriety of
Speech, 1. to say that Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which is an act of the
Understanding, should be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fear or Hope, which be
affections; such a confus'd
tumbling together of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43200:18"/>
of the Soul becomes
onely him, that either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not, or desires not to be
understood. But perhaps his
meaning may be, that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in Deliberation
represents one-while matter of
Fear, otherwhile of Hope.
This, I confess, is true, and that
this Hope or Fear doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
produce such a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and act of the Will, upon
which the Action follows; but
yet produces a true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
resolution, or act of the
Will. For it is not possible
for a man to have true cause
and matter of Hope represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, but he must will
it, at least in a degree, and so
long as that Hope is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43200:19"/>
by a new Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So it is alike in Fear,
that whosoever actually fears
any evil, effectually wills the
avoiding of it, till something
intervenes that diverts the
Fear. But of this more in the
next Point.</p>
            <p>Third Point. The Will is
defined to be the <hi>last Appetite,
and is immediately before the
doing of the Action.</hi> Other
Appetites that come upon men
in time of Deliberation are but
intentions and inclinations.
The truth of these and the
like Points (saith Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>) is
to be tried by reflection upon
our selves, what we conceive
when such Speeches are us'd:
and then the Will is nothing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43200:19"/>
else but the last Appetite. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> should have
heard of <hi>Voluntas ambulatoria,</hi>
a Will liable to change; and
therefore every Will is not the
last. For if you reflect, you shall
find a man seriously to will and
resolve that to day, which the
next day he wills not. When a
man makes his Testament,
which is also call'd his last
Will, and is indeed of all others
the most resolv'd act of his
Will; yet he may change that
Will, and often men do it. But
then you say it ceaseth to be
his last Will. 'Tis true. And
therefore something was a Will
for the time, which was not the
last Appetite. But it cannot
now be call'd his Will. True,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43200:20"/>
because he has chang'd it, not
because it is not last; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(say we) consists the liberty
of a voluntary Agent, that he
can change his Will, and make
that not to be last which once
was last, that is, he hath power
over his last Will, I mean over
that which for the time was
the last, and was as serious and
resolv'd as the last.</p>
            <p>And for those Actions which
he calls only Intentions and
Inclinations, I see no reason
why they should not be called
Wills; seeing 1. they are acts
of the Will, for no application
of the Soul to any thing, upon
a reason can proceed from the
inferiour Sensitive part, and
therefore must either be acts
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43200:20"/>
of the Will, or be nothing at
all. And 2ly. by Mr. <hi>Hobbe</hi>'s
own rule and definition of
Will; every one of those suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Appetites are Wills, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'till another consequent
Appetite followed, they were
the last for the time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in their courses and turns
all are Wills. Indeed after
they are changed and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
again, I think no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
they should be still called
Wills, when they cease to be
at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth Point.</hi> To say he is a
free Agent, is all one to say, He
hath made an end of Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Here I shall call Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
again to his own reflection,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43200:21"/>
whether a man cannot be said
to be free, before he hath made
an end of Deliberation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than after? As when I
desire to have a friend dine
with me, I meaning to ask him
first whether he be ingaged, or
resolv'd for any other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
do use these words; <hi>Sir,
are you free?</hi> and if he answers
me that he is free, I presently
apprehend, that he is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
for any particular, but
is still capable of a resolution
to dine with me. Not, but
that he may be said to be free
too that hath made an end of
Deliberation, but in another
sence; that is, he is free from
all doubts that come by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.
But the same may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43200:21"/>
be free also before Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is ended, but it is from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
determinations and
resolutions, which is the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
we defend, to do or not
to do. And this seems to be a
greater and more proper Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
than the other; for he
that is free from Deliberation,
acts indeed freely, but it is in
that one way to which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.
But he that is so free
as to go any way, is more free
than he that goes but freely
in one way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth Point.</hi> Liberty is the
absence of all Impediments to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that are not contained in
the nature and intrinsecal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Agent.</p>
            <p>If it will content Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43200:22"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>ã1 page duplicateã</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:43200:22"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>ã1 page duplicateã</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43200:23"/>
That shall be allow'd to be
one sence of the word: but if
I may have leave to do but
what he desires I should do, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
I find another sence, and
the very same which is denied
by him, A Liberty from Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.
As when a Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
a Wife to his Son,
the Son hath, no doubt, liberty
to take that Wife in Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
his sence. And yet if the same
Son should desire his Father to
give him his liberty, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would presently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that he desired somewhat
that he had not given him,
that is, leave as well to refuse
her if he saw cause, as to take
her; he would not cavil with
him, and say, You have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43200:23"/>
in that you are ty'd to
her: but if he means to give
him his liberty, his meaning
also will be to absolve him of
the necessity to take her. By
this we see, that no advantage
is gotten to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
which shews a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from Necessity reflected
also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth Point is an argument
to prove, That</hi> all Actions are
necessitated, because they have
necessary Causes.</p>
            <p>I deny the Consequence.
For when he sayes, That all
Actions have their necessary
Causes, his meaning is (if his
meaning agree with the reason
he gives of it,) That it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
they have Causes, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:43200:24"/>
(saith he) <hi>nothing can have
beginning from it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> self.</hi> Now
can any one imagine, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
man should think this a
good consequence? Nothing
can have beginning from it
self, and therefore every thing
is necessitated: that because
an Effect must necessarily be
produced by some Cause, that
therefore the Cause did neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
produce that Effect. For,
good Sir, reflect again, and
bethink your self, That as some
Effects cannot be produced
but by a concurrence of many
Causes together, every one
of these is necessary to the
producing of the Effect, and
yet not any one of these doth
necessitate the Effect; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43200:24"/>
it is necessary that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be effected, if
that cause be single and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventh Point is another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to prove, That</hi> volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
actions are necessitated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have sufficient Causes,
and all sufficient Causes are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>That all sufficient Causes
are necessary, [sufficient] may
have a double meaning: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when there is sufficient
virtue and aptness in the
things to produce the Effect,
if they were us'd and imployed
by the Agent; or else when
the Agent also actually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes
them to that purpose
'till the work be produc'd.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43200:25"/>
Take [sufficient] in this latter
sence, and all men will confess,
that the Effect will follow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily.
But the Power,
which the Will is said to have
over sufficient Causes, is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of such onely as are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in the first sence, (<hi>i.e.</hi>)
such as have aptness in them to
produce the Effect, when they
are used; which is a sence
both common and reasonable:
As I have sufficient to pay all
my Debts, I have sufficient to
defray the charges of a years
travel; and yet neither pay a
Penny, nor stir a foot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighth Point charges the
Definition of a Free Agent
that is given by others, with</hi>
Nonsense <hi>and</hi> Contradiction;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43200:25"/>
viz. <hi>That</hi> when all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to produce the Effect be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
can nevertheless not produce
it.</p>
            <p>For the Nonsense let it lie
between us a while, 'till the
matter be examined a little,
and then let them take it that
have most right to it. If there
be any Nonsense in the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it must be either in the
meaning of them that use it,
or in the words they use to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their meaning. When
they speak of all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to produce the Effect<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
their meaning is well known
to be of all except the Agent's
Will<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> or if it were not known
to Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> it might and
ought to have been from the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43200:26"/>
very words of the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which plainly suppose the
Will of the Agent to be yet
undetermined. All things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in this sense may well be,
and yet nothing produc'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Agent hath not yet
resolv'd to use them. But if
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> will make them
mean what they do not, he
may very well make them speak
what they should not. Now if
their meaning imply no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
or Nonsense, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it doth not, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
the words must, or it
will not be difficult on whom
to bestow the Nonsense. And
for the words, (to say there be
all things needful, when yet
the Agent is excepted, who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43200:26"/>
is no less needful than any of
the rest,) let the common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of men, or as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
is pleased to call it, let Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
be judge. As when a
man hath a good seat for a
House, all materials, workmen,
and mony to defray the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
he may, and commonly
doth use to say, He hath all
things requisite and needful to
build a House, and then too
when his Will is yet suspended,
and unresolved whether to use
them or not. Therefore your
Self, or, if you will, Reflexion
being judge, you have clapt
the Nonsense upon your own
head.</p>
            <p>But enough of the Points,
let us see if we can mend
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43200:27"/>
our selves with the Reasons of
them.</p>
            <div type="reasons">
               <head>REASONS.</head>
               <p>Wipe your Eyes, I beseech
you, for never were there such
Reasons seen before, such My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
discovered.</p>
               <p>For the first Point, yea for
five of the eight Points, the
Reasons are, That they have
no Reasons. For he sayes they
cannot be prov'd but by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion:
and in that he speaks
but truth; for 'tis sure, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or proof can be made of
the signification and use of
Words, which is all that the
first five Points have blest us
with. But though he said
true, in saying no Reasons
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43200:27"/>
could be given; yet he said
not well in promising Reasons,
when he puts us off with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions.
Of the five first points
himself confesses that no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
can be given; and of the
two next, if he will not confess
so too, he shall be compelled.
For they are Arguments, and
contain in effect and substance
Syllogisms, which are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Reasons; for who ever
went about to give, or could
give Reason of a whole Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,
if the Reasons present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
belong to any part of the
Syllogism, in which case only
Reasons can be given? Let him
but say to which part of his
Points his Reason belongs, and
I will do him so much reason
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43200:28"/>
as to acknowledge it. In the
mean time he stands upon his
good Behaviour, whether these
two points shall be allowed to
have any more reason than the
five former. And for the eighth
and last point, which is all the
hope that is left us to be a point
of reason, his Reason is; That
as he said before, so now he
sayes again; and whatsoever
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is pleased to say
twice over, you may be assur'd
is true.</p>
               <p>This is the summe of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in the most sober and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
construction I can
make of them; yet because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the title of the seventh Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
some new matter is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that was not spoken
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43200:28"/>
of before, I shall say something
to that too.</p>
               <p>He layes down a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more general than the
question, That <hi>all Events ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so casual have necessary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I should grant this, yet
the voluntary Agent may be
free, though the work which
he produces be necessary. This
I shall shew in the Instances
which are brought to prove
this Proposition.</p>
               <p>The first is of the Chance of
a Die. I confess, that though
it be very casual to the Caster,
yet it doth necessarily come to
pass upon such postures and
motions of the Hand and Die,
as happen'd to meet together
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43200:29"/>
at that time: yet I say too,
that as to the Caster of the Die
it was not necessary, because
he had a double power over
that Chance to have hinder'd
it if he pleas'd; for either he
might not have thrown the
Dice at all, or he might have
so ordered the motion and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of his hand that could
have caused another Chance.
Yea more (desiring to avoid
controversies, as much as Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> doth to make them) I
grant also, that there is a time
when, and a respect wherein vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Agents are in the same
condition with natural, and
do act necessarily. For not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a natural Agent solely and
singly doth work his proper
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43200:29"/>
natural Effect necessarily, as
the Fire necessarily heats; but
also when they are in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
together, as it were a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of Causes: whether
that be casual, as the motions
and posture of the hand, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with suitable postures
with the Die and the Table,
do produce necessarily a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
chance; or whether it be
artificial, as the Medicine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of several Drugs do
necessarily produce a common
Effect, beyond the vertue of
their particular natures apart,
which belongs to them onely
in that conjunction and society
of operation. So likewise a
voluntary Agent, constantly
resolv'd, and actually coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43200:30"/>
with other sufficient
causes, doth as necessarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Effect, as any natural
Agent, working either alone,
or in conjunction and society.
So as in this case, if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
seeks for an Adversary, I assure
my self he will find none; and
if he thinks he hath found a
Truth, 'tis but such as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lost. But when we affirm
voluntary Agents to be free
from necessity in acting, we
look upon them in another
state and condition; for they
act not like natural Agents,
whose work immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
and flows from their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but have a progressive
operation, that is before any
thing: beside their Being, they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43200:30"/>
deliberate, resolve, and fall to
execution, and there is a time
for all these allow'd. And
though when they are come
to that perfect state and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
that they have pass'd
the irrevocable resolv'd Will,
they act as necessarily as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Agents do: yet in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
state, that is, from their
first Deliberation to their last
constant Resolution, they are
absolutely free to do, or not
to do. In which case alone
we assert the liberty of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Agents, against which
nothing either is or can be
prov'd by the instance of the
chance of a Die.</p>
               <p>2. And for the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Weather, That
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43200:31"/>
whatsoever comes to pass, <hi>rain,</hi>
or <hi>not rain,</hi> it comes so to pass
necessarily.</p>
               <p>I answer, first, that this is
impertinent to the question,
concerning the liberty of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Agents, who have no
operation or concurrence to
the event of Weather.</p>
               <p>And secondly, the reason
that is us'd to prove that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
is insufficient in many
respects: as because it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that one of the two must
happen, either <hi>rain</hi> or <hi>no rain,</hi>
therefore that which doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
comes to pass necessarily.
My first reason is, because the
truth of a Disjunctive Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
as this is, [it must rain,
or not rain,] consists <hi>in disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43200:31"/>
partium,</hi> and not <hi>in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctis
partibus;</hi> for when you
resolve this Proposition into
two Categoricks, [it shall rain]
for one, and [it shall not rain]
for another, which resolution
the event will make, as the
nature, so the truth of the
Proposition is changed. For
when the Event hath turned
the Disjunctive Proposition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Categorick, as that [it
rains,] it cannot partake of
that Necessity, which consisted
onely in the Disjunctive. And
to make this plain, I shall quit
your Instance with another.
Suppose I am confin'd to live
within the walls of <hi>London,</hi> so
as it is now necessary for me
either to live in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43200:32"/>
in some other part of the City;
yet am I not ty'd, by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
to <hi>London,</hi> to any one
place: if I were ty'd and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to any one place, it
must be either to that place I
chuse to live in, or to that I do
not live in. The latter I hope
no man will imagine can be
necessary, to live where I do
not; and if the former were
necessary, that is, to live where
I do, <hi>viz.</hi> (for Example) in
<hi>Cheap-side,</hi> then by vertue of
that confinement to <hi>London,</hi> I
might be punish'd if I had not
liv'd in <hi>Cheap-side;</hi> in which
case a Jury out of <hi>Bethlem</hi>
would not condemn me, for
that were to make it all one to
be necessitated to live in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:43200:32"/>
and to be necessitated to
live in <hi>Cheap-side.</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why from the necessity of
the Disjunction cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
a necessity to the parts
of it separately, is clear by the
Instance I have given. The
necessity that is laid upon me
is to the whole latitude and
compass of <hi>London,</hi> which
leaves me free to any part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that latitude. So the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
that it shall <hi>rain or not
rain,</hi> is onely to the compass
and latitude that these two
make, <hi>raining or not raining;</hi>
but within that latitude as to
the one alone, or to the other,
there is no necessity. If you say
it is necessary for me to live in
<hi>Cheap-side,</hi> because I live in no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43200:33"/>
other part of the City; so that
it is necessary it should rain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it doth not hold up: I
answer, that this is a necessity
of Consequence, which infers
no necessity upon the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
which is the Necessity
in question; that is, that my
living in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> or the rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to morrow, which are the
Consequents, did come to pass
by necessary Causes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I am afraid of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
his bitter <hi>Sarcasm</hi> upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
that to say, It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<hi>necessitate consequentiae,</hi>
but not <hi>consequentis,</hi> is all one
to say, It is necessary <hi>Tityre,</hi>
but not necessary <hi>tu patulae;</hi> I
will prevent it, by shewing
the difference in an instance. If
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43200:33"/>
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> would not have the
Goose go bare-foot, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
he should shoo it; this no
doubt but is a necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and yet I suppose he
will not think that the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is necessary: as that it
is necessary he should shoo the
Goose; and, to say truth, there
is no more necessity it should
rain to morrow, than there is to
shoo a Goose.</p>
               <p>3. In this instance of the
Weather there is another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency
about Necessity:
for whereas the question is,
Whether all things come to pass
necessarily? that is, out of such
necessary Causes, that it was
not possible they should not
come to pass; the proof of this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43200:34"/>
is taken from such a necessity as
belongs onely to Propositions,
not to Productions. Which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Propositions consists
onely in a necessary coherence
of the parts together, so as the
Enunciation is never false: as
when the <hi>Genus</hi> is predicated
of the <hi>Species,</hi> or the proper
Accident of the Subject; as,
<hi>Homo est Animal, &amp; Homo est
visibilis,</hi> are Propositions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
true, because they are
alwayes true, and nothing can
happen that should make them
false. So it is necessary, that
it should rain or not rain to
morrow, that is, it is a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
necessarily true, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be true; but no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Necessity in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43200:34"/>
question, which is the necessary
production of these Events
from necessary Causes. For if
this Necessity were implyed in
that Disjunction, then every
necessary Proposition should
consist of a necessary Effect,
predicated of sufficient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Causes, which every
mean Logician knows to be
false. And therefore, to use
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his own words,
because he is like to be best
pleased with them, this is all one
as to say, It is necessary <hi>Tityri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tÃ¨,
Ergo</hi> it is necessary <hi>tupatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licÃ©.</hi>
After he hath given his
Proofs, as he thinks, in full
weight, like a free Chapman,
he casts in one Argument over
and above, taken from God's
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43200:35"/>
Decrees and Prescience.</p>
               <p>Because Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself
doth not warrant this to be
good Logick, I cannot in civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
charge him for it; but if
his design be in that caution [if
I thought it good Logick] to
make us believe, that he made
a conscience of keeping these
Rules, I am sorry for his ill-luck
that he chose to do it here<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
for if he had but dipped his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
blindfold upon any other
part of his Discourse, he might
with more colour have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself than in this. For I
pray, against what Rule of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
doth he trespass, that useth
what arguments he pleaseth<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
But so apt is he to mistake in
reprehending others, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:43200:35"/>
cannot blame himself without
an errour: yet for all this,
though there be no want of
Logick in using this argument,
yet there is not much in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
he uses.</p>
               <p>First in general, both for
the Decree and Prescience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they be Divine Actions
that proceed from God's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes;
and the using of such
for arguments of truth in other
things, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself in his
Postscript confesseth to be the
cause of those many Errours
that men fall into: yet had he
not the grace to forbear, but
falls himself into the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
he decreed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as if he would prove his
Errour by his Fault. For what
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43200:36"/>
but a Fatal Necessity could
make him to do that which
with the same breath almost
he condemns? But to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>First, of the Decree, that it
is frustrated by Liberty.</p>
               <p>1. I answer, that to prove
Necessity from God's Decrees<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
is to prove <hi>obscurum per obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:</hi>
for of all the points of
Divinity, it is confessed by all
that write of it, That nothing is
more obscure than the nature
and efficacy of Divine Decrees<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
That is one <hi>Elenche</hi> and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
in Logick.</p>
               <p>2. Another is, That [De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree]
is an equivocal word, and
admits of diverse sences and
constructions. As, for instance,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43200:36"/>
God decrees to destroy some
City: that it may be either
Conditional, as if it repent
not; or Absolute, whether it
repent or no. 2. That Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
may be either as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the City onely,
and not to the means by which
it is to be destroyed, or to both.
For though God should decree
absolutely to destroy the City,
yet it is yet free that it be done
either by the mutual dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Citizens, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion
of an Enemy; either of
which are a sufficient, neither
a necessary meanes: Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is not necessary, because it
may be by Invasion; and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion
is not, because it may be
by Dissension. 3. It may be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43200:37"/>
Absolute both to the thing and
to the means. As for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that it may be by Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
among the Citizens, yet
that means may come to effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>
it two wayes; either upon
foresight, that they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of themselves, or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Decree of God that they
should dissent. 4. God may
also decree that two wayes<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
either by working upon the
Will by a power irresistible, <hi>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motionem
Physicam,</hi> as they call
it; or <hi>per Moralem,</hi> that is, such
inducements and inclinations
as will <hi>ducere,</hi> not <hi>trahere;</hi> by
either of which wayes God's
Decree may be accomplished.
This variety, partly in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
partly in the constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43200:37"/>
that are made of them,
which do all imply a different
respect to Liberty, doth make
the Argument from general
words insufficient to conclude
any thing, for <hi>dolus semper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>

                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>is.</hi>
That's another Fallacy in
Logick.</p>
               <p>3. Seeing Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hides
himself from his Adversary in
this Thicket of acceptions, it
will be necessary to beat every
Bush for him, and by inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the several sorts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
to shew that Liberty
threatens no destruction to any
of them, or, to speak more apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
needs fear none from them.
For if they be inconsistent and
mutually destructive, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43200:38"/>
to be said, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God should destroy
the Liberty of man, than that
the Liberty of man should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Decreee of God.</p>
               <p>And that God's Decree hath
no such operations upon man's
Liberty, I shall instance in the
most eminent of all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
in which all the world
and their actions are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I mean that of Election
and Reprobation, briefly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
you through the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
opinions and perswasions
that several men have of them.</p>
               <p>1. That Decree, by which
men are said to be ordain'd to
Salvation as Believers, and to
Damnation as dying in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,
presupposing their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43200:38"/>
Faith and Impenitence, can
have no operation upon those
actions that went before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(I mean) in considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though not in time.</p>
               <p>2. That Decree which is
put in such an order, as makes
it antecedent to mens actions,
may preserve the liberty of
their Wills divers wayes, and
by name, <hi>per congruam vocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
that is, by fitting them
with such opportune and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
inducements, as will
infallibly determine but not
necessitate them.</p>
               <p>3. That Decree that lies in
a middle way, between the
two forenamed, that in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
goes before, in Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
follows the actions; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43200:39"/>
to which opinion, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
the Reprobate are
called <hi>Praesciti,</hi> because they
be looked upon as Sinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be reprobated; and
the Elect are more peculiarly
called <hi>Praedestinati,</hi> because
they are elected before, or
without consideration of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Believers. This Decree,
as to the Reprobates, can have
no operation upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
because it follows them.
And as to the Elect, though it
goes before their faith, yet, as
was said before, it leaves it free
to follow after.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Decree be
any of these, or some others,
(for others there be) let him
wink and choose, or let him
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43200:39"/>
take the most rigid or peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of all, that of the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
that damns men before it
makes them, and saves them
before they have any thing to
be saved; which Decree above
all others is most like to impose
a Necessity upon humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet here the argument
will fail too.</p>
               <p>1. Because there be a great
many voluntary actions that
come not under this Decree, as
having no reference to life or
death, from the Decrees where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
must that Necessity flow.
As for Example, All indifferent
actions, which have nothing of
Morality, of Virtue, or Vice
in them, which we shall never
carry to Heaven or Hell with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43200:40"/>
us. Now those Actions which
work nothing towards the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
of the Decree, can
receive no Necessity from it:
for if there be any Necessity
from the Decree, upon humane
Actions, it is because it cannot
be accomplished without them.</p>
               <p>2. Upon the same account,
not onely indifferent but many
moral Actions are free from
the necessity of the Decree.
For Example, all the good that
a Reprobate doth (for no
doubt they do many things
morally and substantially good,
and abstain from many Evils,)
cannot be necessitated by the
Decree of Reprobation; for
certainly a man may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without doing good. In
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43200:40"/>
llke manner all the evil that
the Elect doth (for who is there
that sins not?) is also free from
the Necessity his Decree can
lay upon him, unless you will
say it is necessary for him to
sin, that he may be saved; for
he is under no other Decree,
but that unto life and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>3. Upon the same score I
adde further, that the Decree
layes no Necessity upon any
one action a man doth; for not
onely Election cannot necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
a man to sin, and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot necessitate a man to
do good; but also neither
doth Election necessitate a man
to do good, nor Reprobation
evil, as to any particular good
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43200:41"/>
or evil: the reason is, because
their Decrees may be brought
to pass without them. As <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
though he had not betray'd
his Master, might have been
hanged for some other sin; for
certainly Reprobation doth
not necessitate a man to kill
his Father or Mother, or to
commit any other sin by name.
So likewise St. <hi>Peter</hi> might
have been saved, though he
had not at that time when he
did, made his confession, that
<hi>Christ was the Son of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it had been sufficient to
accomplish the Decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to have believed in
Christ at any other time: and
if no individual action be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the bringing of that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43200:41"/>
to pass which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
then whatsoever else
may, the Decree cannot make
it necessary. Now if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
gives no necessity to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
indifferent, nor to good
actions on the Reprobate, nor
to evil in the Elect, no, nor to
any one particular to either of
them; what actions are there
left, upon which the Decree
can have any such operation?
Lastly, if the Decree may pass
upon men without respect to
their well or ill doing, as in the
last nam'd Opinion (which of
all others is confess'd most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to necessitate) is supposed,
then 'tis evident there can be
no Necessity to do well or ill
in reference to the Decree,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43200:42"/>
which hath no reference to
well or ill doing. But you
will say, to do this or that is
necessary, though not to the
Decree it self, yet to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it. And I beseech you
why so? for may not a man as
justly be hang'd without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as be condemn'd to be
hang'd without it? Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it is ill done to lay that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Decree, which belongs
to the execution of it, and 'tis
worse if it belongs to neither.
But it may be Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has
another kind of Decree by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as he hath many other
conceipts. If he hath, it may
prove to be of that nature,
when he shall vouchsafe to let
us know it, that I shall deny
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43200:42"/>
the antecedent of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That there is any such
Decree; but be it what it will,
I shall the consequence, That
therefore there is no liberty in
humane actions: which I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he should let go upon his
bare word, when he cannot
but know, that thousands of
Authors, which do not agree
about the nature of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
do yet all agree in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the consequence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of Prescience, and
argument taken from it.</p>
               <p>1. Though it be an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
speech to say, that God
foresees any thing, which must
imply a <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>posterius</hi> in
his actions, things incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with Eternity, that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43200:43"/>
to all times; yet because
we cannot understand God's
actions but by taking measure
by our own, and future things
are not seen by us but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen,
I do allow Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> to
say, That those things which
are future to us, though not to
God, are yet foreseen by him,
provided, that use be not
made of it, to argue from his
foresight as an act that is past,
upon which as a Cause must
depend an Effect that must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after it: for God's vision
doth not prevent the thing
seen, but accompany it; for
that's the nature of every act,
that it supposes the object in
some kind of being, and so is
meerly accidental to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43200:43"/>
of it, and can lay no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
upon it. And though
it be hard to comprehend,
how God should now be said
to be present with those things
which are yet to come; and
yet on the other side it is as
hard to apprehend how it can
be otherwise, that God should
be eternal, and yet not present
with any part of time, as well
future as past. When Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
shall teach us, how God can
see that which is not to be seen,
for that which is future is not,
and therefore is not to be seen;
and to say they are to be seen
in their Causes, is liable to the
same difficulties, because the
particular Causes of the thing
are as well future as the thing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43200:44"/>
it self: that is, if he can shew a
better way than this, That
those things are present to
God which are future to us, I
will let go my hold. In the
mean time it shall serve for my
first answer to the argument
from God's Prescience, That
because all vision supposes the
thing seen to be, it is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
to it, and cannot necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
it.</p>
               <p>2. Admitting foresight in
God as an act past, and the
thing to follow, it must follow
in the same condition it was
foreseen, (granting me that
which I shall presently prove,
That Cod can foresee contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
things:) That which in
the nature of it was contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43200:44"/>
cannot become necessary
by being foreseen, for then he
should not see as they are. But
you will say, If God foresees
them, it is necessary they
should come to pass; I say so
too, but how? in that quality
that God foresaw them, that
is, contingently; for it's as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that those things that
are produced of contingent
Causes, should come to pass,
as those that are produced of
necessary, upon supposition of
God's foresight: and it is no
bull in that sense to say, That
contingent things are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For there is a double Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
one of Illation and
Discourse, an other of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
and Operation. To
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43200:45"/>
affirm the latter of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
things implies a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
but not so the former;
that is, God's Prescience is a
necessary argument to prove,
because he cannot be mistaken,
but not a necessary Cause to
produce the Effect, of which
onely necessity the question
is moved. This argument
therefore hath a term too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
there is one Necessity in
the Premises, another in the
Conclusion, <hi>Praescientia Dei
necessariÃ² probat, non necessariÃ²
producit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> shall deny that
which I promised to prove,
That God can foresee contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Events, because they have
no necessary Causes; then he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43200:45"/>
cannot also foresee what shall
come to pass or not come to
pass, upon the performance or
not performance of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But that God can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
such things, I hope he will
not deny; yet because he is a
liberal and fierce denyer, I
shall put in him mind of one
Instance. God told <hi>David</hi> that
the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him into <hi>Saul</hi>'s hand, but
with this tacite condition, If
he stay'd among them. And
for the consequence, I prove
it thus: In this prediction and
prevision of what the men of
<hi>Keilah</hi> would do, there was no
necessary Cause, as is plain,
for that it did not bring to
pass the Effect; for the men of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43200:46"/>
                  <hi>Keilah</hi> did not, though God
foresaw it, deliver <hi>David</hi> into
<hi>Saul</hi>'s hand.</p>
               <p>And if God can foresee what
would have been, but what was
not, why may he not rather
foresee any thing that shall be,
though it may not have been,
that is, any future contingent?
For if the reason why future
contingents cannot be seen or
foreseen, be, that they have no
necessary Causes; then condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
previsions and predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of such things, as for fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of the condition come
not to pass, could not be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
also, for that they have
no necessary Causes, as appears
by the event.</p>
               <p>These be all Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43200:46"/>
Arguments; yet because he
hath found another invention,
a kind of Lieutenant-Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to which we are ever
and anon remitted when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
be out of the way,
which he calls <hi>Reflection,</hi> and
he may take it ill if it goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
unlooked on, it will be
necessary to exchange a word
or two about it also.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:43200:47"/>
               <head>OF
REFLECTION.</head>
               <p>LET us see how well it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to stand in the
Muster-roll of his <hi>Militia,</hi> and
hath done such Facts for the
subduing of those Monstrous
Errors of our Ignorant Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
as is pretended, and
for which he dresses a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Discourse. This you will
easily perceive both by the
Nature of it, and the Effects and
Atchievments of it.</p>
               <p>1. The Nature of it is (as
far as I can guess) to consider
what I my self think of that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43200:47"/>
which another says and proves
not: that is, I demand of him
and would know, whether that
be true which he affirms, he
bids me, Go look. Now is
that a way to teach me Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to send me to my self,
that is, to one that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
to inform me? And this
is that <hi>Columbus</hi> of our New
World of Philosophy, <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
This is that which (by a
Digression on purpose) is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
to Posterity as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
new Engine, that will
fetch Truth out of the very
bottom of <hi>Democritus</hi> his Pit.
And yet perhaps there's more
in it, than we are at the first
sight able to apprehend, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
being blinded with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43200:48"/>
our Old and Hereditary Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
               <p>2. Therefore he shews to the
World two Noble Experiments
of the vertue of it, which he
hath found in himself; two such
Rarities, as could never be
found in all the Books and
Philosophers that ever you
met with. One is, that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing to be good, and
loving it, is all one. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that Eternity is not <hi>Nunc stans.</hi>
These be the two rare
Experiments which (like a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Mountebank) he hangs
out for the better reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and vending his <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must needs grant, that
these be two admirable strange
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43200:48"/>
Effects of it. For in the first,
Reflection makes him see that
which is not; and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
it makes him not see that
which is.</p>
               <p>For First, that thinking a
thing to be good, and loving
it, is all one; who ever saw
such a sight before times? who
can believe that any thing
should make Thinking and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all one? For my part I
am still in as much doubt as
ever I was; for no Reflection
can prevail with me before
these Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Because they proceed
from several Faculties of the
Soul; one from the Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
the other from the Effective
part. It is not in the power of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43200:49"/>
Reflection to persuade me
that the same Water come
out of two distinct Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
               <p>2. Because nothing can go
before it self; and he tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>
loves any thing because he hath
reason to think it good, mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>
of necessity first think it to be
so.</p>
               <p>3. If Thinking and Loving
were all one, then to think a
thing to be evil, and to love it,
is all one too. For if the Acts
themselves be not all one, the
Object that is the Good can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make them so. But he
will say, If a man reflects, <hi>i. e.</hi>
if he mark it, he that doth the
one, doth the other too: and
they go always together, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43200:49"/>
then why not all one?</p>
               <p>1. I will tell you why, and
I find it by Reflection too;
that he that speaks doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
open his Mouth; and
yet they are not all one. The
Needle also and the Thred go
together, and yet not all one.
They that first told us of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocentaures,</hi>
certain Creatures
that are half Men and half
Beasts, I believe found them
but by Reflection too. For
the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> when they first
saw Men upon the backs of
Beasts so near together, thought
them to be but one Creature.
Just so, to make Loving and
Thinking all one, because he
sees them together, is one of
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s <hi>Hippocentaures;</hi> for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43200:50"/>
he hath a Herd of them in this
little Copse: As that Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Voluntary are all one,
that Deliberation and Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Hope and Fear are all
one, that to make an end of
Deliberation and to be Free is
all one, that Sufficient and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
is all one, that to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
of some Cause and to
be necessitated is all one. In
all these to believe them, or
not to believe them, I hope
will be all one too.</p>
               <p>2. As they are not the same,
though they go together; so
they cannot be the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they go not together. I
mean necessarily. For first there
may be thinking of a thing
good without loving it, a thing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43200:50"/>
too too well known, that men
act contrary to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
<q>
                     <l>âVideo meliora, probÃ³que;</l>
                     <l>Deteriora sequorâ</l>
                  </q>
Secondly, there may be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of that which they do not
think and judge to be good,
because Love many times em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
the good that Sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
offers; which is contrary
to that good which serious
thinking commends. And I
make a question, whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that loves, can
think also and judge. For I
know that an Ass loves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender;
yet I would give
somewhat to know what he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43200:51"/>
thinks for all that; which I
would not if they were all
one. But it may be I may
wrong the poor Ass also to say
he cannot think; for there be
some Philosophers so charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Beasts, as to say they
can reason and discourse. Well,
if I have wrong'd the Ass I
will make him amends, and
say, that if he can think, he can
reflect too; and if he can do
that, he may be one of our
new Philosophers, that shall
find out many Truths that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
never knew; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
shall see plainly that
which never a Philosopher of
them all did see: that to think
a thing to be good, and to love
it, is all one. For that is the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43200:51"/>
first benefit of Reflection, to
see that which is not.</p>
               <p>2. The next is, not to see that
which is, as that <hi>Nunc stans</hi> is
nothing, or signifies nothing,
of Eternity.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his meaning be,
that those words do not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully express what Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is, it is so vulgar a Truth,
as well for all things that be
Infinite, as this, and for all
words that can be invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Man, as well as
these, that he needed not the
help of this rare Invention to
discover it. But if his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be, that by those Terms
(<hi>Nunc stans</hi>) an imperfect
knowledge of Eternity (such
as Infinite things are capable
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43200:52"/>
of) cannot be known, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that which consists in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
and removing such Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Affections from it, as
belong to finite things; he is
very little beholden to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
if it will not let him
see so much; which is all that
any man can desire or hope to
see of Infinite things.</p>
               <p>And that so much may be
seen of Eternity by <hi>Nunc stans,</hi>
I shall desire him to forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon himself, that is,
upon one that deceives him,
and reflect upon the meaning
of the Terms that use them,
when Eternity is said to be
[<hi>Nunc,</hi>] it is to remove from it
<hi>praeteritum &amp; futurum, prius &amp;
posterius,</hi> which are parts of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43200:52"/>
Time, that is finite; therefore
they say that all times are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with the Eternal at once.
And it is likewise called <hi>Nunc
stans,</hi> to remove from it a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
or Motion of part after
part, which belongs onely to
Time, that is finite; for that to
which any thing is added must
needs be finite; though you
adde a thousand thousand, and
and after that ten thousand
times as many more without
stint, you can never make it
<hi>Infinitum</hi> or <hi>Aeternum.</hi> And
therefore to remove from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
these finite Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Terms of <hi>Nunc stans</hi>
are not unfitly us'd for that
purpose: and for more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Eternity than that, it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43200:53"/>
was never in any mans pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to use them. If your
Reflection would not let you
see this, I am afraid that though
it make you quick at seeing
some things, that no body else
can see; yet in that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
it takes away from you
the sight of that which every
body sees; I am afraid (I say)
it is not good for the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight.
I conclude therefore,
(without thinking of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
revenge for the Nonsense,
and Contradiction, and the
<hi>Tityres</hi> and <hi>Tu patulaes,</hi> and such
gear as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is pleased to
daub all those with that are
not of his mind) with this
good counsel, that he give over
his Reflection in time, lest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43200:53"/>
of teaching him some
new tricks in Philosophy, it
make him at last play at <hi>Old,
blind, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should here make an end,
but that I see Paper enough
left, and leisure too to answer
an Objection that I may seem
lyable to: as, What do I sneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a Private Letter,
which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> wrote to his
Obliging Lord? Who besides
is said, not to write Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
for those that like it not;
and therefore I ought not to
trouble him that desires not to
trouble me.</p>
               <p>To the first I answer, That
though the Letter was once a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43200:54"/>
Private one, yet I saw it not
till it became a Publick, till
they were Letters Patents for
any bodies reading. And for
the other, though it be reason
not to trouble them that do
not trouble us in some cases, as
if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> had vented his new
Speculations upon making Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Distortions, turning
and tossing the poor Figures
up and down, and then gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
at some Reasons of them,
which he merrily calls his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
I say, if Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> had
spent his Time and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
upon these onely, he had
onely disturbed the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of Images and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations,
which are nothing,
and therefore ought not to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43200:54"/>
have been disturbed by any in
those his pleasant Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But when (against mine
and every bodies Interest) he
labours to introduce a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
into all mens Actions,
that they have no power to
do more or less than they do,
he takes away the nature of
Vertues and Vices, and so their
relation to Reward and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
and by consequence
leaves no place for Hope or
Fear: which must needs shake
not onely the Foundation of
all Religion, but even of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Society. It is such a
pernicious piece of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
