            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>peached Members (notwithstanding their pretended desires to travell) did continue in, and about London, very active and busie to raise warre, or make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance in the Kingdome. And that the Committee of <hi>Militia</hi> there, did comply with them therein by daily list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, and other preparations towards war, and shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to that end, yea, and entertaining into service, those same Reformadoes, who (by Ordinance of Parliament) were by them to have been put out of the Lines of Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finding continuall jealousies and disturbances to our said proceedings bred in the Army by the daily reports and alarums thereof from the City, wee made a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular addresse to the Parliament for the restoring of the City-<hi>Militia</hi> into those hands in which it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ordinance of the fourteenth of May, last; or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29448:5"/>
last: For the reasonableness of our Desires wherein (supposing that we had such cause to insist on some removall of that power out of the hands into which it was then put up (as here before is partly exprest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in our late Declaration is more fully set forth) we dare confidently appeal to all men (not engaged against us) whether, for the present safety and quiet of the City upon such a change, and to prevent those dangers or disturbances to or in the City, which the want of a <hi>Militia</hi> during the interval (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ceasing of one and new forming of another) might give occasion and advantage unto (especially in such a juncture of affairs) there could be any other way so expedient, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that change, but an immediate reverting into those hands in which it was so lately before (who would make up a <hi>Militia</hi> ready formed to succeed immediately in place of the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any considerable intermission or delay) and whether at a time when Jealousies and Distrusts were both so rife and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (as they might occasion no less distraction or interruption to any quiet settlement or proceedings thereunto, then reall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of mischief would) there could be any proposall more reasonable or hopefull to beget a confidence and acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence (as to that point) both in the Parliament, City and Army, then to have that Power restored (for the present) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those hands, of whose Fidelity to the Common Interest, we had all found so ample and unquestioned proof throughout the most dangerous Times.</p>
            <p>Upon our Address therefore to the Parliament for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (the Army being at such distance as aforesaid) both Houses were pleased, on the 23. of <hi>July</hi> last, to passe an Ordinance for returning of the Militia into those hands, and repealing the Ordinance of the 4. of <hi>May,</hi> by which it had heen changed as before.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, hoping all would quietly succeed to a settlement in this Kingdome, we went on securely to finish our Proposals for that purpose (the Heads whereof have been since published) withdrew the Head-quarter to a farther distance, dispersed the Army to larger Quarters, for more ease to the Countrey; And upon a Recommendation of the businesse of <hi>Ireland</hi> from the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29448:6"/>
Parl. we had, in lesse then a weeks space, prepared and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a considerable force (no lesse then 4000. horse and foot, as Sir <hi>Thomas Temple</hi> employed from the Parliament about that businesse to us can testifie) for a present reliefe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: But the restlesse and treacherous malice of the enemies to our and the Kingdomes peace (taking their supposed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our distance, and dispersed posture (which their faire pretence of peaceable intentions had induced us into) first, they did without all colour of authority, contrive and set on foot in the City, and many of them entred into a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and desperate vow and ingagement, tending to the subversion of the freedome of Parliament, and the liberties of this Nation, to the frustrating of those just and publicke ends, for which so much blood and treasure hath been spilt, and spent, in the late Warres, and to the rising of a new Warre against the Parliament and their Army (which said ingagement both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament, did by their Declaration of the 23. of <hi>July</hi> adjudge and declare to be high Treason in all that should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote or abet the same; and within a few dayes after (to wit, on Munday, <hi>July</hi> 26.) there was a Petition brought to the Parliament, by the Sheriffes, and some Aldermen, and Common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-men, in the name of the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the said Ordinance of the 23. of <hi>July,</hi> concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the returning of the <hi>Militia</hi> into those hands, in which it was put by the Ordinance of the 4. of <hi>May,</hi> which Petition was immediately followed and backed with a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous confluence of Apprentices, and other dissolute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate persons, who committed most horrid and unheard of violence upon both Houses, inforcing them to recall both the said Declaration of the three and twenty day of <hi>July</hi> (concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the said engagement.) And also the said Ordinance of the same date, concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> and compelling the Speaker of the House of Commons to resume the Chaire, after the House was adjourned, and the House to passe such further <hi>Votes</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Kings present comming to <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> as they the said Rioters did please, neither the Guard from the City, that then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Houses, nor the Lord Mayor, Sheriffes, or any Authority
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29448:6"/>
in the City (though sent to for that purpose) taking any course to suppress the said tumult, or relieve the Parliament against that violence, though it was continued for the space of eight or ten houres.</p>
            <p>And the Houses having next day adjourned till Friday, <hi>July</hi> 30. There were Printed Ticekts fixed upon posts, in and about the City the day before, inviting the same persons to the like confluence at <hi>Westminster,</hi> against the Houses next meeting. All which hath been more fully and more assuredly made known, by the Declaration of the Speaker of the House of Commons concerning the same.</p>
            <p>By this meanes the Speakers of both Houses, together with most of the Lords, and a very great number of the most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unquestioned Members of the House of Commons, were driven away, so as they could not with safety attend their service in Parliament, nor with freedome discharge their trust to the Kingdome therein, but were forced to fly to their Army for safety, so as there was not, nor could then be, any free meeting or legall proceeding of a Parliament. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which divers Members of both Houses, (who by the carriage and sequell of the businesse, will appeare to be of the same party and confederacy with the aforesaid Enemies to our and the Kingdomes Peace, and with the Authors and Actors both of the said treasonable engagement, and the tumultuous force upon the Parliament.) Taking this opportunity of time, to carry on their designes, when very few were left, but of their own party, did continue to meet in the usuall places in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster.</hi> And (having under pretence of a necessity for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the Parliament, by adjournment, drawne in some few well-minded Members to sit with them, out of a seru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple least the Parliament should fall for want of adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) tooke upon them the name of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And having on Friday, <hi>July</hi> 30. chosen a new Speaker, did proceed to Vote and Act as a Parliament, and adjourned from time to time; But of what party and confederacy the most of them were, and to what ends and interests they acted, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by what they did, whereof we shall for present give a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29448:7"/>
taste in some particulars, hoping that shortly the whose Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of their proceedings may be made publique.</p>
            <p>For, the said Members of the House of Commons (conveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as aforesaid) immediately Voted and called in (as to the service of the House) the Eleven impeached Members. And also those who upon former Votes of the House were suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or under question to be put out for Delinquency, and had put in their cales; with this pretended House of Commons thus composed, and foure or five Lords of the same Modell (for an house of Peers) they proceed to set up a Committee for safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (whereof all or most of the said Impeached Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were a part) this Committee they appointed to joyne with that same pretended Committee of the City <hi>Militia,</hi> whose power was obtained onely by the tumultuous force and violence aforesaid: To these Committees the most or many of their proceedings referre, and by divers pretended Vot<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s, Orders and Ordinances, procured in the name of one or both Houses of Parliament, large powers were given to these two Committees for raising of Forces, appointing chief Commanders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other Officers; and other vast, unlimited, or unusuall powers were given them, all tending to the raising and levying of a new Warre within this Kingdome; upon which many forces both of Horse and Foot, were actually le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed, and other preparations of Warre made; All which, that they were intended and designed in Justification, prosecution, and maintenance of the aforesaid treasonable engagement, and of the said force and violence done to the Parliament, or of the vere same ends and interests, and to oppose and hinder the restitution of the Houses of Parliament, to their honour and freedome, and the advance of this their Army for that purpose, being then upon a March. Besides the consideration of the persons into whose hands these powers were committed. It is abundantly evident many other wayes, but especially by that Declaration of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>councell of <hi>London,</hi> which was first, by that pretended Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of safety, Ordered, and then by the pretended House (without reading a word of it) approved to be published in the Parish Churches, with an exhortation to the people to take
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29448:7"/>
up Armes, in maintenance of the ends therein expressed, which (though the pretence were for the Defence of the King, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and City, then alledged to be in great danger, (when as indeed none were in danger, but onely the Authors, Acters, and Abe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>tors of the traiterous practises aforesaid, yet) the true ends thereof appear clearly to be the same with the said trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Engagement, and tumult against the Parliament, all of them concerning (as in other things, so especially in this) <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To have the King brought up to London without delay, or any nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer approach of the Army.</hi> And to al these, the succeeding votes of the pretended Houses, for the same thing did speedily e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>eration of the case, since both Houses, and both Kingdomes also (of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>) resolved, that it was not safe, the King should come to <hi>London,</hi> until he had given satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; security to his people, in relation to those publique ends for which so much blood and treasure had been spent) we shall onely say thus much to these mens intentions and designes in the businesse. That had the King come up to <hi>London,</hi> (as they have so oft desired and attempted) it is apparent they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and would have made use of it, rather to lay the stronger foundations of a new warre (upon the ruines of that publique interest contended for in the former, and of all those that had with most candor, clearnesse, and simplicity of heart, appeared and acted for the same) then any way to settle thereby a safe and well grounded Peace. And since they could not rationally expect so easie an obtaining of the Kings Person to <hi>London</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a pretended Vote or Declaration of their desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is as evident that they could intend nothing thereby, but a more plausible pretence, and foundation of quarrel against this Army, whereby to engage or incline to their assistance the Kings party, and such others, who might be catcht with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension thereof, as a speedy way to Peace (the thing so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally longed for) and by such assistance gained the better to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine this Army, and those faithful Members of Parliament, who were retired to it. For our parts we shall rejoyce as much as any, to see the King brought back to his Parliament (and that) not so much in place, as in affection and agreement on such
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29448:8"/>
sound termes and grounds, as may render both Him and the Kingdom, safe, quiet, and happy, and shal be as ready as any to bring his Majesty to <hi>London,</hi> when his being there may be likely to produce (not greater disturbances, but) a Peace indeed. And that such as may not (with the ship-wrack of the publique interest) be shaped and moulded onely to the private advantages of a particular party or Faction. But bottomed chiefly on grounds of common and publique welfare &amp; securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And if (without regard to these considerations) wee would have brought his Majesty with us to <hi>London</hi> in our late advance t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ither (which our enemies could not hinder or prejudice us in) wee had no cause to doubt, but (as to men) we might have had all the advantages which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries promised to themselves, thereby added to the strength and interest of the Army, and have inverted the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages upon them that they intended against us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; So as his Majesties so much deared comming to <hi>London</hi> might have been much to their prejudice, and our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and security, if we had regarded onely our owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>But (as at present out consciences beare cleare witnesses to our selves, so) wee hope God will in the issue make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it cleare to others, that we have not minded, nor been acting our owne worke or interests, but the Kingdomes, and every honest mans in it. Meane while (to returne to our purpose) wee thinke it is sufficiently cleared, That the proceedings of those Members or the Major part of them (that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sit at <hi>Westminster</hi> during the absence of the Speakers) the Powers by them given, the Forces thereupon levied, and other preparations of Warre thereupon made, were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed and driven on, in prosecution and maintenance of the said treasonable engagement, and of the force done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Parliament, or for the same ends and interest with them, and to oppose the advance of this Army towards <hi>London,</hi> for restitution of the Parliament to honour and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and indeed to raise a new warre in the Kingdome against the Parliament and their Army for the destruction thereof. And the same may (yet further) appeare by this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29448:8"/>
that those very Apprentices, Reformadoes and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City who were the chiefe actors in the said engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tumult, were afterwards most trusted and imployed, and most active in their preparations for War.</p>
            <p>By what we have here said, and what hath been declared and published from us, and from the Speakers, and afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Members of both Houses, and by the whole series of our own, and our enemies actions and carriages (compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together) it may appeare how tender we have been not onely of the Authority and just priviledges of Parliament, and of the safety, Peace and wel-fare both of the Kingdome and the City, but even towards those our enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es (seeking onely things necessary for the common good of the whole (and that if possible) without ruine or hurt to any, and yet how maliciously and unworthily we have that while been dealt withall by those our enemies, and by a factious and Powerfull party (especially) in the Parliament and City combining with them: And what clear cause we have had both for all that we have formerly desired or done in prevention of our owne ruine and the Kingdomes disturbance, and also what just grounds for our late ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to <hi>London.</hi> The good service whereof (especially) in restoring the Parliament to a condition of safety, honour and freedome, thereby hath been (without any seeking of ours) acknowledged by both Houses with thanks to us, and publique thanksgiving to the Almighty for it: And a further trust hath been thereupon committed to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for taking care with his Army to safe-guard the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</p>
            <p>The Houses being thus restored to a condition of present safety, Honour and Freedome: Two things seeme clearly remaining to be done (which our own and most mens expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations are most set upon) <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, to Vindicate the Honour, Freedome, and safety of Parliament from the like affronts and violences in Future, and the Army and Kingdome from danger of the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances (whilst things shall be in a debate or treaty for a settlement) and then to proceed unto a speedy settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29448:9"/>
of the Peace of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The latter of these is, first in our intentions (being nearest to the ultimate end.) And we shall earnestly desire that in order thereunto, The proposals of the Army (whereof the heades are published) may be speedily considered and brought to a Resolution. But considering that the debates of them may take up some time ere they be agreed o all hands, and the framing of them into Bils, and perfecting of the same will require much more. Something must first be done in the former for a present security to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from like affronts or violence, and to the Army and Kingdome from the like disturbances to the Peace thereof by any farther advantage which the time like to be spent in the setling of Peace, may afford to our watchfull, restlesse, and (we doubt) implacable enemies.</p>
            <p>First, therefore to these ends (unlesse it should be thought fit to secure the Parliament by keeping the whole body of the Army, or so great a part thereof, to remaine continually in and about <hi>London,</hi> as might be sure to over-power any future tumults or force that may arise out of the City, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wel-fare of the City and ease of the parts adjacent, nor the safety of the Kingdome, in respect of the present po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of affaires will admit.)</p>
            <p>It is absolutely necessary that there be speedy and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary justice done upon (at least) the chiefe Authors or abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the said treasonable engagement, and of the said force done to the Parliament, and upon the chief Actors, in maintenance and prosecution thereof (whereby men may be deterred from the like in future.</p>
            <p>And this is also as necessary to the security of the Army, and Peace of the Kingdome, since it is apparent by all that hath been said, and by infinite other evidences (too many to recount.) That both the said ingagement and the force done to the Parliament, and the power of the City <hi>militia</hi> thereby gained, &amp; the succeeding Votes and orders of the pretended Houses, (but indeed of that faction that are our professed enemies) in maintenance and prosecution thereof, and the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29448:9"/>
Forces thereupon leavyed (put under the Command of Major Generall <hi>Massey,</hi> and others our professed adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) were all designed and directed to the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of this Army, and the raising of a new Warre against us in this Kingdome. And having had such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their restlesse malice and cruel intentions towards us, (notwithstanding our tendernesse and lenity towards them) and of their treacherous dealing (so soone as they thought they had the advantage) notwithstanding all their semblances of complyance to a composure. What reason is there to expect, but that by our patience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, they apprehend in future the like or other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they will breake out againe into the like or worse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of violence and Warre, if all escape with impunity for these.</p>
            <p>But as to this point of security by exemplary Justice in an ordinary way, we see our hopes almost frustrated, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest, (though our desires and resolutions to that purpose, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in our late Declaration of our advance towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> were then seconded with the declared approbation and concurrent resolutions of the Speakers and Members of both Houses, that were driven away to the Army, and with their engagement to live and die with us therein. And though in pursuance thereof, the Right Honourable House of Peeres, have since their restitution, begun and proceeded to declare null and void, all that was done in the name of both Houses, while they lay under the power of that tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous violence; and to give their more authentique approbation to our said Declaration, made in behalf of the said Speakers and Members, while they were with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and in behalfe of the honour and freedome of the Parliament, and to give their like approbation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Declaration and Engagement of the said Speakers and Members, made to us while they were with us, yet) the House of Commons hath not onely not concurred with the Lords in any of those things, but rather seeme to have cast them aside. And upon the Question concerning those very Votes of the said 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July.</hi> To which the Houses
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29448:10"/>
were by the said violence inforced [whether they should b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Null and void] it was carried in the Negative, That the Question should not be put, by the consequences whereof, (which are many wayes very sad, this poor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and more then we can recompt) and by all subsequent proceedings in that House, in relation to the whole busines, we clearly finde, That the Members of that house, who (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the violence done to it, and during the absence of the Speaker, and the other Members thereby driven away) proceeding in the name of that House as aforesaid, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the pretended powers, and did make the pretended Votes, Orders, and Ordinances aforementioned; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were the Factors thereupon for the leavying of War, in prosecution and maintenance of the aforesaid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable engagement, and force done to the Parliament, and for the opposing, resisting, and destroying of this the Parliaments Army in its advance to <hi>London,</hi> for the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parliament to its honour and freedome, being conscious of their own guilt and danger thereby; yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming on their interest in the House, and the patience and lenity of this Army doe continue and intrude themselves, and to sit and vote there, and by their present interest in the House doe use their utmost endeavours, and very much prevaile to obstruct and avoid the bringing of any to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, who have acted under their pretended Authority, (knowing it to be their owne case and concernment in point of impunity, as well as conducency to their faction and interest) And for that cause they labour (as for life) to uphold the things past and done, and the Authorities gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by them and their Faction (in their and the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices pretended Parliament) yea, even those very Votes and Authorities, wrested from the Parliament, by that palpable force of <hi>July</hi> the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, to be good and valid untill they be repealed (as if past in a free and legall Parliament;) in which Point, and all Questions touching upon it, we finde they presume upon, and are strengthened by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of divers other Members, who having (perhaps with harmlesse intentions) continued to sit with them during
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29448:10"/>
