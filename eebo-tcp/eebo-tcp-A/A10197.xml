         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Declarations;</hi> Hath made me
so presumptuous, as not only to compile, but likewise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
this unpolished <hi>Quench-Coale</hi> to your Royall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage:
Wherein like a plain-dealing English-man, I have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1659:3"/>
according to my poore ability, not only defended the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England,
in the particulars now oppugned, against those treacherous
rebellious Sonnes of hers who have professedly both in their
Sermons, practises and printed Bookes oppugned them, out
of her owne Records and Writers (which I have princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
made use of) but likewise discovered and layd open,
without flattery or partiallity, their desperate practises,
aymes, plots and intentions, to suppresse and roote out our
syncere Religion, and usher in Popery by degrees; Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the method, and progresse they have made and
prosecuted in this their pernicious designe.</p>
            <p>The reasons inducing me to dedicate this rude incompt
Discourse (which I had neither time nor opportunity to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish)
to your Sacred Majesty were these.</p>
            <p>1. First, to acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>int your Highnes, with the severall
dangers wherewith the Religion, Doctrine and Discipline,
by Law establishest in the Church of England, are now sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
and those open affronts and oppositions made of
late yeares against it; Of which I presume, your Majesty
(who commonly see with other mens eyes, and heare with
other mens eares, as most Princes are forced to doe) have
not beene yet so fully acquainted, as your faithfull Subjects
could desire, especially by your Prelates.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, to informe your Majesty, how grosly some
of your Prelates and Chaplaines have abused your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and your Subjects eares and eyes, both in the Pulpit, the
<note n="b" place="margin">See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coale from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, p. 64. the Order, of the Counsell-Table con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning S. Gregories Church: And Ibid. p. 15. 16. 17. 19. 53. to 58.</note>
               <hi>Counsell-Chamber,</hi> and in printed Bookes, in the point of
<hi>Altars,</hi> and their <hi>situation of Communion-Tables Altarwise
against the East wall of the Quire;</hi> Which Altars &amp; <hi>Situs</hi> of
Lords-Tables, they have peremptorily affirmed, <hi>to be conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the practise of approred Antiquity; Yea to the Statutes,
Doctrine, Canons and Discipline of the Church of England;</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1659:3"/>
When as it is most apparant: That the primitive Church
laand Christians had no Altars, but Tables only, for aboue 260
teyeares after Christ; And that then and ever since, till now of
late, <hi>both their Tables and Altars were alwayes placed in the</hi>
MIDST <hi>of their Quires or Churches;</hi> As J have here plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifully
manifested; And that they neither bowed to nor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Altars, as these new Doctours falsely dogmatize.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly; To present unto your Majesty, the many
dangerous Innovations and backslidings to Popery that
have crept into our Church of late, and now are publikely
justifyed in print, yea enjoyned by some of your potent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and enforced on your poore Subjects (especially godly
Ministers) under paine of suspension, excommunication, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
yea fining, imprisonment and utter ruine in your
High Commissions, (at<note n="*" place="margin">See 1. Eliz. c. 1. 8. Eliz. c. 1.</note>

            <p>
               <q>That you will never give way to the authorizing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

whereby the Church of England hath stood &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
ever since. That you doe professe to maintaine the

then those who apparantly oppugne it,) as culpable both
to God and your Majesty; And will expect that hereafter
they give you a better account;</q> Yet notwithstanding both
these your royall <hi>Declarations;</hi> Some of your Prelates (who
were both privies and parties to them) with others of your

yea the whole Kingdomes consideration, and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Censures that your Royall Justice can inflict.</p>
            <p>First, they have purged &amp; corrupted the <hi>Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer</hi>
in two severall places, the first whereof so
neerely concernes your Majesty, your Royall Confort and
Princely Issue, that J should be no lesse then an Arch-Traytor
to you all, should I not discover but conceale it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ancient Common-prayer-Bookes there was this</hi>
Collect <hi>prescribed</hi> for the Queen, Prince and Royall Issue
O God, who art the Father of thine Elect and of their seed, we
humblie beseeth thee to blesse our most gracious Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These busy Innovatours, to testify their loyalty and duty
to your Majesty, your Queen and Royall Issue, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed

Castawayes, with one dash; Blotting this clause <hi>(who art the
Farher of thine Elect and of their seed)</hi> quite out of this <hi>Collect,</hi>

have done as much as in them lies, not only to deprive your
Majesty and your Princely Jssue, of that temporall Crowne
of Soveraignty over these your Realmes, to which you are
Elected by God, but also to rob both your Majesty, your Noble
Queen, your Royall Issue, your most Illustrious Sister, and

            <p>2. The second alteration they have made in the <hi>Booke of
Common-prayer</hi> is, in <hi>the Epistle for Palme-Sunday;</hi> small
in appearance, but great in consequence.</p>
            <p>All the Common Prayer-Bookes before the yeare of our
Lord 1629. (as likewise, <hi>Tyndals, Couerdales, Thomas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes
and the Bishops Bibles,</hi> used in our Churches till Anno
1612.) read that text of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. according to the original,
the Fathers, all Latine Writers and Translations, but two of
late (to witt the <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Castalio,</hi> who render it <hi>Ad nomen,</hi>
not IN <hi>nomine,</hi> as all others doe) in this maner. <hi>That IN
the name of Iesus every knee should bow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But these Innovatours, to Jdolize the name <hi>Iesus,</hi> and usher
in the Ceremony of Capping and bowing to it (thereby to
make way for bowing to Images, Altars, Adoration of the
Eucharist and other Romish Innovations) in the yeare of
our Lord 1629. (the very next yeare after your Majesties
<hi>Declarations)</hi> turned this IN into AT <hi>the Name</hi> (as one Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>late
did the like before in the New Translation of the Bible
for the same purpose) contrary to the originall, the sence and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1659:5"/>
scope of the place, the Fathers, all former Common-prayer-Bookes,
&amp; the very rules of our English Dialect; There being
no such phrase in the whole Bible, nor in any English Author,
that ever I yet read, as, <hi>AT the name,</hi> except only in this
mistranslated &amp; corrupted text; But only, IN <hi>the name.</hi>
AT the name being pure nonsence; As appeares by turning
IN into AT, in all the texts of Scripture where this phrase
IN the name is used: As <hi>Math. 28. 19. Baptizing them in
the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Iohn
16. 23. Whatsoever yee shall aske the Father IN my
name, he will give it you: Acts 3. 6. IN the name of Iesus
Christ of Nazareth stand up and walke. Acts 9. 27. 2. 9. He
preached <hi>boldly at Damascus IN the name of Iesus:</hi> And
<hi>Acts 16. 8. 1. Cor. 5. 4. Ephes. 5. 2. 2. Thes. 5. 20. 2. Thes.
3. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all which if we convert IN into AT, and read them AT
<hi>the name,</hi> it makes both the English and text Nonsence, and
so it doth in this very text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. As some<note n="n" place="margin">Lame Giles his Haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and certaine Quaeries propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Bowers at the name of Iesus, Qu. 1. 2. 3, 4.</note>

This prayer (which some have observed, not to have been

            <p>In which strange alteration there are these notorious

            <p>1. First, there is a diverting of the maine edge and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this Prayer from the Iesuites, Priests, Papists, and
Antichristian Babilonish Sect of Rome, particularly designed

they have now turned the whole scope of this prayer (and
by cousequence the very practise and treason itselfe) upon
these poore Innocents; The only men aymed at in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;
And the chiefe men declaimed against both at

them deeply guilty of it; (and can your Majesty trust such

not murther nor deprive you?)</p>
            <p>Now for any thus farre to gratify Traytours and Rebels,
as to acquit them from that very Doctrine which makes
them such, even then when they are quilty of it, must
needs be a danegrous, if not a Trayterous Act, perillous to
your Majesty and the whole Realme.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly; This Alteration extenuates the greatnes and
execrable odiousnes of that horrid Treason, both in respect
of the Actors, and that desperate Doctrine which moved
them to committ it; And to mince or extenuate such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld
treason as this, so execrable to all the world; Is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but to turne Traytour, and become guilty of the
same treason, or of another as bad as it.</p>
            <p>Yea it is to be feared, that those who wilbe so perfidious,
as after thus many Yeares, to goe about to extenuate and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
such a Treason, have a minde to turne Traytours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
atleast wise, to favour Treason and Traytours, and
have treasonable hearts within them.</p>
            <p>5. Fiftly; This corruption is a large step to the abolishing
of the memory of this never to be forgotten Treason, and
of that solemne Holy-day on the 5. of November, instituted

the next step can be no other, but the abrogating both of the

            <p>If the Bishops here reply, that they found it added in
<hi>Rogers his Exposition on the Articles,</hi> printed some yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>J answer, that Coppy was not the Authorized Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
Originall by which they should be directed but a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
Coppy, with which your Majesty would not have your
poore Subjects cheated or deluded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Majesty therefore,</hi> prohibiting any the least difference
from the Articles allowed and authorized heretofore in Queen
Elizabeths dayes, by Parliament; <hi>Prohibited them to insert
this forged addition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they reply, that they were ignorant of the Originall
true Coppyes, and knew not this to be a forgery.</p>
            <p>I answer, that this is very improbable, that so many great
Bishops should be altogether ignorant, which were the true
genuine Articles of our Church, who had read, subscribed
and given them in charge to others so often.</p>
            <p>But admit it true, yet ignorance in this case is no plea at
all for any man, much lesse for Bishops; And if they are so
ignorant of the very Articles of our Church, J hope your
Majesty and others will thinke them very unmeet to be
Bishops in our Church, and trust lesse to their pretended
knowledge, judgement and learning in future times, giving
little credit to any thing they doe or say, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of it, since they are so really or affectedly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the very<note n="*" place="margin">Which they might doe well to study a while, and give over their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Affaires, which make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so blinde and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in divine things.</note> Articles of our Church, in the which they
pretend most skill. But if they knew the very Originall Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes
&amp; Articles (as no doubt they did,) and that this clause
was not in them, but a meere late forgery, most fraudelently
and corruptly added to them; Then they were accessaries &amp;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1659:11"/>
wilfull consenters to this forgery, to delude both your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

rebels against your Majesties <hi>Declaration</hi> before these

these 3 grand forgeries and corruptions, give me leave (I

late Jmpostures obtruded on the Church of England.</p>
            <p>1. The first by <hi>Dr.</hi> (then Mr.) <hi>Iohn Cosens</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; Who Anno 1628. (the same yeare your Majesties
<hi>Declarations</hi> were published,) sett forth a Booke, intiteled:
<hi>A collection of private Devotions, or, the Howers of Prayer;</hi>
Wherein was much Popish Trash and Doctrine comprized,
and at least 20 several points of Popery maintained, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
all which, in the Title and Epistle of this Booke, he
<q>writes; That these Devotions of his, were after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
published by Queen Elizabeth, and were heretofore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1659:12"/>
published among us by her High and Sacred Authority,
to witt, in the Preces of Horary, sett forth by her Royall
Authority Anno 1573.</q>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen as there is no Analogie at all either in matter, forme
or method, between these Devotions of his and those devout
Prayers of her Majesty, nor any of his points of Popery in
them, as hath been proved by<note n="s" place="margin">Cosens his Cose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. A tryall of Private Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> 
               <hi>two particular Answers to his
Devotions in print:</hi> Yet these Devotions of his were never
yet suppressed, but publikely sold among us, approved by a
Bishops license, and now reprinted, to abuse your Majesties
poore Subjects, encourage Papists, and scandalize that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed
pious Queen, as the Authour and Patronesse of his
grosse Popery. An abuse not tollerable in a Christian
State.</p>
            <p>2. The second is as bad or worse. Anno 1631. One <hi>Iohn
Ailward</hi> (not long before a Popish Priest) published a Booke
<q>intiteled: An Historicall Narration of the judgement
of some most learned Bishops concerning Gods Election;
Affirming the Errours of the Arminians, to be the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Doctrine of the Church of England, and of the
Martyrs and Reformers of it, both in King Edwards and
Queen Elizabeths dayes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Booke (though written in professed opposition to
your <hi>Majesties Declaration before the 39. Articles,</hi> to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Arminianisme (yet now made the only iustrument to
advance it and suppresse the truth) was licensed by <hi>Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn,</hi>
then Chaplaine to the Bishop of London, now Arch-Bishop
of Canterbury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The whole Booke except some 3. or 4. leaves containing
nothing else but a</hi> Coppy ef an Answer to a Letter, wherein the
Answerer purged himselfe and others from Pelagian Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Master-peece, forsooth, is pretended to be sett out by
the Bishops and Reformers of our Church in the inception
of Queen Elizabeths raigne by publike Authority, and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1659:13"/>
Doctrine then taught and professed. When this new Booke
was printed, no Coppies must come abrode (as the Stationer
then affirmed) before the<note n="*" place="margin">Now Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> Bishop of London had presented
it to your Majesty, and gained your Royall approbation
thereof.</p>
            <p>Not long after this it flies abrode ouer all the Realme,
to the great amazement and disturbance of many of your
Subjects: One of them comming to that learned Knights
hands, <hi>Sir Humphry Lynde,</hi> (better read in Fathers and
Popish Authours then English Antiquities,) he was so much
stumbled and greiued at it, that he presently repaired with
it, to a Gentlemans study of his acquaintance; Telling him,
there was a new Booke, freshly published, which proued the
Martyrs and Reformers of our Church to be professed
Arminians, and that this was the Doctrine publikely taught
and printed by Authority in the beginning of Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths-raigne;
Saying withall, it would doe infinite harme,
and desiring him to take some paines to answer it.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman no sooner turned ever two or three leaves
of the Booke, but he presently discovered the grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture;
Informing the Knight, that this <hi>Coppy of a Letter, &amp;c.</hi>
was written by one <hi>Champenies,</hi> whom <hi>Iohn Venon</hi> (Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

then publikely preached at Paules, (<hi>dedicated to Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
and printed by Authority in the second yeare of her
Highnes raigne.</hi>)</p>
            <p>He likewise acquainted him, that this <hi>Coppy of his Letter</hi>
was printed about the third yeare of her Dominion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Authours or Printers name thereto, or place where,
or yeare when it was printed, or any intimation at all that it
was ever licensed; All which were plaine evidences, that
it was printed in a corner, without any license at
all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1659:13"/>
And whereas (sayd he) you desire a speedy Answer to it, if
you will give me but a paire of gloves, I will show you two
Answers to it, already in print above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0 yeares since, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Authority, and one of the first printed Coppies of this
Letter to boote.</p>
            <p>To which the Knight replied, J am sure you doe but jest
with me.</p>
            <p>No, sayd the other, I am in good earnest, wil you give me,
or wager a paire of gloves hereupon?</p>
            <p>That (answered he) I will doe with all my heart.
Then, sayd the Gentleman, reach me hither those three
Bookes he pointed to.</p>
            <p>He did so. The first was a Coppy of the Letter, without
name of Authour, Printer, date of time or place; Which
compared with that in this new Booke, proved the same <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, sayd the Gentleman, you have seen the Originall, I
will shew you the Authour of it, (which he did in <hi>Verons
Apology, f. 37.)</hi> and likewise two severall Answers in print:
The first by <hi>Iohn Veron</hi> himselfe fore-named, intitled:
<q>An Apologie in Defence of the Doctrine of Predestination
Dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, and imprinted at London
by Iohn Tisdale in the fourth yeare of her Raigne; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this whole Letter is fully answered: The second, by that
famous Learned Man and exile for Religion in Queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
dayes, <hi>Robert Crowly;</hi> In his Apologie of those English
Preachers and Writers, which Cerberus the three-headed
Dogg of Hell chargeth with false Doctrine, under the

Her Majesties Injunctions, and printed at London by Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

you many full old Answers to your, New Booke, and proved
it to be a meere lie and forgery from the beginning to the
end, yea the most grosse and greatest Imposture, affront and
impudent abuse that ever was put upon the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
VVherefore, Sir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He did so: Yet the Booke was not called in, in a weekes

dispersed over the Kingdome, were only called in, but not
burned, nor any publike Act made against them, to discover
the practise and Imposture: Only the Gentleman was at the

acquainting some of his Friends there, with this

               <q>published in the yeare 1625. (as the words of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Divisions which have since ensued in our Church. For
remedie and redresse whereof, and for Satisfaction of the
consciences of your good people, your Majesty did not
only by publike Proclamation call in that Booke of his
which ministred matter of offence, but to prevent the like
danger for hereafter, reprinted the Articles of Religion,
established in the time of Queen Elizabeth of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</q>

to attempt the writing and Licensing of such Bookes,
you may easily by these Rivulets trace out the Fountaines
from whence all these Enormities, Corruptions, Forgeries

            <p>Besides, if your Majestie will once more cast your prying
eye upon the late Visitation Articles of <hi>Bishop Wren, Bishop
Peirce, Bishop Monntague,</hi> and other your Prelates and Arch-Deacons,
visiting in their owne names and by their owne

places where Altars, Images, Crucifixes, bowing to Altars,
Tapers, rayling Communion-Tables Altar-wise, reading
Second-Service at the Altar, Consecrations of Altars, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Chappels are introduced, urged and many godly

Gods assistance, not only to spend my Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, my Limbes, my

my Soveraigne, my Country, my Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
And if J did it not when I had meanes and oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I should neither deeme my selfe, a faithfull Servant to
my God, nor a loyall Subject to your Majesty, my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
            <p>And now since I have lanched thus farre out into this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
Ocean. (perchance with hazard of drowning, or
Pyrats, unlesse your Majesty rescue me by a Patent of safe
conduct, and calme these boysterous Seas when they arise
to overflow me,) give me leave to wade but one step fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to acquaint your Highnes with the evill dangerous
fruites of these lewd practises, Bookes Innovations, and
then I shall cast anker in the secure Harbour of your Royall
Grace and Protection.</p>
            <p>1. First, they have produced aboundance of Schismes,
Factions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arres, discontents, quarrels, heart-burnings, if not
mutuall malice, hatred and reproaches, among your people
in all places of your Realmes, and quite rent asunder that
ancient unity, peace, love and mutuall charity which flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
among them, before these Innovations crept into the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1659:19"/>
2. Secondly, they have not only <hi>grieved, &amp; vexed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
soules,</hi> but even quite dejected the spirits, and broken
the hearts of many thousand <hi>godly L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts</hi> and most faithfull
Subjects to your Majesty, who even pine away and languish
under them, for griefe and sorrow of heart.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, they have bred a generall feare in the hearts, &amp;
an over-great jealousie in the heades of your Loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of an approaching alteration of Religion, and totall
Apostasie unto the Sea of Rome; They having little left
to secure or arme them against this feare and jealousie, but
the syncerity of your Majesties owne Royal heart to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
your comfortable, pious <hi>Declaracions</hi> (now trampled
by these Novellers under feet in open scorne) and the zeale
of divers of your Nobility, to whom Gods truth and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are dearer then their soules: Which no doubt they
will now declare by their actions in this time of need; To
your Majesties great joy and ease, and the daunting of these
strange audacious Innovatours, though hitherto many of
them have been over-silent.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, they have caused many to turne Atheists,
Skeptickes or Newters in Religion, seeing our Church so
wavering and unconstant; Many to fall off to Popery, and
hundred thousands of Papists from conversion, by encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and hardning them in their Antichristian Errours and
Superstitions, to which they see us running, if not flying so
fast of late, that they say they need not come towards us, since
wee are posting so fast to them.</p>
            <p>5. Fiftly, they have caused thousands of godly Christians
(the<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 18. 24. to 33. Acts 27. 23. 24 Ier. 5. 1. Ezech. 22. 30. 31. Psal. 106. 23. Exod. 32. 10, &amp;c.</note>

flie out to forraigne Countries and Plantations; Hundreds
to seperate from our Church, as now quite Romish and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian;
And made thousands ready for to seperate, it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1659:19"/>
being now a common received opinion among many;<note n="*" place="margin">See a Booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titeled, The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Seperation from the Church of
England.</note> 
               <hi>That
our Churches (especially our Cathedrals) are now so farre Popish in
all respects,</hi> (Latine Service only excepted, which they say is
countervayled by their merry all-sung never-wept Service,
which the people understand no more then Latine,) <hi>that we
have now the same, or at least as just cause to seperate from them,
as our godly Martyrs and Church had to seperate from Rome in
the beginning of Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the same reasons hold not alike of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for the present, yet that they hold as firme in regard of
the future, since now wee and all our Churches are taught
and commaunded, <hi>to</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Reeve p. 20. 205 206. 211. 216. Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, p. 20 A Coale from the Altar, p. 1 26. 27. 63. 64.</note> 
               <hi>imitate our Prelates and Cathedrals in
all their Romish Rites and Ceremonies as their Mother Churches
and true patternes of Imitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that unlesse a speedy Reformation follow of these late
Corruptions and Innovations, halfe the Kingdome, for
ought I can conjecture, are like, either to turne professed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratists,
or else to leave the Realme; To such a passe have
your busy Prelates lately brought things by their new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises,
Bookes, Articles, Ceremonies, Superstitions, and their
Suppressing of Lectures, Preaching, and godly comformable
Ministers, Sermons of Lords-dayes after-noones, Repetition
of Sermons, and the like.</p>
            <p>6. Sixtly, they give a great occasion to Iesuites, Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie-Priests
and Friers, (of which there are now swarmes in
England, (there being <hi>above 60. Benedictine Monkes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>

not only the reports of Travellers witnes, but <hi>Sr. Iohn Cooke</hi>
your Majesties principall Secretary of State, some few yeares
since (in the very infancy of these Innovations and backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings)
affirmed openly in Star-chamber (in the now <hi>Arch-Bishop
of Canterburies case</hi>) that <hi>this newes was spread as farre
as the very Wals of Rome itself, upon his certaine intelligence
thence; And therefore it was high time for your Majesty, your
Prelates and the State to looke more strictly to our Religion,
and to take away all occasions of such Rumours;</hi> Since which
there have been more occasions of them given then in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeares before.</p>
            <p>So as this Rumour is generally believed abroad as a most

               </gap> and crept into some of their late printed
Bookes.</p>
            <p>This likewise is the common confident discourse and
persuasion of most Priests and Papists at home, both among
themselves and in the Company of Protestants, over whom
they now seeme to triumph, and sticke not openly to affirme
and justify, that both our Arch-Bishops (to omit others) are
theirs.</p>
            <p>To make this good, I shall give your Majesty two late

            <p>A Barkeshire Gentleman, of some worth, a Popish Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
was since Easter last 1636. at a publike meeting, where
were divers prime Gentlemen of the Shire, and 3 or 4 Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Peace, if not more; VVhere entring into Discourse
concerning some Controversies of Religion between the
Papists and us, with some of the Company, he used these
words in the hearing of them all; <q>Well Gentlemen,
you may talke and discourse of your Religion as long as
you please, but we have the Queens Majesty and the
Arch Bishop of Canterbury firme on our side; And so long
wee shall make our partie good enough with you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some of the Company questioning him for these words;
He answered, <hi>He would justify and make good what he sayd;</hi>
But was<note n="*" place="margin">Had a Puritan, as they stile them spoken but halfe so much<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

though intimation hath been given of these speeches to some
whom they much concerne.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Dr. Cosens</hi> the last Summer 1636. removed from
the Bishopricke of <hi>Durham,</hi> to his Colledge at <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
He gave his Friends of New-Castle a farewell Sermon in the
Towne, at which Sermon (preached in the after-noone) most
of the Papists in that Towne were present: Two of them
the next morning meeting with two Marchants of the
Towne, who were Protestants, they went all into a Taverne
to drinke their mornings draughts: The Papists demaunded
of the Protestants, whether they heard Dr. Cosens his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?
One replied, that he only heard of it, but heard it
not, by reason of some busines that hindred him: The other
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1659:21"/>
made Answer, that he heard it: The Papists demaund of
him how he liked it? He replied; That it was but a plaine
ordinary Sermon, and that he heard nothing extraordinary
in it: Yea, but said the Papists, did you marke his garbe,
his cringes to the Altar, and how he bowed himselfe when
Iesus was named? He hath the right garbe and duckes of
our Priests.</p>
            <p>The other answered, he did not much observe his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.</p>
            <p>Well, said the Papists, Dr. Cosens is a learned honest
Gentleman, and to tell you truely, <hi>He and the<note n="*" place="margin">Some reported it of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> Arch-Bishop
of Yorke are both ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other bade them, take heed what they said.</hi>
Wee know well enough <hi>(said they)</hi> what we say, we tell you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
they are both ours.</p>
            <p>Whereupon one of the Protestants merrily replied: If
you will needs have both of them to be yours, <q>pray take
them to yourselves, we can spare them well enough.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many words past to this purpose. The Protestants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of these speeches as scandalous to the Arch-Bishop,
and acquainted him there-with.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Papists were Articled against in the High
Commission-Court at Durham, and cited to appeare there;
Appearance they made, but they have not yet made any full
answer, the busines being hushed up in a maner, and layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe.</p>
            <p>Dr. Cosens in the meane time takes his journy towards
Cambridge; Most of the Gentlemen Papists in the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ricke,
to prove him theirs, brought him a dayes-journy on his
way, and some of them as farre as Yorke.</p>
            <p>Like speeches have been used by other Papists, yet more
privately &amp; modestly. The like report they in<note n="t" place="margin">In a <hi>Dr.</hi> new Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet stolen out of Studley his rayling Booke, for the most part, and of the same Subject.</note> print of

His Reasons
For bovving to Lords-Tables, and placing them
Altar-vvise, related and refuted.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>CHISTIAN READER,</hi> before I entertaine thee
with a serious Epistle, give me leave to detaine thee a little
with some late Paradoxes in <hi>Edmond Reeve,</hi> printed by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
to prove the necessity &amp; Lawfulnes of bowi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Altar and Communion. Table at our entring in
and going out of the Church, to refresh thy spirits withall.
His first reason is this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">The Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Booke Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, p. 132.</note> As the people of God being entred into Gods house
(to wit, the Temple of Ierusalem) did worship towards
the Sanctuary or mercy Seate from which he was heard
speaking (not their Altars or Shew-bread-Tables) so now
also ought EVERY ONE being come into Gods house,
to prostrate himselfe, that is, make low obeysance towards
Gods mercy Seare, being the uppermost part of our
Temples, unto Almighty God there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1659:28"/>
This reason is properly reduced into these two Logicall
Arguments, point-blanke against his Conclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. The Jewes worshipped towards the Sanctuary and
mercy Seate, from which God was heard speaking (a
Type of our Pulpits and Reading Pewes, if of any thing;)
not towards their Altars or Tables:</q>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo, EVERY ONE <hi>now also ought to bow to Gods mercy
Seate,</hi> (the Pulpit and Reading Pew, from which he is heard
speaking in his Word; not unto Altars and Tables.</p>
            <p>
               <q>2. Every one ought to prostrate himselfe towards the
uppermost part of our Temples, unto Almightie God there:</q>
But the Roofes of our Temples, at least the East wall of them,
in the Authors sence, not the Table or Akar (or our Pulpits
standing higher then they) <hi>are the uppermost part of our
Temples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ergo, we must prostrate ourselves towards them to God
there; Not towards the Table or Altar.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how then a prostration of the body towards the
ground the lower part of the Temple, can be a prostration
towards the Roofe or upper part of the Church, when as it
removes the body further from it (unlesse Mr. <hi>Reeve</hi> can tell
me how a man may prostrate himselfe upward) I cannot yet
discerne.</p>
            <p>
               <q>2. His second Argument is this:<note place="margin">Ibidem p: 134.</note> The Divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Church calling the Communion-Table Gods
Board, doth give us to understand, that that is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the peculiar Seat of God within the Temple.
(For after a Church or Chappell is consecrated by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
Gods gracious presence is ever at his mercy Seate,
saith the Margent) and therefore towards it unto God
there, we are to make low obeysance, whensoever we come
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1659:28"/>
into Gods house, to pray. Also as the Chaire of State is
alwayes to be honoured, though the person of the Royall
Majesty be not seene there: So is <hi>GODS BOARD EVER
TO HAVE DUE REVERENCE</hi> (therefore this
bowing is done &amp; due to the Board itselfe not God,) and
God who is there perpetually, is alwayes to be prostrated
unto, yea whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the body &amp; blood of Christ in the blessed
Sacrament is not upon the same, (So the Passage in <hi>Bishop
Mortons</hi> too,) nor Divine Service in saying therein, or in
any other place of the Holy Temple. For which cause it
is prescribed, that ever the holy Communion-Table should
be kept Sacred.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This I have else-where fully answered out of <hi>Shelford</hi> &amp;
<hi>Widdowes,</hi> who produce neither Scripture nor Reason for all
this they say, nor any authority, but their owne.</p>
            <p>1. First therefore let them prove: That God hath and
ought to have a Seate in every Church.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, that this Seate is the Communion-Table
only, not the Pulpit, Reading Pew, Bible, or any other part
of the Church.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, that God alwayes sits there by his grace, when
there is no body in the Church, to beare him Company, no
Service, no Sacrament of Christs body and blood.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, that when there is Divine Service read in
the Church, a Sermon preached in the Pulpit, or a Child
Christned at the Font, and no Service or Sacrament at the
the Table, that he yet sits still on the Table, and is there only
specially present by his grace, and not at these other places in
any of his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>5. Fiftly, that God is alike present at the Table by his
grace when there is no Communion as when there is
one.</p>
            <p>6. Sixtly, that men ought in point of duty to bow to every
place where God is present: And to one part only off, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1659:29"/>
in the Church, and not to the whole Fabricke:</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that a Bishops consecration confines God
close prisoner to his mercy Seate, the Table, so as never to
suffer him to stirre one inch from thence, no not when there
is no Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, no Divine Service, no person there to doe him
homage, nor use of his speciall presence.</p>
            <p>Till these bedlam Paradoxes be proved, which wilbe <hi>ad
G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aecas Calendas,</hi> we may well demurre to this second reason.
Of which more fully anon. Only to retort the reason, let
me argue thus.</p>
            <p>The place where God is most specially present by his grace
ought to be bowed unto.</p>
            <p>But God is most specially present by his grace in Heaven,
in the Church-Bible, and midst of his people, not at the East
end of the Church where none must sit neare him, as I
bare else-where proved; And in every good Christians
heart.</p>
            <p>Ergo, these, not the Table, are to be bowed unto. As for
his Chaire of State; That it ought alwayes to be bowed
unto. (I thinke when it is in the ward-robe, Cart, Imbroy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
or upholsters shop, &amp;c. should have been excepted,) he
must shew us some Law or Statute for it, ere we can beleeve
it.</p>
            <p>And though some men bow unto it now and then, because
the King sits some times personally in it: This Gentleman
must prove, that God sits personally some-times on the Table,
which he can hardly doe. But he and others tell us, that
<hi>God sits alwayes there;</hi> Very good; Then I thus retort the
similitude.</p>
            <p>No Man is so sottish to bow to the Kings Chaire of State
when the King himselfe is sitting in it, but only when he is
absent; For when the King his in it, they never doe it, but
bow only and immediately to the King, without any respect
to the Coaire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1659:29"/>
Therefore since God is alwayes sitting on the Table, they
ought not to bow or doe any reverence to it at all.</p>
            <p>And so this Simitude cuts the throate of their cause if
rightly paralleld and applied.</p>
            <p>This will likewise overthrow his<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. p. 136. 137.</note> Argument for the
the placing of the Table Altar-wise, else-where at large
refelled.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Here also (writes he) it is to be considered unto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of Gods holy name (of his Table rather) in what
place of the Chauncell Gods Board or Seat should stand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Doth not nature itselfe teach us, that in every common
house the Seate of the chiefest should be above every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And should not Christianitie teach us, that no Seate of
any person, much lesse of any of the Laity, (it seemes then
the Cleargie may sit above God himselfe if they please)
should be above Gods mercy Seate, the Sacred Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table
in the Chauncell? &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And when as the Lords-Table is set in the uppermost
place within the Chauncell, is it not decent that the ends</q>
thereof (thus this Expositour and Patron of the Common-Prayer-Booke
dares controll it) be towards North and
South?</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Holy Ghost commaundeth all things to be done
decently and according unto order, (Ergo Lords Tables
ends must be turned North and South, against the expresse
order of the Common-Prayer-Booke:) And if it ought
so to be in all things, much more ought it to be in every
thing about Gods house &amp; especially in the standing of his
Sacred Seate; As if this Seate stood very undece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with one side against the Wall, as the East end of the

            </p>
            <p>VVhich they have earnestly pleaded for in late printed
Bookes, in open affront and defiance to <hi>our Statu<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which particulars though they seeme small at first view,
and are slighted by many, as matters of no great moment,
yet, all Circumstances considered, they are very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and the conniving at them without Opposition, like to
prove fatall to our Religion, as the Reading of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
itselfe, will evidence more at large.</p>
            <p>To make this apparant in few words; There is no man
almost so ignorant, as not to know; So blinde, as not to see
that there is a strong faction sprung up of late among us (the
heades whereof were particularly voted and descried in
Parliament-House the last Parliament) who labour with all
diligence, power, and cunning artifice, to bring the whole
body of Popery into our Church againe, yet secretly by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
with as little noyse as might be, by those severall Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes
and meanes, which that cunning-pated Iesuite

Which they prosecute and follow to an haires-breadth.</p>
            <p>To effect this Plot the better (according to the Popes
consultation and direction in his Conclave) they first vented
all the Arminian points in printed Bookes; Which though
at first oppugned by many to their hazard, have now (under
a pretence of silencing all controversies in this kinde) quite
silenced the truth itselfe; Being now publikely printed and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1659:35"/>
preached every where without controll, contrary to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

Devises given open countenance to them, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
people from opposing them, they grew in a short
time so impudent as openly to plead for Jmages, Altars,

in the fore-front to breake the Ice, to see how the people
would relish them; And then when these men had borne
the brunt and blame for a while, and the strangenes of the

of better note and parts, to give greater Countenance to
them, that people might the more willingly embrace these

of Eusebius, Augustine, Durandus, and the 5. Councell
of Constantinople, doe not prove, that the Communion Table
in their times stood in the midst of the Church, or Chauncell;
that B. Jewell is mistaken in their meaninge, <hi>and shapes severall
answeares for to shift them. To that of</hi> Eusebius <hi>hee sayth,</hi> This
proves not necessarily, that the Altar stood either in the body
of the Church, or in the middle of the same, as the Epistoler
doth intend, when hee sayth the middle; The Altar though
it stood alonge the Easterne wall, yet it maye bee well inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
to bee in the middle of the Chancell in Reference to
the North and South, as since it hath stood. And were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
yet this is but a particular case of a Church in Syria,
wherein the people beinge more mingled with the Jewes
then in other places, might possibly place the Altar in the
middle of the Church as was the Altar of Incense in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of the Temple, the better to conforme unto them. To
which I answeare: 1. <hi>That the first parte of this reply is in a sort
meere nonsence. The Altar was placed in the</hi> middest of the
Church or Chancell, <hi>that is (sayth he) in the</hi> East end of it, <hi>or in
the</hi> middest of the East end; <hi>as if the East end of the Church or
Chancell were the Church or Chancell it selfe, or the midst of it, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1659:45"/>
middest of the Church or Chancell, But these beinge distinct, and
different things, the midst of the Church or Chancell, can bee not
more interpreted, to bee the middest of the Eastwall or end of them,
then the East wall, or midst of the East end of the Quire, can bee
the midst of the Church, So that this evasion is but a meere non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
Bull; And had</hi> Eusebius <hi>intended any such thinge, he woulde
have thus expressed himselfe; that they placed the Altar against the
midst of the East end wall of the Church or Quire, not in</hi> the
midst of the Church or Quire, and compassed about it and
the Sanctuary with woodden Railes wrought up to the topp
with artificiall carving.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>I answeare, that</hi> The second parte of the Replie is a plaine
concession of what hee formerly denied; and not only soe, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of it with an annexed reason, Soe that here wee have one
peece of the <hi>Coale</hi> against the other: one denyinge that it was in
the midst, the other confessinge, and provinge the contrary: Nowe
whereas hee writes, <hi>that this was but a particular case of one
Church in Syria:</hi> I answeare, that it seemes this famous Temple
<hi>was one of the</hi>

Paulinus Bishop of Tyre, whoe passed all others for rare

till hee can produce an example of some Churches in the Primitive
tymes, either before, or not long after this, wherein the Table or
Altar stood against the East wall of the Quire Altarwise, as nowe
they are situated, which hee can never doe, I shall take it as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and sufficient proofe for the settinge of the Table in the midst of
the Church or Chancell. That which hee adds, <hi>that it was done
perchance to please the Jewes;</hi> is but his owne fancie, no Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
or writer so much as insinuatinge any such thinge; And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
it true, <hi>yet the Jewes situatinge of the Altar of Incense in

conceit, but by Gods owne direction, is a fitter patterne for Christians
to followe, then any Popish Altars, fixed station at or against the

            <p>
               <hi>To that of the</hi> 5. Counciil of Constantinople, <hi>he replies,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">A Coale from the Altar p. 45. 55.</note> that

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
cannot bee properly interpreted, round about the
Altar, soe as there was no parte thereof, that was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
by the people; noe more then if a man shoulde saye,
that hee hath seene the Kinge sittinge in his Throne, and all
his Nobles about him, it needs or could bee thought, that the
Throne was placed in the middle of the presence, as many of
the Nobles beinge behinde him as before him; <hi>for which hee
cites</hi> Rev. 4. 6. and c. 7. V. 11. <hi>To which I answeare, First,
That as the</hi> proper signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is, a Circle, <hi>as hee
confesseth; soe the proper signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is,</hi> to
compasse or stand round about the Altar in a Circle, and to
hemne it in on every side. <hi>If this then bee the proper meaninge
of the words of this Councill, as all must acknowledge, good reason
have wee to take them in their proper sence, and not improperly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>This word and phrase is soe taken and interpreted in the
Scripture,</hi> (as Psal. 26. 6. Psal. 128. 3. 1. Sam. 16. 11. Rev.
4. 6. and c. 7. 11.) For sittinge, standinge and incircling
the throne or Table round about on every parte; <hi>Therefore it
shoulde by the same Reason bee soe taken here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When as wee saye, the Kings Nobles doe inviron or stand
round about his Throne; this implies, that his Throne stands not
against a wall, but soe as men maye stand round about him; round
about, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

soe.</p>
            <p>4. I shall make it most cleere, that all Altars aunciently were
placed in the midst of Temples, Churches, or Quires, and that it
was the use both amonge Iewes. Pagans, and Christians, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To that of</hi> S. Augustine, <hi>hee replies;</hi> that, mensa ipsius in
MEDIO constituta, is not to be interpreted, the Table set
here in the midst, as it is translated; <hi>but the Table</hi> which is
here before you, accordinge to the usuall meaninge of the
Latine phrase, afferre in medium, which is not to be construed
thus, bringe it precisely into the middest, but bringe it to us,
or before us: <hi>Oh wise evasion! as if</hi> Bishop Jewell, Bishop
Babington, Doctor Fulke, <hi>&amp; the Epistoler were such illiterate
novices, that they knewe not howe to conster Latine, and need bee
sett to schoole againe to learne their Grammer. I wonder why this
pragmaticall Criticke cavelled not at our newe translaters for ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringe
that of</hi> Math. 18. 20. where two or three gathered
togeather there I am in <hi>medio corum,</hi> in the middest of them;
<hi>where the same latine word is used: If</hi> in medio, <hi>heere may bee
properly Englished,</hi> in the middest, <hi>not at the East end, or before
them; why not in this text of Augustine? All knowe, that the
proper signification of</hi> Medium, <hi>is</hi> the midst; <hi>and of</hi> in medium
afferre, <hi>to bringe into the midst, not before men;</hi> Coram nobis,
<hi>beinge the common phrase, signifying to bringe,</hi> a thinge before
men, <hi>not</hi> in medium afferre; <hi>And if this Gentleman remember
his</hi> Grammer; Sentit medios illapsus in hostes, <hi>cannot bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,</hi>
hee perceived hee was fallen, <hi>before</hi> his Enemies,
<hi>but,</hi> into the midst of them. <hi>The translation of</hi> Bishop Jewell
<hi>therefore is good &amp; proper, &amp; the Colier a nonsence Criticke, to
quarrell with it upon such slender grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To that of</hi> Durandns, in medio Ecclesiae apperuios meum,
that it proves not that the Altar stood in the midst of the
Church, but that the Preists stood at the midst of the Altar:
For it is generally knowne that many hundred yeares before
Durand was borne, the Altars generally stood in Christian
Churches, even as nowe they doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answeare, first, that to interpret</hi> in medio Ecclesiae, <hi>the
midst of the Altar,</hi> not of the Church, is nonsence; as if the Altar
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1659:47"/>
were the Church, or the midst of the Altar the midst of the
Church, yea though it stood not in the midst but East end of it.</p>
            <p>2. If <hi>in medio</hi> here, by his owne confession signifie in the midst,
not before the Altar; then why not in that place of <hi>Augustine</hi> too,
at which he formerly carped, as mis-translated.</p>
            <p>3. It is not well knowne neither by experience (for noe man is
so auncient,) nor by any authenticke writer extant, that many
100. yeares before Durand was borne the Altars generally, stood
in Christian Churches as now they doe; there being not one testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that can be produced to prove it. The Altar in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall
Church of Rome standing, even in time of Masse, when the
Pope receiveth the Sacrament, in the middest of the Quire, &amp; the
Pope sitting in a Chair of estate about it, as William Thomas an
eywitnesse of it An. 1547. testifyeth in his History of Italie, yet the
contrary is well knowne, &amp; shall God willing be proved; &amp; if this
were soe well knowne, I wonder why this judicious learned man
proves it no better, begging only the Question disputed, in stead of
proving it; having thus answeared, these nonsense idle Cavills
against the authorities, quoted by learned <hi>Jewell,</hi> I now proceed
to other of our writers.</p>

holier then the rest, wherein the Papists mightily offend.
For the Quire and Chancell was for their Preists &amp; singers,
the other parte of the Church for lay-men, they were not to
enter into that holy place, And thus accordinge to the places
they devided the Congregation as though one parte were

and Nicephorus <hi>write:</hi> That in most Churches in

<hi>I answeare:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, that before their dayes in</hi> Eusebius, Chrysostomes, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines,
&amp; the Emperour Zeno his tyme, <hi>it stood in the</hi> midst
of the Church, or Quire, <hi>and soe it did in</hi> Durandus his age,

and at this day, as Bishop Jewell <hi>hath formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Neither of these two Authors affirme,</hi> that the Altar, or
Communion Table stood at the East end of the Church or
Quire close against the wall, <hi>as nowe they are placed, the thing to
be proved; but only</hi> toward the East part of the Church, ad
Orientem versus, <hi>sayth</hi> Nicephorus: <hi>that is, neerer to the East
then to the West end of the Church; to witt,</hi> in the middest of
the Chauncell, or Quire (<hi>which in many Churches was placed at
the East Isle then, as our Chauncells, &amp; Quires are nowe, though
not in all;) as is evident by the forequoted authorities: Soe as the
argument hence deduced, can bee but this</hi> non sequitur, Altars in
their dayes stood usually toward the East end of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<hi>(to witt in the midst of the Quires, &amp; Chauncells which
stood Easterly, as our Communion Tables stood till nowe of late,)</hi>
Therefore they stood Altarwise against the East wall of the
Church or Chancell, <hi>as some Novellers nowe place them; whereas
the argument hold good the contrarie waye:</hi> They were placed
toward the East end of the Church, therefore not in the verie
East end Altarwise: since toward the East, <hi>is one thinge,</hi> and
in the East <hi>another, as toward London in case of scituation, or

against, not for our Innovators; whoe can produce noe one authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
writer, testimonie or example, for above a thowsand yeares
after Christ, to prove, that Altars, or Lords Tables stood or were
scituated Altarwise against the East wall of the Quire, in such
manner as nowe they place them; there beinge many pregnant
testimonies to the contrarie,</hi> that they stood in the midst of the
Quire, Church, or Chauncell, <hi>where nowe they ought to stand,
as they did in former ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come nowe to the 5. thinge, to examine,</hi> what place is most
proper, and Convenient for the situation of the Communion
Table, especially when the Sacrament is administred? <hi>Noe
doubt the midst of the Church, or Chauncell, (not the East end of
it, where it is newly placed) as the</hi> Rubricke of the Communion
booke, Queene Elizabeths Injunctions, the 82. Canon, the
fore-cited Fathers, and writers resolve in expresse tearmes;
<hi>and that for those ensuinge reasons, which under correction cannot
bee answeared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> because the table at which our Saviour originally
instituted the Sacrament, was placed in the midst of the
roome, hee and his Disciples sittinge then round about it,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1659:56"/>
and soe administringe, and receivinge it, <hi>as the premises mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.
Nowe</hi> wee ought to immitate our Saviours institution,
and example as neere as maye bee, 1. Cor. 11. 1. 23. 24.
Eph. 5. 1. 2. 1. Pet. 2. 21. John 2. 6. <hi>not only in the substance
of the Sacrament, but likewise in all decent, and convenient Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
whereof the scituation of the Table in the midst of the
congregation is one:</hi> Amonge the 6. reasons, why the Lords
board shoulde rather bee after the forme of a table then of an
Altar, published by Kinge Edward the 6. and his Councill,
<hi>this was</hi> the 5. and Cheifest.<note n="m" place="margin">Fox Acts and monum. p. 1211.</note> Christ did institute the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his body and blood at a Table, not at an Altar; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seinge the forme of a Table is more agreeable with
Christs institution then the forme of an Altar, therefore the
forme of a Table is rather to bee used then the forme of an
Altar in the administration of the holy Communion. <hi>The same
argument holds as firme in the situation of the Table; The placinge</hi>
of it in the midst of the Church or Chauncell is more agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with Christs institution then the standinge of it Altarwise
against the wall at the East end of the Quire, <hi>Therefore this
situation of it is rather to bee used then the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because this is most agreeable to the practice of the
Apostles, Fathers, and primitive Church in the purest tymes,
<hi>as I have already manifested, &amp; of the reformed Churches beyond
the Seas,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Because it is most consonant to the booke of Common
prayer, Queene Elizabeths Injunctions, the Bishops owne
Canons, and the judgement of our best writers.</p>
            <p>4. Because it is the most usuall and proper situation of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
amonge all Nations in all ages both a broade &amp; at home,
whoe place their Tables at which they eate, and drinke, in
the midst of their dyninge roomes, at least wise in such sorte
that men maye sitt, or stand round about them, <hi>The Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
therefore beinge</hi> a table to eate, and drinke at, 1. Cor.
10. 16. 17. 20. 21. c. 11. 20. <hi>and the Communion it
selfe usually tearmed both in Scripture, &amp; all sortt of writers from

<hi>this scituation of it must bee fittest, &amp; decentest, which is Common
to all suppinge tables, &amp; doth best expresse, &amp; resemble the nature
of a supper, by standinge in the midst of the Communicants; and
their sittinge, standinge, or kneelinge round about it altogeather
(not by severall files, and turnes,) like soe many bidden-guests.
Whereas the placinge of it</hi> Altarwise, <hi>like a</hi> Dresser, <hi>or</hi> side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cubberd,
<hi>not a</hi> Table; <hi>&amp; the causinge of men to come upp to the
raile by severall files; and there to receive by turnes, kneelinge,</hi> doth
neither expresse the one to bee the Lords table, nor the other
to bee the Lords supper.</p>
            <p>5. Because this scituation of the table in the midst will
<note n="o" place="margin">Fox Acts &amp; monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments p. 1211.</note> more move the simple people from the superstitious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the Popish Masse, Altars, Preists, sacrifices, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Masses, where the Preist alone Communicates, &amp; drawe
them upp to the right use of the Lords supper. <hi>Whereas the
placinge of it Altarwise against the East wall of the Chauncell,
nowe urged is nothinge else,</hi> but to usher Altars; Preists, publique,
and private Masses, adoration of Altars, and the Hostia,
transubstantiation, and the whole body of Poperie into our
Church <hi>againe, as the Papists themselves doe every where cracke,
&amp; vaunt, and all whoe are not wilfully blinded maye at first viewe
discerne by wofull experience. This forme of scituatinge the Lords
Table, and administringe the Sacrament, was used in the primitive
Church,</hi> till<note n="*" place="margin">M. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Vegon <hi>Reliq. of Rome: ch. of Church Goodes: s.</hi> 322.</note> Poperie, &amp; private Masses, thrust it out. When
Poperie, Masses, Masse Preists, Transubstantiation, Altars,
adoration of the Hostia, &amp; other Popish trash were abolished,
this<note n="p" place="margin">Fox Acts &amp; monu. p. 1404. 1406. &amp; the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> scituation of it was againe revived as a Soveraigne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote

ever used to expresse a thing that is Common; &amp;
the Scriptures quoted in the next insuing reason evidence. Whereas
the placing of the Table so farre from the people, the rayling of it in
that so none, but the Minister may have accesse unto it, destroyes
both the Communion &amp; Communion Table in appropriating it to
the Minister, and sequestring it from the people.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>The Communion Table ought to bee placed in the midst of
the Church, and Congregation, because that is the place wherein
God &amp; Christ have especially promised their Gracious presence, as
the ensuinge Scriptures evidence, not at the East end of the Church
or Chauncell as our Novellers fondly dreame, &amp; Magisterially
determine.</hi> Hence Psal. 46. 5. God <hi>is sayd to bee</hi> in the MID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEST

<hi>By all which texts it is evident, That God and Christ are</hi> sayde

descend: the worlde beinge plainely <hi>Circular, &amp; globall,</hi> havinge
no angles nor squares, &amp; so no East, West, North, or South if
simplie considered in it selfe.</p>
            <p>3. Admitt that Christ shoulde come to Iudgment out of the
East in respect of England, and these partes of the worlde; yet this
is no Reason to prove, that our Communion Tables shoulde bee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the East end, of our Chauncells Altarwise, (for then no doubt
the primitive Christians woulde have so placed it, &amp; not in the
midst of their Churches.</p>
            <p>For First, the Lords Table serves only for the administration
of the Sacrament instituted, <hi>to shewe forth Christs till hee come,
1. Cor. 25. 26.</hi> not to demonstrate the manner of his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge
to Iudgment, to which the Table hath no relation. Christs
second comminge therefore havinge no reference to the Communion
Table, nor the Table to it, can bee noe argument for its Easterlie
scitnation.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Apostle</hi> in the <hi>1. Cor. 11.</hi> in all matters &amp; Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
concerninge the administration of the Sacrament, <hi>sends
us only to Christs originall institution,</hi> not to his second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge,
<hi>But the Table at which hee instituted the Sacrament
stood in the midst,</hi> as I have proved, Therefore our Communion
Tables, shoulde so stand nowe, let Christs come to Iudgment which
waye hee please.</p>
            <p>3. Christs gives us this charge by his <hi>Apostles, do all things
decently, and in order, 1. Cor. 11. 33. 34. c. 13. 40.</hi> never
sendinge us to take a patterne from the manner of his second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge,
<hi>which is left Arbitrarie to himselfe and his Fathers
pleasure, Acts 1. 7. Math. 24. 36.</hi> not prescribed as a pattorne

in Christ, the primitive, and all reformed Churches Iudgments, is
most decent, and Convenient, therefore it is to bee observed, and
retained of us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second reason alleaged by our Novellers for their newe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1659:62"/>
dislocation of Communion Tables, is this:</hi> The Communion
Tables ought to bee placed at the East end of the Chancell,
because it is Christs mercy seate, his claire of Estate, and the
speciall place of his presence here on Earth, on which hee sitts,
and resides, and the East end of the Chauncell or Quire is the
upper, the best part, the prime place of honour in the Church,
and therefore no seates ought to bee there suffered, and the
Altar, the Communion Table must bee there seated that soe

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> that the mercy-seate was Jewish, tipicall, &amp; abolished
by Christs death, of whom it was a type. Rom. 3. 25. 1. John

<hi>on these textt, &amp; on</hi> Exod. c. 25. and 26. and 30. and 31. and

            </p>
            <p>2. The mercie seate was nothinge else but the Coveringe
of the Arke, <hi>so called,</hi> because it Covered, and hidd the Lawe,
it was made of pure gold, two cubites, and an halfe broade
with two Cherubims of gold of beaten worke in the two
ends of the mercie seate, and it was put above upon the Arke.
Exod. 25. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. c. 26. 34. c. 30. 6. c. 31. 7.
c. 37. 6. to 10. c. 40. 20. Lev. 16. 13. 14. 15. Num. 7. 8. 9.
<hi>Our Communion Tables are not such for matter, forme, worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshipp,

whereof they maye bee satt, &amp; if you will make the</hi> Quire <hi>resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the</hi> Arke, <hi>you must then place them upon the roofe and leds of
our</hi> Quires, <hi>therefore they are not mercy seates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. God did only dispence his word and Oracles, and all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1659:62"/>
things which hee gave Commaundement to the Children of
Israell from betweene the two Cherubims, and the mercie

therefore in this regard &amp; of it elevation above the pewes, &amp; people
shoulde rather bee</hi> Christs mercie seate, <hi>then the</hi> Communion
Table, <hi>where Christ only</hi> distributed his bodie and blood unto
us, not his word, and precepts.</p>
            <p>4.<note n="o" place="margin">Godwyn ibid. l. 2. c. 1. p. 78.</note> 
               <hi>The Arke and mercy seate stood in the Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum
at the West end of the Temple, not the East. Heb. 9.
4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. whether none but the high Preist might enter,
and that but once a yeare not without blood.</hi> If therefore the
Communion Table bee a mercy seate, it must stand in the West end
of our Churches upon the topp of the Arke in a <hi>Sanctrum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
as it did, neither ought any Bishop or Preist to come neere it,
but the <hi>high Preist only,</hi> (to with the Archbishop of Canterbury
Private of all Engiand) <hi>and that once a yeare, and noe more,
with blooddy sacrifices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. There was but<note n="*" place="margin">Godwyn ibidein.</note> one mercy seate standinge only in the
Temple, not in the Synagogues over the Arke, which was but
one. <hi>If therefore the Lords Table bee a mercie seate, there shoulde
bee but one in all the worlde. This first reason therefore is but a
Iewish frenticke dreame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The <hi>paten</hi> which containes the <hi>Consecrated breade,</hi> and
the <hi>Chalice,</hi> which hold <hi>the hallowed wyne, &amp;</hi> stand <hi>upon the
Table,</hi> as the <hi>mercy seate did upon the Arke beinge made of
silver</hi> in most, <hi>&amp; of gold in some places,</hi> shoulde rather be <hi>Christs
mercy seate then the Table</hi> it selfe, yet no men bowe, or cring to
them, or plead for their honour, and precedently, though more
worthy in respect of matter, use, &amp; immediate contayninge of the
materiall partes of the Sacrament, then the Table.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>I answeare,</hi> That the Communion Table is not Christs
Chaire of Estate, <hi>as these</hi> Novellers <hi>dogmatize.</hi> For heaven
only is Christs Throane, Earth but his foo stoole. Gen. 4. 2.
Psal. 103. 11. Psal. 110. 1. Heb. 1. 13. c. 8. 1. c. 10. 12. 13.
Rom. 8. 34. Psal. 11. 4. Isay 66. 1. Matth. 5. 34. Acts. 7. 49.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1659:63"/>
               <hi>And it is the expresse resolution of the Scripture,</hi> and the Article
of our Creede, that Christ in his humane nature hath his
Throane, and mercy seate only at his Fathers owne right hand
in heaven, where hee sits in Majesty and glorie, makinge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
intercession for us; and shall there constantly reside
untill his second comminge to Iudgment, Acts 1. 11. c. 3. 21.
Hebr. 9. 28. <hi>howe then the Communion Table can bee</hi> his chaire
of State, and cheife place of his presence, <hi>I cannot conjecture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Christ in the Sacrament exhibits himselfe not in his State &amp;
glorie to us, but in the very depth of his passion &amp; humiliation,
the Sacrament beinge instituted, not to manifest his exaltation</hi> and
glorie, but to expresse unto us the breakinge of Gods body
&amp; effusion of his blood on the Crosse, &amp; to shewe forth his
death till his comminge. 1. Cor. 11. 24. 25. 26. Math. 26.
28. Luke 22. 19. 20. <hi>Howe therefore this place,</hi> Phil. 2. 7. 8.
and Emblem of his greatest debasement, <hi>can bee colourobly

               </gap>sty, <hi>I cannot comprehend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Whoe ever heard a Table to eate &amp; drinke at, tearmeds
<hi>chare of State,</hi> either in respect of the meate, or guests? or howe
can it bee so tearmed without grosse absurditie, especially when the
party there present on it, is exposed to us only as <hi>spirituall meate
and drinke, to bee received by us, not adored of us. 1. Cor.
10. 3. 4. 16. 17. 21. c. 11. 21. to 30. John 6. 48. to 59.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. If any thinge maye bee there tearmed <hi>Christs Chaire of
Estate,</hi> it shoulde bee the <hi>Plater &amp; Chalice,</hi> wherein the breade
&amp; wyne are imediately comprised, not the <hi>Table</hi> whereon they
stand, which is rather a <hi>footstoole</hi> to support Christs Chaire, then
the <hi>Chaire</hi> wherein hee sits in State; the breade &amp; wyne not so much
as touchinge the Table.</p>
            <p>5. Why shoulde the Lords Table bee <hi>Christs mercy seate or
Chaire of State, rather then the Font, the Pulpit, or Church
Bible?</hi> Is not Christ as really &amp; spiritually present in the one as
the other, by his mercy, grace, &amp; spirit? and is not <hi>Baptisme, &amp;
the word as necessarie as the Lords supper? Math. 28. 19. 20.
Mar. 16. 15. 16.</hi> yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1659:63"/>
since men maye bee saved without receivinge the Sacrament of the
Lords supper, but not without <hi>Baptisme, &amp; the word read, and
preached,</hi> as many teach.</p>
            <p>6. To make the Communion Table <hi>Christs mercy seate,
Chaire of Estate, and place of his speciall presence,</hi> if it bee
meant of his spirituall presence only, is a falsehood; since hee is
alwayes equallie present in this <hi>manner in all his ordinances to
the end of the worlde. Math. 28. 19. 20.</hi> If of his Corporall
presence, <hi>which is only nowe in heaven, Acts 3. 21. Hebr. 9.
28. John 14. 2. 3. 28. c. 16. 7. 16. 17. 19. 21.</hi> (the thinge
they intend) then it smels of ranke Popo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se, intimatinge a transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
of the breade &amp; wyne into Christs verie bodie &amp; bloode,
a notorious Popish absurditie, <hi>longe</hi>

            </p>
            <p>3. Admitt, that the Communion Table were Christs <hi>mercy
seate, &amp; Chaire of Estate,</hi> (which they take as graunted without
any Scripture, ground or reason, which I desire them first to prove,
before they lay it downe an undoubted principle) yet the conclusion
will not followe, that therefore is must stand at the East end of the
Chauncell or Quire Altarwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For first,</hi> the<note n="c" place="margin">Godwyns Iewish An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities l. 2. c. 1.</note> mercy seate stood in the end of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
and Temple upon the topp of the Arke, not at the East.
<hi>Therefore the Table should stand so too were it a</hi> mercy seate.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Christs Chaire of Estate</hi> ought to bee seated there where
himselfe hath promised his speciall presence: But that is not in the
East end, <hi>but in the midst of the Church and people, Math.
18. 20.</hi> as I have formerly proved by sundry Scriptures: Therefore
it shoulde bee placed in the midst.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Whereas these men protend,</hi> that the East end of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
or Quire where they nowe raile in the Table Altarwise,
is the highest and most worthy place in the Church; and that
noe seates must there bee suffered, for feare any shoulde take
the wall or upper hand of Christ, and sitt above him, or check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
with him in his owne Temple. <hi>I answeare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1659:64"/>
First, that these are ridiculous Childish fantastique conceites of
their owne superstitious braines, grounded on no Scripture or solid
reason, and so not to be credited.</p>
            <p>2. These reasons make Christ ambitious of place &amp; precedency, &amp;
corporally present here an Earth, when as he was; &amp; still is <hi>lowly &amp;
humble, Matth. 11. 29. forbiddinge men to sitt downe at any
Feast in the uppermost place, but in the lowest, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinge
an woe against the Pharisies for lovinge the uppermost
seates in Synagogues, and Feasts, Math. 23. 6. Luke 11. 43.</hi>
therefore were hee nowe on Earth, hee woulde not contend for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency,
and the upper-most place, as these his ambitious-Champions
doe for him, because they love precedency themselves, much lesse
will hee doe it nowe, he hath taken upp his seate and throne in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
&amp; hath left the Earth altogeather in his bodily presence, where
these Novellers woulde faine to be still resident in the Church on the
Communion Table, as the Papists saye he is upon their Altars,
close prisoner in a Pix.</p>
            <p>3. It is most false, that the East end of the Quire or Chauncell
where they nowe place their Altars and Tables, is the most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and prime place of the Church and Quire; For in all <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls</hi>
that I have seene, &amp; in his <hi>Majesties, Chappells, the Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, Deanes Thrones and seates, and the Kings
Closetts are at the West end of the Quire or Chancell,</hi> And
the most honorable persons seat, <hi>is the West, not the East end of
them;</hi> the more West any man sits, the higher, the more East the
lower, the seates next the West end beinge reputed the highest and
honorablest, the seates next the East, the lowest, for the singinge
men and Quiresters, &amp; the meaner sort of people. Soe in Parish
Churches, where there are any seates in the Chancell or Quire, the
seate at the West end is usually esteemed the worthiest and first
seate, and the neerer the East end the meaner, and lower are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.
The West end therefore of the Quire and Chancell, as these
instances, and experience undeniable manifest, is the cheifest, &amp; the
place where the most honorable persons have their seates, &amp; chaires
of State. If therefore the Communion Table, or their Altars, bee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1659:64"/>
               <hi>Christs Chaire of State,</hi> and that hee ought to take precedency
and place of all men, then it must bee placed in the <hi>West end</hi> of the
Quire in Cathedralls, where the Bishops Throne and seate is sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
and removed to the <hi>West end</hi> of the Chancell, where the
best man of the Parish sits, not thrust downe <hi>to the East end of
the Quire or Chancell against the wall,</hi> which is in truth the
lowest place by their owne practice, and resolution. And here we
may behold the desperate so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tishnes, and frenzie of these Popish
Innovators, whoe under a vaine pretence of givinge Christ, &amp; the
Communion Table the upper hand, that none may sitt above them,
will needs thrust them into the varie lowest place even in their owne
practice, Iudgements, and Common reputation, where servants or
the meaner sort of people only sit, (where there are seates or formes)
in most Churches, which yet against their owne Iudgements and
knowledge, (out of I knowe not what factious strange superstitions
humour) must upon a suddaine be Cried upp for the most honorable
place, by these learned Rabbies.</p>
            <p>4. Admit the Communion Table <hi>Christs Chaire of Estate and
mercy seate;</hi> and that it ought to be placed in the best and upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
place of the Church; yet it is only such, and thus to bee sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
when the Sacrament is administred: For howe is it his
<hi>Chaire of State, his mercy seate, and cheifest place of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
when there is no Sacramentall breade &amp; wyne upon it to
represent his spirituall presence to us? But when the Sacrament is
to be administred, <hi>the booke of Common prayer, the Queenes
Injunctions, Fathers, and forecited Authors</hi> informe us, <hi>that it
must bee placed in the body or midst of the Church, or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>
Therefore our Novellers must either deny the <hi>East end</hi> of
the Quire to be the most honorable place, or that it was ever so
reputed; or else confesse the invalidity of this their proposition,
<hi>That the Table ought to stand in the cheife and most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
place of the Church,</hi> unlesse they will Condemne the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the primitive, yea our owne Church, and all our cheife wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Error in this particular.</p>
            <p>5. Admit, that the East end of the Chancell or Quire bee the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1659:65"/>
most honorable parte of the Church, and that the Table for this
reason ought there to be rayled in: Why are not the <hi>Font and
Pulpit there placed and rayled in as well as the Table, and
the Bible, and readinge pewe too, Are not the Font,</hi> the <hi>Pulpit,</hi>
the <hi>Bible</hi> as honorable as venerable, as worthy to take place and
precedency as the <hi>Table,</hi> both in respect of matter, use, relation
to God and Christ, and divine institution? undoubtedly they are;
therefore to be all ranked in an equipage as <hi>the lavers, Shewbread

Waldoyes in Piemont beinge sommoned &amp; pressed to forsake
God and revolt againe to Idolatrie, which they had begun to
cast of, agreed togeather to make a solemne protestation, that
they woulde utterly forsake the false Religion of the Pope,
and live, and die in the maintenance and confession of Gods
word and truth. Whereupon they sayd, lett us all goe to
morrowe into the Temple to heare the word of God, &amp; after
let us cast to the ground all the Idolls, and ALTARS; to
which they all agreed; sayinge, let us soe doe; yea, and that
the very same houre in the which they have appointed us to
bee at the Councill house: Whereupon the next daye after
they assembled themselves in the Church of Body, &amp; as soone
as they came into the Temple without any further delaye,
they beate downe the Images, &amp; cast downe the ALTARS.
After Sermon they went to Billers where they beate downe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1659:66"/>
their Images and ALTARS. Our famous Kinge Edward

               </gap>s opinions of the Popish Masse, out of the hearts
of the simple, which would be more holden in the minds of
the people by the forme of an Altar, then of a Table, as the
King and Councell in their 1. and 3. reasons had resolved,
and to bring them to the right use taught by Holy Scripture,
of the Lords Supper; Hereupon (I say) he appointed the forme
of a right Table to be used in his Diocesse, <hi>(according to the
King &amp; Councells instructions and consideration)</hi> and in the
Church of Paules brake downe the wall standing by the High
Altars side. <hi>And upon this occasion (as it most probable) he wrote
his booke</hi> DE CONFRINGENDIS ALTARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUS,
of breaking downe Altars, <hi>registred by</hi> Bishop B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le
among other his workes, <hi>though not now extant that I can find.
Not long before this,</hi> John Hoper Bishop of Gloster, <hi>(afterwards
a Martyr, as was that worthy</hi> Ridley) <hi>preaching before King
Edward the 6. in his 3.</hi> Sermon upon Jonah, printed Anno
1551. Cum Privilegio, <hi>tooke occasion thus to Censure Altars,
and to move the King utterly to demolish them.</hi> If question now
be asked, is there then no Sacrifice left to bee done of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
people? yea truly, but none other then such, as might be
done without Altars, and they be of 3. sorts. The first is the
Sacrifice of thankgiving, Psal. 51. 17. 19. Amos 4. 5. Hos. 14. 2.
Heb. 13. 15. The second is beneficence, and liberality to the
poore, Mich. 6. 8. 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2. 2. Cor. 8. 19. Heb. 13.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1659:66"/>
16. The 3. kind of Sacrifice is, the mortifying of our owne
bodies, and to die from sinne. Rom. 12. 1. Math. 12. Luke 14.
If we studie not dayly to offer these Sacrifices to God, we be
no Christian men, seing Christian men have no other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
then these which may and ought to be done without Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.
There should among Christians be no Altars, And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was not without the great wisdome and knowledge
of God, that Christ, his Apostles, and the Primitive Church
lacked Altars, For they knew that the use of them was taken
away, It were well then that it might please the Magistrates
to turne the Altars into Tables according to the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ to take away the false persuation of the people,
they have of Sacrifices to be done, upon Altars, For<note n="*" place="margin">Note this</note> as long
as the Altars remaine, both the ignorant people, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
&amp; evill perswaded Preist will dream alway of Sacrifice.
Therfore were it best that the Magistrates remove all the
Monuments and Tokens of Idolatry and superstition, then
should the true Religion of God sooner take place, <hi>which he
thus seconds, in his</hi> 8. Sermon <hi>upon Ionah.</hi> A great shame it is
for a Noble King, Emperour, or Magistrate contrary to Gods
word, to deteyne or keep from the devill or his Ministers any
of their goods o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Treasure, as the Candles, Images, Crosses,
vestiments Altars: For it they be kept in the Church as things
indifferent, at length they will be maintayned as things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<hi>as now we find true by late wofull experience. And in his</hi>
4. Sermon upon Jonah, <hi>hee proceeds thus:</hi> But this prayer of
Jonas is so acceptable, it might be thought of some men, that
the place where Jonas prayed in should have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tered it; as
the foolish opinion of the world is at this time, that judgeth
the Prayer sayd at the High Altar, to be better then that which
is sayd in the Quier; that in the Quier better, then that which
is sayd in the body of the Church, that in the body of the
Church, better then that which is sayd in the Feild or in a
mans Chamber. But our Prophet sayth the Lord hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the place, but to the heart &amp; faith of him that prayeth.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1659:67"/>
And that appeareth. For penitent Jonas prayeth out of the
whales belly, and miserable Job upon the dung heape, Daniell
in the Cave of the Lyons, Hieremie in the claypit, the theife
upon the Crosse, S. Stephen under the Stones, wherfore the
grace of God is to bee prayed for in every place, and every
where as our necessity shall have need, and wanteth solace.
Although I commend the prayer made to God in the name
of Christ to belike in every place, because that our necessity
requireth helpe in every place, yet I doe not condemne the
publike place of prayer, whereas Gods word is preached, his
holy Sacrament used, and common prayer made unto God, but
allow the same, and sory it is no more frequented &amp; haunted,
but this I would wish, that the Magistrates would put both
the Preist, Minister and the people into<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> one place, and shut
up the partition called the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>auncell, that seperateth the
Congregation of Christ one from the other, as though the
vayle and partition of the Temple in the old Law, yet should
remaine in the Church, where indeed all signes &amp; types are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Christ: And in case this were done, it should not only
expresse the dignity &amp; grace of the New Testament, but also
cause the people the better to understand the things read there
by the Minister, and also provoke the sayd Minister to a more
study of the things he readeth least he should be found by the
Iudgement of the Congregation not worthy neither to read
nor Minister in the Church: further that such as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Holy Communion of the body and blood of Christ,
might both heare and see playnly what is done, as it was used
in the Primative Church, when as the abomination done upon
Altars was not knowne, nor the Sacrifice of Christs precious
blood so conculcated and troden under feet. <hi>Hereupon, as also

we may clearly discerne, That one of the first things which our
owne &amp; other reformed Churches did upon the bringing in of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1659:72"/>
&amp; abolishing of Popery, was the breaking downe and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Altars, together with their name, and placing of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Tables in their steed; that the first thing againe, the Papists
did, upon the restitution of Popery, was the erecting of Altars, &amp;
casheering Communion Tables. That the setting up of Altars, &amp;
turning Communion Tables into Altars, or Altarwise, is to no other
end, but to usher Masses &amp; Popery (the inseperable concommitants
&amp; followers of Altars which cannot subsist without them) into our
Church againe; That our godly Martyrs, Princes, Prelates, writers
yea and our Church itselfe, have constantly both in their Iudgments,
practise, &amp; disputes, condemned Altars, as Iewish, Heathenish,
Popish &amp; unlawfull unto Christians; That they are contrary to
the Statute of 1. Eliz. 1. 2.</hi> The Booke of Common Prayer, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
Injunctions, Canons, Orders, Advertissements and
Articles of the Church of England, <hi>&amp; were never yet written or
preached for, patronized, enjoyned, or erected but among, and by
Papists, &amp; that to receive the Masse &amp; sett up Popery, which fall
or stand together with them. And that the Communion Table is
no</hi> Altar, <hi>nor</hi> High Altar, <hi>as our</hi>

All this being thus premised, I come now to give a particular
answer to this 3. reason for placing Communion Tables Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, therfore I deny, that the Communion or Lords Table is
either an Altar, or High Altar, that it ought so to be stiled or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or that any Altars ought to be set up in our Churches;</p>
            <p>First, because the Scripture never tearmes the Lords Table an
Altar, but <hi>a Table, 1. Cor. 10. 21.</hi> only &amp; prescribes a Table only,
not an Altar for the administration of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>2. Because our Common Prayer Booke, Homilies, Articles,
Canons, Injunctions, writers doe the like, distinguishing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table &amp; Altars as opposite contradistinct things, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
one with the other, abandoning not Altars only themselves,
but the very name of Altars, as <hi>Jewish and Heathenish, 1. Cor.
9. 13. c. 10. 18. 19.</hi> being quite expunged, so as it is not to be
found in our Booke of Common Prayer, Articles, Injunctions,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1659:73"/>
Homilies, Canons, which never terme the Lords Table an Altar,
either properly or improperly.</p>
            <p>3. Because Altars &amp; Lords Tables differ much one from the
other.</p>

Where Preachers of the Gospell, <hi>are directly distinguished from

of the Epistle of Paule to the Hebrewes, <hi>with others observe,)</hi>
the Apostle proveth that Aarons Preisthood is changed &amp; the
Ordinance therof, because Psal. 110. speaketh of Christs
Preisthood after the order of Melchisedek, that is freed from
the service of the Altar; and Christ was borne not of the Tribe
of Aaron but of Judah, of which no man gave attendant at the
Altar, to witt the materiall Altar commaunded in the Law.
<hi>To declare, that Altars and giving attendance at Altars properly
belonging to the Leviticall Preisthood, were abolished by Christ
the true Preist and Sacrifice, of which they were but types; And
that as</hi> Christ himselfe was borne of the tribe of Judah, of
which no man gave attendance at the Altar, so the Ministers
of Christ under the Gosple who professe themselves of his

thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> that Christs Preisthood is freed from that Altar
which God commaunded in the Law, and all the service
thereof.</p>
            <p>2. That an other Altar he knoweth not; &amp; Christs Preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
being declared to be freed from the service of this Altar
no Law can tie it to any other.</p>
            <p>3. That whosoever will erect another materiall Altar in
Christs Preisthood, and tie his Church unto it <hi>(as the Papists
add, and our New Prelates and Doctors doe now)</hi> must looke by
what Law they doe it.</p>
            <p>4. That negative Conclusions in matters of faith &amp; due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
follow well from the Scriptutes Silence. It is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
from Scripture therfore I am not bound to beleive it?
Since the Apostle here reasoneth thus; That none of the tribe
of Judah attended the Altar, because Moses speake nothing
of that Tribe concerning the Preist-hood (<hi>which overturnes all
Preists, Altars and attendance at Altars under the Gospell, and
the calling of the Lords-Table an Altar, because the Scripture is
silent and speakes nothing of them, but against them.</hi>)</p>
            <p>To which I shall adde a 5. inference. <hi>That Christ himselfe
never gave any attendance at the Altar, nor yet Melchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or any of Christs Tribe,</hi> Therfore none of Christs Ministers
ought to doe it; and that those Archbishops, Bishops, Preists and
Ministers, who will needs have &amp; set up Altars, plead, write,
dispute for Altars, &amp; likewise waite on, serve &amp; give attendance
at the Altar, are only Preistes of Aaron or Baal, &amp; of their Tribe;
not Ministers of Iesus Christ, nor any of his sacred Tribe, <hi>none of
which gave any attendance at the Altar;</hi> This is the Apostles
reason, inference, &amp; the very drife of his argumentation, not mine,
let those therfore whom it concernes looke well unto it, and evade, or

            <p>6. <hi>Christians have no such sacrifices, incense-offrings, or obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

it appeareth manifestly by the Euangelists.</p>
            <p>And S. Paul calleth the comming to the holy Communion,

               </gap>
brought in the altars first into the Church, utterly forbidding
Tables any more to be used from thenceforth at the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Lords-Supper: when notwithstanding from
Christs ascention unto that time, the Lords Supper was alway
ministred at a Table, according to the practise of Christ, of his
Apostles, and of the primitive Church, Pope Sixtus the second
ordained first of all that the Supper of the Lord should be
celebrated at an Altar, which before was not the use for the
Holy mysteries of the Lords body and blood untill that time
was ministred upon a Table according to the practise of
Christ, of his Apostles and of the primitive Church; &amp; here

               <hi>All these Authorities (to which the Papists could never yee

mistaken in Origens and Arnobius meaning; who must be
understood, not that the Christians had no Altars in their
Temples, but that they had no Altars for bloody or externall
Sacrifices, as the Gentiles had.</p>
            <p>For otherwise it is most certaine, that the Church had Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
both the name and thing, and used both name and thing
along time together before the birth of Origen or Arnobius
either; which he proves by the Testimonyes of Tertullian,
Irenaeus, Cyprian, Ignatius, the Apostles Canons, and Heb.
13. 10.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, first, that this namelesse Author, in modesty
&amp; good manners, should have rather deemed himselfe mistaken in
the meaning of <hi>Origen &amp; Arnobius, then our Homilies,</hi> and
these <hi>our learnedest writers,</hi> whose judgments &amp; authorities cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
will over ballance his.</p>
            <p>2. These Authors tooke their words &amp; meaning aright, what
ever is pretended; as appeares.</p>
            <p>1. By the Gentiles objection itselfe: <hi>The Gentiles charged
the Christians, that they had neither Temples, nor Images, nor
Altars:</hi> Was their meaning then, that they had Temples indeed,
but not to sacrifice in, &amp; Images to, but not to adore; or that in
truth they simplie had neither Temples nor Images. Certainely the
<hi>Coale</hi> itselfe would blush at the first exposition; &amp; the Papists
might else thus pritilie evade these authorities against Images; that
the Christians had Images, but not to adore, though the Gentiles
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1659:80"/>
objected they had none, <hi>and Lactantius &amp; Minucius Felix</hi> too
about that age; <hi>expresly resolved that they had no Temples
nor Images at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their meaning therfore being (as our <hi>Homilies,</hi> &amp; those very
words themselves resolve,) that they had no publicke Temples, no
Images at all, for any assemblies, use, or purpose; their meaning
likewise must be, that they had no Altars at all for any purpose;
(not, no Altars for any bloody &amp; externall Sacrifices as the Gentiles
had, but yet they had them to administer the Sacrament on, as
he falsely glosseth it:) Since the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of Temples, Images<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Altars
are all coupled together, &amp; objected to them in the same sence and
manner.</p>
            <p>Now had the Christians in that age had Temples, but not for
Idolls service, Images, but not to adore; Altars, but not to offer
bloody and externall Sacrifices on, as the <hi>Coale</hi> Glosseth it; the
Gentiles would then never have objected the want of Temples, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
or Images to them, as is probable; since they had them, but
their not sacrificing on them, &amp; adoring them as they did, &amp; not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a right use of them who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they had them; as we tax all couetous
men, or Nonpreaching Ministers, that are Schollers, not for having
no mony or learning, but for not making such use of them as they

               <note n="b" place="margin">Contra Cels. l. 7. f. 96. 97. l. 4. f. 46. 47.</note> The Christians <hi>(sayth</hi> Celsus) cannot endure either Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or Altars, or Images &amp; Statutes to be looked upon, they
openly disprayse Images &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which Origen thus replies: The Christians &amp; also the
Jewes, when they heare, thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, &amp;
him only shalt thou serve; neither shalt thou make to thy selfe
any graven Image, nor the likenes of any thing that is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above or in the earth beneath, &amp;c. and for many things
not unlike these, doe not only dislike the Temples of the
Gods, and Altars, and these Images, but would if there be a
necessity rather runne more willingly to death, then out of
any sinne or impietie altogether defile what they rightly
thinke of God the maker of all things, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therfore <hi>Celsus</hi> affirmes, that Images are by noe meanes to
be esteemed for God, but dedicated to the Gods; when as it
is plainely perspicuous, that to make and affirme such things, is
the part of such men as are about the divinity. But we shall
not so much as account them as Images of the divine Image,
as those who may make no forme as of the invisible, so also of
the incorporiall God.</p>
            <p>By both which charges and replies, it is cleare, that Christians in
those dayes had no materiall Temples, Altars, Images; but only
spirituall Temples, Altars and Sacrifices in their hearts, and brests,
and that they rejected all materiall Altars, Images and Sacrifices
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1659:81"/>
as unlawfull, and abominable. <hi>Origen</hi> himselfe not denying the
charge to be true, but justifying the Christians for having neither,
S. <hi>Arnobius in his 6. Booke against the Gentiles,</hi> brings them
in thus objecting: <hi>In this part ye have used to fix the greatest
crime of impiety upon us, that we neither build sacred houses
for the Offices of worship, that we constitute not the Image
or forme of any of the Gods, that we built no Altars, &amp;c.</hi> (A
plaine charge against the Christians, that they then neither had,
nor yet would build any Temples, or set up any Images or Altars,
which they could not have objected if they had then any,) <hi>that we
offer not the blood of slaine beastes, not Frankincense, not
salted corne, and that we bring not in liquid wine powred out
in bowles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which things verily (sayth Arnobius) we doe not therfore
give over and forbeare, either to build or doe, as if we caried
impious and wicked mindes, or had taken up some contempt
against the Gods out of a rash despaire, but because we thinke
&amp; beleive the Gods; (if so be they are Gods indeed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the eminencie of this name?) will either deride
these kindes of Honours, if they can laugh, or will take them
ill at our hands, if they may be exasperated with the motions
of anger.</p>
            <p>After which he shewes at large the reasons, <hi>why Christians
build no Temples, made no Images or Altars, and offred no
such Sacrifices at all to God, &amp; why they thought it unlawfull
so to doe;</hi> not denying the objection but confessing the matter of
fact to be true, and defending it from the very fundamentall grounds
of Religion; which he would never certainely have done had the
Christians then had any materiall Temples, Images or Altars for
any divine or spirituall use.</p>

All which things he who exhibits, sacrificeth so often as he

            <p>From all these Fathers answers, therfore, it is most cleare and

The second passage is <hi>that in his Booke de Oratione c. 14.

at the first view.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that though this Booke be generally conceived
<hi>Tertullans,</hi> yet I suspect, that the additions after the end of the
Lords prayer explained, where in this passage is, are none of his.
For I find this passage in them: <hi>Sic &amp; die Paschae quo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis
&amp; quasi publica jejunij religio est, merito deponiemus
of culum, &amp;c.</hi> which intimates, <hi>that Christians on Easter day
did Keep, a common &amp; publike Fast, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> And it makes Easter day, not to be <hi>Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
dies;</hi> a day of praying standing, as the next words prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it is certaine,</hi> that Tertullian <hi>in his Booke</hi> de Corona
Militis, writes, that the Christians in his age thought it a
great wickednes to fast or to pray kneeling on the Lords day,
being the joyfull day of Christs resurrection, <hi>much more then
to doe it upon Easter day;</hi> and that the Christians did not fast
but rejoyce in remembrance of Christs resurrection from Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to whitsontide.</p>
            <p>No Ecclesiasticall writer extant then making mention of any
solemne fast or praying kneeling observed by Christians, in that
age on Easter day; who thereon ever used to Feast and rejoyce,
<note n="l" place="margin">See Greg. Nys. Orat. 3. de resur &amp; all the Fathers on that Text.</note>

118. 24. This is the day which the Lord hath made we will
rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> This passage makes me suspitious,
that the later part of this Booke is none of his.</p>

this, or had these Ceremonies or Altars been then in use, they being

Moreover, this Booke makes mention of</hi> Hermas Booke, intitled
the Pastor, <hi>by way of approbation,</hi> and gives an answer to an
objection out of it; <hi>when as</hi> in his Booke de Pudicitia, <hi>he thus

            <p>Now both of them stiling the Sacrament, <hi>the Eucharist,</hi> and
speaking not of any Sacrifice or Sacrament of the Altar, but only
<hi>of spirituall bread to be eaten of us,</hi> (neither of a Table) we may

ancient Minister, who was a Bishop long before him (a plaine
evidence, that <hi>Ministers &amp; Bishops were then both one, and so
promiscuously stiled)</hi> being present when some were baptised &amp;
hearing the interrogatories and answers came weeping and
wailing to him, &amp; falling prostrate at his feet confessed and
protested that the baptisme where with he was baptised of the
heretickes was not true, whereupon he desired to be rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:
which he durst not doe, but told him, that the dayly
Communion many times ministred might suffice him; when
he had been present at the LORDS-TABLE, and had
streched forth his hand to receive the holy food, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
and of a long time had been partaker of the body
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1659:85"/>
and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, I durst not againe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
him, but bade him be of good cheare, of a sure faith, and
boldly to approch unto the Communion of the Sincts. But he
for all this morunneth continually, horror with draweth him
from the LORDS-TABLE, and being intreated hardly,
is persuaded to be present at the Ecclesiasticall prayers.</p>
            <p>In which auncient undoubted Epistle to the Pope himselfe, we
have not mention at all of any Altar, or Sacrament, or Sacrifice
of the Altar, but twice together the name <hi>of the Lords Table,</hi>
&amp; also of a <hi>dayly Communion, holy food, ministring and
partaking of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ &amp;c.</hi>
Which being the proper genuine &amp; undoubted language of that
age, makes me doubt these passages of <hi>Tertullian</hi> to be forged or
corrupted.</p>

            <p>5. S. Cyprian <hi>in many other Epistles that are undoubtedly his</hi>
calls the Sacrament only the Eucharist, the Lords Supper, the
Sacrament of Christs body &amp; blood, &amp; the Table in S. Paules
words, only the Lords Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in his</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Epist. l. 2 Epist. 3. in Pamelius Epist. 63.</note> Epistle to Caelicius only concerning the Cup
in the Sacrament, which all coufes to be his, he confines all
men most punctually to our Saviors institution and example
in all things concerning the Sacrament, <hi>writing,</hi> that Bishops
through out the world ought to hold the reason of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
truth, and Dominicall tradition, nor to depart from
those things which Christ our Master hath both commaunded
and done by any humane and novell Tradition; that we ought
herein to doe only what the Lord hath done before; that if
S. Paul or an Angell from heaven should teach us to doe any
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1659:87"/>
thing, then what Christ hath once taught us and his Apostles
preached they are and should be to us an Anathema: That
Christ only is to be heard; therfore we ought not to attend
what any one before us shall thinke meet to be done, but that
Christ who is before all men, hath first done.</p>
            <p>Neither ought we to follow the custome of any man, but
the truth of God. For if we are the Ministers of God and
Christ, I find none whom we ought more or rather to follow
then God and Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> therfore tying himselfe and all men thus strictly to
Christs institution, &amp; example, in all points and circumstances of
the Sacrament: And Christ &amp; his Apostles never administring it
at an Altar, nor stiling the Lords-Table, an Altar, &amp; his Apostles
never serving nor giving attendance at an Altar, I cannot but
from hence conclude, that these Passages certainely are none of
Cyprians. But to come to the particular scanning of these autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
            <p>1. I answer, That the first of them doth not precisly call the
Lords-Table, an Altar, nor expresly affirme, that Christians then
had Altars, being a meere allusion to the Preists and Altars under
the Law, relating to that of <hi>1. Cor. 9. 13. &amp; Exod. 29. 37. 44.</hi>
as the Text itselfe doth evidence. Which allusions were frequent in
our Ministers, Prayers, &amp; Sermons, when we had no Altars in our
Church for them to waite at, nor Communion Tables called or kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
by the names of Altars.</p>
            <p>2. That it mentions a <hi>Canon and Constitution made at least
60. yeares after S. Cyprians time, to wit in the Councell of
Anegra An. 314. Canon 1. 2. 3.</hi> there being no such Canon extant
in any Councell held in his age, which makes it suspuious if not spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
written long after his decease.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>If this Epistle make any thing for Altars, then, it makes
farre more against our Bishops tenets &amp; power now, since it expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sly
affirmes,</hi> that the people have power, &amp; are boundin conscience
to reject alwayes, and not to receive any man for their
Bishop, or to admit him to enjoy his Bishopricke, who shall
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1659:87"/>
fall away from the truth to heresie, or Idolatrie; that by such
a lapse he ipso facto looseth his Bishopricke, and, becomes no

               </gap>ing up of his body once for all:
<hi>be concludes thus:</hi> So then now if it be a cleare case, and that
by the plaine text of Holy Scripture, that since Christ was once
offred on the Altar of the Crosse, all carnall Sacrifices, &amp; all
manner of offrings, that ever were wont to be offred upon the
Altars, be wholly extinguished, utterly voyd and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
And in as much as no man (being in his right witt when
he advisedly perceiveth and plainely understandeth, that the
cause of the first invention and building of the Altars was for
no other purpose, but to burne or to offer Sacrifices &amp; obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon, which manner of Sacrifices God will no longer
accept) but he will strait wayes acknowledge, that their ought
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1659:89"/>
not any Altar to remaine to any use among us Christians, after
the death and passion of our Master Christ; at which time
as he protesteth himselfe, saying, <hi>Consum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tum est,</hi> it is finished;
signifying thereby, that Moses Law was not only by him
prevented, fulfilled, and finished, but that the same Law or
any Commaundment, Rite, Ceremony, or any other part
there in contained, (as concerning any burthening or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over the Christians) was to all intents ended, taken
away, and fully determined, and the Gospell as it were a
new Law, surrogated, confirmed and established in steed of
the old.</p>
            <p>Therfore Christians thus freed from the Law ought to have
no Altars, but Tables; For what husbandman (be he never so
simple) will be about to plough his land with a whelebarowe,
to harrow it with a slede, or to carry with an harrow? what
husbandman, I say is so folish, as to goe about to wede his
corne with a sith, to moye his hey with a weeding hoke; and
to tedde the same with a rake? Is a leaden Cesterne made
for to sayle on the Sea, is a ship, made to be drawne of horses
as a waggon upon the Land? do Noble men build sumptuons
Palaces for their horses to stand in, and lie themselves in old
ruinons stables? or doe men ordeine fetherbeds for their
dogges, and lye themselves in kennells? who maketh a
Garnar of an Oven, or an Oven of a Garnar? Or who maketh
a threshing flore in his dwelling house, and a herth in his
barne? who can make a pleasaunt &amp; a brave banketing hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
of filthy Schambles, or of a stinking Slaughter house? Yea
or who had not rather have his Supper layed on a faire Table
before him, then on a bloudy Butchars Cradle.</p>
            <p>And so likewise (to apply some of these strong Anagogies
and darke sayings to our purpose) is not a Garnar more meete
to lay up grain in than an Oven? Is it not more meete to
make a threshing flore in a barne then in a mans dwelling
house? And to make an herth to kendle fyre on in the middes
of a mans house, then by the moyes side in his barne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1659:90"/>And so who can make the Jewes old slaughter Synagoge
to serve for the new Euangelike Banketing Temple? Or who
had rather eate the heavenly banket of the Lords Supper on
a Jewish, a heathenlyk, or a Popish Altar: then on a decent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> &amp;
a faire comely Table? The unbeleiving Jew defieth Christes
Table and his Supper also. The unfaithfull heathen thinkes
scorne of the same. The Pope and his Papists make of it a
God or a popet. The Jew abhorreth utterly our religion.
The Heathen in no sence can away with it. The Pope is well
contented to be called a Christian, yea to be thought to be
Christ himselfe, so that he give him leave to live like a Jew
or a heathen. And shall we seeke upon them? Shall we be
partakers of their damnable Ceremonies, of their execrable
Rites, and cursed usages? Or is Christes religion so unperfit
of itselfe, so needy and beggerly, that it must borrow imbring
Fastes of the heathen, borrow Altars of the Pope, &amp; borrow
vestimentes of the Jewes? besides an unnumerable sort of
other like baggage, which hath heen weeded now of late out
of Christes Religion, and now restored home to the owners
thereof.</p>
            <p>Therfore let us either render home againe unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
the superstition of the imbring dayes, and to the Pope
his halowed Altars, and unto the Jewes, their Aarons vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes:
or els let us like good companions joyne together
in a league with them, and be tenauntes in Commune, &amp; put
our religion with theirs in hotch potche.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After which at the end of the Booke he proceeds thus:</hi> S. Paul
through the secret advertisment of the Holy Ghost did know
before hand, then if he had geven the name of an Altar unto
the Lord his Table, that there would be in time to come cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Jewish teachers that would build and sett up Popish
Altars in steed of Tables to serve the Lords Supper upon.</p>
            <p>And surely the holy D. S. Augustine, nor any other Godly
writer, would never have used this terme Altar, so often;
after that sort as they did, if they had had but the least incke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

in the world of foreknowledge, what absurdity, what

what though S, Augustine, or other Doctours used to terme
the Lords Supper the Sacrament of the Altar, which if it be as
I take it (I take it after the most sound and faithfullist under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
the unlearned people should not be greatly behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

            <p>For thus I understand them: The Sacrament of the Altar

            <p>Christ simply and plainly, and without any decking or

            <p>The Massemonger with a marvelous great pompe &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull

            </p>
            <p>For he hath an Altar sumptuously built, yea &amp; that is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with most fyne and white linnen clothes, so likewise
richly garnished, decked and trimmed with divers gorgious
pictures, and costly Images. He hath also crewettes for water
and for wine, towels, coffers, pyxes, Philacteries, banners,
candlestickes, waxe candles, organes, singing Bells, sacry

stones, myters, crosse staves, and many other such like orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
more meet for the Preisthode of Aaron, then for the
mynistery of the New Testament.</p>
            <p>It is nobly sayd of<note n="*" place="margin">Lib 2. Offic. c. 18.</note> S. Ambrose, the Sacraments require
no gold, neither do they delight in gold, which are not bought
for gold. The garnishing of the Sacramentes is the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
or deliverance of the captives and prisoners. And verily
those are precious vesselles, which redeeme soules from death.
That is the true treasure of the Lord, which worketh that,
that his bloud hath wrought.</p>
            <p>Againe he sayth: The church hath gold, not that it should
keepe it, but that it should bestow it, and helpe when need is.
For what doth it profitt to keep that, which serveth to no
use?</p>
            <p>Christ did minister the Sacrament of his body and bloud to
his Disciples, sitting at the Table. When the time was now
come (sayth Luke) Jesus sate downe, and his 12. Disciples
with him. Luc. 22.</p>
            <p>The Massemonger, delivered the bread and wine to his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1659:93"/>
geates kneeling before the Altar. In distributing the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of his body &amp; bloud, Christ the Lord used not an Altar
after the manner of Aarons Preistes, whom the Law of Moses
appointed to kill and offer beastes, but he used a Table, as a
furniture, much more meet to gett, defend, confirme, encrease
and continue Frendship.</p>
            <p>But the Massemonger as one alwayes desirous to shed
bloud, standeth at an Altar, and so delivereth the Communion
to his people: when as the Apostle speaking of the Holy ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
maketh mention not of an Altar, but of a Table, saying,
1. Cor. 10. Ye cannot be partakers of the Lordes Table, &amp; of
the Table of the Devills.</p>
            <p>Neither did the ancient &amp; old Church of Christ alow these
Aaronicall and Jewish Altars. For they used a Table in the
administration of the Lords Supper, after the example of
Christ, as it plainly appeareth both by the Holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Altares.</note> &amp;
also by the writings of the auncient Fathers and Doctors.</p>
            <p>For the Sacrifices taken away, to what use, I pray yow
should Altars serve among the Christians? except ye will call
againe, and bring in use the Jewish or rather Idolatrous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
            <p>Truly Altars serve rather for the killing of beastes, then
for the distribution of the pledges of amity or Freindship;<note place="margin">Note.</note>
neither doe those Altars more agree with the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,<note place="margin">Exod. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then the cawdron, the fyrepanne, the basen, the sholve,
the fleshhoke, the gredyrne, and such like instruments, which
the Preistes of Aaron used in preparing, dressing, and doing
their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>For unto the Honest, seemly &amp; worthy celebration of the
Holy banket, of the body and bloud of Christ, we have need
not of an Altar, but of a Table, except ye will say, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
Church,<note place="margin">When Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars came first into the Church</note> which more then two hundred yeares after
Christes ascension used Tables at the Celebration of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
mysteries: yea except ye will say that Christ himselfe the
Author of this most Holy Supper, did dote &amp; was out of his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1659:94"/>
witts, which not standing at an Altar, like Aarons Preist, but
sitting at a Table, as a Minister of the New Testament did
both ordaine and minister this Holy &amp; Heavenly food.</p>
            <p>For who is so rude &amp; ignorant of antiquities, which kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not, that Pope Sixtus the second, about the yeare of our
Lord 265. brought in the Altars first of all in the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
Tables any more to be used from thenceforth at the
ministration of the Lords Supper; when notwithstanding
from Christes ascension unto that time, the Lords Supper was
alway ministred at a Table, according to the practise of Christ
of his Apostles, and of the Primative Church? But there is
but one only Altar of the Christians even Jesus Christ, the
Sonne of God, and of the virgine Mary, of whom the Apostle
speaketh on this manner, Heb. 13, <hi>We have an Altar, whereof
it is not Lawfull for them to eate, which serve in the Tabernacle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Altar is not of stone, but of God. Not Worldly, but
Heavenly, not visible, but invisible. Not dead, but living;
upon the which Altar whatsoever is offred unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it can none otherwise be, but most thankfully and most
acceptable.</p>
            <p>And like as Christ administring the most Holy mysteries of
his body &amp; blood to his Disciples, sat downe at the Table.
So likewise his Giustes, that is so say his Apostles, sitting at
the same Table receaved that Heavenly food sitting.</p>
            <p>But the Massemonger delivereth not the Sacramentall
bread unto the Communicants except, they first of all kneele
downe with great humility &amp; reverence, that they may, by
this their gesture declare &amp; shew evidently to such as are
present, that they worship &amp; honour that bread for a God:
which is so great &amp; so notable wickednesse as none can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
when it is plaine &amp; evident by the ancient writers, that
the Geastes of the Lords Supper long and many yeares after
Christes resurrection sat at the Table.</p>
            <p>So farre is it of, that they either after the manner of the
Jewes stood right up: or after the custome of the Papists
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1659:94"/>
kneeled, when they should receave the Holy mysteries of the
body &amp; blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So in his</hi> Cathechisme f. 484. <hi>To the same purpose he proceeds
thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>What thinkest, thou, is it more meet to receave the
Supper of the Lord at a Table,<note place="margin">A Table more meet for the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper, then an Altar.</note> or at an Altar?</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Sonne.</speaker>
               <p>At a Table.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sonne.</speaker>
               <p>For our Saviour Christ did both institute this Holy
Supper at a Table, and the Apostles of Christ also did receive
it at a Table.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>And what can be more perfect then that, which Christ and
his Apostles have done.</p>
            <p>All the primative Church also received the Supper of the
Lord at a Table.</p>
            <p>And S. Paul 1. Cor. 10. speaking of the Lords Supper, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention not of an Altar, but of a Table. Ye can not be
partakers, sayth he, of the Lordes Tables, and of the Devills
also.</p>
            <p>Tables for the ministration of the Lords Supper continued
in the Church of Christ, almost 300. years after Christ uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally,
and in some places longer, as Histories make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So that the use of Altars is but a new invention, and
brought in, as some write, by Pope Sixtus the second of that
name.</p>
            <p>Moreover an Altar hath relation to a Sacrifice. And Altars
were built and set up at the Commandement of God, to offer
Sacrifice upon them. But all those<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Sacrifices doe now
cease, (for they were but shadowes of things to come) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Altar ought to cease with them.</p>
            <p>Christ alone is our Altar, our Sacrifice &amp; our Preist. Our
Altar is in Heaven, Our Altar is not made of stone, but of
flesh &amp; blood: of whom the Apostle writes thus Heb. 13.
We have an Altar, whereof it is not Lawfull for them to eat
which serve the Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1659:95"/>Furthermore the Papists have greatly abused their Altars,
while they had such confidence in them, that without an
Altar, or in the stead thereof, a Super-altare, they were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that they could, not duely &amp; truly, and in right forme
minister the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ.</p>
            <p>And this their Altar and Superaltar, likewise must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate,
have prints and charactes made therein, washed with
oyle, wine and water, be covered with a cloth of hayer, and
be garnished with fine white linnen clothes &amp; other costly
apparell, or els whatsoever was done thereon, was counted
vaine &amp; unprofitable.</p>
            <p>The use also of Altars hath greatly confirmed &amp; maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the most wicked error and damnable heresie, which the
Papistes hold, concerning the Sacrifice of the Masse; while
they teach, that they offer Christ in their Masse to God the
Father, an oblation and Sacrifice for the sinnes of the people
both of the living and of the dead, and by this meanes they
greatly obscure and deface that most sweetsmelling &amp; alone
true perfect and sufficient Sacrifice of Christes death.</p>
            <p>And therfore all the Altars of the Papists ought now no lesse
to be throwen downe, and cast out of the Temples of the
Christians, then in times past the Altars of the Preistes of
Baal.</p>
            <p>So far is it of that they be meet to be used, at the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lords Supper. Finally, who knoweth not that
we come unto the Lords Table, not to offer bloody Sacrifices,
to the preformance whereof we had need of Altars, but to
eate and drinke, and spiritually to feed upon him that was
once crucified and offred up for us on the Altar of the crosse,
a sweet smelling sacrifice to God the Father, yea and that once
for all.</p>
            <p>Now if we come together to eate and drinke these Holy
mysteties, &amp; so spiritually to eate Christes body and to drinke
his blood unto salvation both of our bodies &amp; soules, who
seeth not, that a Table is more meet for the celebration of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1659:95"/>
Lords Supper, then an Altar.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>Thy reasons are good
and not to be discommended.<note place="margin">Of gestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to be used at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> But what sayest thou concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the gestures to be used at the Lords Table? Shall we
receave those Holy mysteries, kneeling, standing or sitting?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sonne,</speaker>
               <p>Albeit I know &amp; confesse, that gestures of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
be indifferent, yet I would wish all such gestures to be
avoyded, as have outwardly any appearance of evill, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this saying of S. Paul 1. Thess. 5. Abstaine from all
evill apparaunce.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>And first of all,<note place="margin">Of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> forasmuch as kneeling hath been long used
in the Church of Christ, at the receiving of the Sacrament,
thorow the doctrine of the Papistes, although of it selfe, it be
indifferent, to be, or not to be used, yet would I wish, that it
were taken away by the authority of the hier powers.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sonne.</speaker>
               <p>For it hath an outward appearaunce of evill. When
the Papist thorow their pestilent perswasions had made of the
Sacramentall bread and wine a God, then gave they in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
streight wayes, that all people should with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
kneele unto it, worship &amp; honour it.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>And by this meanes this gesture of kneeling creept in, and
is yet used in the Church of the Papistes, to declare that they
worship the Sacrament, as their Lord God and Saviour.
(Whence M. Roger Cutchud. in his 1. &amp; 2. Sermon of the
Sacrament An. 1552. printed Cum Privilegio, Anno 1560.
<hi>writes:</hi>) Many comming to the Lords Table, doe misbehave
themselves, &amp; so doe the lookers on, in that they worship the
Sacrament with kneeling &amp; bowing their bodies, &amp; knocking
their breasts, &amp; with Elevation of their hands. If it were to
be elevated &amp; served to the standers by, as it hath beene used,
Christ would have elevated it above his head. He delivered
it into the hands of his Disciples; bidding them to eate it, &amp;
not to hold up their hands to receive it, &amp; not to worship it:
&amp; so delivered it to them SITTING, &amp; not kneeling: Only
God is to be so honered with this kinde of reverence, &amp; no
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1659:96"/>
Sacrament: for God is not a Sacrament, neither is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
God. Let us use it as Christ and his Apostles did. If
thou wilt be more devout, then they were, be not deceived,
but beware that thy devotion be not Idolatrie.)</p>
            <p>But I would wish with all my heart, that either this knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at the receiving of the Sacrament, were taken away, or
els that the people were taught, that that outward reverence
was not given to the Sacrament and outward signe, but to
Christ, which is represented by that Sacrament or signe.</p>
            <p>But the most certaine &amp; sure way is utterly to cease from
kneeling, that there may outwardly appeare no kind of evill,
according to this Commaundment of S. Paule 1. Thess. 5. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine
from all evill appearaunce:</hi> Lest the enemies by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of kneeling should be confirmed in their error, and
the weaklings offended, and plucked backe from the truth of
the Gospell. Kneeling with the knowledge of godly honour
is due to none but to God alone. Therfore when Satan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
our Saviour Christ to kneele downe before him &amp;
worship him: He answered, <hi>It is writen; thou shalt worship the
Lord,</hi> Math. 4.</p>
            <p>Standing,<note place="margin">Of stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note>
which is used in the most part of the reformed
Churches in these our dayes, I can right well allow it, if it be
appointed by common order, to be used at the receaving of
the Holy Communion.</p>
            <p>And this gesture of standing was also used at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment
of God of the old Jewes, Exod. 12. when they
did eate the Paschall Lambe, which was also a Sacrament and
figure of Christ to come, as our Sacrament is a signe &amp; figure
of Christ come and gone. Neither did that gesture want his
mysteries.</p>
            <p>For the standing of the Jewes at the eating of the Lords
Passeover, signified that they had a further journey to goe in
matters of Religion, and that there was a more cleare light

them, which were wrapped round about with the darke sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1659:96"/>
of ceremonies: againe that other, yea and these more
perfect Sacraments, were to, be given to Gods people, which
all things were fulfilled and came to passe under Christ, the
authour of the Heavenly doctrine of the Gospell, and the
institutor of the Holy Sacramentes, Baptisme and the Lords
Supper.</p>
            <p>Now as concerning sitting at the Lords Table,<note place="margin">Of sitting.</note> which is
also used at this day in certayne reformed Churches, if it were
received by publique authority and common consent, and
might conveniently be used in our Churches; I could alow
that gesture best.</p>
            <p>For as<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> it is be doubted, but that Christ and his Disciples
sate at the Table, when Christ delivered unto them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his body and bloud: which use was also observed
in the primative Church, and long after.</p>
            <p>So likewise it is most Commonly, that we Christians
follow the example of our M. Christ, and of his Disciples.
Nothing can be unreverently done, that is done of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Christ &amp; of his Apostles. We come together to eate
and drinke the Holy mysteries of the body and bloud of
Christ; we have a Table set before us, is it not meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
that we sitte at our Table?</p>
            <p>The Table being prepared who standeth at his meat? yea
rather who sitteth not downe? when Christ feed the people,
he bad them not kneele downe, nor stand upon their feet, but
he commaunded them to sit downe, John 6. which kind of
gesture is most meet when we assemble to eate and drinke,
which thing we doe at the Lords-Table. Neither doth the
sitting of the Communicants at the Lords Table want her
mystery.</p>
            <p>For as the standing of the Jewes at the eating of the Lords
Passeover signified, that there was yet to come another do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
then the Law of Moses, even the preaching of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Gospell of our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesu: &amp; other
Sacraments then Circumcision and the Passeover, even the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1659:97"/>
Sacraments of Baptisme and the Lords Supper. So in like
manner the sitting of the Christen Communicants at the Lords
Table doth signifie, preach and declare unto us, that we are
come to our journeyes end concerning Religion, &amp; that there
is none other doctrine, nor none other Sacraments to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for, then those only, which we have already receaved of
Christ the Lord.</p>
            <p>And therfore we sitting downe at the Lords Table shew by
that our gesture, that we are come to the perfection of our
Religion, and looke for none other doctrine to be given unto
us: Notwithstanding as I sayd before, gestures are free, so
that none occasion of evill be either done or offred.</p>
            <p>In all things which we call indifferent; this rule of S. Paul
1. Thess. 5. is diligently to be obeyed: Abstayne from all evill
apparaunce.</p>

               <p>When our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Sacrament of his body &amp; blood to his disciples, he
used none other but his owne Commone &amp; dayly apparell:
&amp; so likewise did the Apostles after him, and the primative
Church likewise used that order, &amp; so was it continued many
yeares after, tyll superstition began to creep into the Church.
After that time, fonde, foolysh fansye of mans idle brayne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vysed
without the authority of Gods word, that the Minister
in the divine service, and in the ministration of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
should use a white linnen vesture, which we now
commonly call a Surplesse.<note place="margin">Surplesse.</note>

            <p>Untill this tyme the Church of God continued in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity

of Christ &amp; of his Apostles, requiring no paynted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores
to set forth the glory &amp; beauty of our Religion: which
is then most glorious, and most beautifull; when it is most
simple, &amp; none otherwise setforth, then it was used and left
unto us of Christ, &amp; of his Apostles.</p>
            <p>And contrarywise it is then most obscured &amp; defaced, when
it is dawbed over with the vile &amp; vayne colours of mans
wisdome, although outwardly never so gorgious and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>Afterward as superstition grew and encreased, so likewise
the people began more and more to be liberall in giving to
the Church, and in adourning, decking &amp; trimming the
Temples of the Christians, yea &amp; that so much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were now perswaded, that such Temples, and will

            <p>By this meanes came it to passe, that the simple and plaine
Tables, which were used in the Apostolike and Primative
Church, were taken away, and standing Altars set up, and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously
decked with sumptuous apparell, &amp; garnished
with gold, pearle, &amp; precyous stone. And because that he,

            <p>Reverend M. Alexander Nowell, in his Reprofe of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
profe, printed at London Cum privilegio Anno 1565.
fol. 15. 16. 17. &amp; 66. <hi>writes thus:</hi> Touching the name of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
which M. Dorman so gladly catcheth hold of here is
S. Basill (as he did before in S. Cyprian lib. 3. Epist. 9.) where
we call it the Lords Table, we have for us good authority.</p>
            <p>First, that Christ instituted the Sacrament at a Table, and
not at an Altar, is most manifest: except M. Dorman would
have us thinke, that men had Altars in steed of Tables, in their
private houses in those dayes, but our Saviour expressely
saying, that the handes of him, who should betray him, were
upon the Table, taketh away all doubting. Luc. 22. c. 21.</p>
            <p>And S. Paule 1. Cor. 10. v. 21. also calleth it Mensam Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicam,
the Lord his Table.</p>
            <p>Sure I am that M. Dorman, &amp; all the Papists with him, can
not say so much out of the Scriptures of the new Testament,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1659:98"/>
for their Altars, as I have alledged for the Lords Table, they
may goe therfore &amp; joyne themselves to the Jewes, as in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Jewish ceremonies, so in Altars also; as it seemeth
indeed, they would both become themselves, and make us too
Jewes, rather then Christians.</p>
            <p>If S. Basill, &amp; some old writers call it an Altar, that is no
proper, but a figurative name, for that as in the old Law their
burnt offrings &amp; Sacrifices were offred upon the Altar, so are
our Sacrifices of prayer, and thankgiving &amp;c. offred up to
God at the Lords Table, at it were an Altar.</p>
            <p>But such kind of figurative speech, can be no just cause, to
set up Altars, rather then Tables, unlesse they think that their
crosses also should be turned into Altars, for that like phrase
is used of them, where it is sayed, Christ offred up himselfe
upon the Altar of the Crosse.</p>
            <p>Now the old<note n="*" place="margin">Chrysost. Hom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

truly, without figure, and agreably to the Scriptures. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the spirituall worship or service of God, or Sacrifice,
if yow will (seeing it is also mentioned in S. Basill) due to be
done at the Lords Table, which, as a fore is noted, he calleth
an Altar, it is not lacking in our Churches at the Lords Table:
that is to say, true repentaunce of heart, which is as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
calleth it, Psal. 51. v. 19. a service &amp; a Sacrifice pleasaunt
unto God, the offering up of our prayers &amp; prayses unto God;
which service and Sacrifice of prayse, as the Psal. withnesseth,
Psa. 50. c. 14. v. 23. doth honour God; &amp; specially that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of thankes giving, most peculiar to this Altar or Lords
Table, and to that Holy Sacrament, having thereof a peculiar
name, being called with the Greekes <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> to say, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
giving, for the gratefull remembraunce of that one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
offered by our Saviour once for all: which Sacrifice
of thanks giving we joyntly with other present, doe offer up
to Christ our Saviour, in the memoriall by him selfe, and by
faith in our heates doe communicate his precious body and
blood, a Sacrifice by him selfe offred for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:1659:99"/>
Neither are our oblations, or offrings to the poore lacking,
when we come to this Altar, which S. Paul Phil. 4. v. 18. also
calleth a Sacrifice acceptable, and pleasant to God, where as
yow Papists have no such thing, but only the bare word Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium,
without any offring for the poore; saving that yow
did not forget to receive the offrings for your selves at the
usuall offring dayes, and when any Dirige, or Monthes mind
did fall.</p>
            <p>Thus yow se, M. Dorman, that we have even that same
spirituall worship, service, and Sacrifice too (if yow so will)
due to be done at this Altar, that is to witt, the Lords Table,
which S. Paul speaketh of here, and any other Altar or service
he meaneth not, nor knew none.</p>
            <p>And were yow not altogether to grosse, S. Basill so oft spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of spirituall worshipping, and spirituall service, might
somewhat reforme your carnall and sensuall understanding?
yow se we doe not sticke to grant yow not only a spirituall
worship and service, but a Sacrifice too, which yet hath no
need of your Altars, framed to your selves, upon this false
phantasie, that the body and bloud of Christ are there offred
by the Preistes, for the quicke &amp; dead, with the abuse of that
distinction of the bloudy and unbloudy offering of Christs
body, applied to the same: which altogether is a false fable, &amp;
a vaine dreame most meet for M. Dorman.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures, Heb. 10. v. 10. 12. 14. &amp; 13. 11. 12. doe thus
teach us, that Christ our Saviour once for all offred up his
body and bloud upon the Altar of the Crosse, the one &amp; only
Sacrifice of sweet Saviour to his Father: by the which one
oblation of the body of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a Sacrifice for our sinnes, once
for ever offered, and no more to be offered by any man, we be
sanctified and made perfit.</p>
            <p>Wherfore the Popish Preistes, which doe repeate often
the Sacrifice of Christs death, as they doe teach, thereby, as
much as in them lieth, doe take away the efficacie and vertue
of the Sacrifice of Christes death, making it like to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1659:99"/>
Sacrifices of the old Law: the imperfection of which Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
S. Paul doth prove by the often repetition of the same.
For the continuance whereof their Preistes needed also suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession:
but Christ is a Preist for ever without succession, as
the Apostle Heb. 10. plainly teacheth.</p>
            <p>Our service and Sacrifice now, is the often and thankfull
remembraunce of that only Sacrifice, in the receiving of the
Holy Sacrament at the Lords Table, according to his owne
institution: <hi>Hoc facite in memoriam mei.</hi> Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of me: with spirituall feeding by faith also, upon that
his most precious body and bloud, so by him for us offered.
Touching the pulling downe of your Altars, I answer: they
are justly destroyed, as were those wicked Altars by Asa, Josa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,
Ezechias, Josias, godly Kings of Juda destroyed, 4. Reg.
18. c. 22. 4, Reg. 23. 2. Para. 14. a. 3. 2. Para. 17. b. 6.
2. Para. 31. a. 1. 2. Para. 34. a. 4.</p>
            <p>For as abominable Idolatrie was committed on, &amp; before
your Altars, as ever was upon, and before those.</p>
            <p>If yow require prouses hereof, you shall have them in their
due places of the Masse, &amp; of Idolatrie to Images, after which
he complaines thus of the Papists: also of Christians we have
made us Jewes, and your selves of Ministers of the Gosple
have yow made Jewish and Aaronicall Levites, yow have on
Aarons robes, yow use his gestures, yow have brought in his
incense, his censers, his Altars, his candles, his candlestickes,
his belles, and his banner, his gold and his silver into the

            <p>Of the which beginning of things, <hi>S. Hierome</hi>

            <p>But if the Magistrates by their lawfull authority, because
they see it agreeable to the word of God, doe piously and

            <p>If <hi>King Sebastian</hi> shall thinke meet to cherish and follow

what therfore? that which in the Carnall Law was lawfull
to the Kings of the Jewes, shall it be lesse lawfull to our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verners,

de tempore. And who shall warrant us that this Sermon is
not falsly intituled to S. Augustine (as a great number of
those Sermons are?) But admit it be Augustines owne aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
yet he speaketh only of consecrating of Altars, not for

Tables and Altars were dedicated to the Holy use of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
it is not the matter we stand upon, but whither they
were consecrated for this end.</p>
            <p>They were called Altars unproperly, as the Sacrament was
called a Sacrifice, the Ministers sacrificing Preists &amp; Levites,
yet were they neither in matter, for me nor use, like unto your
Popish Altars of stone, that were set against a wall. For they
were Tables of wood, and so commonly were called, as it is

Popish Altars that are set up to overthrow the Altar of the
Crosse, are not Holy but cursed. And so is all that pertaineth
to them. Neither have they perfection of the Lords Altar
that was in the Temple, which was a figure of Christs only
true Sacrifice once offered, &amp; that never can be sacrificed
againe, <hi>(as S. Augustine Sayth)</hi> Neither did the Altars of the
temple sanctifie by touching, for then the murtherer vvhich
tooke hold of the hornes of the Altar, should be sanctified,
whom God commaunded to be drawne from thence &amp; execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Exod. 21. 14. 1. Reg. 2. 28. Neither if any man had
offered any other gift, then that God which commaunded,
had the gift been made Holy by touching the Altar, for it was
the ordinance of God, by which the Altar sanctified the gift,
and not any quality in the Altar. It is like you are sicke of the
disease of the Pharisees, which was covetousnes, (as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome

the Altar how it vvas made for matter, height, length,
and breadth, the text is plaine in the 8. first verses.</p>
            <p>For the use of us we may note two things; First, that it
was a figure of Christ, as the Apostle to the Hebrewes expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it, And secondly, that the Altars used in Popery, are not
warranted by this example.</p>
            <p>But that the Primative Churches used Communion. Tables
(as we now doe) of boards and wood, not Altars (as they doe)
of stone.</p>
            <p>Origen was above two hundred yeares after Christ, &amp; he
sayth, that Celsus objected it as a fault to the Christians, <hi>Quod

            <p>

yow accuse us for that we have neither Churches, nor Altars,
nor Images. Gerson sayth, that Silvester the first caused
stone Altars to be made, and willed that no man should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
at a wooden Altar, but himselfe and his successors
there. Belike then the former ages knew not profound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that Altars must be of stone, <hi>quia Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Rocke was Christ, as <hi>Durandus</hi> after devised. Upon
this occasion in some places stone Altars were used for sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
and continuance, wooden Tables having been before
used, but I say in some places, not in all.</p>
            <p>For <hi>S. Augustine</hi> sayth, that in his time in Africa they were
made of wood. For the Donatists, sayth he, breake in sunder
the Altar-boords, Again, the Deacons duty was to remove

<hi>mensam ligneam,</hi> the Table of wood.</p>
            <p>Yet was this Communion Table called an Altar, not that
it was so, but only by <hi>allusion metaphorically,</hi> as Christ is called
an Altar, or our hearts be called Altars, &amp;c. Marke with your
selfe therfore the newnesse of this point, for stone Altars in
comparison of our ancient use of Communion Tables, and let
Popery and his parts fall, and truth &amp; sound antiquity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p>Touching the hornes of the Altar spoken of, they litterally
served to keep up the Sacrifice from falling of, &amp; figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely
noted strength, so that, to bind the Sacrifice to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Altar, was to give themselves wholly with a strong
Faith, and only to rest, &amp; trust and stay upon him, and to tye
all carnall affections fast also to the Altars Hornes, by subduing
and making them captive to God. This Altar was in one
place, and the Sacrifice in one place, nothing how Christ should
only once, and in one place offer up himselfe for all man kind.
Concerning the Lampes, as little doe they warrant Popish
Altars, And Christians used no such follies &amp; apish imitations
of things abrogated &amp; serving only for the time.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Altars under the Law were Holy, because they were buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the foundation of Gods institution. Now they are
prophane, not only because they have no institution of God,
whereupon a stone may be layd, but because they are contrary
to the institution which propoundeth a Table, Luke 22. 21.
1. Cor. 10. 21. 1. Cor. 11. 20. Math. 26. 20. 26. 27. and
(in the matter of the Eucharist) never mentioneth Altar:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1659:102"/>
which is confirmed further, in that this Sacrament is called in
the Scripture the Supper of the Lord, (whereunto a Table
doth well agree) &amp; is never termed a Sacrifice, for which an
Altar is fit. That it is sayd, they sat downe, a thing used at a
table, &amp; strang at an Altar, whereat they sat not but stood: that
they did eat &amp; drinke which was never used at an Altar, and
is usuall at a table.</p>
            <p>For although they did eate of that which came from the
Altar, yet they never did eate at it. And if your Masonrie
of Altars came from the Lords ordination under the Law,
why should our table be prophane, or your Altar Holy, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that even under the Law, there was as well a Holy
table, as an Holy Altar.</p>
            <p>And (setting apart the example of Christ) by so much the
table is fitter now then the Altar: as the shew-bread standing
upon the table, hath a nearer Analogie with the bread of the

they take away from yow, calling that whereupon the Holy

they call by their proper names, of signes &amp; Sacraments,
and not by the improper and borrowed speech of Sacrifice or

they doe the bread) so they will transubstantiate the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
of beastes into the body of Christ, not then borne, when
those things were layd upon the Altar.</p>
            <p>Neither hath Augustines Serm. de tempo. 115. any thing
thereof: it hath of the keeping of the Feast of Hallowing of
Altars, which we suppose your selves doe not observe, whereby
it may well be doubted (as of divers others of those Sermons)

shewes himselfe a very <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in the quotations, If not a Papist
in his expositions of both these Texts, which it seemes he never looked

sence and meaning.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>I answer, that it is most cleare, that the first Text of the two,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1659:104"/>
namly,</hi> 1. Cor. 9. 13. Doe ye not know, that they which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
about holy things live of the things of the Temple, and

partakers with the Altar; <hi>is meant only of the Aaronicall Preistes,
Levites and Iewish Altars, not of Christs, Ministers and Lords
Tables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Because the <hi>things of the Temples and Altars,</hi> (which
were placed in the body or Court of the <hi>Jewish temple,</hi> there beeing
no Altar in any of the <hi>Synagoges</hi>) are here coupl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d together, and
the Text of <hi>Deut. 18. 1. quoted to it in the margent of our last
translated English Bibles,</hi> of purpose to confute this <hi>blind Doctor,</hi>
&amp; instruct all men, that this Text is meant of the Aaronicall Preist
&amp; Levites under the Law, not of the Ministers under the Gosple,
as all Expositors whatsoever, both old and new interpret it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Because, the Apostle expresly resolves it so past all dispute,
in the next ensuing words</hi> v. 14. Even so hath the Lord ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that they which preach the Gosple,<note n="*" place="margin">See Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury his Batery of the Popes Batter.</note> 
               <hi>where he puts the</hi>
Preachers and Preaching of the Gosple, and the living by it,
<hi>in direct opposition &amp; contradistinction to</hi> the Preistes &amp; Levites
ministring about Holy things in the Temple, and living of
the Temple; serving at the Altar, and partaking with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
to preaching of the Gosple, and living by it; <hi>drawing an
argument by way of equity from one to the other, in this manner;</hi>
The Preist and Levites under the Law, which minister about
Holy things live of the things of the Temple, and those that
wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar, <hi>&amp; that by</hi> Gods
ordination.</p>
            <p>Therfore by the selfesame reason <hi>hath the Lord ordained, that
the Ministers of the Gosple, who preach the Gosple,</hi> (not those
who seldome or never preach, as our great Prelates doe) <hi>should live
of the Gosple.</hi> So that if we interpret this Text, as this <hi>novell
Doctor</hi> hath done, we shall quite overturne the Apostles argument
&amp; similitude, and make it a meere nonsence Tantalogie, such as his

3. <hi>To that of</hi> Heb, 13. 10. We have an Altar, <hi>it is true that
the</hi> Bishop of Chichester, <hi>heretofore in his</hi> Conference with
<note n="*" place="margin">Fox Acts &amp; monum, p. 1806.</note> Richard Woodman Martyr, <hi>alleaged this very Text,</hi> to prove
the Popish Sacrament of the Altar, and that it is meant of
their Popish Altars, whereon their Sacrifice of the Masse is
offred, and the Rhemists in their Notes on Heb. 13. sect. 6.
<hi>conclude thus:</hi> This Altar (sayth Isychius) is the Altar of Christs
body, which the Jewes for their incredulity must not behold:
1. 6. c. 21. in Levit.</p>
            <p>And the Greeke word (as also the Hebrew answering
thereunto in the Old Testament) signifieth properly an Altar
to sacrifice on, and not a metaphoricall and spirituall Altar.
Whereby we prove against the Heretickes, that we have not
a Common table or prophane Communion boord to eate
meere bread upon, but a very Altar in the proper sense, to
sacrifice Christs body upon: and so called of the Fathers in

               <hi>All the Fathers and ancients on this Text that I have seene;

            <p>But if Christ be the Altar here, and that without doubt,
not withstanding that he is not here expresly sayd to be, why
should not he so be also in Heb. 13. 10. where the name of
Altar is more directly applied to him? why was it there an
Altar of stone; which is here of flesh? there in proper speech
an Altar, which is here but a borrowed speech? Verily there
can be no other reason why that Altar was of stone, but that
the Jesuites, which out of that place framed it, either for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of understanding to conceive the truth, or for hardnes
of heart to yeeld unto it, were heavier and harder then the
very stones themselves, whereof they would have the Altar.
And where in disagreeing themselves, they agree with the
truth: so in that which followeth: Christ is the Altar as he is
man, they are as farre from the truth, as they are neere &amp; like
unto themselves; especially if they meane he is the Altar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Manhood alone: for when his Manhood, being
the Sacrifice, was sanctified by Christ, which is the Altar:
and the thing which sanctifieth, is of a Higher nature then
that which is sanctified by it, Math. 23. 19. Heb, 7. 7. it must
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1659:106"/>
needes follow, that our Saviour Christ must be considered in

               <note n="1" place="margin">William Salisbury.</note> 
               <hi>by</hi> William Salisbury his Battery of the Popes Bater,
printed at London Cum Privilegio Anno 1550. But now
<hi>(writes he)</hi> are we set upon to batter, and beate downe the head
corner stone of their Popish Batereulx: we will first declare
yet one grammer terme more, for the unlearned sake, which
though it be no high point of Divinity, neverthelesse who so
hath not the knowledge thereof, his Divinity is but humanity
or rather carnality then true knowledge in divine matters.
And so the grammarians call it a speach spoken by a figure
called <hi>Metonymia,</hi> when the thing conteyned is ment by the
name of the thing that conteyneth it. As when he say, reach
hither the Cupp, meaning to have the drinke conteyned in the
Cuppe.</p>
            <p>This figurative speech used Christ himselfe, when he sayd
Luke 22. This Cupp is the New Testament in my bloud:
where he ment of the wine, and not of the Cup.</p>
            <p>And likewise Matthew 23. where he speaketh by the name
of the Citty unto them, that dwelled in the Citty, saying,
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that stayest the Prophetes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such manner of speach is also much used in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as Esay 1. Heare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in an other place, Howle ye ships of Tharsis. And so
the Papistes must either grant that, that kind of speech is used
in the text, that we shall anone rehearse hereafter, ior els must
they grant, that the Jewes, (whose Altars or rather Sacrifices
and forbidden meate, the writer of the Epistle alludeth unto)
were wont to eate up their Altars being made of stones. And
that were hard meat indeed; yea that were meate alone for
<note n="*" place="margin">Ostrich is a beast that swalloweth gaddes of stele &amp; digesteth them.</note> Ostriches? yea or rather stone meat were more meet for such
as have stony heartes, as have all Papisticall Doct. who against
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1659:106"/>
their conscience, knowledge and learning, and being all desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the spirit of God, cry &amp; shout for the defence of their
welbeloved Altars, <hi>Habemus Altars, Habemus Altare, Habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Altare;</hi> yea &amp; I may tell yow this <hi>Habemus Altare,</hi> is their
judgeling tricke, wherby they doe juggle unto the unlearned,
it is all their Tabernacle, &amp; only refuge against all tempestes,
and this is as well their shote anker, as their halow at their
hosing up of their ankor. But to hale in my saile and to land
at the proposed haven.</p>
            <p>The English text of <hi>Habemus Altare</hi> written, Hebrew 13.
<hi>is this:</hi> Be not carried about with diverse and strang lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings:
for it is a good thing, that the heart be established
with grace, and not with meates, which have not prosited
them that have had their pastime in them. We have an Altar,
of the which they have no power to eat, which serve in the
Tabernacle, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here he doeth in a manner make a breife rehearsall of all
the cheifest matters that he entreated of before, adding
thereto diverse Godly sentences to persuade the Hebrewes to
abide in this learning: Inducing them also, by alluding unto
their Law being but a shadow to cleave unto the Gosple, and
to let goe the shadow.</p>
            <p>And therfore he sayth thus unto them: And as you had
certaine Sacrifices offred on the Altars, whereof it was not
Lawfull even for the very offerers to eat: so likewise have
we a sacrifice once offred upon the altar of the Crosse, whereof
it is not Lawfull for as many of yow as be yet duskened with
the shadow of the Law to eate, nor to be partakers of it at
all.</p>
            <p>Now therfore must the Papists be thought not only to be
of too childish a witt, and of no understanding, but rather fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and mad, if they continue to prove their stony altars by
this text.</p>
            <p>And therfore would I think it an exceeding good deed
for such as injoy their right witt to pick out from amongst
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1659:107"/>
themselves as many as are vexed with the spirit of the sayd
kind of phrenesy, and send them to Bedlem, or to their owne
City of Rome. For els they shall still infect other, &amp; doe more
hurt then every man is ware of.</p>
            <p>At the last to draw to an end in this matter; where this
word Altar is read in the 6. 8. &amp; 11. Chapters of the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of S. John: if altar in those places, admitting the like
trope and figurative speech, do not signifie Christ also (God
knoweth, it signifieth nothing lesse then the confirmation of
such altars as the Pope hath filled every corner of Christs
Church with all.</p>
            <p>And if the Papistes (after that all the Testimonies, as well
of the Old &amp; the New Testament have fayled them) goe
about to wrest the saying of the old Doctours, for the stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of their altars, they shall get nothing therby, but still
utter their owne grosse ignorance, or their perverse blindnes,
For whereso ever the old Catholike Doctours, used this word
altar for the Lords Table, then alluded they unto the Jewes
Altar, &amp; ment thereby the Crosse which served as an altar to
offer upon the Sacrifice of Christes naturall body.</p>
            <p>And forsorh, ye Papisticall Preistes, as many of yow as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Latine, and marked what yow read, (and if yee
had been<note n="*" place="margin">The Bee gathereth hony on the same flour, that the Spider gathereth poyson.</note> Bees &amp; not Spiders) yow might have gathered
the nature of this manner of allusion or resemblance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
Crosse unto the altars of the Jewes, even out of your
owne poysoned Masse.</p>
            <p>For doe you not remember how ye mumbled (how ye redd
I would say) in a certaine rime of your sayd hotch potch, which
began: <hi>Laudes crucis extollamus, nos qui crucis exultamus, &amp;c,

prove that Christ is the true Altar, whereon every Christian

               <p>First wheresoever the people are gathered together in
Christs name, there is he in the middest; and where he is there
is the Altar, so that we may be bold to come and offer our
gift, if we be in love and charity: if we be not, we must leave
there our offring, and goe first and be reconciled to our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and agree with him quickly, and so forth, and then come
&amp; offer the gift.</p>
               <p>Some will say, how shall I agree with my adversary, when
he is not nigh by a hundred miles? may I not pray till I have
spoken with him? To all such I answer: if yow presume to

agree with thy adversary; that is make thy life agreeable to

               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1659:109"/>
Then all such may be bold to come and offer their gift,
their prayer on the Altar, where the people of God be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together: Thus have I shewed yow my mind, both of the
Altar, and of the offering, as I understand it.</p>

all things, and other men nothing. Heare me: I
will shew yow the true understanding, both of the Altar, and
the offring on the Altar. We have an Altar (sayd Paul) that
yee may not eat of. Meaning thereby, that no man might eate
of that which was offered on the Altar, but the Preist.</p>
               <p>For in Paules time all the living that the Preist had, the
people came &amp; offered it on the Altar, mony or other things:
and when the people came to offer it, and then remembred,
that they had any thing against their brother, then they left
their offring upon the Altar, and went and were reconciled to
their brother: and they came againe and offered their gift,
and the Preist had it. This is the true understanding of the
place that yow have rehearsed: wherfore yow be deceived.</p>

               <p>My Lord, that was the use in the old Law. Christ
was the end of that. But indeed I perceive by Paules words,
the Sacrifice was offered in Paules time: yet that maketh

<hi>doth thus expound this Text:</hi> The Apostle speaketh expresly of
partipation of the Sacrifice of Christes death, as it is manifest
in the two verses next following, which is by Christian faith,
and not in the Sacrament only, whereof none can be partakers
that remaine in the Ceremoniall observation of the Leviticall
Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Therfore this place is brutishly abused, to prove that the
Christians have a materiall Altar, as the Papists have many.
The Apostle meaneth, Christ to be the Altar, &amp; not the Table
whereon the Lordes Supper is ministred, which is called an
Altar, but unproperly, as the Sacrament is called a Sacrifice.
For he saith, We have an Altar, which is but one, where as
the Popish Altars and Communion Tables are many.</p>
            <p>But Isychius sayth, This Altar is the Altar of Christes body;
ye abuse Isychius, for he sayth that the Altar is the body of
Christ it selfe. Such an one sayth he, may not come, neither
to the vaile nor to the Altar; that is, to the body of Christ, to
doe the ministery thereof.</p>
            <p>For that hath Paul, writing to the Hebrewes, taught to be
the vaile and the Altar.</p>

               </gap>. c. 4. Know thou that S. Paul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth,
that the intelligible Altar is the Lords Body, for
he sayth, we have an Altar, whereof they have no power to
eate, which serve the Tabernacle, namely, the body of Christ.
For it is not Lawfull for the Jewes to eate of it. This Altar
of necessity is in the entrance of the Tabernacle of witnesse;
that is in the entrance of the heavens, because we have entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
into the Heavens with him.</p>
            <p>It is manifest therfore, that Hesychius meaneth not the
Ppish Altars, but the body of Christ in Heaven, the mystery
whereof is celebrated on the Lords Table; which of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers is called indifferently a Table, as it is indeed,
and an Altar, as it is unproperly.</p>

But that it is called of them a Table, and was indeed a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
made of boardes, &amp; removeable, set in the midst of the
people, not placed against a wall, I have shewed sufficiently,
by the Testimonies of the ancient Fathers before.</p>

exhorting them to seek establishment of their hearts in
the grace which was brought unto them in the Gospell, &amp; not
in the discretion of meates, alleadgeth this for profe, that even
as those which seryed the Tabernacle, were not partakers by
eating of those beasts, whose blood being brought into the holy
place, their bodies were burnt without the campe.</p>
            <p>Even so, those which holding fast the Ceremonies of the

of our Saviour Christ, who suffered out of the gates of
Jerusalem, and is the truth of the shadowes &amp; figures, which
were burnt without the camp.</p>
            <p>This being the very naturall meaning of the Text, let the
Reader observe, how not childishly only, but absurdly also, the
Jesui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es apply this place to prove a Reall Altar, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a Sacrifice of Christ in the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper.</p>
            <p>For first, what is that which the Jewes are threatned to be
deprived of the eating of.</p>
            <p>If the Jesuites will answer according to their drift heere of,
proving an Altar of stone, and not a Communion Table, they
must say that for reward of their obstinate cleaving to the
Ceremonies of the Law, they shall not eat stones, a small pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for so great a finne, which if the Jesuites were put
unto, they would (I thinke) cry for a Communion Table, as
of some better digestion then the Popish Altar: whereby it is
evident how sottish it is which they straine so much at, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the proper signification of the Greeke word, and the
Hebrew answering there unto: which as if those words which
properly signifie one thing, cannot by borrowed speech signifie
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1659:110"/>
another thing unproperly. And as though they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that the word as properly signifieth a reall Sacrifice, as
this word signifieth an Altar, were not in this very Chapter
translated from the property of it to signifie a spirituall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
            <p>Wherfore by the Altar is meant our Saviour Christ, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
for that as he is the Preist and Sacrifice, so also he is the
Altar, which sanctified himselfe to be offered unto his Holy
Father, as the Altar did sanctifie the gift which was upon it,
And it is Christ, not sacrificed upon an Altar of stone, by a
Preist, but which offered himselfe upon Mount Calvary,
without the gates of Jerusalem, as is expresly mentioned here
in this place.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the writer to the Hebrewes meane Christ,
suffering in a Mysterie, but that oblation of himselfe which he
once offered, wherein the fire of Gods anger fed upon his
body and soule to have (as were the Sacrifices of beasts) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
them, if that his humanity had not been supported and
borne up by the eternall spirit of his God head, wherein he
offered himselfe unto his Holy Father.</p>
            <p>And Isychius l. 6. c. 21. in Lev. saying, that Christs body is
the Altar, confuteth you plainly, that hereof would ground an
Altar of stone: and saying, that the Jewes for their incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
must not behold him, he giveth you another blow, thereby
declaring that the eating of Christ is the beholding of him,
and not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arn all eating of him, or swallowing him downe
the throate, &amp; the beholding of Christ he placeth in the eye
of faith, which the incredulous Jewes wanting must not
behold him.</p>
            <p>What cursed spirits therfore are these, which upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of this place, making as much for their Altars as for
Baals, scoffe at the Holy Table of the Lord, in calling it a
common &amp; prophane board, which must needs (unlesse they
have heardned their faces to all impudency, grant that the first
and last time that ever our Saviour Christ ministred the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1659:111"/>
Eucharist in his owne person, did it at a Table, and not at an
Altar, and at the same Table also at which he eat his common
repast, which notwithstanding we doe not, nor (in the peace
and quiet of the Church) thinke meet to be done.</p>
            <p>But of this matter let the Reader see more before upon
1. Cor. 11. 29. where also he shall see how unworthily the
ancient Fathers are abused for maintenance of Massing Altars.
And let it be here observed how the evidence of the truth
presseth them, which are faine to confesse that the Fathers call
it as well a Table as an Altar, but say they that is unproperly
in respect of the heavenly food of Christs body and blood
received.</p>
            <p>And I pray you, what should let us to say, that when they
call it an Altar; they doe it unproperly, because of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Sacrifice of thankes giving, that is offered at it. Set aside
the truth of the cause triable by other reasons, what warrant
have you for your answer which we have not for ours.</p>
            <p>Nay we may much trulyer say it then you can; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
shewed it before will heere content our selves with one
place, and the same taken from your owne allegations.</p>
            <p>And from him who may well be in stead of all the rest, for
August. Epist. 86. speaking of that which under the Gospell
succeeded that under the Law saith thus: One Altar ought
to give place to another, sword to sword, fire to fire, bread
to bread, beast to beast, bloud to bloud: whereby the same
reason that the beast which is offered must needs be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
speech, and the fire that consumeth it a metaphoricall
fire: it followeth that the Altar, whereupon the beast is layd
and consumed must needs be an unproper speech.</p>
            <p>And indeed this unproperty of speech in the Altar is yet
further confirmed. When in the same place. Augustine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
to one as an Ignorance, that he understood not the
name of Altar to be more used in the vvriting of the Law &amp;
of the Prophets, then under the Gospell, but most evidently of
all, in that the proving, that there is mention of an Altar in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1659:111"/>
New Testament, alleadgeth the place in the Apocalipse, which
the Jesuites themselues interpret of our Saviour Christ. Yow
were heere also greatly over-seen to bring this place; seeing
he against whom this ignorance is objected, affirmed that in
stead of a beast, we have now bread in the Sacrament: and in
stead of blood we have the cup: where yow would beare the
world in hand, that Beringarius was the first that denied
Transubstantiation.</p>
            <p>And S. Augustine answering it, and affirming that bloud
succeeded to bloud, yet doth evidently declare, that he meant
a figurative and Sacramentall bloud, in that where the other
sayd, we have in stead of a beast, bread, Augustine answereth,
that as the Jewes had the presence bread, so we in the Supper
of the Lord, and when he sayth, that every one taketh a peece
of the Immaculate Lambe: it is evident that he meaneth by
the Lambe, the figure &amp; Sacrament of the Lambe, unlesse you
will dare to say, that our Saviour Christ in the Supper is cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
or broken in peeces: but as for your shift it is not so honest:
for presupposing (as you doe) that it is very bloud and raw
flesh, which is there received, the word of Table fitteth it not
so well, but rather the word of Altar ought to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
considering that men use not to bring any of these
dishes to their Tables, and yet were usually brought under
the Law to the Altar: which Altar if you be ashamed to build
up againe to have place meet for your Popish dishes, yow
shall repaire to the Butchers shamble or slaughter house,
where this Marchandise of yours is most saleable.</p>

               <p>Nay, the ancient Father Isichius expoundeth it of

meaning touching the Jewes and the Altar, Heb. 13. 11.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1659:112"/>
For (sayth he)</hi> the bodies of those beastes whose blood is brought
unto the Holy place by the High Preist for sinne, are burnt without
the camp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Therfore even Iesus that he might sanctifie the people
wish his owne blood, suffered without the gare.</p>
            <p>Which words are some what darke, but they will be plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
if we consider both the thing that the Apostle would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,
&amp; the reason by which he proveth it.</p>
            <p>The thing that he would prove, is, that the Iewes cannot
be partakers of the fruit of Christs death, &amp; the redemption
which he purchased with his pretious blood, if they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Ceremoniall worship of the Law of Moses.</p>
            <p>The reason by which he proveth it, is an ordinance of God
in a kind of Sacrifices appointed by the Law to be offered for
sinne, which Sacrifices shadowed Christ, &amp; taught this doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
Lev. 6. 16. &amp; 7. 6.</p>
            <p>For whereas the Preistes vvho served the Tabernacle in the
Ceremonies of the Law, Levit. 4. 3. &amp; 16. 17. had a part of
other Sacrifices &amp; offerings &amp; did eate of them, Lev. 6. 30.
there were certaine beasts commaunded to be offred for sinne
in speciall sort, &amp; their blood to be brought into the Holy
place, vvhose bodies might not be eaten, but must be burnt
vvithout the Campe.</p>
            <p>Now, by these Sacrifices offred so for sinne our only Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Sacrifice Iesus Christ vvas figured, Heb. 9. 12. vvho
entred by his blood into the Holy place, to clense us from all
sinne, 1. Iohn 1. 7. &amp; 2. 2. &amp; his body vvas crucified vvithout
the gate, Iohn 19. 20. that is, the Gate of the Citty of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:
&amp; they vvho keep the Preistly rites of Moses Law,
cannot eate of him, that by his death they may live, Iohn 6. 51.
for none shall live by him vvho seeke to be saved by the Law,
as it is vvritten, Gal. 5. 2. if ye be circumcised, Christ shall
profit you nothing.</p>
            <p>The Apostle therfore exhorting the Hebrewes, to stablish
their hearts vvith grace, that teacheth them to serve the Lord
in spirit &amp; truth after the Doctrine of the Gospell, not vvith

meates, that is to say, with the Ceremonies of the Law, a part
whereof was the difference between unclean &amp; clean in meats
doth move them to it with this reason, verse 10. that they
serve the Tabernacle and stick unto the Rites of the Jewish
Preist hood, their soules shall have no part of the food of our
Sacrifice, no fruit of Christes death, verse 11. For as the bodyes
of those beastes which are offred for sinne, &amp; their blood
brought into the Holy place by the High Preist, might not be
eaten by the Preistes, but were burnt without the campe: so
neither may the keepers of the Preistly Ceremonies have life
by feeding upon Christ, who (to show this mystery) did suffer
death without the Gate, when he shed his bloud to clense the
people from their sinne. verse 12.</p>
            <p>And thus it appeareth by the Text itselfe, that the name of
Altar betokneth the Sacrifice, that is to say, Christ crucified;
not as his death is shewed forth in the Sacrament, but as he
did suffer death without the gate.</p>
            <p>Whereby you may perceive first, the folly of your Rhemists,
about the Greeke word, (is also the Hebrew) that it signifieth
properly an Altar to Sacrifice on; as though it might not
therfore be used figuratively; where yet themselves must
needes acknowledge it to be so too.</p>
            <p>Next the weaknes of your reason; who thereof doe gather,
that, by the Sacrifice, which that word importeth in the
Apostle, is meant the cleane offring, of which the Prophet
speaketh.</p>
            <p>For the cleane offring, of which the Prophet speaketh, Mal.
1. 11. is offered in every place, the Sacrifice meant by the
Apostle, Heb. 13. 11. in one place only, without the Gate.</p>
            <p>Wherfore the name of Altar in the Epistle to the Hebrewes
doth neither signifie a Massing Altar, nor prove the Sacrifice
of Massing Preistes.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hart.</speaker>
               <p>That which you touch, as folishly noted by our Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists

that we have not a Common Table or prophane Communion

               <p>The note of your Rhemists, about the Greeke
&amp; Hebrew word is true, (I grant) yet foolish too, though true
in the thing yet foolish in the drift. For to the intent that
where the Apostle sayth, we have an Altar, it may be thought
he meant not that word spiritually, or in a figurative sence,
as we expound it of Christ, but materially of a very Altar,
such as is used in their Masses: they say that the Greeke word
<hi>thusiasterion,</hi> (as also the Hebrew answering <hi>mizbbeach</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
in the old Testam. signifieth properly an Altar to sacrifice
on, and not a metaphoricall &amp; spirituall Altar. Which speech
how dull it is in respect of the point to which they apply it,
I will make you see by an example of their owne.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Our Saviour in the Gospell teacheth of himselfe, that he is
the true bread, which giveth life unto the world, the bread
which came downe from Heaven, that whosoever eateth of
it should not die; if any man eate of this bread, he shall live
for ever. John 6. v. 61. 33. 50. 51.</p>
            <p>Your Rhemists in their Annotat. on John 6. 32. doe note
thereon, that the person of Christ incarnate, is meant under
the metaphore of bread, &amp; our beleefe in him is signified by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1659:114"/>
eating. Wherein they say well. But if a man should tell
them, that the Greeke word <hi>artos,</hi> (as also the Hebrew <hi>lechem</hi>
answering thereunto in the Old Testament,) doth properly
signifie bread which we eat bodily, &amp; not a metaphoricall or
spirituall bread: were not this as true a speech as their owne?
yet how wise to the purpose, who is so blind that seeth not?
yea, to goe no farther then the very word whereof by their
Hebrew and Greeke they seeke advantage themselves, upon
that place of John Rev. 6. 9. that he saw under the Altar the
soules of them who were killed for the word of God. doe
affirme expresly, that Christ is this Altar. Christ (say they)
as man, no doubt is this Altar. They meane it (I hope) in a
Metaphoricall, or other figurative speech.</p>
            <p>For they will not make him by transubstantiation to be an
Altar properly, yet here is it as true that the Greeke word <hi>thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasterion,</hi>
(as also the Hebrew <hi>mizebbah</hi> answering thereunto
in the Old Testament) signifieth properly an Altar to sacrifice
on, and not a Metaphoricall or spirituall Altar.</p>
            <p>And if it were as much for the advantage of their cause to
prove, that Masse is sayd in Heaven, as that in earth: and that
Christ is properly bread without a figure, as that bread is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Christ in the Sacrament: the text of the Scripture where

expresly of participation of the Sacrifice of Christes

is by a Christian faith, and not in the Sacrament only, whereof

            <p>For the Apostle speaketh manifestly, vers. 12. of the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

            <p>2. Christes selfe, is all the Altar that the Christian Church
hath. Our Altar is He only; and nothing but hee, the Apostle
knoweth no other.</p>

by</hi> King James<note place="margin">8. King Iames.</note> 
               <hi>himselfe, who in his</hi> Paraphrase on the 6. of the

            <p>

            <p>Thus all these with sundrie other writers of our Church, together
with all Protestant writers, whatsoever unanimously interpret this
Text of Christ himselfe, not of Communion Tables and Altars;
Therfore it proves not that the Communion Table is, or may be
called an Altar, though the Fathers some times improperly stile it
so, contrary to the Scripture language, yet not in that sence, or for
any such end as the Papists and our Popish Innovators doe, to bring
in the Sacrament and Sacrifice of the Altar, and set upp Masse
againe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because the Fathers some times phrase them so.</p>
            <p>2. Because the Statetude of 1. Ed. 6. c. 1. r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Altar.</p>
            <p>3. Because the Common Prayer Booke in 2. Ed. 6. Anno
1549. cals the Lords Table promiscuously both by the name
of a Table an Altar.</p>
            <p>4. Because our Godly Martyrs, as John Fryth, Archbishop
Crammer, John Lambert, John Philpot, Bishop Latimer, and
Bishop Ridley, call both the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.
The Sacrament of the Altar, &amp; the Communion Table an
Altar, <hi>as their words cited</hi> in the Coale from the Altar p. 16. 17.
<hi>testify: from whence that Pampl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t concludes thus:</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1659:117"/>
So that we have a Sacrifice and an Altar, and a Sacrament of
the Altar on all sides acknowledged; neither the Prince or
Prelates, the Preist or people dissenting from it, some of those
termes being further justified by the Statute Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the first of these Reasons I answer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer 1.</note> 
               <hi>First, that Christ and
his Apostles never phrase the Lords Table, an Altar, but the</hi> Lords
Table, the Lords Supper, the Communion of Christs body &amp;
blood, we ought therfore to stile them so as the Scripture
doth, 1. Cor. 10. &amp; 11. <hi>to call them by those names the Scripture
gives them, which are proper &amp; genuine, since we</hi> ought to
speake as Christ and God hath taught us of these ordinances.</p>
            <p>2. The Fathers and primative Christians for at least 230. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
after Christ had no Altars of which more before; therfore<note n="p" place="margin">See B. Iewels Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie to Harding Art. 1. div. 5. p. 5.</note> not
the name of Altars, or of the Sacrament of the Altar.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Fathers usually and properly stile the Communion
Table,</hi> the Lords table, the Holy table, the Table &amp;c. <hi>and the
Sacrament i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>selfe,</hi> the Lords Supper, the Sacrament of Christs
body and blood, the Eucharist and the like, &amp; that properly,
<hi>and those who phrase the Table an Altar, or the Sacrament, the
Sacrament of the Altar, doe it only</hi> improperly and figuratively,
(as they stile faith, and our hearts the Altar of a Christian,)
<hi>either in</hi> relation to Christ himselfe, who is our only true Altar,
whose body, blood &amp; death are my stically represented to us in
this Sacrament, or in respect the Sacrifice of his body for us
on the Altar of the Crosse, is here spiritually exhibited, or by
reason of the spirituall Sacrifices of prayer and prayse, and
oblations of Charity for the poores releife that are there offred
up when the Sacrament is received, or because it puts us in
mind of Christ our Altar in Heaven, who must consecrate all
our Services, Sacrifices, &amp; spirituall oblations, &amp; make them
acceptable to his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In these regards only, as<note n="q" place="margin">In their forecited places.</note> some</hi> of our Martyrs, Bishop
Jewell, D. Fulke, D. Reynolds, M. Deane Nowell, D. Willet,
and M. Cartwright observe, <hi>the Fathers sometime stile the</hi> Lords
Table, an Altar, <hi>or</hi> out of an allusion to the Jewish Altars and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1659:117"/>
oblations, which were but types of Christ and his sacrifice on
the Crosse, here represented to us, but never truly or properly.
<hi>Therfore their Antiquities prove it not to be an Altar; nor yet the
Sacrament,</hi> to be the Sacrament of the Altar, <hi>or that it may
properly be so termed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Though the Fathers phrase the Communion Table an Altar,
or the Lords Supper the Sacrament of the Altar; yet this is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that we may now lawfully doe it, or that they did well in it.
For when they used this manner of speech, the Sacrifice of the Masse
&amp; Masse-Preists, with other idolat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous popish trash, was not knowne
nor heard in the world, neither were there any to be scandalized
with those phrases, or to wrest them to such ill ends &amp; purposes, as
since they have been: There were then no Papists to be hardned &amp;
encouraged in their popish Superstition, no Protestants to be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized
or drawen to dreame of Masse and Masse Preists againe,
as now there are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therfore they (prochance) might lawfully use these termes, though
we may not: And yet</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">See this Rhemists Notes on Hebr. 13. Sect. 6. &amp; others of the Masse.</note> these termes &amp; speeches of the Fathers,
the Papists have formerly derived and still defend &amp; justify
all the abominations of their Masse, their altars, Masse Preistes
massing vestments, Cringes, Ceremonies; <hi>which shewes, that
the Fathers might have better spared then used them, since all this
hurt, but no good at all hath proceeded from them; &amp; if we should
now after so long a discontinuance &amp; disuse of these Titles, and our
exploding of them, as</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Fox Acts &amp; monnm. p. 1211.</note> savouring to much of Popery and
Iudaisme, and tending to foment them, <hi>should reassume them,
it would not only</hi> harden the Papists in all their idolatries, errors
&amp; superstitions concerning the Masse and altars wherein they
differ for Protestants, but likewise cause many to revolt from
our religion unto Popery, and others scandalized with these
termes either wholly to seperate from our Church as false, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
Popish, or else to continue in it with wounded,
troubled, scrupulous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences &amp; dejected discontented spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
&amp; drive them almost cleane away from the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper, <hi>as late experience to apparantly manifests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1659:118"/>
So that this fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t reason is of no great moment to prove what is
objected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the second and maine reason; I answer 1. That the Statute</hi>
of 2. Ed. 6. was made in the very infancie of reformation;
<hi>whence</hi> M. Rastall in his Abridgment of Statutes,<note place="margin">Service, &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
               <hi>annexeth
this observation to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But note the time of the first making of this Statute, which
was before that the Masse taken away, when the opinion of
the reall presence was dot removed from us.</p>
            <p>The language therfore of this Act, made thus before the Masse
was taken away, or the grosse opinion of Transubstantiation remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from us, is not much to be regarded, much lesse insisted on,
though the <hi>Coale from the Altar;</hi> doth principally relie upon it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>I answer, that this Act doth not call the Lords Supper,</hi> the
Sacrament of the Altar, <hi>nor the</hi> Lords table, <hi>an</hi> Altar, <hi>but rather
the contrary; For the</hi> Tittle <hi>of it is this:</hi> An Act against such
persons as shall unreverently speake against the Sacrament of
the body and blood of Christ, commonly called the Sacrament
of the Altar,&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the body of the Act runs thus:</hi> As in the most comfortable
Sacrament of the body and blood of our Saviour Jesus Christ
commonly called the Sacrament of the Altar; and in Scripture
(marke it,) <hi>THE SVPPER AND TABLE
OF THE LORD, THE COMMVNION
AND PARTAKING OF THE BODY
AND BLOOD OF CHRIST, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the name which the Statute gives it, is only the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the body and blood of Christ,</hi> thus so stiled, and this clause,
<hi>commonly called the Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> is not a Title
given it by the Statute, but by the Preistes and vulgar people, who
then usually called it so, and added only by way of explanation as
their usuall terme, not the Parleaments, and being omitted in the
ensuing parts &amp; clauses of this Act, which termes, the Sacrament,
<hi>the Sacrament of Christes body and blood,</hi> with out this terme
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1659:118"/>
of explination; which this Act expresly declares, <hi>to be no Title
given it in, or by the Scripture,</hi> which ever calls it, <hi>the Supper
and Table of the Lord, the Communion and partaking of the
body and blood of Christ;</hi> but only by the vulgar, who were
then either for the most part Papists or Popishly affected, neither
Masse nor Transubstantiation, nor Altars being then abolished, as
they were shortly after.</p>
            <p>3. This Act calls not the Communion Table an Altar, (the
sole thing now in question,) but, <hi>the Table of the Lord:</hi> therfore
it makes nothing for Altars, or the stiling of the Communion Table
an Altar.</p>
            <p>4. No Act either in King Edwards Raigne or Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths,
or since her dayes, this alone excepted, calls the Lords Supper,
<hi>the Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> but only <hi>the Sacrament, the Holy
Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c. this Title therfore being omitted in all other Acts,
&amp; mentioned here as the phrase of the vulgar, not the Parleaments,
and used only in the <hi>Statute of 1. Mar. Parl. 1. c. 3. when Masse
and Altars were againe set up and revived,</hi> but in no other Act
of any of our Protestant Princes but this, can be no plea at all, for us
now to call the Lords Table, <hi>an Altar,</hi> or his Supper, <hi>the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Altar;</hi> but rather argues the contrary; that we should
for beare to stile them thus, because the Parleament in all Acts since
concerning this Sacrament or divine Service (except only in Queen
Maries dayes) hath done it; though <hi>the Coale from the Altar</hi>
falsely affirmes the contrary, <hi>that some of their Termes are
further justified by the Statute Law,</hi> but never proves it, neither
in truth can doe it.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Whereas the</hi> Coale from the Altar page 16. 17. <hi>objectes,</hi>

            <p>Where as at the death of King Ed. 6. there remained one
uniforme order of Common service and administration of
the Sacraments, set forth in a Booke intitled; The Booke of
Common Prayer, &amp;c. the which was repealed in the first
yeare of Queen Mary to the great decay of the due honour of
God, and discomfort to the professours of the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

               <hi>And in the end of this Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this clause is inserted:</hi> and be it

set forth to be used with in this Realme or any other the
Queenes Dominions or Countries shall from henceforth be
utterly void &amp; of none effect.</p>
            <p>By which it is most apparant. First, that this Act <hi>repeales
the statute of repeale 1. Mariae: only as to the Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer and administration of the Sacraments confirmed
by Parliament 5. &amp; 6. Ed. 6. &amp;</hi> no further; therfore not as to the
Statute <hi>of 1. Ed. 6. c. 1.</hi> which hath no relation to that Booke, and
so remaines unrevived, and still repealed by this Act as before.</p>
            <p>2. That it revives not any Statute for Common: Prayer or
Sacraments formerly repealed, but <hi>the Common Prayer Booke
itselfe,</hi> &amp; that not as it was at first published, when it had the
name of Altar, &amp; Sacrament of the Altar in it, but as it was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from these termes, and testified in <hi>5. &amp; 6. Ed. 6. with such

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So as it neither revives</hi> the head, body, and every branch of
1. Ed. 6. c. 1. nor yet the Altar, the Sacrifice or Sacrament of
the Altar, nor any of these phrases, as the Author of the Coale
from the Altar, <hi>ignorantly and falsely affirmes, nor any other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

then this which this Statute confirmes; which enacts,
that the sayd Booke &amp;c. with the Alterations and additions
therein added and appointed by this estatute, shall stand and
be in full force and effect, <hi>not by vertue of any former Law,</hi> but
according to the tenor &amp; effect of this Statute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From all which I may safely conlude against the</hi> Coale, that

1. Eliz. 6. c. 1. is revived by 1. Eliz. c. 2. and so that we have
neither a Sacrifice, nor an Altar, nor a Sacrament of the Altar
on any side, much lesse on all sides acknowledged, as he falsely

               </gap>ented from it, &amp; that none of the sayd termes have been

            <p>And so this maine authority on which he &amp; <hi>M. Shelford</hi> built,
is point blanke against them, makes nothing at all for them; and
over throwes their cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the 3. reason I answer; that true it is in the</hi> first Booke of
Common Prayer, <hi>set forth in King Edwards dayes An. 1549.
the Communion Table was called</hi> an Altar, <hi>as is evident by the</hi>
Booke itselfe, and the 2. reason why the Lords bord should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be after the forme of a Table then an Altar: Fox Acts &amp;
Monuments p. 1211. <hi>the Altars themselves being not then remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by publike authority: but when the</hi> Altars the next yeare
following <hi>(for no reformation can be perfited at first, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees)</hi>
were removed by the King and Counsells speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
&amp; Communion Tables placed in their Roomes, not
to humor M. Calvin, but upon good and Godly considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the 6. reasons compiled by the King and Counsell,
(which the Bishops were to publish to the people for their
better satisfaction and instruction, registred by M. Fox; the
very names of Altar and Sacrament of the Altar were by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Parleament 5. &amp; 6. E. 6. c. 1. expunged out of the
Common Prayer Booke, and the names of Lords Table, Gods
board, Communion Table, Holy Table, Communion Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; Sacrament of Christs body &amp; blood, &amp; Lords Table,
only retained &amp; inserted in its steed; which Booke being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
altered, amended &amp; revided by Act of Parliament,
1. Eliz. c. 2. the names, Altar, &amp; Sacrament of the againe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
omitted, and those other Phrases &amp; expressions only
retained.</p>
            <p>The names therfore of <hi>Altar and Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> being
thus <hi>particularly, purposely &amp; professedly damned &amp; expunged
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1659:120"/>
out of the Booke of Common Prayer, by the whole Church
of England in two severall Acts of Parleament under two
most religious Princes, &amp; never thought meet to be used or
reinserted since,</hi> is a most convincing retirated parleamentary
resolution, that the Communion Table is not an Altar (much lesse
an<note n="a" place="margin">Shelford p. 2. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>High Altar,</hi> as some now phrase it;) that the Lords Table,
ought not to be stiled an Altar, nor the Lords Supper the Sacrament
of the Altar, (else why should these Titles be thus exploded?) and
that no Orthodox member of the Church of England ought to stile
them thus, much lesse to write &amp; plead in defence of these their
Titles, as these new Champions doe, but to call them by those proper
names which the Scripture, the Common Prayer Booke, &amp; these
two statutes give them.</p>
            <p>To the 4. reason; I answer:</p>
            <p>First, that neither of all the Martyrs quoted in the <hi>Coale p.</hi>
14. 15. 16. doth call either the Lords Table, an Altar, or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Sacrament of the Altar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>True it is,</hi> Bishop Latimer <hi>sayth, that</hi> the Doctours call the
Lords Table an Altar in many places, in a figurative and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
sence; &amp; Bishop Ridley, <hi>in answer to that place,</hi> that
Bishop White objected out of Cyrill, <hi>sayth,</hi> that S. Cyrill
meaneth by this word Altar, not the Jewish Altar, but the
Table of the Lord; <hi>but themselves never call it an Altar, but a</hi>
Table <hi>only; they being so farre from it, that</hi> Bishop Ridley <hi>writ
a speciall Booke,</hi> de Confringendis Altaribus, <hi>and</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Fox Acts &amp; monum. p. 1211. 1212.</note> he and
Bishop Latimer had a chiefe hand both in casting Altars out
of our Churches and Chapples, &amp; in expunging the very
name of them out of the Common Prayer Booke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither of the other Martyrs so much as mention the Altar
in the words there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly resolves,</hi> that the
Altar meant by Heb. 13. 10. is not the Communion Table or
materiall Altar, but Christ himselfe.</p>
            <p>And as they stile not the Communion Table an Altar, so not
the Lords supper, <hi>the Sacrament of the Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For John Fryth <hi>only sayth,</hi> they examined me touching
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1659:121"/>
the Sacrament of the Altar; <hi>the terme his persecuting Examiners
gave it, not he; who mentions it as their Interrogatorie, not his
answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So John Lamberts words: I make yow the same Answer,
that I have done unto the Sacrament of the Altar, <hi>relates to his</hi>
adversaries Articles which so stiled it, <hi>not to his owne voluntarie
answer, which must be made of, and according to the question de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>M. Philpot <hi>only sayth,</hi> that the old writers doe sometimes
call the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ among
other names which they ascribe thereunto, the Sacrament of
the Altar; <hi>but he calls it not so himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Archbishop Crammer in Henry the 8: dayes, before he was

being subscribed to the Letter to Bishop Ridley, for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Altars, and setting up Tables in their places; and the
6. reasons why the Lords Board should rather be after the
forme of a Table then of an Altar, (condemning both Altars,
and their very name in some sort) sent to Bishop Ridley
which that Letter, being approved, if not compiled by him.</p>
            <p>So that all these Reasons &amp; authorities wherewith the <hi>Coale
from the Altar</hi> is principally kindled and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>full examination, &amp; neither prove that the
Communion Table is an Altar, or may be so stiled, or that the
Lords Supper is or may be phrased the Sacrament of the Altar, but
the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since therfore it is evident by all these authorities and reasons,
notwithstanding these Objections, that the Communion Table is no
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1659:121"/>
Altar, and that the Church, State and writers of England have
abandoned all Altars, and their very name together with them,</hi>
by which Altars (<hi>as</hi> Philippus Eilbrachius: <hi>writes in his</hi> Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northosis

sect. 7.) the Crosse of Christ is overturned, and therfore they
are to be taken away; the Orthodox Churches doing well, in
removing them, and restoring Tables, at which the Papistes
themselves dare not deny, but that Christ and his Apostles
after him used to Celebrate his Supper.</p>
            <p>The objection fals quite to ground, and I may thus invertit:
Communion Tables are no Altars, neither ought they to be stiled
or reputed Altars; Therfore they ought not to be placed Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
against the East end of the Quire, in such manner as the late
Popish Altars, as is pretended stood.</p>

            <p>I answer: 1. but I know not, neither doe I beleiue the Axtece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to be true, for certaine I am, that in many Cathedrals with in
these few yeares (&amp; by name in the <hi>Cathedrall of Salisbury,
Winchester, Exeter, Bristol, Worcester, Carlile</hi> and others) <hi>the
Communion Table stood East &amp; West a good distance from
the wall, not Altarwise against it,</hi> &amp; with in the memory of some
men yet aliue, it stood so in all <hi>Cathedrals of England, &amp; in all
or most of the Kings Chapples.</hi> If they haue been otherwyse si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
of late yeares, (as the Tables in many Churches haue been) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Law; it is but an innouation, introduced by some viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouators,
without any Lawfull authority, for what end all England
sees, and knowes to well. So as I may truly thus retort the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
that the Tables in Cathedrall Churches, and the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
stood not Altarwise but Tabllewise till now of late dayes, when
their situation hath been changed without, yea against both Law
and Canon, Therfore the Lords Tables in all other Churches &amp;
Chapples, ought thus to be situated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the practise in his Mayesteyes Chapples since he came to the
Crowne, I am utterly ignorant of it: But when he was</hi> Prince of
Wales, <hi>I once receiued the Sacrament in his Chapple at</hi> Sant Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes;
<hi>&amp; then the</hi> Communion Table at the Time of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
administration was placed in the middest of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and white linnen Clothes, like Table Clothes, were spread
upon the deskes of the Seates (where in the Communiant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sate round about) in a decent manner, the Ministers delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them the Sacrament in those seates, <hi>and this (they then
certified me, had been, and was the custome of administring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
there, both in</hi> Prince Henries &amp; <hi>his</hi> Majestyts time.</p>
            <p>Whether the Custome be different at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> or other his
Majestyes Chapples, I know not; since I never was at any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there; but of the other, I was an eye-witnes, and many who
have beene ancient servants both to <hi>Prince Henry,</hi> &amp; his Majesty,
can testify this to have been the Custome. I cannot therfore thinke,
that the King &amp; Princes Chapples doe jarre or vary in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>But admit they should, yet <hi>vivendum est legibus non Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis;</hi>
his Majestyes subjects must live according to his Lawes in
this particular, not according to the patterne of his Chapples;
<hi>exempt, as from all Episcopall Iurisdiction,</hi> (as all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
&amp; Chapples should be as well as they if this argument hold
good,) <hi>so from ordinary Rules and Lawes,</hi> which bind the
Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to give a more particular answer. I say, that admit the
Antecedent true, yet the consequence is infirme: We know, that</hi>
Cathedrall Churches have Deanes, Prebends, Canons, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging-men,
Choristers, Organists, Virgerers, Copes, Sackbuts,
(yea Kits &amp; Cornets oft times) in them, &amp; that they sing, not
read their whole divine Service &amp; prayers to; <hi>(I doubt me
much whether with any serious contrition &amp; compunction, since,</hi>
S. James writes thus c. 5. v. 13. If any man be merry, let him
sing Psalmes, if any man be sorry or afflicted, let him pray,
<hi>not sing:</hi> &amp; Salomon <hi>sayth</hi> Prov. 25. 20. As he that taketh
away a garment in cold weather, &amp; as vineger upon niter, so
is he that singeth songs too, much more then with an heavy
heart.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will it therfore follow; Therfore all Papish Churches &amp; Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ought to have such Officers, Instruments, &amp; chaunting? We
know, that many Cathedralls now, I know not by what Law, have
no Communion Tables in them, but</hi> High Altars, (<hi>so they terme

them,</hi>) elevated on High with many steps, and ascents, <hi>their
very exalted situation &amp; name, being clearly derived from the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous</hi>
High places of the Gentiles, so oft condemned in
Scriptures, Num. 33. 52. Deutr. 33. 29. 1. Kings 12. 31.

            <p>
               <hi>Shall therfore all our parish Churches &amp; Chapples have no

whereby the Minister may be more conveniently heard of the
Communicants, in his prayer &amp; ministration, &amp; the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants

with the sayd Minister; and after the Communion done,
from time to time, the same HOLY TABLE to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
where it stood before.</p>
               <p>In which Injunction, (much wrested &amp; insisted on by the <hi>Cole</hi>)
these particulars are remarkable, to stoppe the mouthes of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Innovators.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>that Communion Tables are no Altars,</hi> nor ought to
be so stiled, they being here put in opposition &amp; contradistinction
one to the other, though some now confound &amp; bind them together
as one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. That all Altars were removed, &amp; ordered to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
by vertue and forme of a Law, therfore provided,</hi> to
witt the <hi>Statute of: Eliz. c. 2.</hi> confirming the Booke of Common
prayer which abandoned them. Therfore the bringing in &amp; setting
up of Altars now, and the calling of Communion Tables, Altars,
is against that Law, and the Booke of Common Prayer.</p>
               <p>3. That the setting up &amp; continuance of Communion
Tables, and the calling of them by this name, was, <hi>and yet is</hi>
according to the forme of the Law in that behalfe; <hi>&amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of them and altering of their name to Altars, or High-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars:
against the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That all Altars were generally removed &amp; enjoyned to
be removed in all Churches and Chapples through the whole
Realme, and an Holy Communion Table decently made and
set up in every Church; <hi>therfore no doubt in all Cathedralls, &amp;
in the Queenes owne Chapples, for better example unto others:
So that the erecting of Altars in them, or any of them, must needs
be a late Novelty,</hi> contrary to Law, <hi>to this</hi> Injunction, <hi>and a
grosse Non-conformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That the care of Taking downe Altars, &amp; setting up
Communion Tables, was committed to the Curate &amp; Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1659:126"/>
of each parish, <hi>not the Bishop: yet now these must be
enforced to be the instruments to set up Altars, and displace the
Tables Altarwise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. That the power of keeping Visitations belongs only to
the Queen &amp; her Successors, &amp; that none ought to visit in
their owne names and rights but in hers, as their Visitours,
having first obtained a Commission under their great Seales
so to doe, as the Statutes of 1. Eliz. c. 1. <hi>compared with</hi> 26. H. 8.
c. 1. 37. H. 8. c. 17. 1. Ed. 6. c. 2. 32. H. 8. c. 15. 31. H. 8.

               </p>
               <p>7. That the ordering of the Situation &amp; covering of the
Communion Tables, is referred not to the Bishop or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of the Diocesse, but to the Queenes Visitors, <hi>who were
then</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">37. H. 8. c. 17. Fox Acts &amp; Monum. p. 1181. 1192. B. Iewels life before his workes sect. 25.</note> specially appointed by her Commission, as they were
in King Henry the 8. &amp; King Edwards dayes, <hi>many of them
being</hi> Lay-persons.</p>
               <p>Which Visitours placed them Tablewise, not Altarwise, in such
sort as they stood in all our Churches ever since, till with in these
two or 3. yeares last past.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>That the Communion Table ourght not to be fixed and railed
in Altarwise against the East end of the Chancell, and there to
stand unmoveable, even when the Sacrament is administred: the</hi>
Injunctions <hi>expresly prescribing,</hi> that where ever it stand befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re;
yet when the Communion of the Sacrament is to be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted,
it shalbe removed into such part of the Chancell, (or
into the body of the Church as the Rubricke of the Common
prayer Booke runs) as whereby the Minister may be more
conveniently heard &amp;c. &amp; after the Communion done from
time to time the same Holy Table to be placed as it stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Which word <hi>shalbe,</hi> is not <hi>a baer arbitrary permission only,
as the Colier p. 50. 51. 52. glosseth it,</hi> but a direct pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               <p>These Propositions plainly expressed in the Injunction thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
I come now to answer the objection, being in truth the only
thing our Innonators colorably alledge for them.</p>
               <p>First then I answer,<note place="margin">Answer 1.</note> that this clause, &amp; <hi>set in the place where
the Altar stood,</hi> implies not, but all Communion Tables should be
placed against the Eastwall of the Chauncle, for all Altars were not
so situated,<note n="o" place="margin">Fox Acts &amp; Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments p. 1404. 1406.</note> before this Injunction: <hi>The Altar in Carmarthen
Church, was placed in the middest of the Church, without

               </p>
               <p>The Altar in <hi>the Sauoy Church</hi> and other Churches &amp; Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
(<hi>built North or North and South</hi>) stood at the South end of
the Quire, not the East: <hi>&amp; in many Churches some Altats stood
one way, some an other, some West, some North and South, as</hi>

                     </gap> but generally they ever stood
in the middest</hi> of <hi>the Quire,</hi> as the Promises evidence. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Coale</hi> therefore must prove that all the Altars in
all our Churches and Chapples stood against the Eastwall of the
Quieres, or Chauncles, in the place where now he would have them
situated (which he can never doe) else this clause of the Injunction
will little helpe, but marre his cause, &amp; make poinct-blanke against
him; since it prescribes not the Table to be placed in the East end of
the Quire Altarwise against the wall, but, <hi>in the place where the
Altar stood,</hi> so that where the Alter was placed in the midst, west
North or South end of the Church or Chancle, the Table was to be
there situated likewise.</p>
               <p>2. By <hi>The place where the Altar stood,</hi> is not to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so precisely, that it must stand in that particular individuall
place, or in that forme and manner as the Altar stood; for this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
was not the meaning, but, <hi>in the place,</hi> that is, in that end of
the Church where the Altar stood; to witt, in the midst of the Church,
if the Altar stood there; or in the East, West, North or South end
of the Church, where the Altars were so severally situated; or in the
Chauncel, where the Altar formerly stood in the Chann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1659:127"/>
this only is the true meaning of the <hi>Jnjunction,</hi> &amp; not, <hi>that the
Table should be placed just where the Altar stood, or in that
maner with one side against the East wall of the Quiere,</hi> as our,
Innouators expound it, is most apparant by these Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. First Because the Communion Tables were<note n="q" place="margin">Fox Acts &amp; Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments p. 1211. 1212.</note> 
                  <hi>of a different
forme from the Altars then in Churches</hi> being both longer &amp;
broder then Altars, wich were all most <hi>perfectly square,</hi> but Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
all most as long againe as brode.</p>
               <p>They could not therfore be situated in the same individuall precise
place as the Altars stood, being thus different in proportion &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
from them.</p>
               <p>This is the<note n="r" place="margin">Page 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Coales owne argument,</hi> even against it selfe.</p>
               <p>2. Because the <hi>Coale</hi> itselfe confesseth,<note n="s" place="margin">Page 51.</note> 
                  <hi>that Altars were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated,
&amp; fixed unto this wall; &amp; that Tables were not to
be so;</hi> therfore they were not to be placed punctually in that place,
&amp; in such sort ar the Altars stood &amp; were placed, by his owne confession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. Because the Rubricke of the Common prayer Booke</hi>
prescribes; <hi>that the Minister at the time of administring &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
the Sacrament shal stand at the North side of the
Table,</hi> not at the North end: which clearly determines, that the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of it North and South, not Altar wise, with the ends of it North
&amp; South and the sides of it East and West, against the Wall, as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

               <p>I answer<note place="margin">Answer 1.</note> first, that those two Authorities ever use the word <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and never stile the Lords Table and <hi>Altar,</hi> as his <hi>Objector</hi>
doth, and would have it termed; therefore its most likely they would
have it placed like a Table not an Altar.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>If both the</hi> Queenes Injunctions, those Orders 1561: &amp;
Advertissements 1565. <hi>doe also vnanimously prescribe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Tables to stand</hi> Altar-wise, <hi>why were they not all then

of the Table in them all? <hi>Certainely the</hi> Coliar <hi>must sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy

(If the thing be well observed) as he was inhis Conclusions

               <p>3. I answer that <hi>that the Orders 1561.</hi> prescribing <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table to stand where the steps of the Altar formerly
stood coupled</hi> with the ensuing words, prove; that the Table was
to stand Altar-wise, with one side against the wall, but a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from it, <hi>as farre as the steps of the Altar stood before; &amp;</hi>
that <hi>the setting of the Tables of Gods precepts over the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Board, or upon the East wall over the side Table,</hi> is
not so to be interpreted as if the Commaundements were to hang per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t (for that they could not doe, <hi>the Tables stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
where the steps of the Altar stood,</hi> but over it, that is, <hi>some
good height above it, not direstly over</hi> it, is cleare.) First, by the
words them selves intimating as much, (for they say they <hi>shall be
set or fixed on the East wall over the Communion Table; over</hi>
in both these places, relating to the <hi>Wall,</hi> next antecedent, not to
the <hi>Table;</hi> at least-wise to the <hi>Wall</hi> as well as the <hi>Table:</hi> now the
wall by which the Table stands, cannot be said to be perpendiculary
<hi>over the Table,</hi> but only, <hi>over, that is,</hi> above it, therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
neither the Table of the Commaundements affixed to it, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on it, as it is in many Churches.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Ioseph</hi> was saide, <hi>to be set over all the Land of Egipt:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1659:130"/>
Gen. 41. 33, 43.</hi> not in situation, for so he could not be, but, in
Authority and Iurisdiction, that is, he took place and had prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
&amp; commaund of all in Egipt, or was above them or in higher
authority then they.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus David useth the phrase</hi> Ps: 66.12. Thou hast caused
men to ride over our heades, that is to be above us &amp;
triumph over us.</p>
               <p>So we say, that such a <hi>picture hangs over such a doore or
chimnie or window,</hi> when it hangs above it, though not direstly
over it, such a thing is <hi>over your head, that is, above it, not directly
over it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Admit <hi>over it,</hi> be meant perpendicularly over it, yet this
makes not at all for its situation, <hi>Altar-wyse</hi> but only <hi>Table-wyse
&amp; over it,</hi> must be interpreted, <hi>over the East end of it next to
the East wall, not the East side of it placed against the wall,</hi>
that which hangs over the <hi>East end,</hi> being as truly saide to be <hi>over
the Table,</hi> as that with hangs over the <hi>side or middle of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Neither of these affirme, <hi>that these Commaundements
must hang over it when the Sacrament is administred,</hi> neither
prescribe they any thing how or where it shall then be seated; but at
other times,</p>
               <p>Therefore it proves nothing at all, that the Table ought to stand
Altarwise at the East-end of the Quire, at the time of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Lords Supper as he would thence inferre.</p>
               <p>The 7. Objecteon<note place="margin">Object 7</note> for the placing of the Communion Table Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-wise
is this.</p>

                  <note n="d" place="margin">Coale p 58 59 60 61. &amp;c.</note> The Statute of 10. Elizabeth c. 2. enacts, that if there shall

of Gods glory, the edyfying of his Church, and the due

               <p>A power not personal (sayth the Coale) to the Queen only
when shee was alone but such as was to be continued also

               <p>So that in case the Common-prayer Booke had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               </p>
               <p>3. I answer, that this clause is <hi>meerly personall to the Queen</hi>
because <hi>she and her Commissioners only</hi> is named in it, not
her Heires &amp; Successors &amp; their Commissioners, &amp; that for two
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1659:134"/>
reasons; First, for the Parleament then knew her syncerity &amp; love
to Religion, and her desire to aduance it, of which she had given
good Testimonie all King Edward the 6. time, but especially in
Queen Maries dayes; therfore they would trust her with such a
power; But they then knew not, neither could they divine who
might chance to be her Heyre or Successor to the Crowne, nor what
they might prove, in point of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therfore they would not adventure to intrust them with such
an authority</hi> (<hi>who might peraduenture</hi> overturne the Rites and
Ceremonies of the Church, with the due use &amp; reverence
of Christe holy misteries &amp; Sacraments formerly setled by
this Act, &amp; the Booke of Common prayer by vertue or coulor
of this clause without a Parliament) but limited it only to the
Queen.</p>
               <p>2. Because the <hi>Booke of Common Prayer administration
of the Sacrament &amp; other Rites &amp; Ceremonies of the Church
of England,</hi> being then but newly corrected &amp; published, there might
there upon (as comonly it fals out upon all Alterations) grow some
questions, doubts &amp; inconveniences about it, or some defects or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of alteration appeare in the Ceremonies and Rites therein prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
which needed to be resolved, rectified, &amp; supplied before a new
Parliament might be called to dee it, or perchanse not worthy the
sommoning of a Parliament.</p>
               <p>All which questions, in conveniences &amp; defests, would in likly
hood appeere and be fully rectified, without any need of future alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
Rites, or Ceremonies, or continuing this power to her <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
&amp; Successors,</hi> which are <hi>purposely omitted in this clause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This appeares most clearly, by comparing it with the two
first clause of the Act;</hi> where the forfaitures for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
against the first clause is, severall times by expresse
words limited and given to the Queens Highnes, HER
HEIRES and Successors; <hi>and though the 2. clause
saith,</hi> that he who shallbe convicted the 3. time shall for
his 2. offence forfait to our Soveraigne Lady the Queen

               <p>Let them therfore hence forth either give over these their distoyall
enchroachments upon his Majesteyes royall prerogative Crowne,
dignity, and his Loyall subjects Liberties, or else let the <hi>Colier</hi> for
ever disclaime this Statute &amp; this grand objection, to maintaine his
Altars &amp; new Altered Communion Tables standing Altar-wise,
which overthrowes all Ep scopall inherent Iurisdiction,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The S. Objection<note place="margin">8 Object.</note> is this.</hi> That it is said in the Preface of
the Booke of Common Prayer,<note n="l" place="margin">Coale from the Altar. pag. 11. 65. 66. where it is insiuua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> that if any doubt doe arise in
the use and practising of the same Booke to appease all such
diversity, the matter shalbe referred to the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
who by his discretion shall take order for the quieting
and appeasing of the same, so that the same order be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto any thing conteined in that Booke.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Fox acts. Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. p. 1212.</note> Therefore it is in the Bishops power to cause the Table
to beplaced and railed in Altar-wise against the East end of
the Church, and there it ought to stand.</p>
               <p>I answer first,<note place="margin">Answer 1.</note> the Argument followes not.</p>
               <p>For first the Bishop hath no power given him by this clause to
altar any thing, <hi>but only when and wher there is a doubt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1659:136"/>
and diversity risen in any parrish concerning, the use &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of the said Booke; not,</hi> when<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and where there is no doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the situation of the Lords Table Altar-wise against the
East Wall of the Quire, all taking it for granted, that it ought not
so to be placed, but to stand in that place &amp; manner as it hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
from the beginning of reformation (&amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> time all most out of
mind) till now, Therfore the Ordinary hath no power to order any
thing in this case in most places, and in case that any Popish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouators
have raysed a doubt in any place, where there is or can
be none, touching the placing of the Lords Table; the Ordinary in
this case can not, must not make any innouation, but order that
it must stand in that place &amp; forme as was at first ordained by
the Quee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Majesteyes expresse commaund that there should be
no Innouation in the least degree in any Church Ceremonies,
or Matters of Ecclesiasticall Discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The very words inhibits the Bishop of the Diocesse</hi> to make
any order contrary to any thing contained in this Booke; <hi>now
the placing of the Communion Table Altar-wise against the East
wall, especially when the Sacrament is administred, is contrary to
these</hi> Books, the Queenes Jnjunctions, Canons, writers and
practise of our Church from the beginning of reformation till
now.</p>
               <p>Therfore the Bishop neither can nor ought to turne the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Tables Altarwise by vertue of this clause, but is expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
by it, so to doe</p>
               <p>The last argument to prove that Communion Tables ought

               <p>To this I answer first,<note place="margin">Answer 1.</note> that this concernes only one particular

order inselfe insinuates in these words.</p>
               <p>Now his Majestey having heard a particular relation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
by the Councill of both parties, of all the cariage &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in this cause, was pleased to declare HIS DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIKE
OF ALL INNOUATIONS &amp; receeding
FROM ANCIENT CONSTITVTIONS,
grounded upon just &amp; warrantable reasons, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
concerning Ecclesiasticall orders &amp; goverment knowing
how easily men are drawen to affect Novelties, &amp; <hi>how</hi> soone

in such cases weake judgments may be overtaken &amp; abused:
&amp; the insuing words which seeme to give particular reasons,
why this being but a Nouelty was tolerated &amp; passed over,
<hi>when as otherwise his Mayestey would not have connived at it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Mayesteye therefore deeming it</hi> an Innouation, &amp; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thus his dislike of all Innouations; <hi>this order is so farre from</hi>
giving authority or encouragement to the Metropolitane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
or other Ordinaries to require the like in all other
Churces committed to them, <hi>as the Author of the Coale infers,
that unlesse he will apply that ancient verse.</hi>

               <q>Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.</q>
               <p>To the Metropolitane Bishops &amp; other ordinaries that they,
love &amp; are incouraged to affect &amp; set up these Innouations, which
his Mayestey dislikes, they must rather be discouraged then anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               </p>
               <p>And truly if al things be well considered they have little cause to
be thus incouraged to require &amp; make this Innouation as they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

            <head>THE
MANNER OF ALTERING THE
Communion Table of the Collegiate Church of
WOLVERHAMPTON in the Countie of
STAFFORD: &amp; consecrating it for an
Altar, the 11. day of October. Anno
Domini 1635.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>PON Satarday being the 10. of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1635. <hi>Maister Edward Latham,</hi> one
of the Proctors of <hi>Leichfeild,</hi> &amp; Surrogate
of Woluerhampton accompanied with
some 20. or 30. Persons, men, weomen
and Chorasters, came to the Towne, many
of the Inhabitants, but cheifly the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
going to meet him.</p>
            <p>The intent of his &amp; their coming, was to performe the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of <hi>Dedicating the Communion Table to be an Altar,</hi> and
of consecrating certeyne <hi>Altar Cloathes</hi> (as they said) <hi>to the
glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Table was made new for this purpose, being about a
yard &amp; an halfe in lenght, exquisitely wrought and inlaid, a
fayre wall of waynscot being at the backe of it, &amp; the rayle
before it, was made to open in the middle, &amp; not at one side;
the middle, where the Ministers tread, being matted with a
very fayre Matt.</p>
            <p>Vpon the Table was placed a faire Communion Booke,
couered with cloth of gold, &amp; bossed with great silver Bosses,
together with a faire Cushion of Damaske, with a Carpet of
the same; both party coulored of skie coulor &amp; purple, the
fringe of the Carpet being blew &amp; white.</p>
            <p>On each side of the Table hangs two peices of white Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico,
&amp; betwixt them the 10 Commaundements, written in a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1659:142"/>
fayre Table with guilded Letters, the foresaid Cushion stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
just below it.</p>
            <p>But on the North end where the Minister stands to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,
&amp; in that peice of white Callico, is represented at the
top, the picture of Angels with faces, cloudes; &amp; birdes fley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
about the middle, the picture of Peter on the Crosse, at
the bottome, George on horsebacke treading on the Dragon,
leaues, &amp; grasse, with some trees, being beneath all, almost at
the end of it.</p>
            <p>In the other peice of white Callico on the West end, is the
same as on the North end, only the picture in the middle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
being the picture of Paul with his<note n="*" place="margin">Like a Persecutor not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</note> sword in his hand,
all this being the curious worke of some needle woman.</p>
            <p>Now the mysterie why, the Pictures of Peter, &amp; Paul &amp;
George on horsebacke, &amp; more other are in this worke, is
imagined, because the Church is dedicated to the memorie
of Peter and Paul &amp; it is vnder the Iurisdiction of Sant Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
Chappell at Windsor.</p>
            <p>The next day being the Lords day, assoone as the Preists (for
so they would be called, to suite the better with their Altar)
came to the Church, each of them made a Low Congie a peece
at their very first entring in at the great Church dore, and
an other Congie a peece at the Ile dore, &amp; after that 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
apeece towards the Altar (before its dedication,) and so
they went into the Chancell where a bason of water &amp; a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
was provided for the Preistes to<note n="*" place="margin">It seemes they come to Church with polu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hands, &amp; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inking soules, that they thus needed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense.</note> wash in, where was
incense burnind which perfumed the whole Church; &amp; then
they returned backe making 3. Congies a peece, &amp; went to
service; which was solemnely performed, the Organs blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
great singing, not heard of in this Church before,
which kinde of seruice lasted two howres at least.</p>
            <p>Seruice being finished there was a Sermon Preached by
one <hi>Maister Ieffery Arch-deacon of Salop</hi> in the County of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
whom the Surragate brought with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His text was,</hi> Iohn. 10. 22. 23. And it was at Hierusalem the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1659:143"/>
Feast of the Dedication, &amp; it was winter, &amp; Iesus walked in the
Temple in Salomons Porch.</p>
            <p>All his whole Sermon was to prove the truth of the Altar.
He had not one place of Canonicall Scripture as we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
&amp; but one place in all, which was out of the <hi>Maccabees:</hi>
His Sermon lasted an hower.</p>
            <p>After Sermon they went to the <hi>Dedication,</hi> or rather as
the Preacher stiled it, <hi>Renouation of the Altar:</hi> and in the Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
<note n="*" place="margin">One Preist can consecrate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what need then 4.

one of them had a Paper in his hand, which they termed:
<hi>Censer,</hi> &amp; so they went vp to the <hi>Altar,</hi> reading as it went, for
they looked often on it.</p>
            <p>As they went they made 3. Congies apeece, &amp; when they
came to the Altar, they kneeled downe &amp; prayed ouer the
cloth, &amp; the other Consecrated things, the Organs blowing
all the while; this solemnity lasted almost halfe an hower.</p>
            <p>After all this was performed there was a Communion, and
one was appointed to stand with a Bason to receyve the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
divers gaue mony, &amp; it was thought it had been giuen
to the poore; but the man that held the Bason gaue it to the
Surragate, (the somme gathered being reputed about 40. s,) he
calling the Church-wardens gaue them as he said 10. s, the
remainder he told them he would bestow on other pious vses,
but the 10: d. being counted, proved to want. 6. of the just
somme he said he had deliuered them.</p>
            <p>None gaue the Communion, but the 4. that had <hi>Copes.</hi>

            <p>This finished, they<note n="*" place="margin">Defiled belike with the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of the Altar &amp; have Altar-clothes.</note> washed their hands &amp; returned,
making 3. Congies apeece as before.</p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Its well they would allaw an afternoone sermon to grace this Dedication since they admit none their since.</note>

            </p>
            <p>This Sermon did justify and magnify the Altar, &amp; lasted
<hi>more then an hower:</hi> which being finished, they went to prayer;
which was very solemnely performed, the Organs blowing,
&amp; diuers Anthems &amp; Responds being sung at that time:

            <p>I answer first, that our Church allowes not so much as of a
Commemoratiue Sacrifice, neither doth shee in her Homilies, or
Articles stile the Sacrament of the Lords Supper so, much lesse in
her Common prayer Booke, Injunctions, Canons or statntes:
neither, doth the Colier alledge one passage in any of all these, to
proue this bold assoueration, either p. 8. or p. 15. 16. where like a
beggerly Pedlar, he layes open all his shrids &amp; stolen wares.</p>
            <p>2. The Church of England (euen in that very <hi>homilie</hi> he

this homily strikes dead at once; and our Common-Prayer-Booke

            <p>3. A commemoratiue Sacrifice is a meere Bull, and
contradiction: For as the picture of a man is no man, or of

So the commemoration of Christ Sacrifice, is in truth
no Sacrifice, nor kinde, nor species of a Sacrifice, but only a
shadow or memoriall of a Sacrifice. So that this is but
a Mountebancks chear, and distinction to delude children &amp;
fooles with all, not warranted by any Scripture or judicious
Orthodox divine.</p>

               </gap> where he layes downe the conclusion fully warranted
by the Apostles text.</p>
            <p>1. <q>That to make any Preists in the new Testament by
special office beside Christ, is to rent the Preisthood of
Christ, and to make it imperfect like Aarons, which for
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1659:149"/>
the same reason that it had many Preists, was weake, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
&amp; inferiour to Christs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. <q>That to make Preists by office in the New Testament,
to offer up any corporall sacrifice is to make Christs Preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
seperable from his owne person, which is against the
nature of Christs Preisthood, which can not pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e from one
to another. Hebr. 7. 24.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3. <q>That to make plurality of the Preists in Christs Preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
Vicars, or Substitutes, or in any respect, partaker of
the office with him, is to praesuppose that Christ is not able
to doe that office alone, but is either dead or weake that he
cannot fulfill that office; contrary to the text which saith:
Because he continueth for ever, he hath an unchangable
Preisthood, or a Preisthood that cannot passe from one to
another. Hebr. 7. 24.</q>
            </p>
            <p>4. <q>That whosoever communicateth Christs Preisthood
with another, besides his owne person, maketh Christ not
able alone to saue to the uttermost, those that come unto
God by him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>5. <q>That the Scripture knoweth no Preist, but the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Preists of Aarons post<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Or else that one Preist that was made by oath in the time of
the Gospell, besides these the Apostle knoweth none, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were there any other in his time in the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>6. <q>That to have Preists now, after the similitude of Preists
under the Law, were to renounce the difference which God
hath made betwixt the Law and the Gospell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>7. <q>That to make a Preist in the Gospell, who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
by an Oath, to abide for evermore in the office, but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1659:149"/>
may be changed, and another come iu his place, is contrary
to Evangelicall Preisthood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>8. <q>That to make Plurality of Preists in the Gospell, is to
alter the order of Melchizedech sworne with an Oath, and
to renounce the worke sett betwixt the Law and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>9. <q>That to make a man Preist now, is to marre the Sonne
of Gods priviledge; To whome the priviledge only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>10. <q>That to make a sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ull and weake man Preist now, is
to weaken the Preisthood of the Gospell, and make it like
the Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>11. <q>That as long as Christs consecration lasteth (which
endureth for ever) none must medle with his Preistly office.</q>
            </p>
            <p>12. <q>That to adde unto it, and to bring in as many Preists
now, as did serve in the Temple of old, is to provoke God,
to adde as many plagues, as are written in Gods booke,
upon themselves, and their Preists also.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All which considered; I hope these Novellers dare not say,
they are Preists after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> much lesse of

the Consecrating of Altars: (a Ceremony already begun at Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhampton,</hi>

with divers of our learned Writers are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
            <p>To make this cleare in few wordes.</p>
            <p>1. First it is apparent that <hi>every Consecration of a Church,
Chappell, or Church-yard makes a Mort:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the expresse resolution of the whole Parliament &amp;
Realme in the <hi>Statute of 15. R. 2. c. 5. Rastal. Mort. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:1659:150"/>
But <hi>Mort:</hi> are directly against the Lawes and Statutes of
the Realme, as appeares by Brook, Fiz: and Rastall in
their Titles Mort: Therefore these Consecrations are so
too.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, they are expresly opposite to the Statutes of
2. <hi>and 3. E. 6. c. 1. 5. and 6. E. 6. c.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>If these statutes with that of Jac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From which Patent (truely transcribed out of the Rolls,
where it it is in Lattine,) I observe:</p>
            <p>First, that the Arch-Bishops had then no Lawfull right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
power at all to consecrate Churches, Chappels, or Church-yeards,
without a speciall License from the King himselfe,
under his Great Seale: Therefore by like reason not to keep
Consistories, Visitations, inflict Ecclesiasticall Censures, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
or silence Ministers and the like, without such a speciall
grant or Licence: And so their Episcopall jurisdiction, not
<hi>

            <p>Secondly, that after such a License given them by the
King, under his great Seale, they cannot, yea ought not by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1659:157"/>
Law to consecrate any Church, Chappel, or Church-yeard,
without suing forth a spec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all Patent out of the Chauncery,
under the Great Seale, particularly and by name authorizing
them with sufficient words and clauses, to consecrate such &amp;
such a Church, Chappel, or Church yeard in speciall, (much
more then must they have the like speciall Patent, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
to keep Courts, Visitations, suspend or silence Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and the like,) which Licenses and Commissions now
they sue not out, but goe on of their owne heads, in and by
their owne Episcopall authorities for the most part, for which
a <hi>Paemunire</hi> lies against them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that every consecration is, and makes a<note n="b" place="margin">15. R. 2. c. 5. Rastall Mortma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. 8 3.</note>

License and warrant from the King, under his Great

            <p>Fourthly, this Patent allowes neither the Bishops, nor
their Officers, to take any fees at all, for any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations;
Therefore the <hi>fees they</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, they cannot inforce any man, or Parish, to have
their Chappels, Churches, or Church-yeards consecrated, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
themselves require and desire it may be done, as some
words in the Patent (which for brevity sake I have omitted)
manifest, and the words <hi>may, nor shall consecrate,</hi> implieth as

            <p>Sixtly, that this gives them no power at all to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate

Gosple, or second service at the High-Altar or Lords Table (or
to suspend them if they refuse to doe it) when there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <q>The reason of this demaund is five-fold:</q>
            <p>1. Because in truth there is no Statute, Law, Injunction, or
Canon extant, prescribing any such thing.</p>
            <p>2. Because the <hi>Rubricke before the Communion ordaines,
that the</hi> TABLE AT THE TIME OF THE
COMMVNION <hi>shall stand in the body of the Church or
Chancle</hi> WHERE MORNING AND EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING
PRAYER BE APPOYNTED TO
BE SAID, <hi>and the Preist standing at the</hi> NORTH
SIDE <hi>of the Table, shall say the Lords prayer with thi col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
following. &amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>Rubricke</hi> at the end of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
ordaines thus: <hi>Vpon the Holy-dayes if there be no
Communion, shall be said all that is appointed at the Communion,
untill the end of the Homily, concluding with the generall
prayer,</hi> &amp;c. But it sayth not, that it shall then be sayd at the
Communion Table: Whence I observe:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1659:159"/>
1. That the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Rubricke</hi> ties not the Minister to say second

<hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That when he reades service at it, the <hi>Table ought not

            <p>The Minister ought not to read <hi>Second service</hi> at the Altar,
but then only, when it is removed and brought downe into
the body and middle of the Church or Chancel to celebrate
the <hi>Communion</hi> at, as the <hi>Rubricke, Injunction &amp; Canon</hi>
resolve: But the <hi>Table</hi> is not thus to be removed or placed

that it ought alwayes to stand in the middest of the Church,
or Chancel, which they profestedly deny) witnesse the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke

VVhat coherence of vigour is there in this argument? What
beast had he reason would thus dispute? Had they hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
<hi>Ergo, we must alwayes adore, bow downe to, or worship
God towards (not in) our Churches and Chaples:</hi> This had
been a more probable inference, though unsound; Because
the Iewes worshipped and prayed towards their <hi>Temple only,</hi>
which is <hi>vanished;</hi> Not towards their Synagogues, of which
our Churches is rather patternes and successours, then of
the Temple, which was but one, not many, and that a type of
our Saviour, abolished shortly after his death, nor of our

               <hi>other purpose then it.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>But to answer the texts fully:</q>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> the worship towards the Temple, here mentioned,
was not <hi>bare bowing downe of the body only</hi> (as these Novellers
dreame) <hi>to, or towards it, or the Altar or Temple, but a praying
towards it, as is evident, by Psal. 28. 2. 1 King. 8. 20. 30. 33. 35.
38. 42. 44. 48. 2 Chron. 6. 20. 21. 24. 26. 29. 34. 38. Dan:</hi> 6. 10.
Therefore it warrants no bowing to or towards the Altar or
Lords Table without prayer.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it was a <hi>worship towards the Temple only, not
towards the Altar in the Temple;</hi> And so makes nothing for
bowing towards the Altar or Table; For the Church or
Chapple it selfe is neither.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it was <hi>only a turning with the face towards the
Temple;</hi> Not any genufl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction or chringing to the Temple:
But this bowing of our Novellers, is not simply <hi>towards,</hi> but
likewise to the Altar, as<note n="n" place="margin">Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Booke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end.</note>

Now bowing to, and towards the Altar,
are in some respects two distinct things; Therefore this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
towards the <hi>Temple,</hi> no warrant for any bowing to a
Table or Altar,</p>

               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:1659:165"/>
4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this worshipping towards the Temple is
taken two manner of wayes in scripture; <hi>Improperly</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly:
Improperly</hi> for a praying in some private place, not only
out of the Temple, but even out of the sight and veiwe of it.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Daniel even in Babylon prayed 3 times a day towards
Ierusalem: Dan. 6. 10. And so did all the Iewes where ever they
were,</hi> whether in captivity exile or their owne Country,
1. King. 8. 30. 35. 38. 44. 48. and other fore-cited texts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Properly: For worshipping or praying in the Temple: as, 1. King:</hi>

            <p>Take it in either sence, and it will not avayle our Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
David in his private devotions, even out of the sight and
veiwe of the Temple, did worship or pray towards it; Ergo
we at our coming in and going out of the Church, when we
see the <hi>Table</hi> or <hi>High Altar</hi> must bow downe to or towards
it; or David did worship God towards, that is, in his Temple.</p>
            <p>Ergo, they must bow and worship to or towards the <hi>Altar
or Table,</hi> (<hi>for in them or either of them they cannot locally worship
God, unlesse they will make new formes of Altars and Tables, and
be mewed up within them by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>om these texts, to justify these Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> the Iewes had good warrant and ground to
worship and pray towards the Temple For:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> they had a divine premission and authority, if
not a precept so to doe.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, a promise from God himselfe to heare &amp; gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

their prayers made towards the Temple;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Both which appeares by the</hi> forequoted texts of the Kings,
Chronicles, Daniel, and the Psalmes. <hi>Viz:</hi> 1 King. 8. 39. 30. 33. 35. 38. 42. 44. 48. 2 Chron. 6. 20. 21. 24. 26. 29. 34. 38. Dan. l.
10. Psal. 5. 7. Psal. 28. 2. Psal 138. 2.</p>
            <p>But we have no such permission or precept to bow <hi>to</hi> or <hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Altars</hi> or <hi>Tables,</hi> but a direct precept against it, which
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1659:165"/>
many read at the <hi>Altar</hi> &amp; <hi>Table,</hi> (to witt, the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
<hi>Exod. 20. 5. Thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor
worship them;</hi> extending as well to <hi>Tables</hi> as to Images, Idols
or any other creatures) though they presently breake it by
bowing unto the <hi>Table or Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither have we any promise of reward, or of answering
our prayers made to us, for this <hi>cringing to Altars and
Tables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their practise thereof warrants not ours.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> the Temple was a speciall and lively type of
our Saviour Christ himselfe, (as Divines generally accord,)
and that in many respects, too tedious here to mention.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Wherefore the Iewes were thus to worship<note n="q" place="margin">See the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours on 1 King. 8. 2 Chor. 6. Ps. 5. 7. &amp; 138. 2. &amp; Dan. 6. 10</note> towards
the Temple, to teach them alwayes to looke forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Christ, which was to come in the flesh, as to their
only Sanctuary, helpe and refuge in all conditions, the only
Mediatour and intercessour, to whom they must pray, the
only High Preist, Sacrifice, Oblation and Altar they must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on typified by the Temple, but never towards Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now these reasons of their worshipping towards the Temple
make nothing for the cringing and congewing to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Tables &amp; High Altars.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the Temple was the place of Gods speciall
presence, which God had chosen for himselfe to dwell in,
and to put his name there, where all the Isralites were every
yeare by speciall commaund from God, to meet &amp; to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, and this among others was one cause of their
praying towards it. Deut. 12. 11. 12. 1 King. 7. 29. 30, &amp;c.
Psal. 122. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Innovatours</hi> cannot produce one Syllable in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to prove, that the High Altar or Communion. Table is
<hi>the speciall place of Gods presence, the place which he hath chosen
to place his name there and to dwell in;</hi> Sure the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
us, that VVHERESOEVER <hi>two or three (Mat.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1659:166"/>
18. 20.) are gathered together in Christs name, there is he in the</hi>
MIDDEST <hi>of them;</hi> And thereupon commaunds us: <hi>To
pray</hi> EVERY <hi>where,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 2. 8. because God is now
every where alike present by his <hi>Grace:</hi> Therefore no ground
have they to worship or bow either <hi>to</hi> or <hi>towards</hi> it, as they
doe.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Finally,</hi> the Jewes whether they were <hi>East, West,
North, or South</hi> from the <hi>Temple,</hi> or it from them, worshipped
and prayed towards it.</p>
            <p>But our Innovatours, as they will have all Altars stand
<hi>Eastward,</hi> so they will terminate and direct their worship
only towards the <hi>East,</hi> and Altars standing towards the
<hi>East.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These texts therefore, with <hi>Davids</hi> worshipping towards
the Temple (on which they principally relie) make nothing
at all for the bowing to Altars and Tables, which no <hi>Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yea, but if these doe not avayle them, Mr. <hi>Shelford</hi> (in his
<hi>Sermon of Gods house, p.</hi> 18. 19. 20. 21. 22.) acquaints us with
some others that will: as, <hi>Psal. 99. 5. Exalt yee the Lord our

            <p>1. I answer, first, that this is only the rayling speech of
<hi>Rabshaketh,</hi> not the dictate of Gods infallible Spirit, therefore
no authenticke proofe.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, the first part of it is a direct untruth, why not
the latter too, there being no such commaund of Hezechiahs
in Scripture, for the <hi>Isralites to worship before one Altar?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>But admitt there were:</q>
            <p>3. Yet thirdly, I say, that this Commaund to worship <hi>before
the Altar,</hi> makes nothing for worshipping or bowing to the
Altar, much lesse the Table; No more then <hi>David lifting up
his hands towards Gods holy Oracle:</hi> Ps. 28. 2. proves that we
ought to lift up our hands towards the Table or Altar, when
we come in, or depart out of the Church, or when ever we
make prayers unto God.</p>
            <p>For first, this worshipping before the Altar was not any
<hi>Genuflection,</hi> or bowing to or towards it, but <hi>a bringing of an
Oolation or Sacrifice to it, and burning incense on it,</hi> as the next

the Table.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because they might worship before the Altar,
without any bowing or particular inclination of the body to
it, as we use to kneele and pray before the <hi>Font</hi> at every
Christning, before the Minister and Pulpit at every Sermon,
before the Grave at every funerall, before the Reading Deske
at every Common-prayer, Mourning or Evening, and yet
bow or cringe our bodies to or towards neither of them, out
of any respect at all unto them; Neither doe we the like to
the Sacrament or Lords Table when we receive his Supper
though most kneele before it then.</p>
            <p>So that J may now safely conclude, that there is no <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is not a word of the Preists bowing to or

their necke to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>this bowing their neckes</hi> before the Altar, was not
with any relation to the Altar, but to God, and only a bowing
of the body in prayer to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Therefore this spacious forged <hi>Antiquity,</hi> hatched but of

And that for three reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because the parties that were thus to prostrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Elders and Saints of God were<note n="g" place="margin">Rhena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus &amp; La Cerda l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tents, or
men excluded and excommunicated from the Churth and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for some hainous sim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s, which they were thus to lament:</hi>
This bowing and prostration therefore of themselves, could
not be <hi>Aris Dei,</hi> to the Altars, from which they were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
But <hi>Charis Dei,</hi> to the beloved Saints of God, to whom
they might have private accesse for comfort and counsell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because the end of this bowing to the Elders and
Brethren was only to aske them pardon for their scandals and
offences against the whole Church and them; And to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their crimes, as the last words, <hi>omnibus fratribus legationes
depraecationis suae injungere,</hi> manifest: Or else<note n="h" place="margin">See Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Hist. l. 9. c. 35</note> to desire them
to pray, greive and lament to God both with and for them; As
the following clauses.</p>
               <p>Quid consortes casuum tuorum ut plauso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; ad remedium conlaboret, necesse est, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, it were absurd for them thus to bow and kneele
dovvne to the Altar of God, for either of these tvvo causes;
Therefore it vvas questionlesse to the Saints of God, and must
so be rendred.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because the <hi>Tripartite History, Ierom, Cyprian,
with others,</hi> quoted by <hi>Rhenanus and La Cerda,</hi> touching the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1659:170"/>
manner of the <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ession) in the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, make no mention at all of any bowing to Altars,
used in this kinde of discipline, by <hi>Pae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to the <hi>Saints of God, who bedewed these Paenitents with
their teares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This bowing therefore only to Gods Saints is no proofe
of the Antiquity of bowing to Altars.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, admit it were <hi>Aris Dei,</hi> yet it makes nothing to
the purpose: For this was not any precise bowing to or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Altar such as is now used, but only a kneeling or
prostration in prayer before it, as the text doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>
               <p>Besides it is <hi>Aris Dei adgeniculari,</hi> in the <hi>Passiue,</hi> not <hi>adge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculare</hi>
in the <hi>Active</hi> verbe; Therefore no voluntary genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion

               </p>
               <q>To which I answer:</q>
               <p>First, that here is no mention of any bowing to or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Altar, but only of a kneeling downe, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
at it, <hi>to pray and weep to him that is worshipped on it;</hi>
Which proves no more the use or practice of bowing to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
then our Ministers <hi>kneeling downe and praying at the Lords

warrants or proves a custome to bow to or towards the Lords

                  <q>The sixt, is that of <hi>Eutropius the Eunuch (Socrates Scholast,

               </p>
               <q>I answer:</q>
               <p>That there is no prostration to or towards the Altar to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
it, but to be secured by it, a flying to it only as a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>
                  <q>The seaventh, is the example of <hi>Paulus</hi> the Novatian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Constantinople, who perceiving his Church to be
in great &amp; immine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t danger of burning, by reason of a fearce

prayer the preservation of his Church, and so by his unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

from burning. <hi>Socrates l. 7. c. 39. in the Booke 38. in the

               </p>
               <q>I answer:</q>
               <p>That here was no prostration or bowing to or towards the

nothing.</p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>Nicephorus</hi> makes no mention of the Altar, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relates, that <hi>Paulus went into the Sanctuary, and there prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               </p>
               <p>Finally, this case is extraordinary, upon an extraordinary
occasion: Neither doe the <hi>Historians</hi> mention it to prove any
reverence then given to the Altar, but only to <hi>shew the force
and fruite of prayer,</hi> which can quench even the most raging
flames of fire.</p>
               <p>In a word; We reade here of a bowing and prostration in
prayer before the Altar, but not of any bowing or prostration
to the Altar without any prayer; The thing only in dispute;

him all, or none.</p>
               <p>That I presume they will not doe, <hi>for then they must adore
the Crosse, the Crucifix, and Nayles wherewith our Saviour was
pearced,</hi> and that they will not doe (I suppose) as yet: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they disclaime him in this, why not in that of adoring
the Altar.</p>

Fourthly, he writes expresly, that they did adore the Altar,
and not coadore the Trinity with it, but rather adore the
Trinity by or through it.</p>

is no lesse Idolatrie, by our owne <hi>Homilies</hi>

the Altar</hi> (and that <hi>by the Preist, at the time of Consecration)

               <p>That this Authour lived 1120 yeares after Christ, and is
the first undoubted writer that makes mention of <hi>bowing to
the Altar at the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ring into the Church,</hi> which I have met with
all; Which Ceremony, as is likely, began in his dayes. But
yet observe.</p>
               <p>First, he sayth, they bowed <hi>To,</hi> not <hi>towards</hi> the Altar only;
Which many of our Novellers deny they doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the ground and reason of bowing to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
then, is farre different from those reasons alleadged for it
now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They bowed thus:</hi> Only to restify that they were Gods Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours,
ready at all times to doe him service; <hi>Not, from any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
drawne from the Altar; But wee forsooth must bow to
it,</hi> because it is Gods mercy seat, the place of Christs speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
on Earth, his Chaire of state, to testify ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Communion with
the faithfull, because it is the principall part of the Church; <hi>And if
all these faile,</hi> because it is used in Cathedrall Churches; <hi>Which
reason they never dream'd on then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that as they then bowed to the Altar, so likewise
they bowed themselves <hi>both East and West,</hi> to testify, <hi>that God
whom they worshipped was every where alike present.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our men will only bow Eastward, and have all Altars
so situated, not Westward; And confine <hi>Gods speciall presence
to their Altar, and the East end of the Church,</hi> as if he were not
every where present alike; Which is directly opposite both to
their practise and reason here alleadged to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they bowed only to the Altar <hi>at their first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Church,</hi> ours now, not only at their coming in,
but every time they passe by it, towards it, repaire to
it, retire from it, and at their going out of the Church
besides.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, this, in that age, <hi>was the practise only of Monkes when
they went to their houres of prayer</hi> (for of them he speakes, as is

evident by the precedent and subsequent chapters) with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to these houres. <hi>Therefore</hi> it is no proofe for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
or Laymens practise of it then, or now.</p>

               <q>To vvhich I answer:</q>

VVhich our bowers themselves confesse to be Idolatrous.</p>

               <head>The second Authority.</head>
               <p>The second, is that of <hi>Cardinall Pooles Deputie visitours in

               <p>This Authority, I confesse Is full, for bowing not to the

but <hi>to the Altar it selfe.</hi>
               </p>

was prescribed: In Queen Maries dayes, by professed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,

               <p>The third, is that of <hi>Odo Bishop of Paris</hi> in a Synode about

had he used any such Ceremony, this Cardinall doubtlesse

               <p>If our Altar-worshippers will presse or imitate his example,
then they must bow and worship towards our Churches-steeples,
when they see them, (for which they may have some
colour from <hi>Davids worshipping, Psal. 5. 7. Psal. 138. 2. and
Daniels praying towards the Temple, Dan.</hi> 6. 10.) not towards
the Altar or Table.</p>
               <p>Now, most of our Churches towers and steeples stind, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and Tables situation; This president therefore will manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overthrow their bowing to, and worshipping towards the
Altar, and the East, which they now so much contest
for.</p>
               <p>As for these mentioned prostrations, and kneelings downe
at or before the Altar only to pray, or to receive a Crowne or
Cardinals hat, without any relation to the Altars, as they were
for these speciall ends and purposes, not out of any respect to
the Altar; So they warrant not our genuflexion or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our bodies towards, or to the Altar or Table, upon
reasons drawne from the Altar or Table, or for other
purposes, and upon other occasions then these.</p>
               <p>Besides, this kneeling and prostration of theirs was only at
and before consecrated Altars, not at or before Lords Tables
or unhallowed Altars.</p>
               <p>But few of our High Altars are yet solemnely dedicated

               <p>Which reason I have already proved falce. Only I shall
demaund these few Questions of them:</p>
               <q>I. QVESTION.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>By what Scriptures or Fathers they can make good this
proposition;</hi> That the High-Altar or Lords-Table is the speciall
place of Gods presence upon Earth, and his Chaire of state, wherein
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:1659:184"/>II. QVESTION.</q>
               <p>What they meane by this speciall presence, whether his
corporall, or his divine presence?</p>
               <p>If his corporall, that implyes, first, a Transubstantiation of
the Sacramentall bread and wine into the very body &amp; bloud
of Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a perpetuall reservation of the consecrated
bread thus transubstantiated into Christs body on the Altar
&amp; Lords-Table, (else the reason holds not, but only at the time
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sacrament is administred, and the consecrated bread
&amp; wine is standing on the Table; And so they ought them only
to bow to or towards the Altar; <hi>Not at other times when there

               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, it implyeth, a denyall of the Scriptures and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Creed, which assure us, That Christ in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature and corporall presence is wholy ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; That he is sett downe at his Fathers owne right
hand; That he is no more corporally present upon Earth;
That he cannot be corporally in many places at once, and
never was so that wee find in the Scripture; That the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
must containe him untill his second comming to
judgement: And the like, Acts 3. 21. cap. 1. 10. 11. John
14. 2. 3. 19. c. 16. 28. c. 17. 11. 12. c. 13. 1. 1. Pet. 3. 22. Heb.
10. 12. cap. 12. 2.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And it is point-blancke against the <hi>Homilies, Articles,
Writers and established doctrine of the Church of England,</hi> to
which these Rebellious sonnes of Belial have subscribed.</p>
               <p>If they meane only Christs Spirituall presence, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is as much at the Font, the Pulpit, the Bible, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Booke,
as on the Table, as much in the whole
Church and Quire, as in all, or any of these standing in them;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1659:184"/>
                  <hi>Yea much more in every pore Christians heart and soule the true
Temples of God, wherein Christ and his spirit dwell by faith;
Ephes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore if this reason hold firme they must bow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to or towards all and every of these, as well, and as oft as
to the Table or Altar.</p>
               <q>III. QVESTION.</q>
               <p>Admit the Preposition true, I would demaund of them,
how they can prove this their assertion to be truely Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox;
<hi>That</hi> men ought to bow and worship to and towards
the place of Christs speciall presence? What Scripture,
Councell, or Father hath taught them any such Doctrine?
Certainely if this be good Divinity, then when ever they see
the Pulpit, Bible, Font, Church, or any pious Saint of God
though never so pore, they must for sooth bow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because
Christ is specially present in them, then they must no sooner
looke up to Heaven, but they must bow their knees and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to it, for that is Gods Throne, Christs Chaire of Estate.
indeed, and the place of their speciall residence, by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
expresse resolution: Yea then when ever they see the
Paten or Chalice, which immediately containe the Bread and
Wine, they must bow to them, because they are the place of
Christs speciall presence, rather then the Table or Altar, on
which those vessels which conteine the Sacrament only stand.</p>
               <q>IV. QVESTION.</q>
               <p>Jf this reason be folid, I would then demaund but this
Question, whether Christ be not more immediately, really,
and spiritually present (yea and corporally too, if they hold
any such presence in the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>crament, as they seeme to doe,) in
the Consecrated B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead and Wine, then in the Chalice or Cup,
or on the Table or Altar it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e? If so, (as all must necessarily
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1659:185"/>
graunt) then it will inevitably follow from this reason, that
they must much more adore and bow to the consecrated bread
and wine, then either to the Altar or Table.</p>
               <p>If so, then I would demaund of them:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> what is the reason they bow only to the Altar or
Table, not to the consecrated bread ond wine? Or in case
they answer that they bow to both; How their bowing to
the bread and wine differs from the Papists adoration of
them, which our Church condemnes as most grosse Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is the cause why they bow to the Altar or
Table, before the bread and wine are consecrated, when
Christ certainely is not there present, in that manner as they
fansie, and yet bow not to the bread and wine after consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when Christ is specially present in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> why many of them at the administration of the
Sacrament, when as they have the bread and wine in their
hands, bow downe to the ground almost, as they come from,
passe by, or goe to the Table or Altar, out of their reverence
and respect to the Table and Altar, and yet bow not at all to
the consecrated bread and wine, which they hold then in their
hands?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> whether bowing to and towards the Altar or
Table so frequently and devoutly (as they deeme it) when
there is no Sacramentall bread and wine upon it, and at the
time of the Sacrament, even when they hold the Sacrament
in their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nds, and their not bowing to or towards, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Sacrament it selfe (which is farre more ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ourable
then either the Table or Altar, which serve only for its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
and distribution, and may put them more immediately
in mind of Christ) be not an advancing &amp; a preferring of the
Table &amp; Altar, not only before the Pulpit, the Fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the Bible, the
Common-prayer Booke, the Paten &amp; the Chalice themselves,
but likewise before the consecrated bread and wine, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Christs Supper, and the Lord Christ himselfe, to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1659:185"/>
whome they give no such congies, such solemne adoration,
reverence, genuflexion, honour and respect?</p>
               <p>If so, then it is almost execrable and ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>minable; Jf not,
then let them informe me; How that which is least bowed
to, worshipped or adored, is most reverenced and respected,
then that which is not bowed to or honoured with any such
genuflection; Or how themselves can preach and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

soone we may have all of them (as wee have Altars Preists

the reason why wee bow to Tables and Altars, <hi>because they are

is there made and presented to the Trinity.</p>
               <p>This reason I have sufficiently disproved already in proving

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> that this is a plaine untruth, for they are neither a
signe of Ierusalem, Golgatha, the High-Preist hall or the

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> if a truth, yet unable to VVarrant this Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;
For what Scripture, reason or Authour is there to just fie,
that men ought to bow at the signe of the place where our
Saviour was dispised dishonoured and crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if this reason be good, then these Novellers
must bow at and to the <hi>signes of Ierusalem</hi> which hang up in
every <hi>Citie,</hi> or to, or towards these <hi>Tauerne Posts</hi> (which these
bowers haunt much night and day, to make them nod, bow
and reele the better to their Altars) where the signe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
hangs; For they are properly the signe of the place
where our Saviour was most dispised and crucified then the
Table or Altar: Then likewise they must bow to every
<hi>Mappe of Ierusalem,</hi> of the holy Land, for they are signes
of that place too; Much more to Jerusalem and Golgatha
themselves, to which I wish these Cringers would all travell
in <hi>pilgrimage,</hi> that so they might have the sight of the place
it selfe to encourage them in this their bowing, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more moving then the bare signe of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this perchance may make something for the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Crucifixes and the Crosse, because though they are
no signes of the place where Christ was dispised and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
yet they are signes of that on which he was dispised
and crucified, whereas the Table or Altar is a signe of neither.
So that the Papists, if any, shall give him thankes for this
reason.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And if I may judge, this is the cheife, if not the sole reason,
why most men use this Ceremony. The Arch-Bishops both

               <p>Since therefore this bowing is neither commaunded by

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God forbid, that the Bishoppes practise should

               <q>I ANSWER.</q>
               <p>That I can hardly beleive, that this addition to the second
is <hi>Bishop Mortons</hi> owne, but a tricke of Legerdemaine, thrust
in by some other, without his privity, with purpose to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
this incomparable peece of his, and draw a scandall
upon him.</p>
               <q>My Reasons are three.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> because his judgment &amp; practise formerly to my
knowledge, haue been otherwise in this particular, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the point of bowing at the naming of Iesus; And not
aboue three monthes before this second Edition published,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e writ a letter to <hi>Dr. Daniel Featly,</hi> wherein he declared his
iudgment both against Altars, and placing of Lords Tables
Altar-wise, and this Ceremony of bowing to or towards
them.</p>
               <p>Therefore I cannot belive his judgement and practice so
soone altered, unlesse there be such infection in Bishops Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets,
as to make them all <hi>turne-coates,</hi> as it hath made most of
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> because the phrase and style are different from his
savouring rather of some Disciple of <hi>Sheldfords,</hi> or of <hi>Bishop</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Iust like his bowing not to the name of Iesus, but to the Sence; Serm. on Phil. 2. 9. 10. 11.</note>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because it is a contradiction to what himselfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
maintaines in other places against the Papists, and in
the words immediately foregoing, as appeares by these two
particulars:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the Bishop in the words immediatly preceding this
addition, writes thus:</p>

both himselfe and the Primtive Church, in maintaining the

the Church to be for use as convenient, and for order more
decent, then the situation of them in the midst.</q> A thing

&amp; idle Romish Pamphlets. But to returne to the

               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> The Bishop in the immediate foregoing words writes:
(p. 462.) That the Greekes and Latines more rarely called
the Table of the Lord an Altar then a Table: Which they
would not have done, had Altar, caried in in it, the true
and absolute property of an Altar using therein the same li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
as they used to doe in applying the name Altar to
Gods people and to a Christian mans faith and heart. And
both before and after he shewes: (l. 6. c. 3. p. 417. 418. 419.
c. 5. p. 461. 462. 463. 464.) That the Fathers generally
call Christ our Altar, placing him as our true Altar only
in Heaven, which he proves by Irenaeus: l. 4. c. 34. Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen

               </p>
               <p>But here in the beginning of this addition he is made to
approve both the name, the having use and situation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
in our Church, and of Priests too; From which he is so
farre:<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 361. 462.</note> That in the beginning of this very Section before the
addition he writes in this maner: Your<note n="f" place="margin">Bellarm. l. 1. de Missac. 2. dist. 5.</note> Cardinall his
objection is this: <q>That Preist, Altar &amp; Sacrifice are Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,

each other. So he, and that truely, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But what if wee shall say of this point of Appellations,
that it was not so from the beginning, here unto we claime
but your owne common confessions. Viz. <hi>g</hi> That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did willingly absteine, from the words Sacrifice
Sacerdos, &amp; Altar: So your Cardinall &amp; Durantus your
great Advocate for the Roman Masse. Whereby they
have condemned not only other your Romish disputers,
who have sought a proofe of your proper Sacrifice in the
word Altar, used by the Apostle Paule, Hebr. 13. But also,
themselves, who from S. Luke, Acts. 13. (<gap reason="foreign">

concluded a proper Sacrifice. As if the Apostles had both
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1659:191"/>
absteined, and not absteined from the words of Preist and
Sacrifice.</q>
               </p>

(saith he) absteined from the word Sacerdos, as
from that which is more proper to the Old Testament. So
he, vvherefore this and the English word Priest, hauing a
different relation, one to a sacrificing Minister, (which is
proper to the Old Testament,) the other as it is derived
from the word Presbyter, in the New Testrment, which is
Senior, and hath no relation to a sacrificing func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It must follow, that your Disputers seeking to urge the
signification of a sacrificing office proper to the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for proof of a sacrificing act proper to the New, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
as fond and fruitlesse a labour, as the patching of old
vestments with new pieces, whereby the rent is made
worse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But the Apostles did indeed forbeare such tearmes in their
speeches concerning Christian vvorship, whereof these your
fore-named Disputers can give you a reason; Least that
(say<note n="g" place="margin">Bellarm. l. 1. de Missa, c. 17.</note> they) the Iewish Priesthood being as yet in force,
might seeme by using Iewish Termes to innovate Iewish

                     </gap>s. Which is enough to shew, that you are persuaded
they absteined from the use of these words for some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he and much more against Priests: And against Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars

both which this addition allowing, seemes not to be his.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Here againe I cannot but admire, that these tearmes of

by our writers, together with Altars &amp; Sacrifices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

               <p>I feare therefore that this Clause was added by some of
those Bishops Chaplains, who licensed these New Pamphlets
which point-blanke oppugne the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>shops booke; Or else by
some of these New Writers or their Freinds.</p>
               <p>These Reasons (I say) enduce me to beleeve, that this is
not the Bishops passage. But that which doth must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
with me is this,<note n="*" place="margin">Fox Acts &amp; Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. p. 1781.</note> the sottishnes of the difference, reason
and proofes therein alledged, which savours neither of his
judgement, learning, nor acurenes; All which I shall now
examine.</p>
               <p>1. First, the partie here puts a difference betweene Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
bowing to the Altar and Table, and Papists, which
(sayth he) is three fold:</p>
               <p>First, in the cause or reason of this bowing: <hi>Papists bow
towards the Altar only to adore the Eucharist which is on it:</hi>
Therefore by his owne confession they bow not to or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Altar, out of any relation to, or occasion dravvne
from the Altar; <hi>Though Cardinall Pooles Visito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s in
Cambridge</hi> enjoyned the Schollers <hi>to bow to the ALTAR, as
well as to the Hostia in Queen Maries dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Protestants bow towards the Table, to testify the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of all the fait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> full communicants. there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, in the Object,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>apists bow to the Eucharist, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
to the Lord of the Table, not to the Table of the
Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, in the time,</hi> Papists bow only when the Eucharist is
upon it; Protestants when no Eucharist is thereon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:1659:192"/>
The second difference, makes Papists and Protestants bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both one. For they bow not to the Eucharist, or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
bread and wine; (<hi>See Bishop Mortons Institution of the
Sacrament, l. 7. c.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.) <q>But as they apprehend and,
beleeve it to be the very body &amp; bloud of Christ,</q> ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Christ
himselfe both God and man: And so to him which these
Protestants termes, <hi>the Lord of the Tabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> Therefore the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their bowing (at leastwise according to the Papists Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine)
is both one; And so in this respect no diversity in their
genuflexions.</p>
               <p>The first and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st liversity makes Protestants worse then
Papists, and that in these respects.</p>

               <p>But, the Papists have so much piety and religion in them,
as neither to make it one or other, bowing <hi>towards it,</hi> ONLY
<hi>to adore the Eucharist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the Papists never bow to the Altar or Table but
when the Eucharist and Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

present on it;</hi> 
                  <q>At which time both by their Canons and
Doctrine they are enjoyned to bow towards it only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
the Sacrament.</q> A cleare euidence that no part of their
bowing is either occasioned by, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or done unto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>
               <p>But our Novellers (out stripping the Papists) how to or
towards the Table <hi>even then when there is no Eucharist on it;</hi>
When they both know and beleeve that Christ is not there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
present neither in his person nor in his ordinances; And
when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s neither the Doctrine nor Canons of our Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne

only or principally to the Lord of the Table, but to the Table
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1659:193"/>
and Altar it selfe;)</q> Therefore their bowing is farre worse,
more unreasonable &amp; absurd then the Papists in these two
respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>3ly.</hi> The Papists bow thus (<hi>Bishop Morton Ibid.</hi>) only to adore
their breaden God, terminating their worship intentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
only in Christ:</q> But our Novellers make Christ only a
stalking horse in this their adoration, <hi>bowing not to the Table
but to the Lord of the Table:</hi> And why so? What to worship
or honour him thereby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> No such matter; But <hi>to testify the
Communion of all the faithfull Communicants at the Table;</hi> Such
a peece of new divinity, as J never read the like, except in
some Popish Masse bookes, to witt, <hi>Officium beatae Mariae
secundum usum sacrum, their Ladies Psalter, Primer,</hi> &amp;c. which
teach their Proselites, <hi>to pray to God to move the Saints to pray
to him for them.</hi> For who ever read of any immediate bowing
and adoration to God, <hi>to testify only a communion among men?
A bowing to the Lord of the Table,</hi> not to terminate it selfe in
him, but by and the through him, <hi>to signify the Communion of all
faithfull Communicants at the Table?</hi> VVhat is this but to
make Christ and his worship a stalking horse to our brainsick
fantasies? to adore them by and through Christ? And to erect
a kinde of new worshipping of him, not terminated in him,
but given to him for some end, that is, out of him and beyond
him.</p>
               <p>In this regard therefore this bowing is farre more<note n="*" place="margin">Bishop Morton l. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</note> intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

worship of God by or through the Hostia</hi> and our Novellers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
towards the Table, and their owne fantasies in and
through God himselfe, as this reason manifests, which I shall
next examine.</p>
               <p>And here, first I shall demaund, in what Scripture or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
this reason of bowing to or towards the Lords Table,
is to be found, except in this: And what idle head was the
first inventour thereof? Certainly, if there be any <hi>new thing
under the Sunne,</hi> (<hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. 9. 10.) or any thing written of late
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1659:193"/>
that were never heard or thought off before, this reason is
it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I shall demaund, where God requires this C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in Scripture for any such end as this? And whether
he will not be angrie with us, for giving him such a worship
as is neither required by him, nor terminated in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> what authority any man hath to institute any such

               <p>Sixtly, whether it be not an high presumption in man, to

<hi>ordered to be signified by a Sacrament of his owne institution?</hi>

               <p>Seventhly, whether this bowing only towards the Table
be not one great step towards the adoring of the Eucharist
on the Table; And whether these who yeeld to the one, will
not easily be drawne to proceed on to the other? And so
safest to avoyd the first: for feare of being once taken with

a sincere and genuine worship, or Superstitious: Not the
former.</p>
               <p>First, because not instituted or prescribed by God in his
word, no text so much as intimating, much lesse enjoyning
it, nor any one example in the New Testament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because never practised by the Patriarches or
Prophets in the Old Testament, who never thus bowed to
or towards Altars: nor by Christ or his Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who never thus inclined their knees or bodies to or towards

off all hare-adoration only fo the body, not accompanied
with prayer or some so other religious duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Altars themselves under the Gospell, abolished by
Christs death, are not of divine institution, but contrary to it;
Therefore the bowing towards, them, to honour God or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Christ thereby, is superstitious &amp; unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, had it been a worship of divine institution, its
probable, that the Saints of God in the Apostles dayes, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, and all succeeding ages would both have
conscionablie and constantly used it; And either fore-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

Mettle, or in some Curious common Prayer-Booke standing
on our Altars, only for a dumbe shew, adorned with two or

all the people of the land went into the house of Baal: And
brake it downe, his Altars and Images brake they in peeces,

               <p>They when they worshipped, prayed or Sacrificed to

so it is the only visible object to which it is directed, in which

               <p>Fourthly, all the reasons produced to appropriate this
bowing to or towards the Altar and Table, &amp; to justify the

only from the Altar and Table; This bowing without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

               <p>Fiftly, the situation of the Tables Altar-wise,
and eleuating and raysing the ground in some places
higher then before, the gracing of it with Crucifixes, Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes,
Arras hangings, Candlestickes, Basons, Cushions and

                  </gap>g argument in my judgement, that
they bow directly to it, making it the immediate object of
their bowing, and worship not God, whose presence they now
confine to the Altar, and never adore in this maner but in, by,
through, on or towards the Altar or Table.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the bowing to it when <hi>there is no Sacrament</hi> at
all on it, nor cause to deeme God specially present at <hi>or on
it,</hi> (<hi>See Bishop Mort on, p.</hi> 463.) is an invincible argument,
that they doe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1. First, I have heard many of them confesse, that they

               <p>2. Secondly, J have heard them exhort and perswade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to bow <hi>to</hi> it.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I have heard them preach for bowing not
towards but <hi>To</hi> the Altar and Table; And fevv Sermons have
there been of late times either at Court, Paules Crosse, or our

more terrible; The bow as all know (and we of this Nation

their bow is towards the Archer and the hornes from him
towards his enemie, it is a Signe of peace and safety, that he
hath no intent at all to shoote, hurt, or slay him; But when
once the Archer tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Scriptures often mention:</hi> (<hi>See Ps. 7, 12. Lam. 2. 4. c.</hi> 3, 12.)

Noah and his posterity, placed in the cloud for a token of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veuant
between him and the Earth:</hi> (<hi>See Gen.</hi> 9. 13. 14. 15. 16.)
And becanse it was a token only of love, grace and peace, he
placed it with the hornes downeward, and the backe towards
Heaven, to testify and proclaime peace and mercy to the
world; Now when God shall thus in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the world under the Law, to the world under the
Gospel, and consider what it is, wherein we are to imitate
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:1659:208"/>
these Gentiles; Concerning their Altars, and what it is
vvherein we must leave and forsake them. Altars, as they
are properly so taken for those on which the typicall or
supposed reall Sacrifices were offred, are novv ceased and
taken away. Our Saviour vvhen he vvas lifted up upon
the Crosse, bad Altars to be beaten dovvne; When he rent
the veile of the Temple, the Earth-quake shooke their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
VVhen he died, their parts were acted and vvent
out. The Papists that they may scrue the Pope farther
into the mistery of iniquity, vvill have him maintaine one
Lesson, vvhich themselves confesse to be a note of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
and that is, that Ievvish Ceremonies are not yet
ceased, at the least in matters of Sacrifices and Altars. But
perhaps they had rather be beholden to the Gentiles for
them. For if vve vvould beleive Cardinall Baronius, vve
may see their lustrall vvater,<note place="margin">Baron. Auval. ann. Dom. 44.</note> and sprinkling of Scpulchres,

Church; God allowes but two Altars to the Temple, and
Bruschius reckons 51. in one Church in Vlmes, taking
their patterne belike from Venus Temple, of which the
Poet; Ubi Templum illi centumque Sabeo thure calent

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. Secondly, they imitate the Gentiles in dedicating
their Altars to such as it is unknowne, or at the least uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
if ever any such were in the world, as to S. George,
S. Catharine, and S. Christopher, doing no otherwise then
did the Romans, who consecrated Altars, Dijs incertis, to
their uncertaiue Gods, or these Athenians,</q> who built them
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:1659:208"/>
Deo ignoto, to their unknowne God. But we need not much
seeke to know whom they follow in these devotions, vvhen
as it is a maine Argument urged by Bellarmine, that Altars
and Sacrifices were used by the Gentiles, therefore they must
still be retained by Christians: I know not vvhat antiquity
they pretend, nor vvhat they can finde in the Primitive
Church, <q>to prove the lawfulnes of them, we denie not, but
that the Fathers might tearme the Table of the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
an Altar:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And that first, in respect of the similitude it hath to the
Altar of the Ould Testament, for that on it are placed
the Sacraments of Christs body, which before was figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
offered up by the Priest upon the Altar.</q>
               </p>
               <p>

Offerings, which vvell disposed people vvere vvont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovv
upon the poore, &amp; this vve vvill grant them; But that
there vvere any such Altars in use in the Primitive Church
as they pretend vve absolutely deny. VVe have an High
Priest (saith the Authour to the Hebrevves) vvho needeth
not daily as those Priests to offer Sacrifice, nor that he
should offer himselfe as often as the High Priest entreth
into the Holy place, every yeare vvith the blood of others,
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of
the vvorld, but novv once in the end of the vvorld, hath
he appeared to put avvay sinne by that Sacrifice himselfe

Christ Iesus, and herein vve must observe that Precept of
our Saviour to his Disciples; Goe not into the vvay of
the Gentiles in these things imitate them not; But vvhat
doe vve, therefore altogether shunne Altars, &amp; Jmages, &amp;
Temples? Jt vvas an old imputation indeed of Celsus
&amp; others, against Christians in the Primitive Church, as it
is novv of the Romans against us, that vve abandon these
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1659:209"/>
Ceremonies, &amp; relinquish them, to which my answer at
this time shalbe no other then what Origen gave Celsus;
Celsus affirmes (saith he) that we shune Altars and
Images, because he takes it to be the beleife of that invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
&amp; inexplicable Communion we maintaine; When
in the meane time he perceives not, that to us the mindes
of the just are for Altars &amp; Temples; From which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
are sent forth these most sweet odours of Incense, vowes
I meane, and Prayers from a pure Conscience: We are not
therefore ambitious in mouing Altars, or framing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,

               <p>
                  <q>Let any man (addes that Father) make an inquiry into
those Altars which we expound, and compare them with
those which Celsus (I will say which the Pope would bring
in,) or the Images which are fixt in the mind of them
which worship God with Phydias's or Policletus's, or
whom he ever men list to select of cunning Artisicers,
and he shall plainly see, that these inanimate and sencelesse
Colosses shall decay and corrupt with time, whereas these
living Sanctuaries shall be immortall, and continue for
ever.</q>

                     </note> S. Bernard gives of the Altars of his time, by the
hight of such sumptuous and wonderfull vanities (saith he)
men are more incited to offer then to adore. Thus riches
are swallowed up by riches, thus mony drawes in mony,
because I know not by what meanes (but so it is) where
men see most, there are they most willing to give.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>On Altars therefore is presented the beautifull portrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of some Saint, and it is thought so much the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by how much the more beautifull. Men runne to kisse
it, they are invited to enrich it, and more are astonished
at things curious, then inclined to adore things religious;
O vanity of vanities, and yet not greater vanity then mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the Church abounds in the Walls, and wants in her
poore; She cloathes her stones with gold, and leaves her
Sonne naked, to the cold, the maintenance of the poore
serve to satisfie the eyes of the rich, the curious find matter
to delight them, the distressed find no bread to sustaine
them.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>But are these the devotions which Rome so vaunteth of?
Well might S. Austin (<hi>in Psalm.</hi> 43. 49.) then wish those of
his time to forbeare Sacrificing &amp; Altars, if this be all the
fruit of them.</q>
               </p>

                  <q>Alas! he shewes himselfe farre from alowing such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures,
(saith he) If thou hast a fat Bull, reserve him not
for the Altar, as if Iewish or Gentilish Sacrifices were in
use, but kill him for the poore, though they cannot drinke
the bloud of Goates, yet they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eate the flesh of Bulls, and
he which said unto thee. If I hunger, I will not tell it thee,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:1659:210"/>
will then tell thee I was hungry, and thou gavest me to
eate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But what Altar then would he have us to erect to God?
What Sacrifices, thinkes he, ascend best pleasing in his
sight? Why, he turnes us to the Psalmist. Offer unto
the Lord, the Sacrifice of praise, an humble and a contrite
heart shalt thou not dispise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>So then wouldest thou build an Altar? VVhy, the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
Altar thou canst build, is a lowly heart: VVouldest thou
have something to offer, see an oblation passing the bloud
of Goates and Calves, and Sacrifices of praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</q>

                  <q>As great a difference (doubtlesse) as between Signes and
things, &amp;c. For your better apprehension of this truth,
if you will be pleased to observe that Christ in the time
of the first Institution and Celebration of this Sacrament,
propounded it, in the place where he with his Disciples,
gave it unto them, to be Eaten and Drunken; Then tell us
where it was ever knowne, that any Altar was ordained for
Eating and Drinking? In Gods Booke we finde Levit. 9.
that the Priests themselves were not permitted to eate their
Oblation on, but besides the Altar. Neither may you
thinke it any Derogation to this Sacrament, that the place
whereon it is Celebrated, is not called an Altar of the Lord,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:1659:212"/>
seeing the Spirit of God, by his Apostle hath dignified it
with as equivalent Attributes; For the Apostle, as he called
this Sacred Banquet purposely, The Supper of the Lord, &amp;
the vessel prepared for the Liquid: The Cup of the Lord;
So did he name the place whereon it was set: The Table
of the Lord, and the contemners thereof, Guilty of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Bloud of the Lord; And thereupon did denounce
the vengeance &amp; Plague, which fell upon prophane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,
the judgement of the Lord and all these in one

               <p>
                  <q>Thus this learned Bishop point-blanke against Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,
Shelford, Reeve &amp; the Colier, who in the point
of Altars, and wresting of Hebr. 13. 10. to materiall Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</q>

Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which be makes his owne private fantasie, the sole rule of Decency, without one word of Scripture to backe them.</note> A Note vpon 1. Cor. 14. 40.
Let all things be done decently and in Order.
Tending to search out the truth in this Question:</head>
            <head type="sub">Whether it be Lavvfull for Church-Covernours to
Command indifferent decent things in the administration
of Gods Worship?
VVritten by a judicious divine and pertinent
to the matters debated in the
Quench-Coale.</head>
            <p>ALL (I conceive) that this place houldeth forth touching
the point of Decency and Order, may be summed up in
these particulars.</p>
            <p>1. First, that the whole Church and every member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are to performe all the duties of Gods worship in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
&amp; orderly maner.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, what the Church and Members thereof are
to doe in this kind; That the Church-Governours may and
ough to see it done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:1659:214"/>
Thirdly, that it being the duty of Church-Governours
to see that all things in the <hi>Cougregation be done</hi> decently &amp;
orderly; It is therefore their part in eminent measure to be
able to discerne and judge what is decent and undecent,
what is orderly &amp; disorderly.</p>
            <p>Now, when I say, it is their part, I meane, it is their duty;
Their place and authority requireth it, not that they alwayes
have a power and Spirit of discerning to judge a right in this
case; For, it seemeth, the High-Priest with the rest of his
Brethren and Prophets, yea and David himselfe, all of them
thought it decent to bring backe the Arke of the Lord upon
a New-Cart, which afterward David himselfe saw and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
it, was not done after due order, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13.
From whence it appeareth (since they also are subject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in this kind) that it will not be safe for them to judge
and declare the decency of things by no better a rule then
their owne wisdome, judgement &amp; pleasure; But even they
also as well as the people must be guided by such rules as the
Holy Ghost directeth us unto in this case, which are the holy
and infallible Scriptures, and with Scripture, Nature and
Civill-Customes; Yea and I willingly also admit the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Custome of the Church or Congregation in which a
man liveth: For to judge of Decency by all these Rules we
have warrant in Scripture, as 1. <hi>Cor. 14. 34. 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 14.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>And indeed, they who are to <hi>approve themselves</hi> in all their
proceedings, (as<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor 4. 2. When Peter and Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauded us to obey our Superiours they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey the Bishops in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Christ, not in their owne. Tyndals Answer to Mr. Mores first Booke, p. 286.</note> 
               <hi>Paul dia</hi>) and as all Church-Masters ought
to doe, <hi>to every Mans conscience in the sight of God,</hi> ought to
be seriously guided by these patterns.</p>
            <p>It is not fitt for them (I say) to give for the ground of
their proceedings, their owne wisdome and pleasure, but it
be hooves them to justifie their doings therein fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such rules,
as every good Conscience may see approveable, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
12. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:1659:214"/>
Fourthly &amp; lastly, this place in hand houldeth-foarth
also farther this truth, that whatsoever thing the Church
seeth by those former rules to be indifferent and decent, or
which Church-Governours shall by these rules declare so to
be, those things may and ought lawfully to be done.</p>
            <p>For farther clearing whereof, and the better describing of
the power of Church-Governours in these matters; It may
be observed that of decent things lawfull to be done in Gods
Church, some are; <hi>Indifferent and decent;</hi> As to preach in
a Gowne or Cloake, whereof the one is no more necessary
or expedient then the other. <q>But now they are become
Laudable Ceremonies, whereas before they were but
Ceremonies alone. Now are they become necessary rites
godly Institutions, seemly ordinances, when as afore they
had no such names. <hi>Iohn Bales Image of both Churches on A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. 13.

            </p>
            <p>1. 2. <hi>Decent and Expedient;</hi> As to abide in single life, or to
enter into marriage; Of which though marriage
in time of persecution be indifferent, yet single life
is more expedient, to prevent the troubles of the
Flesh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Necessarie and decent,</hi> either allwayes; As a Woman to
keepe silence in the Church: Or at least <hi>Hic &amp;
Nunc,</hi> in some places and at some times, so as the
neglect thereof would be uncomely and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As, a<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 5. to 11.</note> Woman to be unvailed in the Congregation in

Now, for such things as are <hi>necessary and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> Church-Governours
have power to give order and commandement
concerning them. As did the Sinod at Ierusalem touching
those things, which they called <hi>Necessary,</hi> to wit, Necessary
during the time of the offence of the Jewes. VVhich was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be avoyded: <hi>Acts.</hi> 15. 28. Of such things as are
<hi>decent and expedient,</hi> Church-Governours also have power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

declare the Decency and Expediency of them, yea and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
and perswade the practise of them; But not to give an
Order or Law to bind the people thereunto farther then
themselves shall find it expedient and decent for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus in point of abiding in Single-life, in time of the

1. Cor. 7. 25. 40. <hi>Yea and perswaded to it, for</hi> avoyding trouble

in the Churches behoofe, unlesse Necessity be joyned
with expediency.</p>
            <q>Objection.</q>
            <p>Against this it may be objected, Paul had power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
Philemon that which was convenient; Therefore he
might make a Law commanding the Church some expedient
decent things.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:1659:215"/>Answer.</q>
            <p>It followes not; For first, its one thing to give a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
for once, another thing to make a Law to bind
One alwayes to doe the like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is one thing to commaund a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who may owe himselfe to a Church-Governour, as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon
did to Paul: Another thing to commaund, yea to
give a standing commaund and binding Law to a whole
Church, to whom he professeth himselfe a <hi>Servant or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
as 2. Cor.</hi> 4. 5. over whom he hath <hi>no authority,</hi> but<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 1. 2. 2. Cor. 1. 14. Simile.</note> 
               <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
or Economically,</hi> to witt, when he speakes in his Lords
or Masters name, not in his owne. As the Steward in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
hath not power over his Masters Spouse, but when he
speakes or shewes his Masters commaund or directions, not
his owne.</p>
            <p>But,<note place="margin">Note this</note> of such things as are only <hi>Indifferent &amp; Decent,</hi> I doe
not find in Scripture that ever Church-Governours did law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
advise &amp; perswade them; Much lesse charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
them. And that this place in hand, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. doth
not give them any such power (though it be much urged to
this end) may appeare from these reasons.</p>
            <p>First, the place speaketh not of Indifferent Decent things,
but of Necessary-Decent things, the neglect whereof was
undecent, and disorderly, by the light of Nature, Scripture
and Custome. <q>As<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. to 17. c. 14. 2. to 38.</note> for Men to weare long-haire, women to,,
be bare-headed, and for women to speake in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
as also for men to speake many of them at once.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the words of this place run not thus, Let all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
things be done; Or let all things judged or declared by
the Church-Governours to be decent be done, but thus, <hi>Let
all things,</hi> to witt, all Ecclesiasticall matters; As all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God that are done in the Church, all the duties of
Gods worship; Whether Praying, Prophesying, Psalmes or
Sacraments, or the like, be <hi>done decently &amp; orderly, in orderly
and decent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:1659:216"/>
               <hi>But whether in that decent maner,</hi> which Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
doe appoint, or in some other, that the Apostle limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not, but only requireth <hi>that all be done d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cently,</hi> which if
it be done, his rule here prescribed is observed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, the same may appeare out of this place by
this argument.</p>
            <p>If this place of the Apostle did give power and authority
to Church-Governours to commaund indifferent decent
things, then he that should transgresse the commaundement
of the Church therein, should also transgresse the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the Apostle: As, looke what Order or Acts of
Iustice any civill Governour doth by vertue of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the King, He that violateth such Acts, or trangresseth
such Orders, transgresseth also against the Commaundement
and Commission of the King.</p>
            <p>But, it appeareth to be otherwise in this case, <hi>(See D. Barnes,
That mens Constitutions binde not the Conscience, p. 297. to</hi>
300.) as for instance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Church-Governour</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand a Minister to preach alwayes
in a Gowne (it <hi>being indifferent &amp; decent</hi> so to doe) he that shall
now and then preach in a cloake, transgresseth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of the Church; But not of the Apostle: For he that
preacheth in a cloake, preacheth also decently, or else where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
serveth <hi>Tertullians</hi> whole Booke, <hi>de Pallio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if so be it be done decently, then it is all that the
rule of the Apostle requireth in this point.</p>
            <p>But, because this point is of great consequence both for
Church-Governours and others to be truely informed in,
give me leave to cleare the same from some other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
To witt, <hi>that it is not in the power of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
to commaund indifferent decent things in the worship of
God by Order of Law.</hi> (Prelates and Cleargy-men may be
right well assured, that God never gave unto them authority
to make and establish so many Ceremonies and Traditions
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1659:216"/>
which be contrary to the liberty of the Gosple, and are
blockes in Christen mens wayes, that they can neither know
nor observe the same his Gosple in liberty of conscience, nor
so attaine a ready way to Heaven. <hi>Iohn Paru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>First then, that which exceedes the bounds of Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
authority and straightneth the bounds of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
that is not in the power of any Church-Governour to
commaund.</p>
            <p>But to commaund indifferent decent things, by order of
Law, exceedeth the bounds of Apostolicall authority, and
straightneth the bounds of Christian Liberty. Ergo, &amp;c.
The former of these, to witt, that to commaund indifferent
decent things exceedeth the bounds of Apostolicall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
appeareth from the Commission graunted to the Apostles,
which was the largest Commission that ever Christ gave to

            <p>As for the second or latter part of the Assumption, that to
commaund Indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Decent things straightneth the bound
of Christian Liberty, is of itselfe evident. For, whereas (for
Example,) <hi>a single man or woman are at Liberty to marry where
they will, 1. Cor.</hi> 7. 39. If the Apostle had bound them from
marriage by any commaund of his, though they had received
that Guift of Continencie, yet he had then straightned and
deprived them of their Liberty in that particular, 1. <hi>Tim. 4.
3. 4. Col.</hi> 2. 20. 21.</p>
            <q>OBJECTION.</q>
            <p>It is wont to be excepted against them, that Christian
Liberty stands not in the freedome of outward Actions,
but in the freedome of Conscience.</p>
            <p>As long therefore as there is no Doctrinall necessity put
upon the Conscience to limit the lawfulnes of the use of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, Christian Liberty is preserved, though the use
and practise of outward things be limitted.</p>
            <q>ANSWER.</q>
            <p>Whereto I answer; The Apostle in this case leaveth the
people of God at Liberty, not only in point of Conscience
for lawfulnes to marry; But even in outward<note n="*" place="margin">See 1. Cor. 9. 4. 5. 6. 1. Tim. 4. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Third Argument.</head>
               <p>The third Argument or reason is this: They who did
accommodate themselves in the use of Indifferent things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the judgement and practise of all Christians
wheresoever they came, they (surely) did not make Lawes
and bind Christians to accommodate themselves to their
judgements and practise in the use of things Indifferent: But
the Apostles of Christ (and <hi>the Christians too in the primitive
Churches</hi>) did accommodate themselves in the use of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things according to the judgement and practise of all
Christians wheresoever they came; As appeareth from the
<note n="*" place="margin">See Acts 21 23 24 26 27. Eusebius Eccles. Hist. l. 5. c. 21. to 25 in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But, here it may be objected, though the Apostles rather
chose to use their Liberty and their lenity then their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in these indifferent things, wheresoever they came; Yet
if they had pleased, they might have used their Apostolicall
authority in binding all Churches to their judgements and
practise in such things.</p>
               <q>Answer. 1.</q>
               <p>Hereunto I answer, first, that doubtles if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any such authority, they would in some place<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and at one time or other have claimed it and practised
it; For, a sword never used rusteth in the scabbard; And,
<hi>Frustra est potentia quae nunquam venit in actum.</hi> It is a true
Axiome, and pertinent to that we speake off.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, I say, that the Apostle himselfe doth clear the
point, when he confesseth he did thus accommodate himselfe
even to the weaknesses of Christians,<note place="margin">Note this.</note>

(as <hi>abstaining from Fornication;</hi>) or at least in respect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
offence, as <hi>abstaining from blood, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let me conclude this Argument taken from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Paul his intercourse with the Apostle Peter, about a
matter of this kind: If the Apostle Peter was to be blamed
for compelling the Gentiles by his example to observe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things or Ceremonies of the Iewes; Then other
Church-Governours wilbe as much blame-worthy for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
Christians by Law &amp; by grevious ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sures, to obserue
the Ceremonies now in questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though they were Indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
But, the Apostle Paul tells us, <hi>that Peter was to be blamed in
this case, Gala.</hi> 2. 11. 14. Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>OBJECTION.</q>
               <p>Now, if any except thereat (as some are wont to doe in
this case) and say, that Peter was therefore blamed, because the
Ceremonies to which he compelled the Gentiles were not
urged as things Indifferent, but as Necessary to Iustification
and Saluation.</p>
               <q>ANSWER.</q>
               <p>I answer; This is but a meere evasion, and will stand them
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:1659:219"/>
in no stead; For, it is certaine, Peter did not account them
as necessary, he knew the contrary, nor did he so use them
himselfe, nor so compell others to them; But, knowing his
Liberty for him (a Iew) to use them among the Iewes, he
used them when the Jewes came downe from Ierusalem, out
of a tender care to prevent their offence.</p>
               <q>OBJECT.</q>
               <p>But, you will urge againe, and say: The false Teachers
did urge them as necessary.</p>
               <q>ANSWER.</q>
               <p>I answer; What then? So did the Christian Iewes at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
yet <hi>Paul himselfe used them there, Acts.</hi> 21. 23. 24. 26.
27. notwithstanding the corrupt opinion of worship and
Necessity which they put upon them, as much as ever did
the false Teachers in Galatia.</p>
               <q>OBIECTION.</q>
               <p>Why then (will you say) did Paul blame that in Peter,
which he practised himselfe?</p>
               <q>Answer.</q>
               <p>He had indeed blamed Peter for that which he practised
himselfe, if he had therefore blamed him for practising such
Ceremonies, because they were urged by others with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
opinion of Necessity and worship.</p>
               <q>QVERE.</q>
               <p>What was then the difference that made the practise of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:1659:219"/>
Paul lawfull in using the Ceremonies at Ierusalem, and
the practise of Peter unlawfull in using the same Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
at Antioch?</p>
               <q>ANSWER.</q>
               <p>J answer. The difference was this: Though that corrupt
opinion of the necessity of the Ceremonies prevailed alike
in both places; Yet the Ceremonies themselves had
not the like warrant in both places. In Ierusalem they were
knowne to have been the Commandements of God, and were
not yet knowne to the Christian Iewes to have been abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
and therefore at Jerusalem they had warrant from
God to use them, to avoyd the offence of the weake Iew
there; But at Antioch and in all other Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
they were, (at best) but things Indifferent, as having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been commaunded of God there; Whence it was, that
Peter saw his Liberty to forbeare them there at his first
comming.</p>
               <q>QVERE.</q>
               <p>What was then the Sinne of Peter in resuming the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
of the Ceremonies there?</p>
               <q>ANSWER.</q>
               <p>His Sinne was double. First, the abuse of his authority in
the Church, for that unawares by his Example <hi>he compelled
the Gentiles to the use of such Ceremonies,</hi> as himselfe saw Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to forbeare amongst them; And which having never
been commaunded by God to them, he had no power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on them. His other sinne was, the dissembling or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
of his Christian Liberty which he should then (then)
have stood upon, when he saw the false teachers <hi>urge these
Ceremonies upon the Gentiles as well as upon the Iewes, to the
prejudice of their Christian Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:1659:220"/>
When things that are indifferent are commaunded to be
done of necessity (as now all our Prelates Ceremonies are)
then are not the same to be obeyed, because the same destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our freedome in Christ. <hi>Dr. Barnes</hi> saith: Mens Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
binde not the Conscience. p. 300.</p>
               <p>The Summe of all this will lead us by the hand one step
farther, namely; If it be a sinne in Church-Governours to
commaund (especially upon strict penalty) Indifferent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
things; It wilbe a sinne also in Ministers, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians to subscribe <hi>Ex animo,</hi> and to yeeld obedience
by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity to such commaunds, although the Ceremonies
were as good (indeed) as they were prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded (which I believe
they are not) Indifferent-Decent-Things. For, doth not such
voluntarily Subscription and Conforming to them build up
our Church-Governours, yea and with them (that which is
most to be taken to heart of us, our Soveraigne civill Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
also in the confidence, that such commaundements are
as well lawfully given by them, as received and obeyed, yea
confirmed and allowed by us?</p>
               <p>Now, to build up or edify a Brother to sinne is properly
to offend a Brother; For the proper Definition of an offence
is, that <hi>which edifieth a Brother unto Sinne,</hi> as the originall
word expresseth it, <hi>1. Cor. 8. 10.</hi> and so to sinne against a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is <hi>to wound his Conscience;</hi> Yea, and as much as in us ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>to cause him to perish for whom Christ died;</hi> Which is no
better then Spirituall Murther of his Soule.</p>
               <p>Now, if thus to edifie any Brother to Sinne be so heynous
an offence, how much more heynous an offence is it, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie
our Governours to the giving &amp; urging of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements,
yea and to the sharpe Censuring of all others,
as refractory and factious persons, who choose rather to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the losse of the greatest Comforts they enjoy i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
this World, then to wound the Consciences either of them
selves or of their Governours.</p>
               <p>It is true, by forbearing obedience to those commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:1659:220"/>
we offend the Spirits of our Governours, and make
them to be (though causelesly) offended with us; But by
yeelding obedience to these things we should offend their
Consciences in edifying them to sinne, and provoke the Lord
to be offended with them. Better they be offended with us,
without fault, then through our fault God to be offended
with them and us.</p>
               <p>It is not for Christians; Much lesse for Ministers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, since the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of this Treatise a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Story hath fallen out
in the Tovvne of Colchester, in
the County of Essex, vvorthy
publike knovvledge, vvhich I
shall here relate.</p>
            <p>One Thomas Nuceman Parson of the Parish Church of
S. Runwald in Colchester caused the Communion-Table in
his Church to be removed and rayled in Altarwise; Which
done he enjoynes all the Communicants to come up to the
new rayle, and there to kneel downe and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
refusing to administer the Communion to any but
such who came up to the rayle, though present in the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
and ready to receive it in the accustomed place and
maner, and commaunding the Church-Warden to present
them to D. Aylot (the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate,
for that Towne during his Metropoliticall Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:1659:223"/>
for not receiving, when as they should have presented
him for not giving them the Communion, when as they there
profered to receive it, after their auncient maner. One Mr.
Burroes of that Parish being thrice put by the Sacrament,
for not comming up to this new rayle, and yet presented for
not receiving, thereupon prefers a Bill of Inditement upon
the Statute of 1. Eliz. c. 2. against Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oman for this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at Colchesters Sessions: Which Inditement being ill
drawen, and most of the grand Iury Nucomans friends, an
<hi>Ignoramus</hi> was retained thereon, and <hi>Dulman</hi> the Clerke
that drew it, might have well been added thereto.</p>
            <p>This Inditement only exhibited so troubled Nucoman
and Dr. Aylot, that the next Court-day Mr. Burroes is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
for not appearing in Court, though he made
his personall apparance, and there continued till the Court
was risen, as he could prove by 20 witnesses, and the Dr and
Register both confessed as much, (such strange justice and
vexatious oppression now raignes in these spitefull, I should
say spirituall Courts.)</p>
            <p>The next Lords day, Nucoman publisheth the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in the Church, and then sends the Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
to Mr. Burroes there present to commaund him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the Church: VVho comming to him accordingly; He
told them, that the Excommunication certainly was forged
by Nucoman his enemie, that there was none granted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him in the Court, for he was present all the while;
And how ever, it came not out in the Kings name, under the
Kings Seale, and by an authority derived immediately from
the King by speciall Letters Patents, as it ought by Law to
doe, and the expresse provision of the Statutes of 1. Ed. 6.
c. 2. 1. Eliz. c. 1. 8. Eliz. c. 1. and therefore it was voyde
in Law, neither would nor could he in poynt of loyally to
his Majesty obey it, being not made by his authority. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Church-wardens left him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:1659:223"/>
Nucoman hereupon bids them carry him out of the
Church; The Church-wardens refuse to doe it. Then he
chargeth the Constables to doe it: Who c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ming to Mr.
Burro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; he told them, that he was not excommunicated, that
they had nothing to doe in the Church, neither was it any
part of their office but the Church-wardens to remove him,
and therefore bid them to doe no more then they could ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
by Law, else they should smart for it. Upon this they
left him.</p>
            <p>Nucoman hereupon puts off his Surplesse, closeth
his Booke and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth out of the Church, the people follow
him by degrees.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burroes sits still till about 11. of the clocke when the
Clerke came to shut the dores.</p>
            <p>The next day there was a great stirre about this busines,
Nucoman would have this a disturbance against the Statute
of 1. Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. c. 3. Mr. Burroes said, that he was the disturber
and the Dr, for publishing and granting such an illegate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
and giving over divine service without
cause, and that he was not to goe out by Law if the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
had been legall, but ought to have been carried
out by the Church-wardens, and so was no disturber. Much
adoe there was about it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burroes to cleare the busines goes to the Register and
Dr. to know whether he was excommunicated or no, and
for what cause.</p>
            <p>At first they denyed he was excommunicated, neither
would they believe that Nucoman had published any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
against him: Which when he made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
they then told him he was excommunicated indeed by
the Court: He demaunded for what cause? They answered
for not appearing: He replied he was present all the while
in Court, and that they both knew to be true; And is this,
said he, your justice to excommunicate men for not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
when they are all the while in Court?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:1659:224"/>
To which Dr. Aylot answered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sir, you are an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datious
fellow indeed, you will indite your Minister for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
we will take you downe in time, and teach you
how to indite Ministers, I will excommunicate you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all the
Parishes round about and throughout England, and see who
dares absolue you, for Inhibition I am sure you can have
none.</p>
            <p>VVill you so Mr. Dr. said he, I thought your power had
not been so large as to reach over all England, nor your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and insolency so great as to excommunicate his
Majesties subjects thus against Law, for inditing these that
breake both his Majesties Lawes and Declarations; If you
abuse me thus as you say, you will, I will not only goe to
Church notwithstanding your excommunication, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
bring you into the Star-chamber for abusing me in this
maner.</p>
            <p>Well the<note n="*" place="margin">This Dr. is an high Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner, and when any man oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his extortions or Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations presently he hath a dormant warrant and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevant to arrest and vex the parties<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> With which course he hath so vexed &amp; abused the Country and his Majesties authority, that hanging is to good for him; The like have other Commissioners done.</note> Dr. proceeds, excommunicates him upon no
grounds in other Parish-Churches, threatens him with the
High Commission, only for inditing Nucoman for abusing
him as before, and bringing in Innovations. And doth not
such a rejected wilfull oppressing unjust Ecclesiasticall Iudge
deserve to be trussed up for such proceedings? Were<note n="§" place="margin">His 5. Sermon before King Edward, fol. 64.</note> 
               <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Latymer</hi> now alive, and should heare such a story of an
Ecclesiasticall Iudge, (and most of them are of the same Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,)
he would not sticke to say before the <hi>King</hi> himselfe; J
<hi>would wish that of such a Iudge in England now we might have
the skin hanged up. It were a goodly signe, the signe of the
Iudges skinne.</hi> And certainly till the skins of some of these
Spirituall Devill-Iudges be fleyde off, and their neckes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with a Tiburne-tippet for their extortions and strange
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:1659:224"/>
oppressions of his Majesties people, in a way of justice, the
people shall never live in quiet, but the Wolves will bite and
devour them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Burroes, notwithstanding all this malice, proceeds in
his resolution as well as the Dr. on the 2. of October last,
being the Lords-day, he goes to his owne Parish-Church,
without any absolution, whereupon Nucoman gives over
service and departs, and all the people after him; Then he
goes to another Church where he was excommunicated;
And after that to a third, they all doe the like and leave the
Church.</p>
            <p>On Monday the 3. of October, being the Sessions-day
for the Towne, he prefers a new Inditement against Nuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for his Innovations, the Mayor and Recorder persuade
him to desist, he refuseth to doe it; Then they wish him to
put it off till next Sessions, because it was a new case. He
answered, the case was plaine, and that he must by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
indite him this Sessions or not at all. Then they fall
to perswade the Iury, not to finde the Inditement; The Iury
being stout honest men, notwithstanding finde it, <hi>Billa vera,</hi>
this Innovation of Nucoman being a notorious affront both
against the Statute and his Majesties late Declarations; They
desire them to change their verdict; The honest men refuse
to doe it: Thereupon the Sessions is presently adiourned for
10. dayes.</p>
            <p>Nuoman posts to the Arch-bishop of Canterbury, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaint
him with these proceedings, and to crave his direction
what shalbe done.</p>
            <p>Upon his retorne he brings downe a Pursevant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with him to arrest Mr. Burroes only for prosecuting him
in the Kings behalfe, enters his house, and first by pollicy,
after that by power seekes to apprehend him, sets the whole
Towne in an uproare, gets the Sessions adiourned 9. weekes
longer to the end that he may escape the punishment of the
Statute, and remove the Inditemeut thence into the Kings
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1659:225"/>
Bench for delay. Thus are the Kings good Subjects abused by
a packe of Iewde companions, and the High Commission
made the Instrument, not only of oppressing his Majesties
best subjects, but of patronizing knaues and offenders in
their open contempts against his Majesties Lawes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
the chiefe use it now serves for. Master
Burroes threatens them all with the Star-chamber, for
a conspiracie, and denying him and the Kings Iustice; And so
the matter yet hangs in suspence.</p>
            <p>This case is like to be a president for all England to follow;
And if all people where Communion-Tables are turned into
Altars, or rayled in Altarwise, or they inforced in a new ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to come up to the rayle to receive; will preferre the like
Inditements against their Ministers (yea and Bishops too,
the chiefe Agents in these Novelties, upon the second clause
of the Statute of 1. Eliz. c. 2.) whereupon they are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
6. whole monthes, without bayle or mainprise, upon
the first Conviction and Inditement, and to forfaite one whole
yeares profits of all their Ecclesiasticall livings &amp; promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s;
And for the second, to be imprisoned and deprived of all
their livings <hi>ipso facto;</hi> for the third to forfait all their goods,
and be for ever made uncapable of any Ecclesiasticall living
or preferments; Our busy Romish Innovatours will shrinke
in their bornes, &amp; we shalbe no more troubled with Altars,
rayling in Lords-Tables, or ascending up to them to receive.
