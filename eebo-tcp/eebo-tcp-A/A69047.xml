            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have penned this conference anent
ceremonies; short, that thine eyes
should not be wearied with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it: plaine, that thy wits should
not be troubled with the understanding
of it: generall, because they are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in sundry treatises already hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
My purpose onely is, the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the simple and unlearned, to
guard their minds, that they bee not
drawn or stollen away from the truth,
by these common and deceaving argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are much in the mouthes
of those who mind earthly things. The
speechmen in it are, <hi>Cosmophilus,</hi> that
is, a lover of the World: and <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
that is, a lover of God. The love
of the one of their two opposite objects,
either to God or to the World, leads the
opposite armies, whether of preachers, or
of professors in these decaying dayes. The
true badge of the lover of God, is, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
to plead for God and his cause:
although it should be to his worldly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.
The true badge of the lover
<pb facs="tcp:14790:3"/>
of the World, is to plead for the World,
and the belly-advantage: howsoever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a fair (although a fectlesse) profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
That proverb proves now over
true, <hi>The belly is busie, and witty:
and it wants eares.</hi>

many in this age among us, who draw
their wits from their belly, and their
wealth to it. So that; although a lowd
plain speaking truth do meet these belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted-men
in the teeth: yet they heare
not, they are deafe; for they have no
eares where their wits are. But the day
will dawe, when they shall be forced to
heare on the deafest side of their head. O
then, how careful should we be, knowing
the terrour of that day, to perswade men
to the love of the truth: &amp; to persevere
in it our selves, preassing to approve our
selves both unto God, and unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men: that so we may receive
that crowne of glory, that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,

               <p>Well <hi>Cosmophile,</hi> yee make but a mock
of the matter of my mourning; yet I will answer
you in your own termes: surely they will never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>And why so I pray you <hi>Theophile?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Because they are so full of Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
ingredients, my stomake loathes them, and all
such Romish Drogs and Dregs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>No <hi>Theophile,</hi> yee must not say so. The
particulars in these articles, the practise whereof is
presently urged (except it be kneeling in the act of
receiving the sacrament) were in use in the prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14790:4"/>
Church, before the Antichrist occupied the
Roman Chaire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I see <hi>Cosmophile,</hi> yee except kneeling in
the act, and that iustly: seeing it hath neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor mother, but the Antichrist in his full
growth: and I am sory it should find so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
patrons. As to the rest, how ancient soever
some of them may seeme to be, yet all were but
humane inventions, beginning and rising with the
Antichrist, whatsoever the intention was. As for
their use, it ended in abuse: their devotion in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition:
as it ordinarily befalles to all human
devices in matter of divine duties. And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
having setled himselfe in his throne, called
them in, and many other also of that quality, to
his coyn-house, and stamped them all with his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
image, that henceforth they might bee
known for the proper and peculiar coyn of his
kingdome, where-ever they were fouud current in
the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>O but they are now purged from all these
abuses, and superstitions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Cosmophile,</hi> it is no small paines
would purge them. For although they be like wax
in receiving; yet are they like brasse in reteining
the stampe of superstition: they are like the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard,
that cannot change his spots. I would think
them then rightly purged, if the kirk were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purged of them. They should be purged as
the fire purgeth the stubble; seeing they defile the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14790:4"/>
puritie, and deface the beautie of Gods worship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>You must not think <hi>Theophile,</hi> that it is a
good reason to reiect any thing, because it hath
been, or is in the Roman Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>The reason is good enough <hi>Cosmophile,</hi>
and holds well in these things, without the which
Christs Kirk may be, and abide in good case, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
with all her orders and ornaments,
wherewith the Evangell hath adorned her: in
these things, which (being indifferent as yee say)
have been abused and defiled with idolatry: in
these things, which, for the most part, are badges
of the Romish beast, and baits to superstition: if
the brasen serpent, Gods own ordinance being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
abused to idolatry, was broken and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished;
much more their base and bruckle ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
mans invention, should be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>O but some of these remaines <hi>Theophile,</hi>
even in reformed Churches, and are not much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed
by sundry learned Protestant Theologues.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>True, they remain <hi>Cosmophile,</hi> but as a
black spot in a faire face, which many of of the
godly-wise would be glad were wiped away. As to
mens not disallowance, or silence it makes not
lawfulnesse. I could give as learned Theologues,
two for one, disallowing.</p>

               <p>It is your ministers <hi>Theophile,</hi> who mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informe

               <p>I would have them to propone and prove

               <p>I will give you these three <hi>Cosmophile.</hi> 1.
The bands of their fideli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y. 2. The credit of their

and charity, to their worthy predecessors in this
our Kirk.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>What call ye the bands of their fidelity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Their oath and their subscription to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14790:5"/>
that confession of faith, which two do bind us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
which are professors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>O but these bonds may be loosed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I confesse they may be violently bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but lawfully loosed they cannot be. For an
oath is the strongest bond that the tongue can
make: and subscription is the strongest bond that
the hand can make. If ye breake these bonds, tell
me, what shall bind a man?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm</speaker>
               <p>I tell you <hi>Theoph.</hi> our superiours, King
and Church may loose them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>No <hi>Cosmophile,</hi> that may they not. For
both consented, yea and by their authority presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this confession, and urged these bonds on all:
binding first themselves, then others, to hold fast
their profession, according to that confession,
during all the dayes of their life. So the bands of
the grave must bind al, before we can be loosed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
these bonds. Indeed <hi>Cosmophile</hi> there is harder, and
faster knots in them, then ye consider of; namely
in the band of the oath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>What be these I pray you <hi>Theophile?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>In that band there is a double, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble
knot. The one, the perswasion of the
truth. The other: the promise for the truth.
In the former, the takers of the oath solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
professed their perswasion wrought in their
hearts by Gods spirit, through his word, of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
truth of that religion, doctrine, and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
professed in the Kirke of Scotland at that

time: and after to be continued therein: and by
the contrary, the detestation of all false religion,
Papistry, and all the particular poynts thereof, as
they were then condemned by our kirk. In the
latter, they solemnly promised to maintaine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
prof<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>It is true <hi>Theophile,</hi> that band and the
knots thereof, holds fast upon the substantialll
poynts of religion, doctrine, and discipline, which
a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Surely <hi>Cosmophile,</hi> the matter of the
oath, and all the particulars thereof, are like a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Taber<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

might seem to be indifferent in themselves seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and apart considered: yet ye must not thinke
it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thing indifferent, to single, and pick out the
small pinnes of it (as yee account them) at your
pleasure, lest all (as is like this day) fall downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>But will you consider <hi>Theophile,</hi> that your
formes, and ceremonies for the which; and ours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the which yee stand, have not entred in that
oath, being but things indifferent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Yes but they have <hi>Cosmophile:</hi> for in it
ours in generall termes are included, and yours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14790:6"/>
and abjured. Farther, this oath is relative,
and hath respect to the former confession, bookes
of discipline, and acts of assemblies. By the which
particularly, and expresly our formes were
received, ratified, and passed under practise, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Christs ordinance: and yours rejected,
and debarred out of our Kirk, as Antichristian
rites.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>That oath <hi>Theophile,</hi> so farre as it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
these outward, and alterable formes, or the
like, was but indefinite, and conditionall: that is,
such formes as it should please the Church for the
time to appoynt, continue, or change, according
to that power and libertie she did professe herselfe,
in sundry acts of assemblies, to have over such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It was both determinate and absolute
<hi>Cosmophile,</hi> even in these formes, and such was the
mind of our Kirk at that time, which (as I sayd in
the former answer) received ours, and rejected
yours. So that her Profession of her power, in the
change of things indifferent, extends not to their
formes, which are so particularly and by name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:
and the great seale of that solemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
set upon the continuance in reteining of the
one, and in outholding and withstanding of the
other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>I think <hi>Theophile,</hi> that was an unadvised
Oath, in respect of these indifferent formes, which
should not be made the subject of an Oath: seeing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14790:7"/>
they are so subject to changes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I think <hi>Cosmophile,</hi> ye are evill advised to
condemne so wise, and worthy a Kirk, consisting
both of preachers and professors of all estates, in
an errand of so great importance, as if they had
not known nor keeped these inseparable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a lawfull oath, which the Lord himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
Ierem. 4. 2. That an oath should bee in
<hi>Truth,</hi> and so not false: in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> or discreri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so not rash: In <hi>Justice,</hi> and so not unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
or unequitable. The first and last respect
chiefly the matter of a lawfull oath; and the mid,
the manner. Now that this oath was given in
truth, and to the truth, it is cleare, because they
swore their resolution and perswasion of the
truth of these heades contained therein. That
it was given in judgement, not rashly or unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
(as yee say) it is cleare by the words of
the confession, where it is sayd, that after long
and due examination of their conscience, being
throughly resolved in the trueth by the word and
Spirit of God, they gave it. That it was given
in justice, it is cleare, because all the particulars
they swore too, were, and are agreeable to
GODS word, serving for the edification of
the Kirke, and overthrow of the kingdome of
Sathan, and of his eldest sonne the Antichrist:
and that their formes, which yee call indifferent,
were not such in the judgement of our Kirke,
when they appoynted the one, and discharged the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14790:7"/>
other, is evident by the religious and grave rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
given for their so doing. As that ours were
according to Christs institution, agreeable to the
simplicitie of the Evangell, profitable for the
preservation of the purity of Gods holy worship,
and eschewing of the occasions, and countenance
of superstition, and conformity with Rome: but
yours by the contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>I see then <hi>Theophile,</hi> yee are loath to grant
these formes to be indifferent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>That I am <hi>Cosm.</hi> and although I should,
yee would be little neerer your purpose. For it is
neither the unadvisednesse of the maner; nor the
the indifferencie of the matter of an oath, will
loose the band thereof once layd on, as long as
the indifferent matter is not turned to a sinfull
use, or abuse. Although such cases might possibly
hinder the making of it: it is onely the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
looses all. The oath which Iosua and the
Princes of Israel gave to the Gibeonites, Ios. 9. 14.
15. was unadvisedly made: for they consulted not
(sayes the text) with the mouth of the Lord: yet
it was advisedly keeped, for the religious reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the great and glorious name of God. If
yee be able to prove, that our formerly established
formes are turned unlawfull, unprofitable, ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable,
profane, or superstitious, goe to, try
your wits. Your Bishops and Doctors publickly
professed they would not, they could not.</p>

               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Yea but for all that <hi>Theophile,</hi> your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Sure then <hi>Cosm.</hi> yours must fly in at the
window: For ye have no lawfull warrant to bring
them in, in the roome of so old and kindly posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
who have all your lyfrent takes, sworne, and
subscribed to them, to stand sure, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie
of that dreadful damnation, in the great day
of the Lord. Beside in so doing, shall yee not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the guiltinesse of double perjurie by the
violent ejection of the one, which were sworn to:
and the fraudulent and forcible intrusion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which were sworn against.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Ye aggreage the matter strangely <hi>Theoph.</hi>
in making it both sinfull and hurtfull.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I will add the third also <hi>Cosm.</hi> shameful.
Consider that worthy example of good Abraham,
and yee shall see that, and more, Gen. 14. 22. 23.
When the king of Sodom offred to him the goods
which he brought back, after battell against the
Kings, he refused to receive them, and why? I <hi>have
lift up my hand,</hi> sayes Abraham, <hi>to the Lord, the most
high God, the possessor of heaven, that I should so doe:</hi> and
wherefore that? <hi>lest the King of Sodom should say, I
have made Abraham rich? Abraham</hi> thought, that
had been to him a great discredit, and shamefull
slander. Now have we not all lift up our hand to
this LORD, the most high GOD, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor
of heaven and earth, that we shall continue in
the maintenance and obedience of these comely
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14790:8"/>
and customable formes of our Kirk, and not to
borrow, beg, or bring back again these formes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred,
and abjured: lest, beside both sinne and
skaith, to our great disgrace and shame, it should
also be sayd: The Antichristian King of spirituall
Sodom, hath enriched, or rather bewitched us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>I will leave now the purpose of the oath
<hi>Theoph.</hi> and come to the persons who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it concerns.
Howsoever, it would seem that these who have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
taken it, cannot be freed from the bonds
of it: yet ye know, such as were not come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
yeares at that time: who have never personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken it: as also the succeding posterity, are not
bound by it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Cosm.</hi> (to passe by the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
whose case is alike with preachers) there are
few either among our Ministers, or among your
Bishops, who are not personally bound, both when
they passed their course in the Colledges of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
and when they entred in the office of the
Ministery, beside the renewing of these bands sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
times since in particular synods, and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
As to these forenamed, who have not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
taken it, or in time comming shall not, they
are bound really. Because this bond of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and predecessors (who at that time represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the whole body, and all sorts of the members
of our reformed Kirk) as upon their parts it was
personall: so also it was reall, passing to their
children, being about a matter which concerned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14790:9"/>
their good and welfare; as well as theirs, who took
the oath. Now to cleare this poynt <hi>Cosm</hi> If that
oath of Israel to the Gibeonites, bound old, and
yong, parents and posterity, in a matter more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and of lesse importance (albeit the oath was
obtained by craft, and ignorance) much more
doth this oath binde, in a matter so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
so profitable, and with such knowledge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liberation, resolution, and perswasion
made unto God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>That oath of Israel <hi>Theoph.</hi> concerned this
present life: but this oath concernes our religion;
and the life to come: so they are not alike.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It is true <hi>Cosm.</hi> the two lives are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
But as for the oath, if the band of it hold fast

                  </gap>nt the one, and the matters belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
tell me, by what reason it should not far more
hold in things concerning the other? If even
common civil bands, or worldly contracts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an oath, binds parents and predecessors, who
make it: and children and post<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rity, who made it
not: much more should this religious contract,
and holy covenant, sealed both with oath and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
binde both to the constant profession,
and practise of that truth, which is according to
godlinesse. Did not that religious vow which Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua
made, chap. 24. 14. <hi>I and my fathers house</hi> (sayes
he) <hi>will serve the Lord,</hi> bind not onely those who
were present, but even his posteritie through their
generations? Did not that stone which Iosua set
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14790:9"/>
up as a witnesse of the covenant, which the people
did make to for sake all strange Gods, and to serve
the Lord, vers. 26. continue a witnesse of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of children and posterity, who (after Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua
and all the Elders that out-lived him, were
dead) brake that covenant, and served Baalim,
Iud. 2. 12. Did not likewise that solemne oath and
covenant made by Asa King of Iuda, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that they would seek and serve God, 2. Chron.
15. bind all, old and yong, parents, and posterity,
among whom, whosoever afterward fell away, were
even guilty of the breach of this particular oath
and covenant, as well, as of the generall covenant
to be Gods people. Here are in the like case, like
examples.</p>

and as ever yee would dwell in the mountaine of

the great oath of God. Beware of dangerous and

which hee made by God to the King of Babel,

hard and heavy challenge, and threatning from
the Lord, by his Prophet Ezekiel, cap. 17. 18. 19.

against such superfluous, and superstitious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.

of some transporting passion, as feare, favour, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,

were a great oversight in the not constant profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the formerly avowed truth. I have seen the
day <hi>Cosm.</hi> when even your principall pillars have

            <sp>

               <p>Yet <hi>Theoph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for all yee have sayd, if these
things be in themselves in different, or lawfully, why
may they not be received?</p>

yee sing ever one song, and strike ever upon
one string. But give me licence to question you a
little; Why confound ye indifferencie and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Seeing (to speake properly and strictly) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie
is in respect of the nature of a thing: and
lawfulnesse in respect of the use of it. It is true, we
have a liberty in things indifferent, to doe, or not
to doe: but when wee come to the particular and
determinate act or use of them, if they be found
expedient and profitable, then properly are they
counted and called lawful. But this is your cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
<hi>Cosmophile,</hi> under the generalitie, ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and plausible sound of words (passing by the
proper signification of them) to colour all your
purposes, which you propone: that yee may
steale away a conclusion by appearance, where
there is no logical or lawful consequence.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:14790:11"/>
               <speaker>Cosmoph.</speaker>
               <p>I wil answer to your first question
<hi>Theophile,</hi> I call them things indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which are neither commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by Gods word: and so neither good nor evil
in themselves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Then if so be <hi>Cosmoph.</hi> are ye not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by Gods word, and told, that it is not good
to plead and persecute so hotly for them, as ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
doe? And is this a good argument of yours,
Those things are indifferent in themselves, that is,
neither commanded, nor forbidden, neither good
nor ill: Therefore we vvil have them reduced,
and repossessed in our Church. Indeed <hi>Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phile,</hi>
ye have need to learn better Logicke from
your Doctors. For it is not the indifferencie of a
thing, that will vvarrant the admission, farre lesse
the readmission of it againe into a Church.
Yee must come to the use, wherein a thing is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evil nor good, lawful nor unlawful, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
nor inexpedient. And if yee can prove, that
your formes in their use are expedient and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ours not at all, or lesse then yours, I shal

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>

               <p>Will ye <hi>Cosm.</hi> put them to the triall of
that true touch stone, of these Apostolicall rules,
order, comelinesse, edification, peace, charity,
Rom. 14. 1. Cor, 14. ye shall easily perceive, what
yee and they both prove. Let wofull experience
this day be judge, and give out sentence. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,

of your formes, that hardly in outward shew can
they be discerned; answeres that to order? The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuring
and defiling vaile of Antichristian ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
drawen upon the comely putitie, and simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
of the Evangell, agreeth that with comelines?
The weak ones offended, &amp; distracted with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what hand to turne to: the Papists heartned
and hardned in their superstition: the stronger,
and wel resolved grieved to see things go so; makes
this for edification? By dissention and division, the
bowels of a motherly Kirke rented; stands this
with peace and charity? So these rules clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
how perillous and pernicious your formes

               <p>Will yee look <hi>Theoph.</hi> to the example of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Wee will keep us within the boundrod

among whom many both worthy preachers and

them. Onely this farre for the form and state of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14790:12"/>
their Kirk: their case and ours is very farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
They are free (although not of every consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
band) yet of the bands, which, beside
these, bindeth us strictly. As 1. the band of Oath.
2. Subscription. 3. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

4. publick profession. 5. uniforme practise; all
standing and pleading for our formes: and against
yours. They have continued and kept them still,
which our Kirk did so advisedly cast out, and so
long hath holden out, as pestilential clouts of that
Romish infective superstition. So if ye would leave
your unlike examples, and your jangling in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
wherein ye take roome to reele, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>unne to
many starting holes: and if ye would consider par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
what is the singular case of our Kirk in
this respect, ye would be forced to confesse, that it
is not a thing lawfull, nor indifferent, to reduce
them. And albeit in the judgement of some Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
where some of them are in a Kirk, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without the disturbance of the peace thereof,
be removed, they may be tollerate: yet all in one

is not tollerable. The consideration of

the monuments and remainders of Idolatry, and
all the occasions and entisements to it, be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
What wil become then of your ceremonies?
The truth is <hi>Cosm.</hi> as long as that man of sin hath
place upon the face of the earth, they wil never be
cleansed. And as for preaching, it is appoynted by
God, not to cleanse them, but to consume them,
and him both. 2. Thess. 2. Indeed <hi>Cosm.</hi> ye may be
the Popes Pensioner, for the paines ye take to vent,
and advance his wares.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Yet seeing other things <hi>Theoph.</hi> which
have been abused to superstition, are purged,
and retained: as for example, our Temples, and
Churches, wherein the true God is now truely
worshipped: tell me, why may not these things
in like manner be purged and retained?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I desired you before <hi>Cosm.</hi> to hold off
your unlike examples, but yee doe not: therefore
by answer either to content you, or convict you, I
say 1. Temples, or Kirkes have a needfull use, both
natural and civil, in the commodious, and comely
containing of people, for the publick practise of
Gods worship. So the abuse may be purged, and
they retained. But the best use of your ceremonies
is but abuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being removed, they fall, as idle,
and fectlesse things, to the ground. 2. Albeit a
Kirk be the place, wherein God is publickly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped:
yet it hath no place or state in the exercise
of that worship, as any part, poynt, or ceremony
thereof: as your formes have. 3. Sometimes some
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14790:13"/>
needful circumstances may require, even the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to be removed, and razed: as the Temples of
Idols were in the dayes of Constantine, and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,
two godly Emperours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Would your Ministers <hi>Theoph.</hi> in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
tell the people, that these ceremonies should
be, and are used, without any Papistical superstition
and opinion of merit, of inherent holines, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie,
or of necessity, as if they were essential parts
of Gods worship, this would purge all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>If they should so doe <hi>Cosmophile,</hi> how
would you purge them of the slander of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
who before in their doctrine have told the
people so oft, that such ceremonies should not be
used at all, because superstitious. And albeit they
should tell, and tell again, as ye prescrive, what assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
have ye, that therby the hearts and minds of
simple people should be purged of that naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
they have to superstition: so long as the
objects &amp; occasions of it stand in their eyes. And
so much the rather, when they see such things so
violently enforced, as if they were matters of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
efficacie and necessity in Gods worship. I must
say <hi>Cosm. little wit makes meekle travell.</hi> Were it not
better to fill up the pit, and so to take away all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of falling in it: then to spend time unnecessarily
to warn folks to go by it, who notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
through forgetfulnes, carelesnes, or want of
light, might fal into it? Preachers &amp; preaching may
be better imployed, then to be made slaves to your
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14790:14"/>
ceremonies, by giving continuall warning to saif
from their ill, when no sound warrant can be given
for their good.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I have answered that already in effect,
<hi>Cosm.</hi> But I will adde this further: It is true, God
hath given authority to both, but with this restric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and direction, (sayes the Apostle Paul 2. Cor.
13. 10.) <hi>not for the destruction, but for the edification of
his Kirk.</hi> For the power of authoritie is the power
of equity, and not of injury. Now by urging to
re-edifie that, which was justly destroyed: and to
destroy that, which was lawfully built; what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
authority can free the doers from transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Gal. 2. or themselves from guiltinesse.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>

Mans authority is not absolute in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
but i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is tied to these former scriptures: from

               <p>One thing sayd, and another thing
seen, <hi>Cosm.</hi> We see sensibly, it rather continues and
increases offence. For the hearts of the lovers of
the truth, of King, and Kirk, are exceedingly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
when they see humane authority enforcing,
what divine authority hath forbidden: And the
hearts of the enemies to all, wonderfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
when they see authority so favour and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their formes. For then there is no perill of
offence, when the expediencie and utilitie of the
use of things indifferent, is evident: but if that be
not, the injunction of authority is very inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,

which is written. Before yee had yeelded to their
ceremonies, ye should have seen them in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
yeild to your substance. Ye have been over sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>Cosm.</hi> in going awayward to Rome, to meet
them: but who sees, that they have any mind to
meet you mid-way. Ye think to draw them to you:
but ye have chosen the wrong cords, their own ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
by the which they will draw you neerer
to their Babel: then ye shal do them to your Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14790:15"/>
And if they seem to draw neere to you by such
means, ye had need to beware of Iudas kiss, that is,
treachery &amp; cruelty under the cloke of hypocrisie.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Ye are too much afraid for so few, honest &amp;
innocent ceremonies; the peaceable receving wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It is not your word or vote will cleanse
them, they have been so oft convict &amp; condemned;
and to receive one ceremonie, is to receive all. For
they are not loose, bnt linked, as in a chain, so inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably,
that draw one, draw all. It is but your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
to let some few, that look most smoothly, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>It may wel be a deep wit, but it seems to
be no divine wisedom, to trouble the peace of so
vvell a constitute Kirk, by intruding such idle cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
as if there were worth in them, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
the meanest point of that peace. Surely even
an approved politick wit, would be loath to make
such an interchange: seeing any one of the least
points of the peace of Christs Kirk, is worth all
your gracelesse and peacelesse ceremonies.</p>

               <p>Now I desire to have your particular answer
severally: first for the authority of our Kirk. Have
not the conclusions of that late assembly, holden
at Perth, credit to take away all scruples: and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your conscience anent the receiving and
practising of these formes.</p>

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly they have not <hi>Cosm.</hi> for it is
Scripture, and not Kirk-conclusions, which settles,
and satisfies the conscience. As for that Assembly,
the unlawfull constitution, the violent and posted
proceeding, and the crafty closing of it, wel enough
known to all, declares those conclusions to have
been, rather collusions, and delusions.</p>

               <p>I am not speaking fantasie <hi>Cosm.</hi> but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
I wil put in bellance with that unlawful assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
which was so divided in judgement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
all the former worthy, and well constitute As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
for the space of moe then a Iubile of

let a constant and conscientious hand hold it, and
ye shal sensibly perceive, how light and little worth
your one is in reducing these superstitious formes,
in respect of the weight and worth of all those, in
removing them.</p>

               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Wel <hi>Theoph.</hi> ye should not reason against
the Acts of an Assembly: nor set your selfe as a

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Ye see <hi>Cosm.</hi> it is not I, but many godly,
and grave Assemblies reason against one pretended
assembly, and doe justly chalenge it of levity, and
perjurie for restoring those so deservedly forefalted
Romish rites. Farther, ye know, that how sever the

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14790:16"/>
yet the ordinances of the Kirk, are presented
to us, not with the necessity of beleeving, but with
the liberty of judging. For albeit the judgment of
jurisdiction, to censure, belongs not to me: yet I
should have the judgement of discretion to satisfie
my conscience, by the warrant of the word, in all

               <p>Your kirk <hi>Cosm.</hi> what doe you call your

such vvisedome and prudence, by long and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold

As for schisme or separation, it seems ye vvot
not vvhat they meane For in the unitie both of
judgement and practise, we yet stand with the kirk
wherein we were baptised, and brought up: and
vvhereunto we gaue our right hand of fellowship,
and band of fidelitie: which being broken by you,
ye may justlie bee called schismatikes, both from
this Kirk, and from your selves also: seeing ye have
broken down the beautiful walles of our Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,

commendations of the good and godly Kings of

               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>I acknowledge he is, and so was David,
a most worthy Prince and Prophet too: yet he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>There is not a minister <hi>Theoph.</hi> within his

               <p>It may be so <hi>Cosm.</hi> but I know it should

in the house of God, sanctified &amp; set a part by him
to that service, both should and wil know best the
wil of his maister, anent the poynts, and discharge
of his own calling: and likewise, what concernes
the weil, good order, and diet of the family, and
domestickes thereof. Surely it may seeme strange,
and must spring either from a high presumption of
selfe conceit: or from a high contempt of the holy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14790:18"/>
ministry, that credit shall be given to every one in
their own calling (yea go even down to the basest
mechanicks) but it shal be denied to Ministers in
their calling; they and it both being subject to the

               <p>Is he not our native and gracious King,

               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Wel <hi>Theoph.</hi> if ye care not for his pleasure,
yet I think ye vvill respect his displeasure, and feare
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14790:18"/>
his Majesties offence, vvhich will draw vvith it so
many fearful evils upon the Church, if these things

offence, ye make it to be the offence of anger,
not of ignorance. For of ignorance it cannot be, in
respect of his so great a measure of light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
and of anger, it will not be, in respect he is
indued with so peerlesse vvisedom and clemencie.
So neither can he stumble through lack of light;
neither vvil he tumble over his anger, as ye say, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his loyal subjects. So I affirme <hi>Cosm.</hi> ye deserve
neither Bishoprick, nor pension, at his Ma. hand,

his vvill: but vve must rest upon the vvil &amp;
word, both of his and our king. Yea and your great
Donns, and Doctors professed, that reason, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and antiquity are against these things: and ye
have nothing for you, but his Majestis vvill, and the
feare of his offence. But it seems ye favour most
your own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, seing ye look these light cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>

                  </gap>remony, as if they were metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed

danger for commission against Gods ordinance,
as for omission of mans. And make what ye will
of them, it is too neere marching. For they have
made an innovation and alteration of the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of faith, sworn and subscrived by us: so that a
new one is thrust into the room therof. Moreover,
whatsoever is a matter of conscience, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but in so far, it is also a matter of faith. Now
will you, or dare you say, that there is no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be kept in the using of such things as may
defile Gods holy and pure worship. But I will
come neere you, and try your faith a little <hi>Cosm,</hi>
He who sweareth, and for his worldly hinderance
changeth, doth he not cast a great impediment in
his own way to the mountain of God? But he,
who sweareth for his spirituall furtherance, and
yet changeth, casteth a farre greater, if mercie
and repentance remove it not. Beleeve ye this <hi>Cos.</hi>
it is Gods word, Psalm. 15. Beleeve ye that all the
poynts of Gods worship, both inward &amp; outward,
should be directed by his word? Beleeve yee that
there should be no communion betwixt Christ and
Belial. These are matters of faith, founded on Gods
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14790:19"/>

will, whether for the doctrine of faith: or for that
divine holy habit of the soule; they belong to the
one, as a part of the subject: or to the other, as a
part of the object, that is, ye must beleeve, that they
are either with, or against the word.</p>

               <p>If so it should be <hi>Cos.</hi> then it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that your ceremonies, to the which you would
have us to conform, were first freed of superstition,
which shall never be. Therefore ye must turn you,
and consider where the best formes, the reformed
formes are, according to the holy patterne: and let
conformity be there, and so uniformity: else it may

up against them, affirming that these indifferent
ceremonies (as yee call them) have bred greater
difference, and division in the kirk, and yet do, then
the doctrine it selfe. They have ever been (as the
story of the Kirk in all ages reports) that apple of
contention cast in by that old and subtile Serpent,
which hath vexed the Paradise of God. Therefore
would to God (say they) that the Kirk were once

to deny the benefits of the Kirk to those, vvho
are both in, and of the Kirk; or to punish either in

man. As to vvorldly favour and places: it is better

               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Now I will leave the Professors, and come
to the Preachers. It will go very hardly with them,
if they obey not. For the Church will take their
calling from them, and close their mouth: and the

               <p>That is a hard saying, indeed, &amp; drawes
with it a great hinderance to the free course of
Christs Evangell: and a furtherance to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
course. Yet if so shal be, the comfort of
faithfull Preachers is, that no creature is able to
take a good conscience, the love of God, and the
liberty of the Spirit from them. But I will aske,
what kirk is this of yours, that will close up the
mouthes of the faithfull servants of Christ. The
good people it cannot be: for they heavily regrate
such iniquity. The faithfull Pastors it cannot bee:
for in none of their meetings, generall, provinciall,
or presbyteriall, have they allowed such work. So
it rests, that your Bishops must bee this crabbed
Kirk, who being once so solemnly banished out of
our Kirk, as belonging to that Antichristian crew,
hath cropen back againe upon us, and minds after
this manner, to revenge the old quarrel. Alas <hi>Cosm.</hi>
if they proceed after that fort, how shall the rooms
of honest Preachers be supplied?</p>

               <p>There may be anew <hi>Cosm.</hi> and yet little
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14790:21"/>
worth, who will rather defile their roomes, then fill
them; who will love the fleece better then the
flock: who will study more to be Patrons of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie,
&amp; ceremonies, to please the Bishops: then
paternes of pietie, charitie, and sobriety, to profite
the people.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>But ye must consider more deeply of this
matter, <hi>Theoph.</hi> ye must not think that your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
should leave their calling, and forsake their
flock, for such things: that wil be an ill and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Ye mistake the matter very farr, <hi>Cosmop.</hi>
for they are not leavers of their calling, but your
Bishops are reavers of their calling from them.
They are not forsakers of their flockes, but your
Bishops are wilfull and violent ruggers of them
from their flock. They are patients &amp; not agents:
sufferers of violence, and not actors in that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse:
who would rather leave, and forsake
their lives, if it lay in their hands. Your Bishops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Cosm.</hi> for their worldly ease, profit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
in effect willingly have left their former
calling, or pastorall charge, and violently thrust
honest men out of their places: because they will
not allow their evill course.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Nay but they should not suffer themselves
to be deprived of their ministery, and loose the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
therof, for matters of this indifferent nature.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>Ye must confesse then <hi>Cos.</hi> that farr lesse

them from their ministery, for matters of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
nature: and if they doe, they are damned
of them own selves, Tit. 3. 11. They avow and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
them to be matters indifferent: but they urge
them as matters of necessity, and lay upon their
omission, the pain of deprivation. Therefore our
faithfull Pastors, who count them not indifferent,
may lawfully suffer themselves, rather to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from their calling, then deprive themselves of a
good conscience, by doing any thing against it.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Let alone <hi>Theoph.</hi> I tell you over again, it
is better for them to yield to these things, then to
loose their ministery, or the exercise of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>They loose no ministery <hi>Cosm.</hi> who keep
a good conscience, and give testimony by suffering
to Christs cause: that is a speciall poynt of their
ministery, when they are called to it. They stand
in the reputation of GOD, faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
let men account of them as they will. As to
the closing up of the exercise thereof, ye may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how the contrary will fall out. For the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
taken from them in their own parishes by mens
malice, is given to them in prison, or banishment,
by Gods providence. Albeit they be cast in bands,
or under banishment, yet Gods word is not
bound, nor banished.</p>

               <p>Will yee consider <hi>Cosm.</hi> that the earth,

Iland is but a silly angle of it. If it cast them out,
and close the doore upon them, their provident

care for them, and open in forrain nations to them
a wide doore for the entry of the Evangel, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
declares. They wil never want maintenance,
who have care to maintaine, and entertaine a good
conscience: which is a continual feast. Alas <hi>Cosmo.</hi>
it is a lamentable thing to see, how some learned
men, sometime well thought of, have turned now
both their tongue, and their penne, to the wrong
hand, for worlds gain: and do direct the darts of
their variable wits, unsetled judgements, and sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife
learning, against the truth, and sincere patrons

they wont to throw them against their Romish e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>There is nothing in your mouth, but a
Ministery, a Ministery. But I must tell you, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
and take a good conscience from it, is but a
misery. What is the price of it, when the power of
it is gone? and the worth of it, when the vertue is
away? Is not grace, and a good conscience the life
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14790:23"/>
of it? if they be gone, it is but a dead ministery, and
so farre better to burie it, then to beare the dead
burthen of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cosm.</speaker>
               <p>Ye care not <hi>Theoph.</hi> for making of emptie

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theo.</speaker>
               <p>The Lord knowes the contrary: albeit
I confesse, that pulpits are then most empty, when
those who occupy them, are empty of holy humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
heavenly wisedome, and Christian courage for
Christs cause. Silent sufferings of faithfull ministers
for the truth, prove oft-times as profitable to
Gods people, to confirme them in it: as eloquent
Sermons of the truth to informe them of it. That
people is most desolate, whose Pastors are most
dissolute, either in doctrine, or life. God can and
will provide for his people, the means and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their comfort, as pleases him best.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cos.</speaker>
               <p>I am of that judgment, that a minister should
not suffer the losse of his calling for any thing, but
for that he should suffer the losse of his life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
               <p>And ye will not say, that any Christian
magistrate wil or should for such omission take his
life: and if any would, then the case is altered (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the practise of such ceremonies were indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent)
and turnd in the case of confession, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
for the which one might lawfully suffer.
Your judgement is not sound <hi>Cosm.</hi> touching this
matter: for there is great difference between doing
&amp; suffering. We may suffer the gratest evill of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14790:23"/>
rather then do the least evil of sinn. We
may commit no evill of sin, how small soever, that
good of any sort may come of it. Now, to practise
these superstitious ceremonies, is many wayes scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
and to give a scandal, is sin, or moral trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
expresly forbidden in the law.</p>

               <p>Have at you then <hi>Theoph.</hi> when these two
divine duties, to wit, <hi>The preaching of the Gospell:</hi> and
<hi>The not practising of inconvenient ceremonies</hi> (as yee call
them) cannot both the performed together by your
Pastors: but of the necessity, if they stand to the
one, they must fall from the other: then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and weightiest dutie, which is the preaching of
the Gospel, should prevaile: the liberty wherof in
that case, they should redeem even by the practise
of these ceremonies: and so let fall the lesser dutie,
which is the not practising of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theop.</speaker>
               <p>Your great Gun <hi>Cosm.</hi> hath raised a great
smoke but hath done no skaith to the cause. For ye
divide between these two divine duties, by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
necessity, which is both wrong &amp; weak. Wrong,
because it is no divine dividing necessity, by any
ordinance of Gods word, which (by the contrary)
couples these two duties together: but it is
an humane dividing necessity, by violence of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14790:24"/>
mans enforcing authority. Weake, because experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
our school-mistresse, may tell you, that the
Lord oft-times keepes together in the persons
of faithful preachers these two duties in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
Experience proves this in the persons of
sundry, who are violently thrust out from their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
charges. Thus divine providence stands
out against your humane violence. Againe, for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answer, I will let you see the inequality, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
quality of these these two duties: <hi>To preach
the word,</hi> is an affirmative dutie and respects the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of good: <hi>Not to practise inconvenient Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
is a negative dutie, and respects the not
doing of evil. Now the affirmative may be without
sin in some cases, and somtimes and places omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
as when one can neither keepe, nor redeeme
the liberty of preaching, unlesse he enter his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
captive to some one sinne, or other. But the
negative cannot in respect of any circumstance,
bee omitted, without sinne. Because to omit the
dutie negative of <hi>The not practising of these ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
is to practise them, and so to commit a sin: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
superstition and scandall are the two insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
companions thereof. So albeit the former du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
seeme weightiest in the quality, or kind thereof:
yet in the knot, or band, it is not so strait, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
as the other.</p>

               <p>Well then <hi>Theoph.</hi> I see there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

the Anguillists here, slipping, and sliding to and
fro, by the wimples and windings of their wits, and
wayes, so that, no gripe can be had, or holden of
them. Better to preach the Gospell of Christ in
Virginia, then to practise the ceremonies of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
in Scotland. Oh how is the sometimes faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
