            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="analysis">
               <p>IT is not unlikely, but that I ſhall be charged with Ingratitude, upon account of theſe Papers, which ſcruple at the pretenſions of Kindred, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelf eaten a Founders Bread: A Charge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104264:4"/>
indeed, which of all things I abominate; and tho' the Argument may be popular, yet I hope it will not appear concluſive. Suppoſe this <hi>A.</hi> had been my Founder; yet, ſince Gratitude is but one part of duty to a Founder, if this which is called Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſhall interfere with the obſervance of his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, I conceive he Acts moſt conſiſtently, who keeps to them, which are the Rule of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to every particular. Beſides, I thought my ſelf oblig'd in common juſtice to propoſe ſomewhat of this nature; for tho' in Acts of mere favour and grace, the reſpect had to any (tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo remote) Relation to a Founder, or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, be truly commendable, yet when they pretend to a ſtrict right, and many additional ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, to the prejudice of others it may be more deſerving, nay ſometimes of their Seniors in the College; I thought I ſay in Common Juſtice, ſuch a pretenſion ought to be ſcrupled and examined, and, if groundleſs, utterly diſcountenanced. I ſhall therefore propoſe theſe Queries, Collections, and Obſervations, intirely ſubmitting them to better Judgments how far they are concluſive againſt ſuch pretenſions, for to be peremptory and poſitive; beſides, that 'tis a diſgrace to fail in ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, I ſhall not take the Confidence, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104264:4"/>
to that Authority magiſterially to aſſert. I come now to the thing in hand, which is to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in theſe three Points.</p>

                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> What this <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> is.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who are theſe <hi>Conſanguinei.</hi>

                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How far this Right of <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> extends.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As to the firſt Point, I find, that by the Civil and Canon Law, this Conſanguinity muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 2. 35. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 3.</note> and ſtated. Now by the Civil Law there is no proper Conſanguinity ſtrictly taken, as I think, but between Brothers, and Siſters of the ſame Father. All other Relation, being either <hi>Agnatio per lineam maſculinam,</hi> or elſe <hi>Cognatio per lineam foemininam.</hi> But the difference of theſe two being taken away <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Novell. De Haered. ab inteſtato,</hi> 118. §. <hi>Nullam vero.</hi>
                  </note>, Kindred may be more largely called <hi>Cognatio generalis,</hi> or <hi>Jus eorum quos ab eodem ſtipite deſcendentes ſanguis conjunxit:</hi> And according to this definition we find <hi>Conſanguinitas, q. ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis unitas,</hi> to ſignifie this <hi>Cognatio generalis,</hi> by the Civil Law <note n="‖" place="bottom">L. deſcriptionis C. de imponend. lucrat. deſcript. &amp; conſanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in gloſſ.</note>. Thus much for the ſtrict, and for the more large acceptation of the word by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104264:5"/>
Civil Law; conſonant to which large uſe of the word the Canoniſts take the ſame; the Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agreeing, Conſanguinity is it not That Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which one perſon has to another as deſcended lineally from him, or that Relation which two perſons have to each other as coming from the ſame common ſtock, whether by the male or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſide? This Conſanguinity I find alſo is threefold: 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Aſcendentium,</hi> The Relation of the Father, Grand father and their Wives, to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Grand-children, <hi>&amp; ſic Aſcendendo.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendentium,</hi> as of the Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c. &amp; ſic deſcendendo.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Tranſverſalium,</hi> as between Brothers and Siſters and their Children, Uncles and Aunts and their Children, <hi>&amp; ſic de Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris ex utroque latere per dictam Novellam,</hi> 118. Thus much for the uſual definition, deſcription, and diviſion of Conſanguinity allowed by all, as I conceive. I come now to the ſecond Point, who are theſe <hi>Conſanguinei. Eos Conſanguineos dicimus,</hi> ſays the Canon Law <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 2. 35. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 3.</note>, <hi>quos divinae, &amp; Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ac Romanorum atque Graecorum leges, Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neos appellant, ac in Haereditate ſuſcipiunt, nec repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere poſſunt.</hi> In ſome Books indeed I find, <hi>Affines,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104264:5"/>
ſo termed; and <hi>Bartolus</hi> ſays, <hi>Quod communis uſus loquendi, Conſanguineum appellat, etiam quocunque mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſanguine conjunctum.</hi> But if we conſider that in our Caſe, <hi>A.</hi> the Founder was never Married; that cuts off all pretenſions by Affinity, and of Children, and their Deſcendants: Aſcendants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed by any means; and they being to be <hi>de noſtra Conſanguinitate,</hi> and <hi>de noſtro Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne;</hi> none ſure can be his kin, but by the Fathers, and Mothers ſide, and that will exclude all remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Alliance, or thoſe <hi>quocunque modo;</hi> i. e. <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimo ſanguine Conjuncti.</hi> Theſe things being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, Are not the <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> to the Founder, thoſe allied to him <hi>ex linea Tranſverſali,</hi> as Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and their Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Siſters Children, <hi>&amp;c. &amp; ſic de Caeteris in linea Tranſverſali,</hi> of Statutable Age? Now theſe, <hi>ex utroque latere,</hi> being equally privileged <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Novella, de Haered. ab inteſtato,</hi> 118. §. <hi>Nullam vero.</hi>
                  </note>, they all claim to the very ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Which brings me to the third Point, how far, or to what degree this Right of Conſanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty extends. Now becauſe the Civil and Canon Law differ in the Computation of their Degrees, this difference muſt firſt be ſtated: It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be obſerved, what is ſaid, that the chief deſign
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104264:6"/>
of the Canon Law, is to reckon the degrees, ſo as not to interfere with prohibited bloud, to prevent inceſtuous mixtures, and to promote relation and publick decency and honeſty. And becauſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage cannot be, but between two <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 2. 35. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 4.</note> perſons, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Canons place two in one degree, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Civil Law, are in two. For the Civil Law reſpecting only the Conveyance of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and the Right of Succeſſion; and becauſe that Right is convey'd down from one to another, therefore <hi>generata perſona gradum adjicit.</hi> The Rules of each Law's Computation, ſee in the <hi>Decretum</hi> immediately preceding <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 6.</note>. This being obſerved, the next thing is, to aſcertain which Computation we ought to follow: and, ſay our Books <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Garcias de beneficiis</hi> 7. <hi>par. c.</hi> 15. <hi>nu.</hi> 25.</note>, <hi>Certum eſt ſequendum eſſe Computationem legalem pro gradibus, nam quoad ſucceſſiones &amp; in earum materia ſervanda eſt in utroque foro, Computatio legalis &amp; non Canonica:</hi> And that this is a ſort of Succeſſion, may appear by and by. Now Conſanguinity extends it ſelf more or leſs, according to the different matters, it is referred to, as may be ſeen at large <note n="*" place="bottom">Bertachini Repertorium Verb. Conſanguinitas.</note>. But without doubt there cannot be a more ſubſtantial
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104264:6"/>
and favourable Conſideration, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Kindred may claim the greateſt privileges, than in caſe of Succeſſion; and if the greateſt are there allow'd, there can be no reaſon to complain: And tho' in a Fellowſhip of a College, <hi>Non ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceditur Jure haereditario, &amp; Succeſſionis merae;</hi> yet where Kindred are called, it may be ſaid it is <hi>Succeſſio aliquo modo, ſeu ad inſtar.</hi> Now <hi>A.</hi> the Founder having made over his Eſtate to a certain number of Men, and having appointed them and their Succeſſors, his Heirs, he did <hi>Illorum fidei com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere,</hi> to admit his Kindred into ſome part of the Inheritance in Common with them, and to allow them a Maintenance among them. And tho' <hi>fidei commiſſum</hi> may not take in, in all reſpects the true notion of ſuch a Fellowſhip; yet where we cannot be punctual, I conceive the Law will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Reference to what is moſt likely. A Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip therefore in Relation to Kindred, eſpecially if we either conſider the Obligation the Law then laid upon the Clergy to provide for their <hi>Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinei</hi> (and the Founder was of very high rank in that Order) or the deſign of the Foundation, namely. a Maintenance for Students: I ſay, if we conſider this, a Fellowſhip is a proviſion, a lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, by way of a <hi>ſingulare fidei commiſſum,</hi> to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104264:7"/>
given them by the College; as the <hi>Haeredes fidei Commiſſarii,</hi> or <hi>Fiduciarii</hi> in this reſpect. And Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in <hi>fidei commiſſis,</hi> being to be regulated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of Succeſſion <hi>ab inteſtato</hi>

               <p>This then being the Statute, let us ſee whether this Right <hi>in perpetuum</hi> follows from the Letter of the Statute. <hi>A.</hi> the Founder begins, <hi>Quia ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dàm Apoſtolum, &amp;c.</hi> which alſo we find enforced by the Canon Law <note n="*" place="bottom">

And ſince he takes the hints from the Law, may we not reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he purſues the Law according to the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. And this being the Obligation, in caſe any one ſhould happen to die inteſtate, and ſo the <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> to be unprovided for, by the Party whilſt living: Here the Law did enjoyn the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and other Ordinaries to diſtribute what the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104264:10"/>
perſon died poſſeſſed of <hi>in Pias Cauſas, Perſonis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedentium Conſanguineis, Servitoribus, &amp; Propinquis, ſeu aliis:</hi> And this is Ordained alſo by a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Conſtitution <note n="*" place="bottom">Cap. Ita quorundam, de teſtamentis in Lynwood.</note>. Again, from the uſing the Words <hi>Conſanguinitas noſtra, Genus, &amp; ſanguis noſter;</hi> for without doubt, had it been deſigned that all manner of Relation, how diſtant ſoever, ſhould have been privileged, the Founder might have had terms of a leſs ſtrict Sence: And therefore, as we have good reaſon to ſuppoſe that he was not ignorant of that Conſtitution in <hi>Lynwood,</hi> ſo may we not ſuppoſe, that according to the ſame Law from which he took the hint, he would intend alſo the Perſons, he was obliged to take care for. And accordingly <hi>Lynwood,</hi> on the Conſtitution afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, ſays, <hi>Et Conſanguinei, &amp; qui ſunt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinei, patet ex Hoſtiens, ſumma</hi>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104264:11"/>
                  <hi>noſter,</hi> yet is it not reſtrained by thoſe two? It being never once more mentioned, but the Founder keeps to <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> and <hi>Sanguis.</hi> And having thus far proceeded to ſhew the Founder had reſpect to the Law, both for the Obligation of providing for his Kindred, and alſo for what Perſons were truly ſo, come we now to ſee to what degree he meant them. And here according to <hi>Lynwood</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">C. ita quorundam, de teſtamentis &amp; decedentium.</note>, of whom I cannot ſuppoſe the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ignorant; and what ſay you, if <hi>Lynwood</hi> made this Statute? We find the tenth degree to be the utmoſt, for which the Church was to provide, in the Diſtribution of Inteſtate's Goods; and the Church being only to ſupply the Teſtator's neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and ſupplying it only to the tenth degree, can we ſuppoſe the Law to oblige farther? His Words are theſe <note n="†" place="bottom">Ita quorundam &amp; Decedentium.

Et ſic in bonis Laici, &amp; ſic in bonis Clerici inteſtati, deficientibus praedictis, Eccleſia praefertur fiſco.</hi> And the more to confirm this, that the Founder had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104264:11"/>
an eye to <hi>Lynwood</hi> in this Provincial; or if it was <hi>Lynwood</hi>'s Opinion and Draught, he meant it purſuant thereto, we find the perſons to be provided for, in the College, are ranked in the ſame Order. <hi>Conſanguineis Servitoribus, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquis, ſeu aliis.</hi> The Statute ſays, <hi>Illi qui ſunt vel erunt de Conſanguinitate noſtra.</hi> The Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Conſanguineis.</hi> The Statute ſays, <hi>Illi qui ſunt vel erunt de locis in quibus poſſeſſiones, &amp;c.</hi> The Provincial, <hi>Servitoribus &amp; Propinquis,</hi> and the Gloſs <hi>&amp; Propinquis, tam ratione loci quam ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> Laſtly, The Statute ſays, <hi>Tum pauperiores ſcholares, &amp;c.</hi> The Provincial, <hi>Aliiſque,</hi> which the gloſs upon <hi>Aliiſque,</hi> calls <hi>extraneis, dummodo ſint pauperes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to conſider, whether he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned a Perpetuity to his Kindred. If the Founder had intended they ſhould claim <hi>in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum,</hi> he might have uſed more expreſs words. And tho' he ſays, <hi>Qui ſunt vel erunt,</hi> yet <hi>Erunt</hi> may be underſtood, of thoſe which ſhould be in the tenth Degree; for 'tis likely there were ſome then capable when the Statute was made. Again, <hi>Erunt</hi> muſt be kept to <hi>de noſtra Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinitate;</hi> and what that is, has been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104264:12"/>
to be explained. Nor is <hi>futuris tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> only to be reſtrained to the <hi>Conſanguinei,</hi> but relates alſo to Elections in general, which were to be made in Caſes of Vacancy for ever. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what ever theſe words may ſignifie, yet may not, <hi>Quibus deficientibus,</hi> well agree with what has been propoſed? A word uſed in all Books to expreſs the extinction of Kindred, and as it were purpoſely put here to prevent all am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity: And that <hi>Deficere</hi> does imply a total extinction, a final period, may it not appear, from the conſtant uſe of the word, when joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to terms, ſignifying <hi>Stock, Family, Kindred,</hi> and <hi>Lineage;</hi> being alſo explained in that ſence, from the Founders making after a new Degree of Privileged perſons, a new Subſtitution? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, becauſe when he provides for the <hi>paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riores Scholares, &amp;c.</hi> in caſe of want of thoſe <hi>in locis ubi poſſeſſiones, &amp;c.</hi> he is ſo far from uſing that word <hi>Deficere,</hi> as well conceiving, there would not be a want of People in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a total extinction as I may ſay; but he uſes theſe words, <hi>Quod ſi tales tempore Electionis minime reperti fuerint.</hi> And thus doth it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from Statute, and fair Conjectures, That
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104264:12"/>
here is a new Subſtitution, <hi>Et perpetuitas non ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in Conſanguineos, ſed in aliis ſervatur;</hi> which is the difference required by <hi>Sanchez,</hi> in the place afore-cited, to fix it to a certain degree, and not to extend it <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither according to Law, the General Opinion of the D. D. Statute, or fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures it does appear (with ſubmiſſion ſtill) that there is any privilege beyond the tenth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, may we not conclude with <hi>Mantica,</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, <hi>Ideo qui vult admitti tanquam ex progenie, debet probare ſe in aliquo gradu, qui non ſit ultra Decimum?</hi> And that too, aſcending to the very Founder; for altho' in other Caſes, a Relation to the laſt immediate Poſſeſſor, is a good claim for the next Heir, yet here the Law looks no farther than a Poſſeſſion continued from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate to the next Taker: But in our Caſe, no one claims by Right of Succeſſion, ſtrictly ſo called; or as related to a former Kinſman, but from his own next a-kin, as mediately related to the Founder; ſo that a flaw in immediate or mediate Kindred ſpoils the Line. Beſides, ſuppoſe I am indiſputably related to one who ſpeed as a Founders Kinſman, the proof he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104264:13"/>
made of His relation is unknown to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent College; and ſince I found my Right upon a Special qualification, even to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of others elſe Eligible, I ought to ſhew my Pretenſions, and the Society are to judge of the clearneſs of my Title.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs perhaps to ſay, how improbable now it is to fix any tolerable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent; and where ſuch Memoirs, which require all the punctilio's of Niceneſs, which are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly adjuſted, and which are often ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly neglected: I ſay, where ſuch Memoirs have great Chaſms and Diſcontinuances, and cannot carry the Relation up to the firſt of the Branch.</p>
               <p>Again, where the ancienteſt <hi>Memorandums</hi> are an hundred Years ſhort of ſuch a Founder, there is, I ſay, juſt reaſon to ſuſpect the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a Deſcent. Beſides, the Methods of ſuch Regiſtrings are very faulty, and ſo far from being exact, and to be relied upon, that they deſerve little credit, it having been inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly confeſſed, that the very perſons Words have (and that uſually too) been taken, for what Family they have been related to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:104264:13"/>But however unlikely it may be, to bring an exact and nice Title; yet where there is ſome ſpecious ſhow, eſpecially ſince the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are ſworn when admitted Fellows, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the <hi>Conſanguinei,</hi> 'tis beſt to err on the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſide. 'Tis true indeed, this may be ſo, where no one elſe is like to be wronged by theſe Pretenſions, who may be equally, nay more eligible; and here we ought to judge rather nicely than favourably; eſpecially too, where he claims other advantages, beſides thoſe of a bare Election.</p>
               <p>And as to the Oath, the Clauſe indeed is ſtill adminiſtred; but it was then made, when there were, or would be, in ſome time, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
               <p>However, the intent of the Founder, and the Law having determined this Right of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity, according to what we have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Obligation muſt ceaſe on Courſe. And beſides, that there are alſo other Clauſes or Things deducible from them, now ſworn to likewiſe in that Oath, not now warrantable. And thus much for theſe Queries, Collections, Obſervations, or what elſe you will call them.

                  <p>Either he claims upon the Title of mere <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity;</hi> or,</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> back'd with the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Statutable qualifications.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He cannot claim upon the firſt account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that very Statute which gives him a Right as <hi>Conſanguineus,</hi> gives it not merely as ſuch, but upon theſe Terms, <hi>Dummodo ſit habilis, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he claims upon the Second, there the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege are Judges of his Qualifications, both by Statute of the Founder, and Orders of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor; which Orders provide, That the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates ſhall approve themſelves by a three-days Examination, to every Fellow ſingly if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, <hi>Tam quoad quam ad doctrinam;</hi> by which <hi>Examen,</hi> the Fellows are to judge. Now this Right of Judging and Chooſing is not to be taken from the College; and if they Elect in due time, the Election is good, nor can a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low be put upon them.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe none are Elected, but by the Head and Majority of the Fellows; and if the Choice be made in due time, there can be no Lapſe or Devolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The College are upon their Oaths; and when they have Judged and Elected under that Obligation, which is the higheſt can be laid upon them, the Election of a qualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is irreverſible. I have nothing more to add, but that theſe Papers are entirely ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the more knowing and experienced.</p>
