            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THey who to States and Governours of the Commonwealth direct their Speech, High Court of Parlament, or wanting such accesse in a private condition, write that which they foresee may advance the publick good; I suppose them as at the beginning of no meane endeavour, not a little alter'd and mov'd inwardly in their mindes: Some with doubt of what will be the successe, others with feare of what will be the censure; some with hope, others with confidence of what they have to speake. And me perhaps each of these dispositions, as the subject was whereon I enter'd, may have at other times variously affected; and likely might in these formost expressions now also disclose which of them sway'd most, but that the very attempt of this addresse thus made, and the thought of whom it hath recourse to, hath got the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer within me to a passion, farre more welcome then incidentall to a Preface. Which though I stay not to confesse ere any aske, I shall be blamelesse, if it be no other, then the joy and gratulation which it brings to all who wish and promote their Countries liberty; whereof this whole Discourse propos'd will be a certaine testimony, if not a Trophey. For this is not the liberty which wee can hope, that no grievance ever should arise in the Commonwealth, that let no man in this World expect; but when complaints are freely heard, deeply consider'd, and speedily reform'd, then is the utmost bound of civill liberty attain'd, that wise men looke for. To which if I now manifest by the very sound of this which I shall utter, that wee are already in good part arriv'd, and yet from such a steepe disadvantage of tyranny and superstition grounded into our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as was beyond the manhood of a <hi>Roman</hi> recovery, it will bee attributed first, as is most due, to the strong assistance of God our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, next to your faithfull guidance and undaunted Wisdome, Lords and Commons of <hi>England.</hi> Neither is it in Gods esteeme the diminution of his glory, when honourable things are spoken of good men and worthy Magistrates; which if I now first should begin to

               </gap> might be justly reckn'd among the tardiest, and the unwillingest of them that praise yee. Neverthelesse there being three principall things, without which all praising is but Courtship and flattery. First, when that only is prais'd which is solidly worth praise: next when greatest likelihoods are brought that such things are truly and really in those persons to whom they are ascrib'd, the other, when he who praises, by shewing that such his actuall perswasion is of whom he writes, can demonstrate that he flatters not; the former two of these I have heretofore endeavour'd, rescuing the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him who went about to impaire your merits with a triviall and malignant <hi>Encomium</hi>; the latter as belonging chiefly to mine owne acquittall, that whom I so extoll'd I did not flatter, hath been reserv'd opportunely to this occasion. For he who freely magnifies what hath been nobly done, and fears not to declare as freely what might be done better, gives ye the best cov'nant of his fidelity; and that his loyalest affection and his hope waits on your proceedings. His highest praising is not flattery, and his plainest advice is a kinde of praising; for though I should affirme and hold by argument, that it would fare better with truth, with learning, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, if one of your publisht Orders which I should name, were call'd in, yet at the same time it could not but much redound to the lustre of your milde and equall Government, when as private persons are hereby animated to thinke ye better pleas'd with publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, then other statists have been delighted heretofore with publicke flattery. And men will then see what difference there is between the magnanimity of a trienniall Parlament, and that jealous hautinesse of Prelates and cabin Counsellours that usurpt of late, when as they shall observe yee in the midd'st of your Victories and successes more gently brooking writt'n exceptions against a voted Order, then other Courts, which had produc't nothing worth memory but the weake ostentation of wealth, would have endur'd the least signifi'd dislike at any sudden Proclamation. If I should thus farre presume upon the meek demeanour of your civill and gentle greatnesse, Lords and Commons, as what your publisht Order hath directly said, that to gainsay, I might defend my selfe with ease, if any should accuse me of being new or insolent, did they but know how much better I find ye esteem it to imitate the old and elegant humanity of Greece,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:121215:3"/>
then the barbarick pride of a <hi>Hunnish</hi> and <hi>Norwegian</hi> statelines. And out of those ages, to whose polite wisdom and letters we ow that we are not yet <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Jutlanders,</hi> I could name him who from his private house wrote that discourse to the Parlament of <hi>Athens,</hi> that perswades them to change the forme of <hi>Democraty</hi> which was then establisht. Such honour was done in those dayes to men who profest the study of wisdome and eloquence, not only in their own Country, but in other Lands, that Cities and Siniories heard them gladly, and with great respect, if they had ought in publick to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the State. Thus did <hi>Dion Prusaus</hi> a stranger and a privat Orator counsell the <hi>Rhodians</hi> against a former Edict: and I abound with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like examples, which to set heer would be superfluous. But if from the industry of a life wholly dedicated to studious labours, and those naturall endowments haply not the worst for two and fifty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of northern latitude, so much must be derogated, as to count me not equall to any of those who had this priviledge, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be thought not so inferior, as your selves are superior to the most of them who receiv'd their counsell: and how farre you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell them, be assur'd, Lords and Commons, there can no greater testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony appear, then when your prudent spirit acknowledges and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes the voice of reason from what quarter soever it be heard spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and renders ye as willing to repeal any Act of your own set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth, as any set forth by your Predecessors.</p>
            <p>If ye be thus resolv'd, as it were injury to thinke ye were not, I know not what should withhold me from presenting ye with a fit instance wherein to shew both that love of truth which ye eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professe, and that uprightnesse of your judgement which is not wont to be partiall to your selves; by judging over again that Order which ye have ordain'd <hi>to regulate Printing. That no Book, pamphlet, or paper shall be henceforth Printed, unlesse the same be first approv'd and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenc't by such,</hi> or at least one of such as shall be thereto appointed. For that part which preserves justly every mans Copy to himselfe, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for the poor, I touch not, only wish they be not made preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to abuse and persecute honest and painfull Men, who offend not in either of these particulars. But that other clause of Licencing Books, which we thought had dy'd with his brother <hi>quadragesunal</hi> and <hi>matrimonial</hi> when the Prelats expir'd, I shall now attend with such a Homily, as shall lay before ye, first the inventors of it to bee those whom ye will be loath to own; next what is to be thought in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:121215:4"/>
generall of reading, what ever sort the Books be; and that this Order avails nothing to the suppressing of scandalous, seditious, and libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Books, which were mainly intended to be supprest. Last, that it will be primely to the discouragement of all learning, and the stop of Truth, not only by disexercising and blunting our abilities in what we know already, but by hindring and cropping the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that might bee yet further made both in religious and civill Wisdome.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but that it is of greatest concernment in the Church and Commonwealth, to have a vigilant eye how Bookes demeane themselves as well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors: For Books are not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead things, but doe contain a potencie of life in them to be as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive as that soule was whose progeny they are; nay they do preserve as in a violl the purest efficacie and extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I know they are as lively, and as vigorously produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, as those fabulous Dragons teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to spring up armed men. And yet on the other hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse warinesse be us'd, as good almost kill a Man as kill a good Book; who kills a Man kills a reasonable creature, Gods Image; but hee who destroyes a good Booke, kills reason it selfe, kills the Image of God, as it were in the eye. Many a man lives a burden to the Earth; but a good Booke is the pretious life-blood of a master spirit, imbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd and treasur'd up on purpose to a life beyond life. 'Tis true, no age can restore a life, whereof perhaps there is no great losse; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of ages doe not oft recover the losse of a rejected truth, for the want of which whole Nations fare the worse. We should be wary therefore what persecution we raise against the living la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of publick men, how we spill that season'd life of man preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd and stor'd up in Books; since we see a kinde of homicide may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdome, and if it extend to the whole impression, a kinde of massacre, whereof the execution ends not in the slaying of an elementall life, but strikes at that ethereall and and fist essence, the breath of reason it selfe, slaics an immortality rather then a life. But lest I should be condemn'd of introducing licence, while I oppose Licencing, I refuse not the paines to be so much Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall, as will serve to shew what hath been done by ancient and famous Commonwealths, against this disorder, till the very time that this project of licencing crept out of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> was catcht up
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:121215:4"/>
by our Prelates, and hath caught some of our Presbyters.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Athens</hi> where Books and Wits were ever busier then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of <hi>Greece,</hi> I finde but only two sorts of writings which the Magistrate car'd to take notice of; those either blasphemous and Atheisticall, or Libellous. Thus the Books of <hi>Protagoras</hi> were by the Iudges of <hi>Areopagus</hi> commanded to be burnt, and himselfe banisht the territory for a discourse begun with his confessing not to know <hi>whether there were gods, or whether not:</hi> And against defaming, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that none should be traduc'd by name, as was the manner of <hi>Vetus Comoedia,</hi> whereby we may guesse how they censur'd libelling: And this course was quick enough, as <hi>Cicero</hi> writes, to quell both the desperate wits of other Atheists, and the open way of defaming, as the event shew'd. Of other sects and opinions though tending to voluptuousnesse, and the denying of divine providence they tooke no heed. Therefore we do not read that either <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine school of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> or what the <hi>Cynick</hi> impudence utter'd, was ever question'd by the Laws. Neither is it recorded that the writings of those old Comedians were supprest, though the acting of them were forbid; and that <hi>Plato</hi> commended the reading of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of them all, to his royall scholler <hi>Dionysius,</hi> is commonly known, and may be excus'd, if holy <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> as is reported, nightly stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died so much the same Author and had the art to cleanse a scurrilous vehemence into the stile of a rousing Sermon. That other leading City of <hi>Greece, Lacedaemon,</hi> considering that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> their Law-giver was so addicted to elegant learning, as to have been the first that brought out of <hi>Jonia</hi> the scatter'd workes of <hi>Homer,</hi> and sent the Poet <hi>Thales</hi> from <hi>Creet</hi> to prepare and mollifie the <hi>Spartan</hi> surlinesse with his smooth songs and odes, the better to plant among them law and civility, it is to be wonder'd how musclesse and unbookish they were, minding nought but the feats of Warre. There needed no licencing of Books among them for they dislik'd all, but their owne <hi>Laconick Apothegms,</hi> and took a slight occasion to chase <hi>Archilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> out of their City, perhaps for composing in a higher straine then their owne souldierly ballats and roundels could reach to: Or if it were for his broad verses, they were not therein so cautious, but they were as dissolute in their promiscuous conversing; whence Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides affirmes in <hi>Andromache,</hi> that their women were all unchaste, Thus much may give us light after what sort Bookes were prohibited among the Greeks.

to a military roughnes, resembling most the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> guise, knew of learning little but what their twelve Tables, and the <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick</hi> College with their <hi>Augurs</hi> and <hi>Flamins</hi> taught them in Religion and Law, so unacquainted with other learning, that when <hi>Carneades</hi> and <hi>Critolaus,</hi> with the <hi>Stoick Diogenes</hi> comming Embassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> tooke thereby occasion to give the City a tast of their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, they were suspected for seducers by no lesse a man then <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor, who mov'd it in the Senat to dismisse them speedily, and to banish all such <hi>Attick</hi> bablers out of <hi>Italy.</hi> But <hi>Scipio</hi> and others of the noblest Senators withstood him and his old <hi>Sabin</hi> austerity; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd and admir'd the men; and the Censor himself at last in his old age fell to the study of that whereof before hee was so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous. And yet at the same time <hi>Naevius</hi> and <hi>Plautus</hi> the first Latine comedians had fill'd the City with all the borrow'd Scenes of <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Philemon.</hi> Then began to be consider'd there also what was to be don to libellous books and Authors; for <hi>Naevius</hi> was quickly cast into prison for his unbridl'd pen, and releas'd by the <hi>Tribunes</hi> upon his recantation: We read also that lipels were burnt, and the makers punisht by <hi>Augustus.</hi> The like severity no doubt was us'd if ought were impiously writt'n against their esteemed gods. Except in these two points, how the world went in Books, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat kept no reckning. And therefore <hi>Lucretius</hi> without impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment versifies his Epicurism to <hi>Memmius,</hi> and had the honour to be set forth the second time by <hi>Cicero</hi> so great a father of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; although himselfe disputes against that opinion in his own writings. Nor was the Satyricall sharpnesse, or naked plainnes of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> or <hi>Catullus,</hi> or <hi>Flaccus,</hi> by any order prohibited. And for matters of State, the story of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> though it extoll'd that part which <hi>Pompey</hi> held, was not therefore supprest by <hi>Octavius Caesar</hi> of the other Faction. But that <hi>Neso</hi> was by him banisht in his old age, for the wanton Poems of his youth, was but a meer covert of State over some secret cause: and besides, the Books were neither banisht nor call'd in. From hence we shall meet with little else but tyranny in the Roman Empire, that we may not marvell, if not so often bad, as good Books were silenc't. I shall therefore deem to have bin large anough in producing what among the ancients was punishable to write, save only which, all other arguments were free to treat on.</p>
            <p>By this time the Emperors were become Christians, whose disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in this point I doe not finde to have bin more severe then what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121215:5"/>
was formerly in practice. The Books of those whom they took to be grand Hereticks were examin'd, refuted, and condemn'd in the generall Councels; and not till then were prohibited, or burnt by autority of the Emperor. As for the writings of Heathen authors, unlesse they were plaine invectives against Christianity, as those of <hi>Porphyrius</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> they met with no interdict that can be cited, till about the year 400. in a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Councel, wherein Bishops themselves were forbid to read the Books of Gentiles, but Heresies they might read: while others long before them on the contrary scrupl'd more the Books of Hereticks, then of Gentiles. And that the primitive Councels and Bishops were wont only to declare what Books were not commendable, passing no furder, but leaving it to each ones conscience to read or to lay by, till after the yeare 800. is observ'd already by <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> the great unmasker of the <hi>Trentine</hi> Councel. After which time the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> engrossing what they pleas'd of Politicall rule into their owne hands, extended their dominion over mens eyes, as they had before over their judgements, burning and prohibiting to be read, what they fansied not; yet spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their censures, and the Books not many which they so dealt with: till <hi>Martin</hi> the 5. by his Bull not only prohibited, but was the first that excommunicated the reading of hereticall Books; for about that time <hi>Wicklef</hi> and <hi>Husse</hi> growing terrible, were they who first drove the Papall Court to a stricter policy of prohibiting. Which cours <hi>Leo</hi> the 10, and his successors follow'd, untill the Councell of Trent, and the Spanish Inquisition engendring together brought forth, or perfeted those Catalogues, and expurging Indexes that rake through the entralls of many an old good Author, with a violation wors then any could be offer'd to his tomb. Nor did they stay in matters Hereticall, but any subject that was not to their palat, they either condemn'd in a prohibition, or had it strait into the new Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory of an Index. To fill up the measure of encroachment, their last invention was to ordain that no Book, pamphlet, or paper should be Printed (as if S. <hi>Peter</hi> had bequeath'd them the keys of the Presse also out of Paradise) unlesse it were approv'd and licenc't under the hands of 2 or 3 glutton Friers. For example:

Sometimes 5 <hi>Imprimaturs</hi> are seen together dialogue-wise in the Piatza of one Title page, complementing and ducking each to other with their shav'n reverences, whether the Author, who stands by in perplexity at the foot of his Epistle, shall to the Presse or to the spunge. These are the prety responsories, these are the deare An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphonies that so bewitcht of late our Prelats, and their Chaplaines with the goodly Eccho they made; and besotted us to the gay imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a lordly <hi>Imprimatur,</hi> one from Lambeth house, another from the West end of <hi>Pauls</hi>; so apishly Romanizing, that the word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand still was set downe in Latine; as if the learned Grammaticall pen that wrote it, would cast no ink without Latine; or perhaps, as they thought, because no vulgar tongue was worthy to expresse the pure conceit of an <hi>Imprimatur</hi>; but rather, as I hope, for that our English, the language of men ever famous, and formost in the atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of liberty, will not easily finde servile letters anow to spell such a dictatorie presumption English. And thus ye have the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and the originall of Book-licencing ript up, and drawn as line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as any pedigree. We have it not, that can be heard of, from any
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:121215:6"/>
ancient State, or politie, or Church, nor by any Statute left us by our Ancestors elder or later; nor from the moderne custom of any refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Citty, or Church abroad; but from the most Antichristian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and the most tyrannous Inquisition that ever inquir'd. Till then Books were ever as freely admitted into the World as any other birth: the issue of the brain was no more stifl'd then the issue of the womb: no envious <hi>Juno</hi> sate cros-leg'd over the nativity of any mans intellectuall off spring; but if it prov'd a Monster, who denies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk into the Sea. But that a Book in wors condition then a peccant soul, should be to stand before a Jury ere it be borne to the World, and undergo yet in darknesse the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Radamanth</hi> and his Collegues, ere it can passe the ferry back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into light, was never heard before, till that mysterious iniquity provokt and troubl'd at the first entrance of Reformation, sought out new limbo's and new hells wherein they might include our Books also within the number of their damned. And this was the rare mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell so officiously snatcht up, and so ilfavourdly imitated by our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siturient Bishops, and the attendant minorites their Chaplains. That ye like not now these most certain Authors of this licencing order, and that all sinister intention was farre distant from your thoughts, when ye were importun'd the passing it, all men who know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of your actions, and how ye honour Truth, will clear yee readily.</p>
            <p>But some will say, What though the Inventors were bad, the thing for all that may be good? It may so; yet if that thing be no such deep invention, but obvious, and easie for any man to light on, and yet best and wisest Commonwealths through all ages, and occasions have forborne to use it, and falsest seducers, and oppressors of men were the first who tooke it up, and to no other purpose but to obstruct and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the first approach of Reformation; I am of those who beleeve, it will be a harder alchymy then <hi>Lullius</hi> ever knew, to sublimat any good use out of such an invention. Yet this only is what I request to gain from this reason, that it may be held a dangerous and suspicious fruit, as certainly it deserves, for the tree that bore it, untill I can dissect one by one the properties it has. But I have first to finish, as was propounded, what is to be thought in generall of reading Books, what ever sort they be, and whether be more the benefit, or the harm that thence proceeds?</p>
            <p>Not to insist upon the examples of <hi>Moses, Daniel &amp; Paul,</hi> who were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:121215:7"/>
skilfull in all the learning of the AEgyptians, Caldeans, and Greeks, which could not probably be without reading their Books of all sorts, in <hi>Paul</hi> especially, who thought it no defilement to insert into holy Scripture the sentences of three Greek Poets, and one of them a Tragedian, the question was, notwithstanding sometimes contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted among the Primitive Doctors, but with great odds on that side which affirm'd it both lawfull and profitable, as was then evidently perceiv'd, when <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostat, and suttlest enemy to our faith, made a decree forbidding Christians the study of heathen learning: for, said he, they wound us with our own weapons, and with our owne arts and sciences they overcome us. And indeed the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were put so to their shifts by this crafty means, and so much in danger to decline into all ignorance, that the two <hi>Apollinarii</hi> were fain as a man may say, to coin all the seven liberall Sciences out of the Bible, reducing it into divers forms of Orations, Poems, Dialogues, ev'n to the calculating of a new Christian Grammar. But saith the Historian <hi>Socrates,</hi> The providence of God provided better then the industry of <hi>Apollinarius</hi> and his son, by taking a way that illiterat law with the life of him who devis'd it. So great an injury they then held it to be depriv'd of <hi>Hellenick</hi> learning; and thought it a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution more undermining, and secretely decaying the Church, then the open cruelty of <hi>Decius</hi> or <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> And perhaps it was the same politick drift that the Divell whipt St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in a lenten dream, for reading <hi>Cicero</hi>; or else it was a fantasm bred by the feaver which had then seis'd him. For had an Angel bin his discipliner, unlesse it were for dwelling too much upon Ciceronianisms, &amp; had chastiz'd the reading, not the vanity, it had bin plainly partiall; first to correct him for grave <hi>Cicero,</hi> and not for scurrill <hi>Plautus</hi> whom he confesses to have bin reading not long before; next to correct him only, and let so many more ancient Fathers wax old in those pleasant and florid studies without the lash of such a tutoring apparition; insomuch that <hi>Basil</hi> teaches how some good use may be made of <hi>Margites</hi> a sportfull Poem, not now extant, writ by <hi>Homer</hi>; and why not then of <hi>Morgante</hi> an Italian Romanze much to the same purpose. But if it be agreed we shall be try'd by visions, there is vision recorded by <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> far ancienter then this tale of <hi>Jerom</hi> to the Nun <hi>Eustochium,</hi> and besides has nothing of a feavor in it. <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 240, a person of great name in the Church for piety and learning, who had wont to avail himself much against hereticks by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:121215:7"/>
being conversant in their Books; untill a certain Presbyter laid it scrupulously to his conscience, how he durst venture himselfe among those defiling volumes. The worthy man loath to give offence fell into a new debate with himselfe what was to be thought; when sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly a vision sent from God, it is his own Epistle that so averrs it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd him in these words: Read any books what ever come to thy hands, for thou art sufficient both to judge aright, and to examine each matter. To this revelation he assented the sooner, as he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, because it was answerable to that of the Apostle to the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Prove all things, hold fast that which is good. And he might have added another remarkable saying of the same Author: To the pure all things are pure, not only meats and drinks, but all kinde of knowledge whether of good or evill; the knowledge cannot defile, nor consequently the books, if the will and conscience be not defil'd. For books are as meats and viands are; some of good, some of evill substance; and yet God in that unapocryphall vision, said without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, Rise <hi>Peter,</hi> kill and eat, leaving the choice to each mans discretion. Wholesome meats to a vitiated stomack differ little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from unwholesome; and best books to a naughty mind are not unappliable to occasions of evill. Bad meats will scarce breed good nourishment in the healthiest concoction; but herein the difference is of bad books, that they to a discreet and judicious Reader serve in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respects to discover, to confute, to forewarn, and to illustrate. Wherof what better witnes can ye expect I should produce, then one of your own now sitting in Parlament, the chief of learned men repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Land, Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> whose volume of naturall &amp; national laws proves, not only by great autorities brought together, but by exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematically demostrative, that all opinions, yea errors, known, read, and collated, are of main service &amp; assistance toward the speedy attainment of what is truest. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive therefore, that when God did enlarge the universall diet of mans body, saving ever the rules of temperance, he then also, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, left arbitrary the dyeting and repasting of our minds; as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every mature man might have to exercise his owne leading capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. How great a vertue is temperance, how much of moment through the whole life of man? yet God committs the managing so great a trust, without particular Law or prescription, wholly to the demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of every grown man. And therefore when he himself tabl'd the Jews from heaven, that Omer which was every mans daily portion of

               </gap>eading is unlawfull: yet certainly had God thought good to limit us herein, it had bin much more expedient to have told us what was unlawfull, then what was wearisome. As for the burning of those Ephesian books by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> converts, tis reply'd the books were magick, the Syriack so renders them. It was a privat act, a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act, and leaves us to a voluntary imitation: the men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse burnt those books which were their own; the Magistrat by this example is not appointed: these men practiz'd the books, another might perhaps have read them in some sort usefully. Good and evill we know in the field of this World grow up together almost insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; and the knowledge of good is so involv'd and interwoven with the knowledge of evill, and in so many cunning resemblances hardly to be discern'd, that those confused seeds which were impos'd on <hi>Psyche</hi> as an incessant labour to cull out, and sort asunder, were not more intermixt. It was from out the rinde of one apple tasted, that the knowledge of good and evill as two twins cleaving together leapt forth into the World. And perhaps this is that doom which <hi>Adam</hi> fell into of knowing good and evill, that is to say of knowing good by evill. As therefore the state of man now is; what wisdome can there be to choose, what continence to forbeare without the knowledge of evill? He that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures, and yet abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly better, he is the true wayfaring Christian. I cannot praise a fugitive and cloister'd vertue, unexercis'd &amp; unbreath'd, that never sollies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race, where that immortall garland is to be run for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dust and heat. Assuredly we bring not innocence into the world, we bring impurity much rather: that which purifies us is triall, and triall is by what is contrary. That vertue therefore which is but a youngling in the contemplation of evill, and knows not the utmost
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:121215:8"/>
that vice promises to her followers, and rejects <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>; Which was the reason why our sage and serious Poet <hi>Spencer,</hi> whom I dare be known to think a better teacher then <hi>Scotus</hi> or <hi>Aquinas,</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing true temperance under the person of <hi>Guion,</hi> brings him in with his palmer through the cave of Mammon, and the bowr of earthly blisse that he might see and know, and yet abstain. Since therefore the knowledge and survay of vice is in this world so necessary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting of human vertue, and the scanning of error to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, how can we more safely, and with lesse danger scout into the regions of sin and falsity then by reading all manner of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctats, and hearing all manner of reason? And this is the benefit which may be had of books promiscuously read. But of the harm that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult hence three kinds are usually reckn'd. First, is fear'd the infection that may spread; but then all human learning and controversie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious points must remove out of the world, yea the Bible it selfe; for that oftimes relates blasphemy not nicely, it describes the carnall sense of wicked men not unelegantly, it brings in holiest men passionately murmuring against providence through all the arguments of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> in other great disputes it answers dubiously and darkly to the common reader: And ask a Talmudist what ails the modesty of his marginall Keri, that <hi>Moses</hi> and all the Prophets cannot perswade him to pronounce the textuall Chetiv. For these causes we all know the Bible it selfe put by the Papist into the first rank of prohibited books. The ancientest Father must be next remov'd, as <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and that <hi>Eusebian</hi> book of Evangelick preparation, transmitting our ears through a hoard of heathenish obscenities to receive the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Who finds not that <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Jerom,</hi> and others discover more heresies then they well confute, and that oft for heresie which is the truer opinion. Nor boots it to say for these, and all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writers of greatest infection, if it must be thought so, with whom is bound up the life of human learning, that they writ in an unknown tongue, so long as we are sure those languages are known as well to the worst of men, who are both most able, and most diligent to instill the poison they suck, first into the Courts of Princes, acquainting them with the choisest delights, and criticisms of sin. As perhaps did that <hi>Petronius</hi> whom <hi>Nero</hi> call'd his <hi>Arbiter,</hi> the Master of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; and that notorious ribald of <hi>Arezzo,</hi> dreaded, and yet dear to the Italian Courtiers.

By which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way all the contagion that foreine books can infuse, will finde a passage to the people farre easier and shorter then an Indian voyage, though it could be sail'd either by the North of <hi>Cataio</hi> East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or of <hi>Canada</hi> Westward, while our Spanish licencing gags the English Presse never so severely. But on the other side that infection which is from books of controversie in Religion, is more doubtfull and dangerous to the learned, then to the ignorant; and yet those books must be permitted untoucht by the licencer. It will be hard to instance where any ignorant man hath bin ever seduc't by Papisticall book in English, unlesse it were commended and expounded to him by some of the Clergy: and indeed all such tractats whether false or true are as the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah</hi> was to the <hi>Ennuch,</hi> not to be <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood without a guide.</hi> But of our Priests and Doctors how many have bin corrupted by studying the comments of Jesuits and <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> and how fast they could transfuse that corruption into the people, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is both late and sad. It is not forgot, since the acute and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Arminius</hi> was perverted meerly by the perusing of a namelesse discours writt'n at <hi>Delf,</hi> which at first he took in hand to confute. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that those books, &amp; those in great abundance which are likeliest to taint both life and doctrine, cannot be supprest without the fall of learning, and of all ability in disputation, and that these books of either sort are most and soonest catching to the learned, from whom to the common people what ever is hereticall of dissolute may quickly be convey'd, and that evill manners are as perfectly learnt without books a thousand other ways which cannot be stopt, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill doctrine not with books can propagate, except a teacher guide, which he might also doe without writing, and so beyond prohibiting, I am not able to unfold, how this cautelous enterprise of licencing can be exempted from the number of vain and impossible attempts. And he who were pleasantly dispos'd, could not well avoid to lik'n it to the exploit of that gallant man who thought to pound up the crows by shutting his Parkgate. Besides another inconvenience, if learned men be the first receivers out of books, &amp; dispredders both of vice and error, how shall the licencers themselves be confided in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we can conferr upon them, or they assume to themselves above all others in the Land, the grace of infallibility, and uncorruptednesse? And again if it be true, that a wise man like a good refiner can gather gold out of the drossiest volume, and that a fool will be a fool with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:121215:9"/>
the best book, yea or without book, there is no reason that we should deprive a wise man of any advantage to his wisdome, while we seek to restrain from a fool, that which being restrain'd will be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to his folly. For it there should be so much exactnesse always us'd to keep that from him which is unfit for his reading, we should in the judgement of <hi>Aristotle</hi> not only, but of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, not voutsafe him good precepts, and by consequence not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly admit him to good books; as being certain that a wise man will make better use of an idle pamphlet, then a fool will do of sacred Scripture. 'Tis next alleg'd we must not expose our selves to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without necessity, and next to that, not imploy our time in vain things. To both these objections one answer will serve, out of the grounds already laid, that to all men such books are not temptations, not vanities; but usefull drugs and materialls wherewith to temper and compose effective and strong med'cins, which mans life cannot want. The rest, as children and childish men, who have not the art to qualifie and prepare these working mineralls, well may be exhorted to forbear, but hinder'd forcibly they cannot be by all the licencing that Sainted Inquisition could ever yet contrive; which is what I promis'd to deliver next, That this order of licencing conduces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the end for which it was fram'd; and hath almost prevented me by being clear already while thus much hath bin explaining. See the ingenuity of Truth, who when she gets a free and willing hand, opens her self faster, then the pace of method and discours can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her. It was the task which I began with, To shew that no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or well instituted State, if they valu'd books at all, did ever use this way of licencing; and it might be answer'd, that this is a piece of prudence lately discover'd. To which I return, that as it was a thing slight and obvious to think on, so if it had bin difficult to finde out, there wanted not among them long since, who suggested such a cours; which they not following, leave us a pattern of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was not the not knowing, but the not approving, which was the cause of their not using it. <hi>Plato,</hi> a man of high auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity indeed, but least of all for his Commonwealth, in the book of his laws, which no City ever yet receiv'd, fed his fancie with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many edicts to his ayrie Burgomasters, which they who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise admire him, wish had bin rather buried and excus'd in the <hi>genial</hi> cups of an <hi>Academick</hi> night-satting. By which laws he seems to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat no kind of learning, but by unalterable decree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:121215:10"/>
most of practicall traditions, to the attainment whereof a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of smaller bulk then his own dialogues would be abundant. And there also enacts that no Poet should so much as read to any privat man, what he had writt'n, untill the Judges and Law-keepers had seen it, and allow'd it: But that <hi>Plato</hi> meant this Law peculiarly to that Commonwealth which he had imagin'd, and to no other, is evident. Why was he not else a Law-giver to himself, but a transgressor, and to be expell'd by his own Magistrats; both for the wanton epigrams and dialogues which he made, and his perpetuall reading of <hi>Sophron Mimus,</hi> and <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> books of grossest infamy, and also for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the latter of them though he were the malicious libeller of his chief friends, to be read by the Tyrant <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who had little need of such trash to spend his time on? But that he knew this licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Poems had reference and dependence to many other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so's there set down in his fancied republic, which in this world could have no place: and so neither he himself, nor any Magistrat, or City ever imitated that cours, which tak'n apart from those other collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall injunctions must needs be vain and fruitlesse. For if they fell upon one kind of strictnesse, unlesse their care were equall to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat all other things of like aptnes to corrupt the mind, that single en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour they knew would be but a fond labour; to shut and fortifie one gate against corruption, and be necessitated to leave others round about wide open. If we think to regulat Printing, thereby to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie manners, we must regulat all recreations and pastimes, all that is delightfull to man. No musick must be heard, no song be set or sung, but what is grave and <hi>Dorick.</hi> There must be licencing dancers, that no gesture, motion, or deportment be taught our youth but what by their allowance shall be thought honest; for such <hi>Plato</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of; It will ask more then the work of twenty licencers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin all the lutes, the violins, and the ghittarrs in every house; they must not be suffer'd to prattle as they doe, but must be licenc'd what they may say. And who shall silence all the airs and madrigalls, that whisper softnes in chambers? The Windows also, and the <hi>Balcone's</hi> must be thought on, there are shrewd books, with dangerous Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispices set to sale; who shall prohibit them, shall twenty licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers? The villages also must have their visitors to enquire what le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures the bagpipe and the rebbeck reads ev'n to the ballatry, and the gammuth of every <hi>municipal</hi> sidler, for these are the Countrymans <hi>Arcadia's</hi> and his <hi>Monte Mayors.</hi> Next, what more Nationall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, for which England hears ill abroad, then houshold gluttony;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:121215:10"/>
who shall be the rectors of our daily rioting? and what shall be done to inhibit the multitudes that frequent those houses where drunk'nes is sold and harbour'd? Our garments also should be referr'd to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencing of some more sober work-masters to see them cut into a lesse wanton garb. Who shall regulat all the mixt conversation of our youth, male and female together, as is the fashion of this Country, who shall still appoint what shall be discours'd, what presum'd, and no furder? Lastly, who shall forbid and separat all idle resort, all evill company? These things will be, and must be; but how they shall be lest hurtfull, how lest enticing, herein consists the grave and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wisdom of a State. To sequester out of the world into <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> and <hi>Eutopian</hi> politics, which never can be drawn into use, will not mend our condition; but to ordain wisely as in this world of evill, in the midd'st whereof God hath plac't us unavoidably. Nor is it <hi>Plato's</hi> licencing of books will doe this, which necessarily pulls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it so many other kinds of licencing, as will make us all both ridiculous and weary, and yet frustrat; but those unwritt'n, or at least unconstraining laws of vertuous education, religious and civil nurture, which <hi>Plato</hi> there mentions, as the bonds and ligaments of the Commonwealth, the pillars and the sustainers of every writt'n Statute; these they be which will bear chief sway in such matters as these, when all licencing will be easily eluded. Impunity and remisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for certain are the bane of a Commonwealth, but here the great art lyes to discern in what the law is to bid restraint and punishment, and in what things perswasion only is to work. If every action which is good, or evill in man at ripe years, were to be under pittance, and prescription, and compulsion, what were vertue but a name, what praise could be then due to well-doing, what grammercy to be sober, just or continent? many there be that complain of divin Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for suffering <hi>Adam</hi> to transgresse, foolish tongues! when God gave him reason, he gave him freedom to choose, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is but choosing; he had bin else a meer artificiall <hi>Adam,</hi> such an <hi>Adam</hi> as he is in the motions. We our selves esteem not of that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or love, or gift, which is of force: God therefore left him free, set before him a provoking object, ever almost in his eyes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in consisted his merit, herein in the right of his reward, the praise of his abstinence. Wherefore did he creat passions within us, pleasures round about us, but that these rightly temper'd are the very ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of vertu? They are not skilfull considerers of human things, who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:121215:11"/>
imagin to remove sin by removing the matter of sin; for, besides that it is a huge heap increasing under the very act of diminishing though some part of it may for a time be withdrawn from some persons, it cannot from all, in such a universall thing as books are; and when this is done, yet the sin remains entire. Though ye take from a covetous man all his treasure, he has yet one jewell left, ye cannot bereave him of his covetousnesse. Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest discipline that can be exercis'd in any hermitage, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them chaste, that came not thither so: such great care and wisdom is requir'd to the right managing of this point. Suppose we could expell sin by this means; look how much we thus expell of sin, so much we expell of vertue: for the matter of them both is the same; remove that, and ye remove them both alike. This justifies the high providence of God, who though he command us temperance, justice, continence, yet powrs out before us ev'n to a prosusenes all desirable things, and gives us minds that can wander beyond all limit and satie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Why should we then affect a rigor contrary to the manner of God and of nature, by abridging or scanting those means, which books freely permitted are, both to the triall of vertue, and the exercise of truth. It would be better done to learn that the law must needs be fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous which goes to restrain things, uncertainly and yet equally working to good, and to evill. And were I the chooser, a dram of well-doing should be preferr'd before many times as much the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible hindrance of evill-doing. For God sure esteems the growth and compleating of one vertuous person, more then the restraint of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten vitious. And albeit what ever thing we hear or see, sitting, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, travelling, or conversing may be fitly call'd our book, and is of the same effect that writings are, yet grant the thing to be prohibited were only books, it appears that this order hitherto is far insufficient to the end which it intends. Do we not see, not once or oftner, but weekly that continu'd Court-libell against the Parlament and City, Printed, as the wet sheets can witnes, and dispers't among us, for all that licencing can doe? yet this is the prime service a man would think, wherein this order should give proof of it self. If it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, you'l say. But certain, if execution be remisse or blindfold now, and in this particular, what will it be hereafter, and in other books. If then the order shall not be vain and frustrat, behold a new labour, Lords and Commons, ye must repeal and proscribe all scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and unlicenc't books already printed and divulg'd; after ye have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:121215:11"/>
drawn them up into a list, that all may know which are condemn'd, and which not; and ordain that no forrein books be deliver'd out of custody, till they have bin read over. This office will require the whole time of not a few overseers, and those no vulgar men. There be also books which are partly usefull and excellent, partly culpable and pernicious; this work will ask as many more officials, to make expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and expunctions, that the Commonwealth of learning be not damnify'd. In fine, when the multitude of books encrease upon their hands, ye must be fain to catalogue all those Printers who are found frequently offending, and forbidd the importation of their whole suspected <hi>typography.</hi> In a word, that this your order may be exact, and not desicient, ye must reform it perfectly according to the model of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Sevil,</hi> which I know ye abhorre to doe. Yet though ye should condiscend to this, which God forbid, the order still would be but fruitlesse and defective to that end whereto ye meant it. If to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent sects and schisms, who is so unread or so uncatechis'd in story, that hath not heard of many sects refusing books as a hindrance, and preserving their doctrine unmixt for many ages, only by unwritt'n traditions. The Christian faith, for that was once a schism, is not unknown to have spread all over <hi>Asia,</hi> ere any Gospel or Epistle was seen in writing. If the amendment of manners be aym'd at, look into Italy and Spain, whether those places be one scruple the better, the honester, the wiser, the chaster, since all the inquisitionall rigor that hath bin executed upon books.</p>
            <p>Another reason, whereby to make it plain that this order will misse the end it seeks, consider by the quality which ought to be in every licencer. It cannot be deny'd but that he who is made judge to sit upon the birth, or death of books whether they may be wafted into this world, or not, had need to be a man above the common measure, both studious, learned, and judicious; there may be else no mean mistakes in the censure of what is passable or not; which is also no mean injury. If he be of such worth as behoovs him, here cannot be a more tedious and unpleasing Journey-work, a greater losse of time levied upon his head, then to be made the perpetuall reader of uncho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen books and pamphlets, oftimes huge volumes. There is no book that is acceptable unlesse at certain seasons; but to be enjoyn'd the reading of that at all times, and in a hand scars legible, whereof three pages would not down at any time in the fairest Print, is an imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I cannot beleeve how he that values time, and his own
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:121215:12"/>
studies, or is but of a sensible nostrill should be able to endure. In this one thing I crave leave of the present licencers to be pardon'd for so thinking: who doublesse took this office up, looking on it through their obedience to the Parlament, whose command perhaps made all things seem easie and unlaborious to them; but that this short triall hath wearied them out already, their own expressions and excuses to them who make so many journeys to sollicit their licence, are testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony anough. Seeing therefore those who now possesse the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by all evident signs wish themselves well ridd of it, aud that no man of worth, none that is not a plain unthrift of his own hours is ever likely to succeed them, except he mean to put him'elf to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary of a Presse-corrector, we may easily foresee what kind of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers we are to expect hereafter, either ignorant, imperious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, or basely pecuniary. This is what I had to shew wherein this order cannot conduce to that end, whereof it bears the intention.</p>
            <p>I lastly proceed from the no good it can do, to the manifest hurt it causes, in being first the greatest discouragement and affront, that can be offer'd to learning and to learned men. It was the complaint and lamentation of Prelats, upon every least breath of a motion to remove pluralities, and distribute more equally Church revennu's, that then all learning would be for ever dasht and discourag'd. But as for that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, I never found cause to think that the tenth part of learning stood or fell with the Clergy: nor could I ever but hold it for a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and unworthy speech of any Churchman who had a competency left him. If therefore ye be loath to dishearten utterly and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, not the mercenary crew of false pretenders to learning, but the free and ingenuous sort of such as evidently were born to study, and love lerning for it self, not for lucre, or any other end, but the service of God and of truth, and perhaps that lasting fame and perpetuity of praise which God and good men have consented shall be the reward of those whose publisht labours advance the good of mankind, then know, that so far to distrust the judgement &amp; the honesty of one who hath but a common repute in learning, and never yet offended, as not to count him fit to print his mind without a tutor and examiner, lest he should drop a scism, or something of corruption, is the greatest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure and indignity to a free and knowing spirit that can be put upon him. What advantage is it to be a man over it is to be a boy at school, if we have only scapt the ferular, to come under the fescu of an <hi>Imprimatur,</hi> if serious and elaborat writings, as if they were no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:121215:12"/>
more then the theam of a Grammar lad under his Pedagogue must not be utter'd without the cursory eyes of a temporizing and extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing licencer. He who is not trusted with his own actions, his drift not being known to be evill, and standing to the hazard of law and penalty, has no great argument to think himself reputed in the Commonwealth wherin he was born, for other then a fool or a forei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. When a man writes to the world, he summons up all his reason and deliberation to assist him; he searches, meditats, is industrious, and likely consults and conferrs with his judicious friends; after all which done he takes himself to be inform'd in what he writes, as well as any that writ before him; if in this the most consummat act of his fidelity and ripenesse, no years, no industry, no former proof of his abilities can bring him to that state of maturity, as not to be still mistrusted and suspected, unlesse he carry all his considerat diligence, all his midnight watchings, and expence of <hi>Palladian</hi> oyl, to the hasty view of an unleasur'd licencer, perhaps much his younger, perhaps far his inferiour in judgement, perhaps one who never knew the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of book-writing, and if he be not repulst, or slighted, must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Print like a punic with his guardian, and his censors hand on the back of his title to be his bayl and surety, that he is no idiot, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, it cannot be but a dishonor and derogation to the author, to the book, to the priviledge and dignity of Learning. And what if the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor shall be one so copious of fancie, as to have many things well worth the adding, come into his mind after licencing, while the book is yet under the Presse, which not seldom happ'ns to the best and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentest writers; and that perhaps a dozen times in one book. The Printer dares not go beyond his licenc't copy; so often then must the author trudge to his leav-giver, that those his new insertions may be viewd; and many a jaunt will be made, ere that licencer, for it must be the same man, can either be found, or found at leisure; mean while ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Presse must stand still, which is no small damage, or the author loose his accuratest thoughts, &amp; send the book forth wors then he had made it, which to a diligent writer is the greatest melancholy and vexation that can befall. And how can a man teach with autority, which is the life of teaching, how can he be a Doctor in his book as he ought to be, or else had better be silent, whenas all he teaches, all he delivers, is but under the tuition, under the correction of his patriarchal licencer to blot or alter what precisely accords not with the hidebound humor which he calls his judgement. When every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:121215:13"/>
reader upon the first sight of a pedantick licence, will be ready with these like words to ding the book a coits distance from him, I hate a pupil teacher, I endure not an instructer that comes to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wardship of an overseeing sist. I know nothing of the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, but that I have his own hand here for his arrogance; who shall warrant me his judgement? The State Sir, replies the Stationer, but has a quick return, The State shall be my governours, but not my cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; they may be mistak'n in the choice of a licencer, as easily as this licencer may be mistak'n in an author: This is some common stuffe: and he might adde from Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> That <hi>such authoriz'd books are but the language of the times.</hi> For though a licencer should happ'n to be judicious more then ordnary, which will be a great jeopardy of the next succession, yet his very office, and his commission enjoyns him to let passe nothing but what is vulgarly receiv'd already. Nay, which is more lamentable, if the work of any deceased author, though never so famous in his life time, and even to this day, come to their hands for licence to be Printed, or Reprinted, if there be found in his book one sentence of a ventrous edge, utter'd in the height of zeal, and who knows whether it might not be the dictat of a divine Spirit, yet not suiting with every low decrepit humor of their own, though it were <hi>Knox</hi> himself, the Reformer of a Kingdom that spake it, they will not pardon him their dash: the sense of that great man shall to all posterity be lost, for the fearfulnesse, or the presumptuous rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a perfunctory licencer. And to what an author this violence hath bin lately done, and in what book of greatest consequence to be faithfully publisht, I could now instance, but shall forbear till a more convenient season. Yet if these things be not resented seriously and timely by them who have the remedy in their power, but that such iron moulds as these shall have autority to knaw out the choisest periods of exquisitest books, and to commit such a treacherous fraud against the orphan remainders of worthiest men after death, the more sorrow will belong to that haples race of men, whose misfortune it is to have understanding. Henceforth let no man care to learn, or care to be more then worldly wise; for certainly in higher matters to be ignorant and slothfull, to be a common stedfast dunce will be the only pleasant life, and only in request.</p>
            <p>And as it is a particular disesteem of every knowing person alive, and most injurious to the writt'n labours and monuments of the dead, so to me it seems an undervaluing and vilifying of the whole Nation. I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:121215:13"/>
cannot set so light by all the invention, the art, the wit, the grave and solid judgement which is in England, as that it can be comprehended in any twenty capacities how good soever, much lesse that it should not passe except their superintendence be over it, except it be sifted and strain'd with their strainers, that it should be uncurrant without their manuall stamp. Truth and understanding are not such wares as to be monopoliz'd and traded in by tickets and statutes, and standards. We must not think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the Land, to mark and licence it like our broad cloath, and our wooll packs. What is it but a servitude like that impos'd by the Philistims, not to be allow'd the sharpning of our own axes and coulters, but we must repair from all quarters to twenty licencing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Had any one writt'n and divulg'd erroneous things &amp; scandalous to honest life, misusing and forfeiting the esteem had of his reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, if after conviction this only censure were adjudg'd him, that he should never henceforth write, but what were first examin'd by an appointed officer, whose hand should be annext to passe his credit for him, that now he might be safely read, it could not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended lesse then a disgracefull punishment. Whence to include the whole Nation, and those that never yet thus offended, under such a diffident and suspectfull prohibition, may plainly be understood what a disparagement it is. So much the more, when as dettors and delinquents may walk abroad without a keeper, but unoffensive books must not stirre forth without a visible jaylor in thir title. Nor is it to the common people lesse then a reproach; for if we be so jealous over them, as that we dare not trust them with an English pamphlet, what doe we but censure them for a giddy, vitious, and ungrounded people; in such a sick and weak estate of faith and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, as to be able to take nothing down but through the pipe of a licencer. That this is care or love of them, we cannot pretend, whenas in those Popish places where the Laity are most hated and dispis'd the same strictnes is us'd over them. Wisdom we cannot call it, because it stops but one breach of licence, nor that neither; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as those corruptions which it seeks to prevent, break in faster at other dores which cannot be shut.</p>
            <p>And in conclusion it reslects to the disrepute of our Ministers also, of whose labours we should hope better, and of the proficiencie which thir flock reaps by them, then that after all this light of the Gospel which is, and is to be, and all this continuall preaching, they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:121215:14"/>
should be still frequented with such an unprincipl'd, unedify'd, and laick rabble, as that the whiffe of every new pamphlet should stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger them out of thir catechism, and Christian walking. This may have much reason to discourage the Ministers when such a low conceit is had of all their exhortations, and the benefiting of their hearers, as that they are not thought fit to be turn'd loose to three sheets of paper without a licencer, that all the Sermons, all the Lectures preacht, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vented in such numbers, and such volumes, as have now well-nigh made all other books unsalable, should not be armor anough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one single <hi>enchiridion,</hi> without the castle St. <hi>Angelo</hi> of an <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lest som should perswade ye, Lords and Commons, that these arguments of lerned mens discouragement at this your order, are meer flourishes, and not reall, I could recount what I have seen and heard in other Countries, where this kind of inquisition tyrannizes; when I have sat among their lerned men, for that honor I had, and bin counted happy to be born in such a place of as they suppos'd England was, while themselvs did nothing but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan the servil condition into which lerning amongst them was brought; that this was it which had dampt the glory of Italian wits: that nothing had bin there writt'n now these many years but flattery and lustian. There it was that I found and visited the famous <hi>Galileo</hi> grown old, a prisner to the Inquisition, for thinking in Astronomy otherwise then the Franciscan and Dominican licencers thought. And though I knew that England then was groaning loudest under the Prelaticall yoak, neverthelesse I took it as a pledge of future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, that other Nations were so perswaded of her liberty. Yet was it beyond my hope that those Worthies were then breathing in her air, who should be her leaders to such a deliverance, as shall never be forgott'n by any revolution of time that this world hath to finish. When that was once begun, it was as little in my sear, that what words of complaint I heard among lerned men of other parts utter'd against the Inquisition, the same I shou'd hear by as lerned men at home utterd in time of Parlament against an order of licencing; and that so generally, that when I had disclos'd my self a companion of their discontent, I might say, if without envy, that he whom an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>questorship</hi> had indear'd to the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> was not more by them importun'd against <hi>Verres,</hi> then the favourable opinion which I had among many who honour ye, and are known and respected by ye,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:121215:14"/>
loaded me with entreaties and perswasions; that I would not despair to lay together that which just reason should bring into my mind, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the removal of an undeserved thraldom upon lerning. That this is not therefore the disburdning of a particular fancie, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grievance of all those who had prepar'd their minds and studies above the vulgar pitch to advance truth in others, and from others to entertain it, thus much may satisfie. And in their name I shall for neither friend nor foe conceal what the generall murmur is; that if it come to inquisitioning again, and licencing, and that we are so timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of our selvs, and so suspicious of all men, as to fear each book, and the shaking of every leaf, before we know what the contents are, if some who but of late were little better then silenc't from prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, shall come now to silence us from reading, except what they please, it cannot be guest what is intended by som but a second ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over learning: and will soon put it out of controversie that Bishops and Presbyters are the same to us both name and thing. That those evills of Prelaty which before from five or six and twenty Sees were distributivly charg'd upon the whole people, will now light wholly upon learning, is not obscure to us: whenas now the Pastor of a small unlearned Parish, on the sudden shall be exalted Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop over a large dioces of books, and yet not remove, but keep his other cure too, a mysticall pluralist. He who but of late cry'd down the sole ordination of every novice Batchelor of Art, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd sole jurisdiction over the simplest Parishioner, shall now at home in his privat chair assume both these over worthiest and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest books and ablest authors that write them. This is not, Yee Cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Protestations that we have made, this is not to put down Prelaty, this is but to chop an Episcopacy, this is but to translate the Palace <hi>Metropolitan</hi> from one kind of dominion into another, this is but an old canonicall flight of <hi>commuting</hi> our penance. To startle thus betimes at a meer unlicenc't pamphlet will after a while be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of every conventicle, and a while after will make a conventicle of every Christian meeting. But I am certain that a State govern'd by the rules of justice and fortitude, or a Church built and founded upon the rock of faith and true knowledge, cannot be so pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. While things are yet not constituted in Religion, that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of writing should be restrain'd by a discipline imitated from the Prelats, and learnt by them from the Inquisition to shut us up all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the brest of a licencer, must needs give cause of doubt and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:121215:15"/>
discouragement to all learned and religious men. Who cannot but discern the finenes of this politic drift, and who are the contrivers; that while Bishops were to be baited down, then all Presses might be open; it was the peoples birthright and priviledge in time of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was the breaking forth of light. But now the Bishops abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and voided out of the Church, as if our Reformation sought no more, but to make room for others into their seats under another name, the Episcopall arts begin to bud again, the cruse of truth must run no more oyle, liberty of Printing must be enthrall'd again under a Prelaticall commission of twenty, the privilege of the people nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, and which is wors, the freedom of learning must groan again, and to her old fetters; all this the Parlament yet sitting. Although their own late arguments and defences against the Prelats might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them that this obstructing violence meets for the most part with an event utterly opposite to the end which it drives at: instead of suppressing sects and schisms, it raises them and invests them with a reputation: <hi>The punishing of wits enhaunces their autority,</hi> saith the Vicount St. <hi>Albans, and a forbidd'n writing is thought to be a certain spark of truth that flies up in the faces of them who seeke to tread it out.</hi> This order therefore may prove a nursing mother to sects, but I shall easily shew how it will be a step-dame to Truth: and first by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inabling us to the maintenance of what is known already.</p>
            <p>Well knows he who uses to consider, that our faith and knowledge thrives by exercise, as well as our limbs and complexion. Truth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd in Scripture to a streaming fountain; if her waters flow not in a perpetuall progression, they sick'n into a muddy pool of conformity and tradition. A man may be a heretick in the truth; and if he beleeve things only because his Pastor sayes so, or the Assembly so determins, without knowing other reason, though his belief be true, yet the very truth he holds, becomes his heresie. There is not any burden that som would gladlier post off to another, then the charge and care of their Religion. There be, who knows not that there be of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants and professors who live and dye in as arrant an implicit faith, as any lay Papist of Loretto. A wealthy man addicted to his pleasure and to his profits, finds Religion to be a traffick so entangl'd, and of so many piddling accounts, that of all mysteries he cannot skill to keep a stock going upon that trade. What should he doe? fain he would have the name to be religious, fain he would bear up with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in that. What does he therefore, but resolvs to give over toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121215:15"/>
and to find himself out som factor, to whose care and credit he may commit the whole managing of his religious affairs; som Divine of note and estimation that must be. To him he adheres, resigns the whole ware-house of his religion, with all the locks and keyes into his custody; and indeed makes the very person of that man his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; esteems his associating with him a sufficient evidence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory of his own piety. So that a man may say his religion is now no more within himself, but is becom a dividuall movable, and goes and comes neer him, according as that good man frequents the house. He entertains him, gives him gifts, feasts him, lodges him; his religion comes home at night, praies, is liberally supt, and sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously laid to sleep, rises, is saluted, and after the malmsey, or some well spic't bruage, and better breakfasted then he whose morning appetite would have gladly fed on green figs between <hi>Bethany</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> his Religion walks abroad at eight, and leavs his kind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainer in the shop trading all day without his religion.</p>
            <p>Another sort there be who when they hear that all things shall be order'd, all things regulated and setl'd; nothing writt'n but what passes through the custom-house of certain Publicans that have the tunaging and the poundaging of all free spok'n truth, will strait give themselvs up into your hands, mak'em &amp; cut'em out what religion ye please; there be delights, there be recreations and jolly pastimes that will fetch the day about from sun to sun, and rock the tedious year as in a delightfull dream. What need they torture their heads with that which others have tak'n so strictly, and so unalterably into their own pourveying. These are the fruits which a dull ease and cessation of our knowledge will bring forth among the people. How goodly, and how to be wisht were such an obedient unanimity as this, what a fine conformity would it starch us all into? doubtles a stanch and solid peece of frame-work, as any January could freeze toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Nor much better will be the consequence ev'n among the Clergy themselvs; it is no new thing never heard of before, for a <hi>parochiall</hi> Minister, who has his reward, and is at his <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars in a warm benefice, to be easily inclinable, if he have nothing else that may rouse up his studies, to finish his circuit in an English concordance and a <hi>topic folio,</hi> the gatherings and savings of a sober graduatship, a <hi>Harmony</hi> and a <hi>Catena,</hi> treading the constant round of certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrinall heads, attended with their uses, motives, marks and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:121215:16"/>
means, out of which as out of an alphabet or sol fa by forming and transforming, joyning and dis-joyning variously a little book-craft, and two hours meditation might furnish him unspeakably to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of more then a weekly charge of sermoning: not to reck'n up the infinit helps of interlinearies, breviaries, <hi>synopses,</hi> and other loitering gear. But as for the multitude of Sermons ready printed and pil'd up, on every text that is not difficult, our London trading St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his vestry, and adde to boot St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and St. <hi>Hugh,</hi> have not within their hallow'd limits more vendible ware of all sorts ready made: so that penury he never need fear of Pulpit provision, having where so plenteously to refresh his magazin. But if his rear and flanks be not impal'd, if his back dore be not secur'd by the rigid licencer, but that a bold book may now and then issue forth, and give the assault to some of his old collections in their trenches, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him then to keep waking, to stand in watch, to set good guards and sentinells about his receiv'd opinions, to walk the round and counter-round with his fellow inspectors, fearing lest any of his flock be seduc't, who also then would be better instructed, better exercis'd and disciplin'd. And God send that the fear of this diligence which must then be us'd, doe not make us affect the lazines of a licencing Church.</p>
            <p>For if we be sure we are in the right, and doe not hold the truth guiltily, which becomes not, if we our selves condemn not our own weak and frivolous teaching, and the people for an untaught and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious gadding rout, what can be more fair, then when a man ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, learned, and of a conscience, for ought we know, as good as theirs that taught us what we know, shall not privily from house to house, which is more dangerous, but openly by writing publish to the world what his opinion is, what his reasons, and wherefore that which is now thought cannot be found. Christ urg'd it as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to justifie himself, that he preacht in publick; yet writing is more publick then preaching; and more easie to refutation, if need be, there being so many whose businesse and profession meerly it is, to be the champions of Truth; which if they neglect, what can be imputed but their sloth, or unability?</p>
            <p>Thus much we are hinder'd and dis-inur'd by this cours of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing toward the true knowledge of what we seem to know. For how much it hurts and hinders the licencers themselves in the calling of their Ministery, more then any secular employment, if they will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:121215:16"/>
discharge that office as they ought, so that of necessity they must neglect either the one duty or the other, I insist not, because it is a particular, but leave it to their own conscience, how they will decide it there.</p>
            <p>There is yet behind of what I purpos'd to lay open, the incredible losse, and detriment that this plot of licencing puts us to, more then if som enemy at sea should stop up all our hav'ns and ports, and creeks, it hinders and retards the importation of our richest Marchandize, Truth: nay it was first establisht and put in practice by Antichristian malice and mystery on set purpose to extinguish, if it were possible, the light of Reformation, and to settle falshood; little differing from that policie wherewith the Turk upholds his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> by the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Printing. 'Tis not deny'd, but gladly confest, we are to send our thanks and vows to heav'n, louder then most of Nations, for that great measure of truth which we enjoy, especially in those main points between us and the Pope, with his appertinences the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats: but he who thinks we are to pitch our tent here, and have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the utmost prospect of reformation, that the mortall glasse wherein we contemplate, can shew us, till we come to <hi>beatisic</hi> vision, that man by this very opinion declares, that he is yet farre short of Truth.</p>
            <p>Truth indeed came once into the world with her divine Master, and was a perfect shape most glorious to look on: but when he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and his Apostles after him were laid asleep, then strait arose a wicked race of deceivers, who as that story goes of the <hi>AEgyptian Typhon</hi> with his conspirators, how they dealt with the good <hi>Osiris,</hi> took the virgin Truth, hewd her lovely form into a thousand peeces, and scatter'd them to the four winds. From that time ever since, the sad friends of Truth, such as durst appear, imitating the carefull search that <hi>Isis</hi> made for the mangl'd body of <hi>Osiris,</hi> went up and down ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up limb by limb still as they could find them. We have not yet found them all, Lords and Commons, nor ever shall doe, till her Masters second comming; he shall bring together every joynt and member, and shall mould them into an immortall feature of lovelines and perfection. Suffer not these licencing prohibitions to stand at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place of opportunity forbidding and disturbing them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue seeking, that continue to do our obsequies to the torn body of our martyr'd Saint. We boast our light; but if we look not wisely on the Sun it self, it smites us into darknes. Who can discern those
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121215:17"/>
planets that are oft <hi>Combust,</hi> and those stars of brightest magnitude that rise and set with the Sun, untill the opposite motion of their orbs bring them to such a place in the firmament, where they may be seen evning or morning. The light which we have gain'd, was giv'n us, not to be ever staring on, but by it to discover onward things more remote from our knowledge It is not the unfrocking of a Priest, the unmitring of a Bishop, and the removing him from off the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> shoulders that will make us a happy Nation, no, if other things as great in the Church, and in the rule of life both economicall and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall be not lookt into and reform'd, we have lookt so long upon the blaze that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> hath beacon'd up to us, that we are stark blind. There be who perpetually complain of schisms and sects, and make it such a calamity that any man dissents from their maxims. 'Tis their own pride and ignorance which causes the disturbing, who neither will hear with meeknes, nor can convince, yet all must be supprest which is not found in their <hi>Syntagma.</hi> They are the troublers, they are the dividers of unity, who neglect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not others to unite those dissever'd peeces which are yet wanting to the body of Truth. To be still searching what we know not, by what we know, still closing up truth to truth as we find it (for all her body is <hi>homogeneal,</hi> and proportionall) this is the golden rule in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> as well as in Arithmetick, and makes up the best harmony in a Church; not the forc't and outward union of cold, and neutrall, and inwardly divided minds.</p>
            <p>Lords and Commons of England, consider what Nation it is wherof ye are, and wherof ye are the governours: a Nation not slow and dull, but of a quick, ingenious, and piercing spirit, acute to invent, suttle and sinewy to discours, not beneath the reach of any point the highest that human capacity can soar to. Therefore the studies of learning in her deepest Sciences have bin so ancient, and so eminent among us, that Writers of good antiquity, and ablest judgement have bin perswaded that ev'n the school of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom took beginning from the old Philosophy of this Iland. And that wise and civill Roman, <hi>Julius Agricola,</hi> who govern'd once here for <hi>Caesar,</hi> preferr'd the naturall wits of Britain, before the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd studies of the French. Nor is it for nothing that the grave and frugal <hi>Transilvanian</hi> sends out yearly from as farre as the mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous borders of <hi>Russia,</hi> and beyond the <hi>Hercynian</hi> wildernes, not their youth, but their stay'd men, to learn our language, and our <hi>theologic</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:121215:17"/>
arts. Yet that which is above all this, the favour and the love of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'n we have great argument to think in a peculiar manner propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and propending towards us. Why else was this Nation chos'n before any other, that out of her as out of <hi>Sion</hi> should be proclam'd and sounded forth the first tidings and trumpet of Reformation to all <hi>Europ.</hi> And had it not bin the obstinat perversnes of our Prelats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the divine and admirable spirit of <hi>Wicklef,</hi> to suppresse him as a schismatic and <hi>innovator,</hi> perhaps neither the <hi>Bohemian Husse</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> no nor the name of <hi>Luther,</hi> or of <hi>Calvin</hi> had bin ever known; the glory of reforming all our neighbours had bin compleatly ours. But now, as our obdurat Clergy have with violence demean'd the matter, we are become hitherto the latest and the backwardest Schollers, of whom God offer'd to have made us the teachers. Now once again by all concurrence of signs, and by the generall instinct of holy and devout men, as they daily and solemnly expresse their thoughts, God is decreeing to begin some new and great period in his Church, ev'n to the reforming of Reformation it self: what does he then but reveal Himself to his servants, and as his manner is, first to his English-men; I say as his manner is, first to us, though we mark not the method of his counsels, and are unworthy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now this vast City; a City of refuge, the mansion house of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, encompast and surrounded with his protection; the shop of warre hath not there more anvils and hammers waking, to fashion out the plates and instruments of armed Justice in defence of belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer'd Truth, then there be pens and heads there, sitting by their studious lamps, musing, searching, revolving new nations and idea's wherewith to present, as with their homage and their fealty the approaching Reformation: others as fast reading, trying all things, assenting to the force of reason and convincement. What could a man require more from a Nation so pliant and so prone to seek after knowledge. What wants there to such a towardly and pregnant soile, but wise and faithfull labourers, to make a knowing people, a Nation of Prophets, of Sages, and of Worthies. We reck'n more then five months yet to harvest; there need not be five weeks, had we but eyes to lift up, the fields are white already. Where there is much desire to learn, there of necessity will be much argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but knowledge in the making. Under these fantastic terrors of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121215:18"/>
sect and schism, we wrong the earnest and zealous thirst after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and understanding which God hath stirr'd up in this City. What some lament of, we rather should rejoyce at, should rather praise this pious forwardnes among men, to reassume the ill depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted care of their Religion into their own hands again. A little ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous prudence, a little forbearance of one another, and som grain of charity might win all these diligences to joyn, and unite into one generall and brotherly search after Truth; could we but forgoe this Prelaticall tradition of crowding free consciences and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberties into canons and precepts of men. I doubt not, if some great and worthy stranger should come among us, wise to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the mould and temper of a people, and how to govern it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the high hopes and aims, the diligent alacrity of our exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thoughts and reasonings in the pursuance of truth and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but that he would cry out as <hi>Pirrhus</hi> did, admiring the Roman docility and courage, if such were my <hi>Epirots,</hi> I would not despair the greatest design that could be attempted to make a Church or Kingdom happy. Yet these are the men cry'd out against for schismaticks and sectaries; as if, while the Temple of the Lord was building, some cutting, some squaring the marble, others hewing the cedars, there should be a sort of irrationall men who could not consider there must be many schisms and many dissections made in the quarry and in the timber, ere the house of God can be built. And when every stone is laid artfully together, it cannot be united into a continuity, it can but be contiguous in this world; neither can every peece of the building be of one form; nay rather the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection consists in this, that out of many moderat varieties and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly dissimilitudes that are not vastly disproportionall arises the goodly and the gracefull symmetry that commends the whole pile and structure. Let us therefore be more considerat builders, more wise in spirituall architecture, when great reformation is expected. For now the time seems come, wherein <hi>Moses</hi> the great Prophet may sit in heav'n rejoycing to see that memorable and glorious wish of his fulfill'd, when not only our sev'nty Elders, but all the Lords people are become Prophets. No marvell then though some men, and some good men too perhaps, but young in goodnesse, as <hi>Joshua</hi> then was, envy them. They fret, and out of their own weaknes are in agony, lest these divisions and subdivisions will undoe us.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121215:18"/>
The adversarie again applauds, and waits the hour, when they have brancht themselves out, saith he, small anough into parties and partitions, then will be our time. Fool! he sees not the firm root, out of which we all grow, though into branches: nor will beware untill he see our small divided maniples cutting through at every angle of his ill united and unweildy brigade. And that we are to hope better of all those supposed sects and schisms, and that we shall not need that solicitude honest perhaps though over timorous of them that vex in this behalf, but shall laugh in the end, at those malicious applauders of our differences, I have these reasons to perswade me.</p>
            <p>First, when a City shall be as it were besieg'd and blockt about, her navigable river infested, inrodes and incursions round, defiance and battell oft rumor'd to be marching up ev'n to her walls, and suburb trenches, that then the people, or the greater part, more then at other times, wholly tak'n up with the study of highest and most important matters to be reform'd, should be disputing, reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, reading, inventing, discoursing, ev'n to a rarity, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, things not before discourst or writt'n of, argues first a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good will, contentednesse and confidence in your prudent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, and safe government, Lords and Commons; and from thence derives it self to a gallant bravery and well grounded contempt of their enemies, as if there were no small number of as great spirits among us, as his was, who when Rome was nigh besieg'd by <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> being in the City, bought that peece of ground at no cheap rate, whereon <hi>Hanibal</hi> himself encampt his own regiment. Next it is a lively and cherfull presage of our happy successe and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For as in a body, when the blood is fresh, the spirits pure and vigorous, not only to vital, but to rationall faculties, and those in the acutest, and the pertest operations of wit and suttlety, it argues in what good plight and constitution the body is, so when the cherfulnesse of the people is so sprightly up, as that it has, not only wherewith to guard well its own freedom and safety, but to spare, and to bestow upon the solidest and sublimest points of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and new invention, it betok'ns us not degenerated, nor droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to a fatall decay, but casting off the old and wrincl'd skin of corruption to outlive these pangs and wax young again, entring the glorious waies of Truth and prosperous vertue destin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:121215:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come great and honourable in these latter ages. Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant Nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks: Methinks I see her as an Eagle muing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazl'd eyes at the full midday beam; purging and unscaling her long abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sight at the fountain it self of heav'nly radiance; while the whole noise of timorous and flocking birds, with those also that love the twilight, flutter about, amaz'd at what she means, and in their envious gabble would prognosticat a year of sects and schisms.</p>
            <p>What should ye doe then, should ye suppresse all this flowry crop of knowledge and new light sprung up and yet springing daily in this City, should ye set an <hi>Oligarchy</hi> of twenty ingrossers over it, to bring a famin upon our minds again, when we shall know nothing but what is measur'd to us by their bushel? Beleeve it, Lord and Commons, they who counsell ye to such a suppressing, doe as good as bid ye suppresse your selves; and I will soon shew how. If it be desir'd to know the immediat cause of all this free writing and free speaking, there cannot be assing'd a truer then your own mild, and free, and human government; it is the liberty, Lords and Commons, which your own valorous and happy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels have purchast us, liberty which is the nurse of all great wits; this is that which hath ratify'd and enlightn'd our spirits like the influence of heav'n; this is that which hath enfranchis'd, enlarg'd and lifted up our apprehensions degrees above themselves. Ye cannot make us now lesse capable, lesse knowing, lesse eagarly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing of the truth, unlesse ye first make your selves, that made us so, lesse the lovers, lesse the founders of our true liberty. We can grow ignorant again, brutish, formall, and slavish, as ye found us; but you then must first become that which ye cannot be, oppressive, arbitrary, and tyrannous, as they were from whom ye have free'd us. That our hearts are now more capacious, our thoughts more erected to the search and expectation of greatest and exactest things, is the issue of your owne vertu propagated in us; ye cannot suppresse that unlesse ye reinforce an abrogated and mercilesse law, that fathers may dispatch at will their own children. And who shall then stick closest to ye, and excite others? not he who takes up armes for cote and conduct, and his four nobles of Danegelt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I dispraise not the defence of just immunities, yet love my
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121215:19"/>
peace better, if that were all. Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
            <p>What would be best advis'd then, if it be found so hurtfull and so unequall to suppresse opinions for the newness or the unsutablenes to a customary acceptance, will not be my task to say; I only shall repeat what I have learnt from one of your own honourable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a right noble and pious Lord, who had he not sacrific'd his life and fortunes to the Church and Commonwealth, we had not now mist and bewayl'd a worthy and undoubted patron of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Ye know him I am sure; yet I for honours sake, and may it be eternall to him, shall name him, the Lord <hi>Brook.</hi> He writing of Episcopacy, and by the way treating of sects and schisms, left Ye his vote, or rather now the last words of his dying charge, which I know will ever be of dear and honour'd regard with Ye, so full of meeknes and breathing charity, that next to his last testament, who bequeath'd love and peace to his Disciples, I cannot call to mind where I have read or heard words more mild and peacefull. He there exhorts us to hear with patience and humility those how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be miscall'd, that desire to live purely, in such a use of Gods Ordinances, as the best guidance of their conscience gives them, and to tolerat them, though in some disconformity to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The book it self will tell us more at large being publish to the world, and dedicated to the Parlament by him who both for his life and for his death deserve, that what advice he left be not laid by without perusall.</p>
            <p>And now the time in speciall is, by priviledge to write and speak what may help to the furder discussing of matters in agitation. The Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> with his two <hi>controversal</hi> faces might now not unsignificantly be set open. And though all the windes of doctrin were let loose to play upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously by licencing and prohibiting to misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falshood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the wors, in a free and open encounter. Her confuting is the best and surest suppressing. He who hears what praying there is for light and clear knowledge to be sent down among us, would think of other matters to be constituted beyond the discipline of <hi>Geneva,</hi> fram'd and fabric't already to our hands. Yet when the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:121215:20"/>
new light which we beg for shines in upon us, there be who envy, and oppose, if it come not first in at their casements. What a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion is this, whenas we are exhorted by the wise man to use dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <hi>to seek for wisdom as for hidd'n treasures</hi> early and late, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother order shall enjoyn us to know nothing but by statute. When a man hath bin labouring the hardest labour in the deep mines of knowledge, hath furnisht out his findings in all their equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, drawn forth his reasons as it were a battell raung'd, scatter'd and defeated all objections in his way, calls out his adversary into the plain, offers him the advantage of wind and sun, if he please; only that he may try the matter by dint of argument, for his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets then to sculk, to lay ambushments, to keep a narrow bridge of licencing where the challenger should passe, though it be valour anough in shouldiership, is but weaknes and cowardise in the wars of Truth. For who knows not that Truth is strong next to the Almighty; she needs no policies, nor stratagems, nor licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings to make her victorious, those are the shifts and the defences that error uses against her power: give her but room, &amp; do not bind her when she sleeps, for then she speaks not true, as the old <hi>Proteus</hi> did, who spake oracles only when he was caught &amp; bound, but then rather she turns herself into all shapes, except her own, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps tunes her voice according to the time, as <hi>Micaiah</hi> did before <hi>Ahab,</hi> untill she be adjur'd into her own likenes. Yet is it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that she may have more shapes then one. What else is all that rank of things indifferent, wherein Truth may be on this side, or on the other, without being unlike her self. What but a vain shadow else is the abolition of <hi>those ordinances, that hand writing nayl'd to the crosse,</hi> what great purchase is this Christian liberty which <hi>Paul</hi> so often boasts of. His doctrine is, that he who eats or eats not, regards a day, or regards it not, may doe either to the Lord. How many other things might be tolerated in peace, and left to conscience, had we but charity, and were it not the chiefstrong hold of our hypocrisie to be ever judging one another. I fear yet this iron yoke of outward conformity hath left a slavish print upon our necks: the ghost of a linnen decency yet haunts us. We stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and are impatient at the least dividing of one visible congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from another, though it be not in fundamentalls; and through our forwardnes to suppresse, and our backwardnes to recover any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:121215:20"/>
enthrall'd peece of truth out of the gripe of custom, we care not to keep truth separated from truth, which is the fiercest rent and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of all. We doe not see that while we still affect by all means a rigid externall formality, we may as soon fall again into a grosse conforming stupidity, a stark and dead congealment of <hi>wood and hay and stubble</hi> forc't and frozen together, which is more to the sudden degenerating of a Church then many <hi>subdichotomies</hi> of petty schisms. Not that I can think well of every light separation, or that all in a Church is to be expected <hi>gold and silver and presious stones:</hi> it is not possible for man to sever the wheat from the tares, the good fish from the other frie; that must be the Angels Ministery at the end of mortall things. Yet if all cannot be of one mind, as who looks they should be? this doubtles is more wholsome, more prudent, and more Christian that many be tolerated, rather then all compell'd, I mean not tolerated Popery, and open superstition, which as it extirpats all religions and civill supremacies, so it self should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpat, provided first that all charitable and compassionat means be us'd to win and regain the weak and the misled: that also which is impious or evil absolutely either against faith or maners no law can possibly permit, that intends not to unlaw it self: but those neighbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring differences, or rather indifference, are what I speak of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in some point of doctrine or of discipline, which though they may be many, yet need not interrupt <hi>the unity of Spirit,</hi> if we could but find among us <hi>the bond of peace.</hi> In the mean while if any one would write, and bring his helpfull hand to the slow-moving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which we labour under, if Truth have spok'n to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, or but seem'd at least to speak, who hath so bejesuited us that we should trouble that man with asking licence to doe so worthy a deed? and not consider this, that if it come to prohibiting, there is not ought more likely to be prohibited then truth it self; whose first appearance to our eyes bleat'd and dimm'd with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and custom, is more unsightly and unplausible then many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ev'n as the person is of many a great man slight and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to see to. And what doe they tell us vainly of new opinions, when this very opinion of theirs, that none must be heard, but whom they like, is the worst and newest opinion of all others; and is the chief cause why sects and schisms doe so much abound, and true knowledge is kept at distance from us; besides yet a greater
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:121215:21"/>
danger which is in it. For when God shakes a Kingdome with strong and healthfull commotions to a generall reforming, 'tis not untrue that many sectaries and false teachers are then busiest in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing; but yet more true it is, that God then raises to his own work men of rare abilities, and more then common industry not only to look back and revise what hath bin taught heretofore, but to gain furder and goe on, some new enlightn'd steps in the discovery of truth. For such is the order of Gods enlightning his Church, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense and deal out by degrees his beam, so as our earthly eyes may best sustain it. Neither is God appointed and confin'd, where and out of what place these his chosen shall be first heard to speak; for he sees not as man sees, chooses not as man chooses, lest we should devote our selves again to set places, and assemblies, and outward callings of men; planting our faith one while in the old Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on house, and another while in the Chappell at Westminster; when all the faith and religion that shall be there canoniz'd, is not susti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent without plain convincement, and the charity of patient instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to supple the least bruise of conscience, to edifie the meanest Christian, who desires to walk in the Spirit, and not in the letter of human trust, for all the number of voices that can be there made; no though <hi>Harry</hi> the 7. himself there, with all his leige tombs about him, should lend them voices from the dead, to swell their number. And if the men be erroneous who appear to be the leading schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, what witholds us but our sloth, our self-will, and distrust in the right cause, that we doe not give them gentle meetings and gentle dismissions, that we debate not and examin the matter throughly with liberall aud frequent audience; if not for their sakes, yet for our own? seeing no man who hath tasted learning, but will confesse the many waies of profiting by those who not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with stale receits are able to manage, and set forth new po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to the world. And were they but as the dust and cinders of our feet, so long as in that notion they may yet serve to polish and brighten the armoury of Truth, ev'n for that respect they were not utterly to be cast a way. But if they be of those whom God hath fitted for the speciall use of these times, with eminent and ample gifts, and those perhaps neither among the Priests, nor among the Pharisees, and we in the hast of a precipitant zeal shall make no distinction, but resolve to stop their mouths, because we fear they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:121215:21"/>
come with new and dangerous opinions, as we commonly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge them ere we understand them, no lesse then woe to us, while thinking thus to defend the Gospel, we are found the persecutors.</p>
            <p>There have bin not a few since the beginning of this Parlament, both of the Presbytery and others who by their unlicen't books to the contempt of an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> first broke that triple ice clung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our hearts, and taught the people to see day: I hope that none of those were the perswaders to renew upon us this bondage which they themselves have wrought so much good by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But if neither the check that <hi>Moses</hi> gave to young <hi>Joshua,</hi> nor the countermand which our Saviour gave to young <hi>John,</hi> who was so ready to prohibit those whom he thought unlicenc't, be not anough to admonish our Elders how unacceptable to God their testy mood of prohibiting is, if neither their own remembrance what evill hath abounded in the Church by this lett of licencing, and what good they themselves have begun by transgressing it, be not anough, but that they will perswade, and execute the most <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican</hi> part of the Inquisition over us, and are already with one foot in the stirrup so active at suppressing, it would be no unequall distribution in the first place to suppresse the suppressors themselves; whom the change of their condition hath puft up, more then their late experience of harder times hath made wise.</p>
            <p>And as for regulating the Presse, let no man think to have the honour of advising ye better then your selves have done in that Order publisht next before this, that no book be Printed, unlesse the Printers and the Authors name, or at least the Printers be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd. Those which otherwise come forth, if they be found mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and libellous, the fire and the executioner will be the timeliest and the most effectuall remedy, that mans prevention can use. For this <hi>authentic</hi> Spanish policy of licencing books, if I have said ought, will prove the most unlicenc't book it self within a short while; and was the immediat image of a Star-chamber decree to that purpose made in those very times when that Court did the rest of those her pious works, for which she is now fall'n from the Starres with <hi>Lucifer.</hi> Where by ye may guesse what kinde of State prudence, what love of the people, what care of Religion, or good manners there was at the contriving, although with singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hypocrisie it pretended to bind books to their good behavior.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:121215:22"/>
And how it got the upper hand of your precedent Order so well constituted before, if we may beleeve those men whose profession gives them cause to enquire most, it may be doubted there was in it the fraud of some old <hi>patentees</hi> and <hi>monopolizers</hi> in the trade of book-selling; who under pretence of the poor in their Company not to be defrauded, and the just retaining of each man his severall copy, which God forbid should be gainsaid, brought divers glosing colours to the House, which were indeed but colours, and serving to no end except it be to exercise a superiority over their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, men who doe not therefore labour in an honest profession to which learning is indetted, that they should be made other mens vassalls. Another end is thought was aym'd at by some of them in procuring by petition this Order, that having power in their hand, malignant books might the easier scape abroad, as the event shews. But of these <hi>Sophisms</hi> and <hi>Elenchs</hi> of marchandize I skill not: This I know, that errors in a good government and in a bad are equally almost incident; for what Magistrate may not be mis-inform'd, and much the sooner, if liberty of Printing be reduc't into the power of a few; but to redresse willingly and speedily what hath bin err'd, and in highest autority to esteem a plain advertisement more then others have done a sumptuous bribe, is a vertue (honour'd Lords and Commons) answerable to Your highest actions, and whereof none can participat but greatest and wisest men.</p>
