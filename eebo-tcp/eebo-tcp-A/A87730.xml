            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Rioters in Lindſey Levell, and their Abettors, would have it thought that our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were ſuch ignorant men, as to make all the Lawes and ſtatutes by which the Commiſſion of Sewers is impowred to remove the ſurrounder of waters with ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations as are utterly impoſſible to remove them, and would ſo conſtrue thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, as if they were only made to mock men, to ſhew a publick good, &amp; to ſorbid the doing of it. But by a true ſenſe of thoſe Statutes it appears that the wiſdome of thoſe times did foreſee, that by Draining the Fenns, a new Province would be added unto England, and did therefore make Lawes fully impowring a Commiſſion of Sewers according to their judgement and wiſdome, to doe theſe publick works ſo honourable and profitable unto this Nation; ſo that the words in the Statutes ought in all reaſon to be ſo interpreted as to inable men to perform what they require them to doe, and according to this, the Drainers of Lindſey Levell have proceeded, and therein followed the ſteps of all proceedings in all undertakings of this nature, all which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by all former Parliaments, not admitting of ſuch conſtruction of the ſaid Statutes, as will make all ſuch works utterly impoſſible and contradictory in themſelves, as our Rioters would have it now underſtood. The long Parliament did Order a Bill to ſettle Lindſey Levell, which is in Maſter <hi>Scobels</hi> hands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is conceived that no man will deny, but that a Parliament has power by an Act, to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the Draining of any part of England on good arguments, and the opinion that ſuch a work may prove beneficiall to the Publick good of the Nation; which is all that can be ſaid, before a worke be done! I ſuppoſe then that this Parliament hath an infallible argument to invite them to ſettle and ſecure Lindeſey Levell, which is a worke already done, and ſo eminently honorable and profitable for the publick good; and to no mans prejudice, though many frivolous clamors be made of the Drainers dogs that barked at the Rioters when they pulled down their Maſters hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (and ſuch like ſtories) as alſo the Hoſpitall Lands (and others) exchanged for their own good, though Maſter <hi>Creſſet</hi> is pleaſed to call it taking to much land from them, which really is ſo: I ſay if all complaints of this nature, be referred unto a Commiſſion of unintereſted perſons to heare and determine as it is in <hi>Bedford</hi> Levell Act, they will be ſoon accommodated, ſo as no man can receive prejudice, but be all benefited by this draining.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is conſiderable, that ſeventy two thouſand acres that never paied penny to publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, will by this Draining contribute and eaſe other parts. [That the cuſtomes will increaſe very much, and that ſeventy thouſand pounds ready mony, may come into the Exchequer, for land belonging to the State, when this work is done] That many thouſands of poor people will be imploid about Flax, Hemp, and other Manufactures, and in Husbandry very conſiderable, where one Drayner in two yeares, did plant above a hundred thouſand Trees, built a houſe that coſt 3000 pound, and imployed for three moneths in one Summer, ſix hundred people to bring in his harveſt of Coole and Rape ſeed, which grew on Land where Fiſh did uſe to ſwim at Midſomer before the Draining; and for which the ſaid Drayner was ſued for Tythes, and made to pay them, and yet the Rioters teſtimonies in the conſented Report, doe all ſweare poſitively, that the Drainers never were in poſſeſſion, which makes thoſe teſtimonies invallid, becauſe contradictory. Of all which building and plantation, there is now no ſigne left, being all deſtroyed and carried away by that Riot, when thoſe publick works were ruined.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the addition of a new Province to England be a Publick good, it doth concerne the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in point of honour, as well as profit, to incourage private men by their private hazard and charge to undertake the like publick workes. For what can be more cenſurable in a Nation, than to ſuffer ſuch treaſure to be loſt ſo many yeares for want of induſtry? Or to ſee thoſe men deſtroyed by a Riot, for doing that which our anceſtors have ſo often invited them to doe, and this Riot done while the cauſe depended in hearing before a Parliament, and in contempt of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Orders of both Houſes, iſſued for confirmation thereof: And yet theſe Rioters with their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors are rewarded by 13 yeares poſſeſſion of the Drayners lands for ruining thoſe works, as if the act were praiſe worthy; while their Abettors doe plead Law for thoſe that have by that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot deſtroyed the foundation of al Law (as much as in them lies) al which the Drayners do humbly ſubmit unto the judgment of this Parliament, and do hope for ſome reparation from the Rioters and their Abettors, that may inable them to repaire thoſe publick works, and will deter others from the lika Riots hereafter.</p>

               <p>IT is humbly conceived, that in honour and juſtice no man will beleeve thoſe ſcandalous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which the Rioters and their Abettors doe whiſper in mens eares againſt the Drayners, and their works of Draining nor give any credit unto the ſeveral printed Libels which have been by them delivered at the Parliament Door againſt the Drayners, all which their great Abettors dare not ſo much owne, as to ſubſcribe their Names to them; and are therefore reputed as falſe ſcandalous Libels, defaming men that rather deſerve Statues of Braſſe, for the good by them done unto the Common-wealth, which their Adverſaries and their Anceſtors have ever indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, but could never effect.</p>
