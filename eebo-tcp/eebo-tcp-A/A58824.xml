            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The very worke of creation ſpeaks this truth; God made many Angels, he made but one man, and yet he could, if he would have made as many Legions of men upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, as of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven: He could, but he would not; would you know the reaſon of it?

            <p>God found not heaven it ſelfe free from mutinie amongſt a multitude of inhabitants, and therefore to take off all colour of Rebellion, and to prevent all pretence to diſobedience againſt Soveraignty, he made but one man; one, and no more; hereby teaching us, That the power of a King over his Subjects is as naturall as the power of a Father over his children; that the power and perſon of a Monarch is from God, and not from the people, and ſo to be acknowledged by the people: <hi>Sic fuit ab initio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is acknowledged by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who was led only by the light of nature, and ſaw as far into the Lawes of nature, as ever man did: <hi>At firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Regall Power belonged to the Father of the Familie,</hi> and he gives this reaſon for it;<note place="margin">Pol. l. 1. c. 8.</note> becauſe in the infancie of the world, the Fathers were ſo grandevous &amp; lived ſo long, that each Father begot ſuch a numerous Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as might people a whole Country: And therfore Regal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over them as Subjects was no leſſe from God, then Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power over them as children.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt that carries any ſhew with it, as I conceive, is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> taking up Armes againſt King <hi>Saul</hi>; and hence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells argue thus: <hi>David</hi> the Subject tooke up Armes againſt <hi>Saul</hi> the King, and was not rebuked for it, either by Divines, Lawyers, or States-men; many of his fellow-Subjects tooke up armes with him, to the number of 600. and very likely, many more contributed to the maintenance of that Army; nor yet were they reprehended by Divinity, Law, or Pollicie: and therefore Subjects may in ſome caſes take up Armes, and contribute to the maintenance of a Warre againſt their King, (if he be an oppreſſour of their Properties, Liberties, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.)</p>
            <p>And to this colourable objection it is anſwered, the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is falſe, falſe and abſurd both; falſe, becauſe <hi>David</hi> was ſo farre from taking up theſe Armes againſt King <hi>Saul,</hi> that he continually fled from him, and never fought with him:<note place="margin">
