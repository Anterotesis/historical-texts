         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

gotté goods, as if he had gotten the
true Good, applaudes his soule, as
if it were the soule of some Swine,
<hi>Soule thou hast many goods, now, &amp;c.</hi>
The Voluptuous when he hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
himselfe with the huske of

climbed the pitch and slipperie

Alas, alas, doe not all these

one liue an hundreth yeeres, beget
children, plant and build, and see
no other good but such as these,
the vntimely byrth is better then

to speake swelling
thinges, whiles we
soare in the Cloud
of generalities, let
vs descend to some solide parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
Three thinges there are
whence commeth Death to the
Soule of Man, Sinne with the
guilt thereof giues the first deadly
blow, exposing it to the wrath of
God who is a Consuming fire,
whose anger is the messenger of
Death, whence came the first
Thunderbolt striking thorough
the Soule, that sentence of God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:24736:14"/>
to <hi>Adam, Thou shalt dye;</hi> And such
as <hi>Nathans</hi> to <hi>Dauid, Thou hast sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and art the childe of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second, is the spott and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of sinne deprauing, yea,
deading all the faculties of man
to spirituall actions, which made
<hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>That which I would
doe, I doe not; And wretched man
that I am, who shall deliuer me from
this body of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that swarme of plagues
and army of punishments, in the
re-reward wherof comes first a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death. All which made</hi> Iob
<hi>cry out,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 3. 20.</note> Why is light giuen to him
that is in misery, and life vnto the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in soule? which long for death more
then for treasures; and ioy when they
can finde the graue.</p>
            <p>Were it not for these three, man
might liue, fare, and doe well, but
sin hauing entred into the World,
brought in Death with it, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:24736:15"/>
reigneth and triumpheth ouer the
sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> with this three-forked
Scepter, of Guilt, of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
of Punishment.</p>
            <p>Here comes in <hi>Faith</hi> with a three
fould Antidote, brings vs to the
Tree of Life, whose fruit and
whose leaues heale vs of the sting
and deadly poyson of Sinne: wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in vs a three-fold life opposite
to the forenamed deaths.</p>
            <p>The first is the life of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
discharging vs from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death, restoring the light
of Gods countenance appeased in
Christ our surty: which made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
cry out,<note place="margin">Psal. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed is the man whose
sinne is couered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is the life of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or new life, regenerating &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing
euery faculty, &amp; quickning
vs to euery good worke; which
maks <hi>Paul</hi> glory, that <hi>he is able to do
al things through Christ inabling him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:24736:15"/>
The third, is the life of ioy and
comfort, cheering the soule in the
middest of all trials and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
which made <hi>Iob</hi> in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of death exult and trust in
his liuing Redeemer, and <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult

            </p>
            <p>In these three, being contained
what-euer accomplisheth the life
of the soule: may not Faith well
be said to supply abundantly all
things pertaining to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse?
But what doe I trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the kindes of life? what
should I blot paper and tyre my
Reader in writing of the kinds of
Faith, the degrees of Faith, or any
other motions of Faith: things

so much vexeth me to see so

so little done by it, the Theory

conceiue nothing but high and

my thoughts for dreames, and to
say; <hi>Faith,</hi> thou art but a name, a

followers so dead, so mopish, so
melancholly? why are worldly
men as merry, as iocund as they?
Yea, why are many ciuill men as
righteous as they? whence should
this wrong and disparagement
proceed? Is thy Vertue exhaust,
thy strength decayed in this old
age of the World? or is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men know thee not? verily
neither of these. No drugge, no
herbe so commonly extolled, so
famously knowne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> of old, <hi>Luther</hi> of late, with

the miserie is, the World either
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:24736:17"/>
knowes not the vse, or forgets
the practise of it. There wants
a practicall <hi>Luther</hi> which should
deale by <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> by
Phylosophie, who brought it
out of the Skies and Bookes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>Doth not all the praise, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

consist in action and not in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Is not the gaine and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of it in sense and feeling,
not in knowledge or discourse?
Is not the throne and seat of it
rather in the heart then in the
head? Who knowes not there
is a Doctrinall speculation and
discourse of Faith easily by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and hearing attained, such
in one as Schollers, that neuer
went out of their Studies and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:24736:17"/>

of that delight and benefit
which the Merchant and Traui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
enioyeth by a reall sight and
fruition of them? What is the
notionall sweetnesse of honey
or sugar to the experimentall

Aery, windie stuffe is all, the
World at this day cares for and
hunts after. The Schoole-men
and Casuists, what doe they but
languish into vselesse, needlesse,

themselues to declaime in

to weaue a curious spiders

rarely shewing or pressing the life,

            <p>In a word, will you see the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion

disputes of it, the Pulpit Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
of it, Profession talkes of
it, prophane men sweare by it,
two or three, few or none liue
by it. I met with a story of an
ancient Hebrew, a reuerend Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
who that he might the more
liuely conuince the people in his

of this excellent Grace, put
himself into the habit of a

            <p>And indeede, why is there

adde not to thy great and many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:24736:22"/>
sinnes, a greater then all: <hi>Cains</hi>
sinne, which was greater in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie
then in fratricide. All
thy help is to looke of thy selfe
an obiect of confusion, and to
looke vpon Christ an obiect of
consolation: And then how fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
and deadly so euer thy sting
bee, by meere looking (a strange
cure I confesse, yet most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued)
that is, by sole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
thou shalt be cured and
liue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But forsooth thou
wilt be more mannerly then so
with <hi>Peter</hi> thou wilt not suffer
Christs precious hands to wash
thy foule feete. Take heede thy
modesty turne not into pertinacy,
lest he swear in his anger thou shalt
haue no part in him, if thou stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly
refuse his gratious offer:
he liked well the humility of that
Cananitish that bore the terme of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:24736:22"/>
dogge, but better her confidence,
that would not be said nay of the
crums of his table. And shalt thou
not tenne times, more honour him
and please him, in trusting his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and sealing to his truth, then in
fearing his iustice and dreading
his power? Take heede of pride
in the clothes of humilitie. Bee
not deceiued, It is pride and high
pride, not to come when thou
art called. <hi>Faith</hi> is obedience,
and obedience is more acceptable
then curtesie &amp; complement. The
sooner thou commest the better
welcome. It is rudenesse and not
good manners not to do as thou art
bidden to doe, yea, so often and
earnestly charged to doe. To doe
the worke of God is to beleeue in
him whom he hath fealed and sent
to be thy Sauiour.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Oh! but thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
faine first repent, amend and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:24736:23"/>
doe some good workes, and then
thou wouldest bee bold to come.
That is, thou thinkest thou shalt
not be welcome vnlesse thou come
with thy cost. Thou wouldest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of a pardon if thou mightst
pay for it: but his are free, and he
bids thee come and buy without
siluer, or else he saies, thou and thy
money perish. Thou wouldest
goe the old and naturall way to
worke. What shall I doe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
euerlasting life, but that is
now farre-done and impassable
through our infirmity: Besides,
before thou canst walke or worke,
thou must be aliue. Did Christ
indent with <hi>Zacheus</hi> for Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and almes? or <hi>Paul</hi> bid the Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
first repent, become a new
man, and then beleeue? No they
knew that the one would volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
necessarily, together, &amp; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
follow or rather accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:24736:23"/>
the other. Wherefore swim out
of these weedes, lay hold on the
Rocke, and to facilitate thy birth
by the Act of beleeuing, set bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy eyes Christs freedome to
all suitors in the time of his flesh,
repelling none that truely desired
the price of his blood: And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
Gods esteeme of <hi>Faith</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other Graces, Deeds, or
Acts of thine.</p>
            <p>Study, striue, endeauor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
as thou doest in a difficult
point to conceiue. Pray for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and for the act of beleeuing.
Be not euer beleeuing, and neuer
a beleeuer; euer beginning to
liue, and neuer liuing. Liue to
day, to day is Saluation offered,
steppe from death to life, and
write this day thy birth day, and
number from hence the dayes of
thy life, in which of a Childe of
perdition, thou are made the sonne
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:24736:24"/>
of GOD through <hi>Faith,</hi> and so
made foreuer. Doest thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
this with thy whole heart?
Driue on the Charriot of thy life
with ioy and reioycing till thou
come to the marke.</p>
            <p>But what signe shall I haue of
the truth of my <hi>Faith?</hi> May it
not bee presumption if without
repentance and sanctitie? How
shall I be sure it is not that vaine
and dead <hi>Faith</hi> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of?</p>
            <p>At the first, it shall suffice to
finde and feele a change of the
minde, an vnfained purpose, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and resolution of new vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
obedience, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
with <hi>Faith,</hi> though
the younger and a second bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in order of Nature: which
where it is, sufficeth to warrant
<hi>Faith,</hi> and to embolden the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the first act of conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:24736:24"/>
               <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the Iaylor, and all

they haue no more that which they

they haue no liuely <hi>Faith,</hi> They
were almost (for matter of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

habit. It is a rare portion, saith
<hi>Salomon,</hi> and that which GOD
giues onely to such as are good
in his eyes, to make vse of wealth,
to eate, drinke, and bee merry:
it is a much rarer to vse <hi>Faith.</hi>
What is a man the better for a

            <p>Oh that this did as clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

things whatsoeuer, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
beauty and benefit of them

breed perfectnesse, and through

Alas poore Phylosophers, when I
read your Treatises of Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of mind, of consolation, of
remedies against both Fortunes,
though in some things you come
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:24736:36"/>
neere the kingdome of Heauen,
yet how dull are your comforts
to one of ours? the highest of
yours to the lowest of ours? Had
you but through a creuis or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
seene the things which the eie
of <hi>Faith</hi> seeth with open face, how
would you in comparison of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianisme
haue loathed your Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme
and Epicurisme? Had you
but with the tip of your tongue,
tasted of <hi>Faiths</hi> dainties, how
would you haue magnified <hi>Faith</hi>
aboue all your Cardinall vertues?
you that so composed your liues
by ieiune and empty contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of an autarky in vertue by the
rules of nature; what stately liues
would you haue led and liued, if
the grace and hopes of the Gospel
had appeared to you by the rules
of <hi>Faith?</hi> As for you Poets of the
lighter and pleasanter veine, when
I read your oades and sonnets,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:24736:36"/>
chaunting out your choice ioyes
and loues, your wishes and vowes,
framing a conceited happinesse to
your selues, as the highest you
could imagine or desire: what low
streines and meane aire do I reckon
them, in comparison, of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and diuine hymnes? what
pittifull subiects for such sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
wits? what difference between
your oaten pipes and our heauenly
harpes? <hi>Salomon</hi> that loued both
these loues, liued both liues, and
sung songs of both sorts, when
God raised his muse to an higher
tune, and taught it to sing the song
of songs, how despised he his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
windy vanities in comparison
of his new spirituall delicacies.
Wherefore, O Christian, that hast
such transcendent obiects of thy
thoughts aboue al other men, why
shouldest thou not euer keepe thy
soule vpon the wing, euer in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:24736:37"/>
bee in the third heauens,
rowling and tumbling thy soule
in these beds of roses: I meane
these meditations of thy Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
sanctification and saluation
through Christ, without which,
why should one day passe thee?
why any one part of a day?
why should not thy soule haue her
due drinkes, breakfasts, meales vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermeales,
beuers, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meales,
as well as thy body? Thus
to redeeme time, thus to taske and
tye thy soule to such heauenly
round of worke, would it not make
the Mill of time pleasant, the yoke
of businesse easie? would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
time glide swiftly and easily
away like a boate with full winde
and tide needing no oares; or a
free mettald horse needing no
spurres, needing no idle pastime
to driue it before thee? shall it not
be a pleasure to thee to want other
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:24736:37"/>
pleasures? Thus mayest thou make
all thy daies Christ-tides, Easters,
Whitsundaies, Birthdaies, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydaies:
not enuying <hi>Foelix</hi> his
felicitie, <hi>Festus</hi> his festiuitie, nor

part or kinde
of Christian life,
consisting in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
which I
shall easily demonstrate not onely
to bee an indiuiduall companion,
but a naturall and necessary effect
of Faith.</p>
            <p>For looke how the strength of
the heart breedes, not onely
cheerefulnesse but actiuenesse:
Motion as well as health (whence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:24736:42"/>
it is that life, is put for liuelinesse
and agility) driues away all las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde,

in the body, for a time
stand with some sleight distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
spots of the skinne, atche of
limbes, but not long with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diseases, either vanquishing
them, or vanquished by them.
This noble vse of <hi>Faith</hi> will excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
appeare in both the parts
of this newe life, <hi>Mortification</hi>
and <hi>Viuification:</hi> And in each of
these, two manner of wayes doth
<hi>Faith</hi> produce this effect; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a moouing, partly as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant
cause. In the first kinde
admirable is the <hi>Pitho &amp; Saada</hi>
of <hi>Faith</hi> aboue all the Oratory

            <p>For thus it goes to worke with
vs, Hath Christ giuen himselfe
for thee, forgiuen thee so many
debts, conferred, fauours of all
kindes vpon thee, and what
hast thou to retribute? If thou
giue all thy goods to the poore,
thy body to the fire, thy soule,
to his seruice; yea were euery
hayre of thine head a man or
Angell, were not all short of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence?
Louest thou, louest
thou this Sauiour of thine, and
darest thou, or wilt thou dare to
venture vpon any thing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:24736:43"/>
him, is there any thing
too good, too heard or deare for
him? <hi>Mary,</hi> if thy teares will
washe his feete, wilt thou not
poure them out? Is thine haire
too good to bee the towell? Is
there any Spicknard too costly
for his head? <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the LORD
requireth the handsell of thy
Tombe, and wilt thou deny
him? <hi>Zacheus,</hi> louest thou thy
wealth aboue his honour that
hath saued thee? <hi>Stephen,</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest

Can, or did any Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
giue the nay to these mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
commaundes or commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
entreaties of Faith, will it
take the repulse? Doth it not
constraine and extort more then
all rackes and strapadoes, allure
more then all wages and prizes?
Doth not this <hi>Magnes</hi> as easily
drawe weighty yron as other
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:24736:43"/>
Iet doth strawes? So that when
thou wouldest bee sure to speed
and obtaine any thing of thine
vntoward heart, set <hi>Faith</hi> a
worke to make the motion, and
that will be sure to speede,
not onely by this perswading
facultie, but also by a Diuine
power secretly effecting what it
requires, conueying into the heart,
will, and abilitie vnto the deede.
It stands not without doores as
a Mendicant Flexanimous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swader,
but enters into the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets
of the heart, shootes the
barres, vnlocks the boults, takes

infuseth a plyable willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
of woluish and dogged,
makes the Will Lambe-like, and
Doue-like: of wilde and hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,

            <p>No otherwise then the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:24736:44"/>
curing the vicious sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
and restoring it to health,
makes it long for wholesome
meate, as before for coales and
ashes.</p>
            <p>All this it doth by fetching su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
efficacie from the
death and life of Christ; yea,
part of that mighty power where by
Christ raised himselfe from
the dead, cured all diseases, and
wrought all his miracles: By the
vertue whereof it metamorphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
the heart of man, creates
and infuseth new principles of
action. Make triall of this in
mortifying the flesh to sinne,
and quickning thy spirit to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
            <p>For example, complainest thou

therefore gettest so many knocks.
Dye to thy selfe, renounce the

his <hi>Hoc habet,</hi> his deathes wound,
pierce his sides, and breake his

            <p>Be weake in thy selfe and strong

thou shalt bee more then Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Leaue tuggling and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd what is there
yet further, thou
wouldest haue
Faith doe for
thee? Oh sayest
thou! it is not
enough to bee healed of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
vnlesse thou mayest take vp
thy bedde and walke; yea, leape
and skippe as the Lame restored
to his limmes. Oh! that I could
finde that life of Grace which I
see in some that can make it their
meate and drinke to doe the will
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:24736:47"/>
Though I be not pestered and
mastered with any reigning cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
yet I finde my selfe so
dull and vntoward, that I take no
pleasure in my life. Know also
that this quickning power, <hi>Faith</hi>
only can helpe thee withall. To
pray, to meditate, to haue thy
conuersation in heauen, to keepe a
Sabbath cherely is as easie to thee
as to Iron to swimme, and stones
to ascend vpward, but nothing is
impossible to <hi>Faith:</hi> it can natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize
these things vnto thee, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphize
thee, make thee a new
creature, of a moule of the earth
a soule of heauen, of a snaile a
dromedarie: such a change as the
Sunne workes in the vapour, when
of an earthy heauy substance, it
makes it light and aery, apt to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
into the middle Region.
Such a change <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith hee
felt in his conuersion: And how
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:24736:48"/>
else came <hi>Dauid</hi> to that high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in Gods seruice, that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Commandements of God
more then thousands of gold and
siluer, the honey and the honey
combe, that hee rose at mid-night
to meditate in them. The selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
duties may be done by the
Ciuill man, and by the beleeuer;
for the outside and deede done,
both may goe to Church, heare
a Sermon, reade a Chapter, but
the one goes as the Beare to the
stake, as a slaue to the mill, and
the dullard to schoole, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the other who hath a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
internall principle: which
is as a spring and oile to the
wheeles, that makes them goe
smoothly and currantly, makes
the yoake light and easie.<note place="margin">Esay 40. 31.</note> They
that trust in the Lord shall renue
their strength, lift vp the wing
as the Eagle, runne and not bee
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:24736:48"/>
weary, walke and not faint.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> it is that fetcheth sap
from the roote Christ, that makes
euery tree bring forth fruite in it
kinde, euery Christian in his
owne calling. What else made
<hi>Dauid</hi> so worthy a Souldier?
what taught his fingers to fight,
so that a bowe of steele was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in his hand? What made
<hi>Paul</hi> an able Minister of the
Gospell, gaue him the doore of
vtterance, made his tongue as
the penne of a readie writer?
<hi>Hee beleeued,</hi> therefore hee spake.
What made <hi>Onesimus</hi> of a false
eye-seruant, trusty to his Master,
as to the Lord? The like might
bee said of all trades and scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Looke what a full treasurie of
all sorts of graces Christ hath
stored vp in him, <hi>Faith</hi> dreineth
and deriueth them out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:24736:49"/>
to the vse of euery seuerall
Christian, euen <hi>Grace for Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> is the Conduit Cocke
that watereth all the Herbes and
flowres in the Garden. All which
the more I consider, the more I
pitty the preposterous care and
vnhappy trauell of many well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
who study the practise of
this and that vertue, neglecting
this cardinall and radicall vertue;
As if men should water all the
branches of a Tree and not the
roote: Faine would they abound
and shine in patience, meeknesse,
zeale, yet establish and roote not
themselues in <hi>Faith,</hi> that should
maintaine all the rest, are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to doe good workes, build
Hospitalles, giue Almes, but stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
not to doe the worke of the
Father: And what is the worke
of the Father, but to beleeue in
the Sonne whom hee hath sealed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:24736:49"/>
and sent into the world to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
on for Saluation; which
worke is the gratefullest work that
we can performe, and which will
make gratefull all that we doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides:
without which all that we
can doe will not please him.</p>
            <p>What cares hee for thy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Rammes, thy Riuers of
Oyle? Hath he not shewed thee,
Oh man, that he that trusteh in his
Sonne honoureth him most of all
in putting to his Seale that hee is
true? This honour if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
doe vnto him, hee would
honour thee with all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and withhold no ornament,
no good thing from thee, if it be
fit for thee. Meeke thou shalt be
as <hi>Moses,</hi> patients as <hi>Iob,</hi> zealous as
<hi>Dauid,</hi> thy soule and life embroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with all kinde of shining

adde this prescript to the former
when thou art on the toppe of

what suite thou hast to him, what
troublesome enemy thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
bee ridde off, suppose it bee
some potent <hi>Haman</hi> of prid,
make but thy complaint, and it
shall bee executed and crucified
before thine eyes. Consider what

            <p>This prescript if thou wilt day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obserue, some daies more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

what more or lesse; though I will
not promise thee thou shalt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to perfection of degrees
such as the perfected spirits of the

thou shalt euer beleeue but in
part, and therefore bee holy but
in part: yet this I dare promise,
as thou growest from <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>faith</hi>
so shalt thou grow from strength
to strength in all other graces, till

Affliction.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ay then, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
is there any
thing yet behinde
that may impeach
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pleat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
of a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
life, speake now if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that hinders it, which
Faith cannot helpe?</p>
            <p>Oh! yes saies the Flesh (which
euer is cowardly and loues ease)
though a man be neuer so iustified
and sanctified, yet may he liue in
pouerty, in crosses, yea in great &amp;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:24736:51"/>
manifolde pressures, and what a
life can there bee in such extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Oh how doth Faith heere
lift vp the Crest, shine and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
aboue Nature, Reason and
all Morall Vertues in her incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
valour? Being in all these
not as they, onely a patient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,
or a meere bearer, but more
then Conquerour; not onely, not
daunted, but reioycing to fall into
manifold trials and tentations;
knowing it selfe to bee the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
that nothing will breake; the
Palme, that sinckes not vnder the
waightiest of burthens; the Oyle,
that euer ouer-swims the greatest
quantity of water you can powre
vpon it, the sheate Anchor, that
holds when all other Tackling
breakes. Here is the Crowne and
Garland of Faith. Were it not for
Conflicts, what superexcellent vse
were then of Faith? Euery Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:24736:52"/>
can swim in a Riuer, euery
sculler saile in a Calme, in daily
and ordinary gusts, euery man of
a patient temper or cheerely dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
can hold vp the head, but
when a blacke tempest comes, a
tenth waue flowes, and one deepe
calls another, nature yeeldes, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
faint, heart failes: then to stand
erect, then to liue and raigne,
that onely can <hi>Faith</hi> doe, which
hath the Word for the Compasse,
and Christ at the helme. The
greatest aduersities that are, are
but the exercise, yea the soile and
luster of <hi>Faith.</hi> Man gloryes when
he can tame Tygers and Lyons,
thinks himselfe a stately king when
hee can make an Elephant bow
and stoope to him, when he leads
a Beare on the Ring, or can han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
a Serpent without hurt; but
what a small conquest is this to
that of <hi>Faith?</hi> When it makes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:24736:52"/>
shame, pouertie, sickenesse, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
banishment, yea death
it selfe, not onely, not dreadfull
and harmefull, but tractable and
seruiceable? Questionlesse, great
and sundry aduantages hath a
Christian by vertue of his <hi>Faith,</hi>
aboue any Naturian or Politique
by all his reason; onely, heere is
the defect of Christians that they
want skill, or else forget to holde
vp their shield when a Dart comes
suddenly vpon them. Like him
that was robbed by a Theefe
with a staffe onely in his hand,
hauing himselfe a Pistole at his
backe ready charged, but surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vpon the sudden, altogether
vnmindefull, or vnable to vse it.
And if a man hath a Target that
is impenetrable, what is hee the
better if his heart or Arte faile
him when hee should defend
himselfe by it? This makes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:24736:53"/>
when they ayle any thing,
with <hi>Saul</hi> to runne to <hi>Endor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28 7.</note> with
<hi>Asa</hi> to send out to the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 16. 12.</note>
as if Faith could stand them
in no steed. When therefore a
storme rises, presently runne and
awaken thy sleeping Faith, knocke
at Faithes doore, ho Faith, helpe
at a pinch, now doe thy office,
and Faith will presenly ayde and
releeue thee with one of these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
cordials.</p>
            <p>First, whereas sense and reason
did but dimmely and cloudily
suggest to their followers certaine
broken and confused opinions,
little better then dreames of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie
and prouidence. Faith will
confidently and euidently assure
thee of this ground of comfort,
that the least ticke befalles thee
not, without the ouer-ruling eye
and hand, not onely of a wise
God, but of a tender Father, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:24736:53"/>
fellow-feeling elder brother, who
knowing thy mould doth more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
measure out euery Crosse
vnto thee, then the carefullest A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries
do their Scruples and
Drammes of dangerous Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, out of this Principle,
Faith will, extract these infallible
conclusions, this estate is not the
Axe of Perdition but the Pruning
Knife of Affliction: this Cuppe
is not a potion banefull, but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable,
how bitter and wringing
soeuer. Whateuer befals, being in
Christ, it cannot bend to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
condemnation or vtter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
but an issue shall bee giuen
out of it. What terrible noyse
soeuer the storme shall make ouer
thy head, it shall bee but as Haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones
vpon the Tiled or Leaded
House that rattle more then hurt.
Thou art kept by the power of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:24736:54"/>
his might the euill one shall not
touch thee: thou art in safe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
vnder the Rocke Christ,
and mayest know in whom thou
hast trusted, and art sure neuer to
be confounded. If it be sicknesse
or pouerty, it is in thy Fathers
owne hand: if the rodde bee in
some malicious enemies hand, if
hee turne thee ouer to a seruant
to scourge thee, and dresse him
in the Diuels habit to scare thee,
yea though Satan himselfe buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fette
thee, yet he stands by, lookes
on, will moderate and number the
stripes: the Diuels could not goe
one inch beyond commission in
the Swine: hee knowes thy
strength is not the strength of
Whales or stones, and therefore
will not permit them to lay on
more, then thou shalt well beare:
his wisdome &amp; grace will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for thee. Hee that is in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:24736:54"/>
good termes with a Prince, feares
not the approach of Heraulds or
Purseuants: he that is out of debt
feares not Baylifes or Sergeants,
but imagines they come vpon some
good Messages.</p>
            <p>Afflictions are scarrbugges to
wicked men, as bushes to theeues,
but if thou bee a beleeuer, at
peace with GOD in Christ,
they lay off their terrible Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
and come with an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
countenance. GOD thy
Father hath giuen the whole
Host and Army of afflictions more
inuiolable charge then <hi>Danids,
Doe the younge man, my Sonne</hi> Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
<hi>no harme.</hi> Doe my annointed
no harme.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith</hi> will further as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that he hath not onely giuen
them a prohibition or negatiue
commission but an affirmatiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuuction
to doe thee all good that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:24736:55"/>
may be: he hath said vnto them,
purge, refine, trye, exercise, breed
the quiet fruit of righteousnesse,
giue him experience of his faith,
make him bring forth more fruit:
so that though there be in thy Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
some maligne or poysonful
ingredients, yet being administred
by him that knowes thy temper
and disease, and entirely affects
thy health, it shall bee so mingled
with allaies and correctors that
the confection shall be good, and
all together shall and must worke
for the best. When thou feelest
thy bowels wring, or (as in a Sea-sicknesse)
are dead sicke for the
present, remember thou shalt bee
the better many daies after. And
though with <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> thy
querulous flesh complaine, and
grunt, and groane, yet when it is
ouer a little, thou shalt bee able
to say, <hi>Oh this was good for me!</hi> I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:24736:55"/>
would not for any thing but I had
borne the yoake in my youth, that
I may liue the more comfortably
in age: Considering that sicke
thou art, and that of many hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
thy Father should not
loue thee, if he should feede thee
with sweete meate, and mingle no
Aloes with them: much folly is
bound vp in thy back, and if thy
indulgent father should forbeare
the rodde he should hate and not
loue thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Moreouer <hi>Faith</hi> will
reminde thee of Christs partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in thy affliction, and of thy
conformity with him, <hi>the first
borne, onely begotten, and entirely
beloued</hi> sonne of God, if hee that
was without sinne, yet was not
without stripes, wilt thou looke
to bee a cockered <hi>Adoniah?</hi> And
what if the Crosse bee heauy,
and thou a weake Childe, yet
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:24736:56"/>
Christ a Gyant at one end,
beares part of it, and makes it light
and easie, hee is quicke of
feeling, when <hi>Stephen</hi> is stoned,
saith, <hi>Saul why persecutest thou
mee?</hi> Besides what more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Badge and Cognisance
canst thou haue of thy Sonship,
then this resemblance of him,
not as now glorified in the
heauens, which thou must stay
for till thou come there, but as
in the way to glory, when hee
despised the shame, suffered the
Crowne of thornes, the Scepter
of Reed, the spittings, buffetings,
mockes and mowes, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches
of vile sinners, the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the Speare, and shewed
himselfe to be the Sonne of God,
not by descending from the Crosse
but by enduring the Crosse: <hi>And
shall I not</hi> (saith he) <hi>drinke the Cup
which my Father hath tempered?</hi> and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:24736:56"/>
if thou wilt bee his Disciple, the
first lesson in his Schoole is,
<hi>Christs Crosse,</hi> Deny thy selfe,
take it vp and follow him, And
glory with the Martyrs, now am
I like my Lord and Master.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Faith</hi> will set before
thee as before him the infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of rewarde, not onely
renowne in this World, which yet
by <hi>Faith</hi> the patience, not onely of
<hi>Iob,</hi> but of all Martyrs haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
but that farre most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Hyperbolicall weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Which <hi>Paul</hi> eying, counted
his afflictions (which to vs would
haue beene intollerable) light and
momentany, not worthy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in comparison: which made
him not onely, not weepe and
howle, but sing in the Dungeon,
and reckon it a speciall fauour and
honour to be counted not onely
a beleeuer, but a sufferer for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:24736:57"/>
Christ. And God forbid, that a
beleeuer should glory in any thing
so much as in the Crosse of Christ,
in his wounds and scarres for his
Lord and Master: As that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>Vincentius</hi> sayd to the Tyrant,
<hi>Threaten these things to your Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Carpet Knights; Rackes,
Strapadoes, torments, are but a play
to vs, we Souldiers chuse to bee in
Christs Garrison, rather then in the
Court, in the Field and fore-front of
the battle, then in the Pallaces of
Princes.</hi> The more hazard and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,
the more glory and honour.
And what else desire wee but to
dye dayly, that the life in Christ
may be manifested in vs? Yea, in
the very instant of Death, Faith
helpes the beleeuer to liue, so as he
may be said not to see death, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to dye, (but that requires a iust
Treatise by it selfe.) Let all the
complaints, greeuances, wants, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:24736:57"/>
miseries of the world be searched
and gaged; the bottome will bee
found either to be want of Faith,
or of the vse and practise of Faith:
So that we may well say with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
to any christian sinking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his crosse, or shrinking at his
enemy, <hi>Hast thou lost thy Faith?</hi>
And conclude with that worthy
Ensigne-bearer of Christ, <hi>Many
are the troubles of the Righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Foxe in 14.</note> but
<hi>by Faith wee stand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc.</note> 
               <hi>by Faith
we fight, by Faith we
ouercome.</hi>

beene forgotten (that which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
should be called worke and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse)
hast thou not melted the
day, yea, it may bee the weeke,
or moneth past, and made thy
soule wholly to fast and pine for
want of these refeshings: if so, as I
most iustly feare it in most of my
Readers, how much more in such
as are vsually no readers? why then
let thy heart smite thee for thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
smite thou thy selfe vpon the
thigh, and say, how haue I liued,
or rather not liued, but consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
precious dayes in time-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Vanities? How comes it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that the greatest part of my
life is the least part wherein I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:24736:60"/>
haue liued.</p>
            <p>Oh then recouer and recollect
thy selfe before thou goe hence,
and be no more. Wilt thou dy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou hast liued, as Boyes slub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
out Bookes before they learne
their lesson. Oh learne to liue this
life, It is neuer too late, it is neuer,
I am sure, too soone; it is no shame
to learne it what age or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
soeuer thou bee of. Bee thou
Prince, Potentate, Nobleman or
Gentleman, though few such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
I looke for: remembring well
what <hi>Bradford</hi> tels the Earle of
<hi>Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> tels <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manian,</hi>
whiles hee was in the
mouthes of all men, most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
most munificent, most
fortunate, in the full of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie,
in the source of pleasures
in the toppe of greatnesse, &amp;c.
who durst lispe a word of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life, of true happinesse, or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:24736:60"/>
what boote was it for any man to
make mention of any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Yet if any such God will
perswade to make tryall of this
life, thou which saist, what is a
Gentleman but his pleasure? shalt
then tell mee, as <hi>Salomon</hi> of his
youth such gentry is but vanity;
true pleasure there is none but in
this life. What is a Christian but
his <hi>Faith?</hi> and what is his life but
the vse of his <hi>Faith?</hi> Beest thou
a Scholler, a Prophet, or Sonne
of the Prophets, what is thy
worke? what is thy scope? or
what should it bee in thy selfe
and others, but this life of <hi>Faith?</hi>
What is <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apolloes</hi> but
such as by whom you haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note>
What euer you teach,
before you haue taught this you
were as good Preache to the
stooles and stones of your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
What are your Auditors
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:24736:61"/>
but dead bones, and skulles, till
they, beleeue, and till Christ be
formed in them. Get first an
hold whereon you may fasten
your Engines to drawe them to
vertues and good workes. You
which would doe that in soules
which <hi>Elisha</hi> did in bodies, raise
them from their graues: Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors
one of a thousand get the
tongue of the learned to declare
their righteousnesse vnto them,
the righteousnesse I say of Faith:
shew your selues skilfull worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
such as haue been brought
vp not onely in moralls of the
heathen, subtilties of Scholemen,
sentences and conceipts of Posti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
rosaries, destructories, Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,
but in the wholesome
word of Faith, which are the
Arme and power of God to the
saluation of euery beleeuer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all let it be our wisedome to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:24736:61"/>
liue our selues by that which we
teach others to liue by; wee that
haue, or might, or should haue
more Faith then common Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
is it not a shame if we liue
not more happily, and cheerefully
then priuate Christians? not by
our Liuings wherein the Laity
hath now gotten the start of vs
for the most part, but by our
Faith, wherein wee haue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of them, or else shame
be it to vs.</p>
            <p>Is it not a shame to see an honor
of a thousand pound a yeere liue as
meanely as a poore Farmer, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and professor of an Art, as a
meane practisioner. Yet this I
must say euen to the meanest trads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and poorest people, this life
belongs not to such onely that are
booke learned, but is equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious
and open (as the Kings high
way) to all sortes of Trauailers to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:24736:62"/>
Heauen. Honourable liues, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
liues, voluptuous liues, poore
folkes haue small hope to atteyne
vnto: but a true happy life they
may and doe liue as well as the
learnedest Cleakes and greatest
Princes, if they get the gift to
practise that, which, such for the
most part doe but study and talke
of. To conclude, what euer thou
art, or who euer that desirest to
mend thy condition, to better
thine estate, to multiply thy life,
to change thy few and euill daies
of thy pilgrimage, into good and
many: behold here is the Art of
liuing well and liuing long. Life
is not to bee numbred by the
houres, but measured by cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
as moneyes not by tale
but value. A little peece of gold
conteynes a great many peeces of
siluer. Manhood consists not in
the bulke of the bones, but in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:24736:62"/>
mettall and spirits. Is not one
weeke of an healthy man, better,
then a yeere of a crasie; one Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
houre, then a gloomy day?
I haue often mused how a man
might come neerest to that life
which <hi>Adam</hi> lost, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
in this latter age of the
World, (wherein the liues of
men are so contracted) the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeuity
of those that liued before
the Floud. And this is the best
helpe I finde: To liue well is to
liue twise. A good man doubles
and amplifies his dayes: one may
speake as much in few words as
another in many. <hi>Persius</hi> wrote
more in a few leaues then <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
in large volumes. One day led
by the rules of Faith is better then
an immortalitie of vanity. A
man may liue to as good content
to himselfe and others, in a short
space, as others in a long life;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:24736:63"/>
some are old in yeeres tediously
drawne out, others in howers
cheerfully spent, some haue been
long, and others haue liued long,
and they onely are such as haue
liued this life; of whom I conclude
as doth the story of the Kings,
<hi>Ieremiahs</hi> Prophecie, touching
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> vpon his aduancement
by the King of Babell, His porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was a continuall portion, a
Kingly portion, euery day a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
all the dayes of his life, such
I say it is, or might be, if Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
might be perswaded not to
content themselues to professe or
thinke they haue Faith, but to liue
by their Faith:<note place="margin">A needfull Caueat.</note> onely before I
part with thee, take from me one
Caueat, one aduise, one request,
and so an end.</p>
            <p>First, take heede thou mistakest
me not in all this, as if I had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of an absolute perfection in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:24736:63"/>
this life equall to vision &amp; fruition
in the life to come, confounded
Heauen with earth, as if I thought
my selfe, or any other to haue
comprehended. If any man
thinkes hee beleeues any thing,
hee beleeues nothing yet as hee
ought to beleeue, but all things
in part, and imperfectly. Wee
cannot by all our assiduousnesse
in Reading, Prayer, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
haue Gods Spirit at an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
command, no more then
Mariners the winde, or Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the showers, so as the most
obseruant beleeuer hath his <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bida
interualla,</hi> his buffetings, lest
hee bee too much exalted, his
desertions wherein his beloued
will hide himselfe behinde the
grates, not to bee found of him
for a while, that hee seeke him
more eagerly, and prise his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
more thankefully, more
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:24736:64"/>
heedefully keepe him when hee
hath him, and be wholly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
on his grace; yet so as this
remaines most sure and certaine,
that the constant and dayly Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiser
of his faith shall constantly,
and congruously bee seconded
with the gusts and gales of his
spirit, the onely true <hi>Zephirus</hi> and
<hi>Fauonius,</hi> shall haue Satan tyed
vp from long and frequent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesting
him, shall not haue such
tedious absences of the Spirit,
such vncertaine fits and moodes
of his ioy and comfort, as the
negligent and loose beleeuer, but
a more stedfast frame and tenor
of ioy, then any other kinde of
man in the world that takes not
this course.</p>
            <p>Prouided that thou take this
aduise,<note place="margin">A profitable aduice.</note> that for the better and
stronger vse of this <hi>Faith,</hi> thou
seele vp thy senses and chaine vp
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:24736:64"/>
thy reason. Walking by sight,
and walking by Faith are opposite
things: and therefore as men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the visuall beames of one eye
by closing the other; so must thou
winke and close vp the eye of thy
soule to all worldly things, that
thou mayest by the prospectiue of
Faith fixe thy spirituall eye vpon
heauenly delights: not that thou
needest goe out of this world and
sequester thy selfe like an Eremite
into Dennes and Caues, retired
from all societie, but euen in the
middest of all glistering obiects
see them as if thou sawest them
not; that is without being deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected with them. So looked
<hi>Paul</hi> from off the things that are
seene euen in the middest of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and looked vpon things which
were not seene: and <hi>Moses</hi> in
Pharaohs Court saw him that was
inuisible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:24736:65"/>
A right beleeuer goes through
the world, as a man whose minde
is in a deepe study: or as one that
hath speciall haste of some weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
businesse, goes through a street;
that gazeth on nothing, heares
nothing, mindes nothing that is
in the way, but onely that which
his head is taken vp withall: Our
conuersation is in heauen, our
treasure is in heauen. Oh! that
all our thoughts were there, so as
no earthly obiect might detaine,
or distract them, no more then
must needes bee in our callings, so
that the maine bent and intention
of all that is within vs might be set
vpon the dayly nourishing of our
Faith.</p>
            <p>For which purpose I make this
parting and farewell suite vnto
thee,<note place="margin">An earnest request.</note> as thou meanest to receiue
any good by this Booke. That
thou wouldest euen from this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:24736:65"/>
very houre wherein thou endest
the reading of it, determine and
couenant, betwixt God and thy
soule, neuer whilest thou liuest
on the face of this earth to omit
one day (God enabling thee by
his Spirit) wherein thou wilt not
vindicate and redeeme, at the least,
one halfe or quarter of an hower,
either twise or once in the day,
at the least: Wherein all other
affaires layd aside, thou mayest
withdraw thy selfe apart from
all company, and occasions, with
a <hi>non obstante,</hi> to practise the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
formerly prescribed. That
is, by Prayer, Reading, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
to put some strength
and life into thy <hi>Faith,</hi> till thou
hast cheered, and reuiued, and
warmed thy soule therewithall.
This if thou shalt inuiolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
the strength, the feeling,
the comfort, and the fruites of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:24736:66"/>
thy Faith will by little and little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly,
and in a little while, most
sensibly thriue and growe till thou
commest to the ripenesse of age in
Christ.</p>
            <p>What hurt can it bee to thee if
thou shouldest binde thy selfe by
vow hereunto, or if thou fearest
thy strength, yet by full purpose
thus to doe all and euery day of thy
life: that so in the Lees and Dregs
of time, whiles fleshly Protestants
are raysing contention about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, or making Sects and
Schismes in the Church about
needelesse trifles, thou maist edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thy selfe in thy most holy Faith
and whilest thou liuest in the darke
wombe of this world, liue by the
Nauell of Faith till thou come to
haue thy mouth satiate with ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of all good things at the right
hand of God. When, as <hi>Elizabeth
Folk</hi> said, <hi>Faith shal cease to be Faith
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:24736:66"/>
and be turned into fruition, and wee
receiue the ende of our Faith, the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of our soules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things haue I written that
your ioy may be full.</p>
            <p>The Iust shall liue by his Faith.</p>
            <p>According to thy Faith so be it to
thee.</p>
