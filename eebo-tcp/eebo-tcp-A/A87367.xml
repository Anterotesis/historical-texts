            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WElcome (Great Sir) thrice welcome to this Hall;</l>
               <l>We 've nothing elſe to welcome you withall.</l>
               <l>All elſe is but your own; to You we owe,</l>
               <l>Life, Liberties, Eſtates, Religion too:</l>
               <l>All elſe is in your Power, only our hearts</l>
               <l>Are <hi>free</hi> to welcome and admire your arts.</l>
               <l>Time was, when we were forc't to court our Chains,</l>
               <l>And kiſſe the Rod which jerk't us for our pains:</l>
               <l>We durſt not cry for fear of t'other laſh,</l>
               <l>But ſmooth'd our browes, and blubber'd faces waſht.</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Lurdan</hi> Maſters made us them reward,</l>
               <l>For <hi>keeping of our Liberties</hi> in Ward.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But unto You, our hearts aſpire to fall</l>
               <l>A <hi>willing Sacrifice,</hi> this Feſtivall;</l>
               <l>Nor think it (Sir) a hollow complement,</l>
               <l>We deal in Wine, <hi>Wine only truth doth vent.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Now give us leave to borrow from our Trade,</l>
               <l>Something which may your radiant Virtues ſhade:</l>
               <l>And what may better Suit you than the <hi>Vine,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That Noble Plant, which does ſuch worth enſhrine?</l>
               <l>Firſt, in its <hi>leaves</hi> which <hi>hide</hi> and <hi>guard</hi> the cluſter,</l>
               <l>It notes your <hi>modeſty,</hi> which hides your luſtre;</l>
               <l>It ſhews your <hi>ſecrecy;</hi> by which ſecur'd</l>
               <l>You have a Bloudleſs Victory procur'd:</l>
               <l>O happy ſoul! whoſe <hi>ſilence</hi> could do more</l>
               <l>Then Arts and Armes, then Retorick and Pow'r.</l>
               <l>You have Three Nations redeem'd, and yet,</l>
               <l>Not ſpilt one drop of bloud in doing it.</l>
               <l>You gently did the Strength and Weapons ſteal</l>
               <l>Out of their hands, before they could it feel.</l>
               <l>Let <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> boaſt; let <hi>Athens</hi> bleſs</l>
               <l>

               </l>
               <l>That load which <hi>lightens</hi> men of all their cares,</l>
               <l>And <hi>fainting</hi> ſpirits with new life repairs.</l>
               <l>Thus You (my Lord) oppreſs your ſelf with pains,</l>
               <l>To <hi>bring</hi> forth unto us more <hi>eaſie</hi> gains.</l>
               <l>Under your <hi>watchful</hi> eyes we <hi>ſleep</hi> ſecure,</l>

               <l>To bind all faſt, and make us firmly bleſt.</l>
               <l>Some are already <hi>drunk</hi> with what-they taſt,</l>
               <l>And in a drunken fit quarrel for haſt.</l>
               <l>We wreſtle yet with <hi>jealouſies</hi> and threats?</l>
               <l>'Tis time muſt ripen all with kindly hears.</l>
