            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The hue of his fleſh was white, and well colour'd, and his hair and yellow beard, render'd him ſo reſplendent, he was ſtiled by many the King of Gold, but he hardly arriv'd to the thirty eighth year of his age.</p>
            <p>His firſt inclination to Arms was promoted by a Genius, as noble as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170463:17"/>
generous, which made him deſirous of glory, and ambitious of greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Prudence was ſtill his companion, eloquence and ſagacity accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſcourſes, vivacity and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility his treaties, and reſolution, and courage his enterprizes. In great affairs he wanted not Providence, readineſſe, and Conſtancy, and the force of his wit, and ſtrength of his mind, was ſtill moſt reſplendent in difficulties; he nobly contemning the Lawrells, and Palms, which were not augmented by labours, and water'd with pains.</p>
            <p>Before the Battell, he appear'd not ſo terrible, and dreadfull, as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, mild, and mercifull, when he had obtain'd the victory, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted in dangers, vigilant in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and wife in each affair. A Prince, in fine of great underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and knowledge in all things.</p>
            <p>He was followed with a greater affection, and applauſe, than any Commander before him. He gave ſatisfaction to all, with his praiſes, hopes, or mildneſſe, and eſpecially
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170463:18"/>
his ſincerity, actions of vertue being written by him with indeleble Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. He never forgat ſervices, whether little, or great, but reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and valu'd them. He was very wittie in his ſayings, and moſt affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in company, ſtill treating, and ſpeaking to all without pride, and frequently asking when he paſs'd by his People, and Souldiers, how they did, what they would, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. To his Table and Court, while he was in the field, he admitted all Gentlemen, and private Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he uſually ſaying, a table is the torment of a ſecret, and a net to catch friendſhip, and affection. He could not abide ceremonies, and complements affected, and to thoſe unacquainted with his Genius, hee ſaid, or cauſed others to ſay, they ſhould reſerve their Courtſhip for the Queens minds of honour, for he was in the field, to teach how to fight, and not to lead a dance.</p>
            <p>He was moſt ſevere in puniſhing the Souldiers offences, and exact in providing for the peoples ſecurity.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:170463:18"/>He, like a true ſouldier, to give an eſſay of the greatneſs of his mind, undertook not any enterprize, which was without danger, he that exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, to a care of his life, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his diſpleaſure. It ſeem'd to him undecent, for a Prince of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like conſtitution, to have the thoughts of death, he thinking the counſell proceeded from fear, which advis'd him to take heed of himſelf. He called him happy, that dy'd in his trade, the volunteer death taking pay under him, that feareth him not.

he did not value the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of arms, nor of times, but that of the courage. That the world was the ſame, each age had it's Mines, and Countermines, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and defences, and that he could war like <hi>Alexander,</hi> be victorious with <hi>Hanibal,</hi> and equall <hi>Caeſars</hi> Progreſſes, who had the mind of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the skilfulneſſe of <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> and <hi>Caeſars</hi> undauntedneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſpace of two years, he drew to his party, either by the force of arms, or the motives of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and reputation, of Fortreſſes, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and wall'd Town, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a hundred and ninety.

            <p>Nothing but the hereſy of <hi>Luther</hi> eclipſed his high qualities, who, if he had follow'd the ſteps of his Anceſtors, not ſwerving from the path of the true faith, would have been the Heroe of Kings.</p>

'Twas therefore obſerv'd, that from the firſt moments, as it were, of her life, and underſtanding, ſhe began, though a child, to procure the enlightning of her intellect, a command ore her reaſon, limits to her will, a curb to her affections, a rule to her actions, and ſtrength <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In her minority, five Miniſters and Officers of the Crown, which

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, to her other applications aforeſaid, ſhe added the inſtructing of her ſelf, in the knowledge of different tongues, to make her ſelf the fitter, and more capaple, for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">She learnt diverſe tongues.</note> in which ſhe made moſt eminent Progreſſes.

though a girle, ſhe penetrated the hidden deſignes of her principall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, of whom ſhe made uſe, to draw to her ſelf, the totall direction of the affairs of the Kingdom, ſo as ſhe gain'd great veneration, free'd her ſelf from the ſubjection, in which ſome pretended to hold her, and beginning to rule, ſhew'd ſhe had not any need, to lay the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms weight on any others head, than her own,<note place="margin">She begins to aſſiſt at the Council of State, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards takes the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon her.</note> inſomuch that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, when ſeventeen years old, to aſſiſt at the Council of the State, and in the eighteenth year, being out of her minority, took upon her the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, on the very ſame day, the War againſt <hi>Denmark,</hi> was hy the Crown of <hi>Swedland</hi> declar'd, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, together with his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, was moſt vigorouſly proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170463:21"/>
She alone did adminiſter all the publique affairs, and determin'd them with much eaſe, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: She alone would treat with Ambaſſadours, and the Miniſters of Princes,<note place="margin">She admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters her ſelf the greatest affairs.</note> giving audience without the Secretaries of State, or any of her Councellours, ſhe her ſelf giving an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to the propoſitions made her, as well by her ſubjects, as forraign Princes.</p>
            <p>This Queen, though young, knew at the ſame time, how to make her ſelf feared, and belov'd, by her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſtrangers. She ſecretly ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the genius, and thoughts of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, ſo us'd them to the bridle of obedience, and reſpect, that ſhe ſaw her moſt formidable Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, though accuſtom'd at the head of their Armies,<note place="margin">She makes her ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd and fear'd.</note> to make the world affraid, to conſerve ſtill in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, a reverence accompany'd with a fearfull obſequiouneſs.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of her mind, ſhe ſtill ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them, with offices of ſuch love and affability, that ſhe animating

their affections, encreas'd ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her ſelf their reſpect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the true props of a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>She beheld every writing preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and quickly, and with a clear voice, recited it in it's language, and with her own hand wrote uſually the Orders of importance, being as ſhy and heedy, in imparting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of her mind, as curious and cunning in penetrating thoſe of others.</p>
            <p>She generally affected all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vertue alone being only the object of her love. She ſought to mend the bad with ſeverity, and make the good better with favours and rewards; ſo as 'tis no wonder, that honour, and the rareſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ſute with worthy men, were ſeen to flouriſh more in her Palace, than in any other Court.</p>
            <p>No Prince ever favour'd more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of vertue, than this Queen; her Majeſty taking very great delight, to diſcourſe with knowing Perſons, and endeavouring to have near her, the learnedſt of each Nation, whom ſhe highly rewarded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:170463:22"/>She had her maids of honour in the Court for decorum, and her own entertainment; but they never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew her from her ſtudies, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of vertue.</p>
            <p>No extreamity of weather, nor heat of the Sun, nor Snow, Wind, Tempeſts, and Rains, nor any other injuries of the ſeaſon, or accidents, could induce her to that care of her ſelf, which was due to her royal condition. She ſuppoſed great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons walk'd not well with delights, and the Soul had no greater impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, in the gaining of vertues,<note place="margin">She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns all delicacy.</note> than the body bred up and foſter'd in them, labour, exerciſe, ſobriety, and vigilance, ſhe counting as parts, of her ſtrong and vigorous mind.</p>
            <p>The glorious enterprizes, which ſeconded the felicity of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties invincible arms, are already eternall in Hiſtories.<note place="margin">She makes war, and then peace with <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> to her advantage.</note> After eight months cruell War, and the famous ſucceſs of her arms; ſhe concluded a peace with his Majeſtie of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> to her great gain, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and afterwards eſtabliſht that

ſhe had formerly meaſur'd, with more accurateneſs, and warineſs: She conſider'd with her ſelf, that as God was ſtill the ſame, ſo his faith was the ſame, and the foundation of all truth: inſomuch, that with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he could not ſuffer any thing to be alter'd, and diſſonant in the knowledge of that Individuum, which ſhould be only one, and ſtill uniform to it ſelf.

The Queen's deſigns had ſolider motives, and deeper foundations. She ſought to gain a Kingdom, where Angells inhabit, and therefore loſt that willingly where men have their reſidence.<note place="margin">She truſts wholly in God.</note> The Queen could not erre in the reaſon of State, who ſecur'd to her ſelfe that of God. She labour'd to know God in true greatneſſe, and felicity; and God made himſelf known to her, by giving her judgement, and vigour, to ſeek what few did deſire, and to deſpiſe that which all covet after. For what concern'd humane reputation, and glory, ſhe had learnt; ſhe could not better make happy and prolong the ſhort periods of her life, than with the report of one of the moſt glorious reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170463:39"/>
that had ever been heard. She therefore very charitably and freely, agreeing to ſurrender her Scepter to the foreſaid Prince Palatine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a way with which, without diſcovering her thoughts, ſhe frankly might renounce the poſſeſsion of thoſe States, which were no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hers, becauſe by her Majeſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd for thoſe of Heaven. She thought, that ſhe had not the luſtre of any vertue, while ſhe ſate on that Throne, which was not illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſplendour of true faith. The Queen lov'd God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could no longer love the world. To mount to the greatneſſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 'twas neceſſary ſhe ſhould fall from the height of terreſtriall felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

Scriptures, and aſcended into Heaven, ſits at the right hand of his father, and is to come again with glory, to judge the quick and the dead, of whoſe Kingdom there ſhall be no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who together with the Father and the Son, is adored and glorified, who ſpake by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: and in one holy Catholick and Apoſtolical Church. I confeſſe one Baptiſme in the remiſſion of ſinnes, and expect the reſurrection of the dead, and the life to come, <hi>Amen.</hi> I firmly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and embrace the Apoſtolical and Eccleſiaſtical Traditions, and the other obſervances and conſtitutions of the ſame Church. I likewiſe admit the ſacred Scripture according to the ſenſe our holy Mother the Church hath held, and holds, to whom it belongs to judge of the ſenſe, and interpretation of the holy Scriptures: neither will I ever receive and interpret it, but according to the unanimous conſent of the Fathers. I likewiſe profeſſe ſeven true and proper Sacraments of the new Law, inſtituted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170463:95"/>
by Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and to the ſalvation of mankind, though al to every one are not neceſſary, namely Baptiſme, Confirmation, Euchariſt, Penance, extream Unction, Order, and Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and theſe to conferre grace; and of theſe, Baptiſme, Confirmation, and Order cannot be reiterated without Sacriledge.</p>
                        <p>I receive and admit the received and approved rites of the Catholick Church in the ſolemn adminiſtration of theſe Sacraments. I embrace and receive all and every thing, which have been deſigned and declared in the holy Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> concerning Original ſin and juſtification. I alſo profeſſe that in the Maſſe, there is offered up to God, a true, proper, and propitiatory ſacrifice for the living and the dead, and that in the moſt holy Sacrament of the Euchariſt, there are truly, really, and ſubſtantially, the body and blood, with the ſoul and divinity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a converſion made of the whole ſubſtance of the bread into the body, and of the whole ſubſtance of the wine into the blood of Chriſt, which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170463:95"/>
converſion the Catholick Church calls Tranſubstantiation. I likewiſe confeſs that under each kind, Chriſt is whole and entire, and a true Sacrament to be received. I conſtantly hold there is Purgatory, and the ſouls there detained, are helpt by the ſuffrages of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And that in like manner the Saints raigning together with Chriſt, are to be honoured, and invocated, and that they offer up to God prayers for us, and their reliques to be held in veneration. I firmely aſſert, the images of Chriſt, and of the bleſſed Virgin, as alſo of other Saints, are to be had and retained, and due honour and reverence to be given to them. I likewiſe affirm the power of indulgences is left by Chriſt in his Church, and their uſe very healthfull to Chriſtian people. I acknowledge the holy Catholick, and Apoſtolical Roman Church to be the Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches; And I promiſe and ſwear true obedience to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſucceſſor of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the chief of the Apoſtles, and Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt.

            </p>
            <p>The day after her Majeſty being willing to dine in publick, a table was prepared with a ſingle covering, under the cloth of ſtate, but becauſe ſhe would honour the Cardinal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and Biſhop, by taking them to dinner with her, two other coverings were brought, one at the right hand, and the other at the left of the table, a little way diſtant from the upper end, where the Queen was to ſit,

each of them being under a little of the Canopy. All the three coverings were in gilt baskets, the Cardinal Legate ſitting on the right hand, the Biſhop on the left, and the Legate ſaying grace.</p>

their rotchets, and forbare very ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to touch any meat, till they ſaw what her Majeſty liked, and had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten firſt of it.</p>
            <p>The firſt diſcourſe began here by the Queen was of the Painters at <hi>Rome,</hi>

At the firſt draught the Queen drank, three great pieces of artillery were diſcharged.

awhile of the Engliſh affaires. Then feeling it grew hot, ſhe cauſed the glaſſe of the windows to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from the top to the botome, and the people which ſtood about the table, retired then a little. When her Majeſty had drank the ſecond time, ſhe ſaid ſhe had never drank ſo much wine as in <hi>Italy,</hi> where it was very excellent. The Cardinal Biſhop replyed, your Majeſty hath drank little of it, for you put much water to it, and we ſee you carry with you the vertue of the North, which the Queen was pleaſed with. In fine, new diſhes of meat ſtill appearing, her Majeſty praiſed <hi>Italy,</hi> as having every thing within it ſelfe except druggs, the Cardinal Legate replyed, what, ſugars? Her Majeſty anſwered, you have them in <hi>Sicily.</hi> And with theſe, and ſuch like diſcourſes, which uſe to be the paſtimes of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in their recreations at table and feaſts, the meat was taken off, and the Queen in the midſt of the two Cardinals aforeſaid, retyred to her chamber, where their Eminences

ſtayed with her, entertaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſeveral diſcourſes. Her Majeſty in her ſpeeches ſhewed a great eſteem, of <hi>France,</hi> and to be well informed of all the affaires of the world, and eſpecially of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave.</p>
            <p>That night they ſaw a Comedy at the charge of the Marquis <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Bentivoglio,</hi> a Cavalier of one of the chiefeſt families in <hi>Italy,</hi> and who may deſervingly be called a true lover of the vertuous. This play, where the honours of <hi>Boreas</hi> with <hi>Orithia</hi> were repreſented, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded very well, eſpecially for the admirable beauty and fineneſſe of the machins.

            <p>The ſame evening the Gentlemen and Ladies had a ball in the Queens Chamber, where the foreſaid Counts <hi>Francis Maria,</hi> and <hi>Lodowick Santi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelli</hi> Brothers, danced a galliard with the Lady <hi>Mary Camilla Diſploratatii,</hi> but becauſe they danced with their Cloakes, and their ſwords, the Queen deſir'd them, for her greater ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to lay them aſide, to the end ſhe might the better obſerve them, which accordingly they did, &amp; danced a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard, which ſo pleaſed her Majeſty, that ſhe ſeemed deſirous to ſee them Dance the Canaries, ſo as they with the Lady <hi>Emilia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbani,</hi> performed

it ſmoothly, and with admirable grace.</p>
            <p>Before they began the ſaid ball, the Cardinall Legate preſented to the Queen (to whom it was dedicated) a Printed booke of ſeverall verſes compoſed by Count <hi>Francis Maria Santinelli,</hi> the greateſt part of which were in praiſe of her Majeſty, who was much taken with it, and kindly accepted it, commending it as the birth of a great ſpirit, and eminent wit, as it generally was held:</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty ſup't afterwards pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in her Chamber, where ſhe heard moſt rare conſorts of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, among which was a violin, and arch-lute, which delighted her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, whereupon ſhe received one of them into her ſervice, called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Maria Ciacchi</hi> of <hi>Sienna.</hi>

            <p>The next Morning ſhe went to the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> &amp; heard Maſs in that Church, where ſhe heard the rare Muſique of thoſe Nunns, two of which are reputed very exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. The went afterwards into the Monaſtery, to the great conſolation,

            <p>After dinner her Majeſty took pleaſure in beholding a Spaniſh <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aeona,</hi> which was danc'd with a grace, agility, and incomparable dexterity, by Count <hi>Lodowick Santinelli,</hi> and ſhe was likewiſe pleas'd to like certain Playes, call'd the forces of <hi>Hercules,</hi> perform'd by ſome perſons moſt nimbly and handſomely.

            <p>Theſe actions were ended about ſeven hours in the night, at what time her Majeſty ſupp'd privately, and went to her reſt. On the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing morning the fifth of the month, the Queen, with her accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed civility, honoured the Nuns of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> with her preſence, hearing Maſs in their

She held Time bound with a chain of gold, who covered with his robe many meddalls of Heros, and being ſo bound, ſeem'd ſubject to the fame of her Majeſty. At the corners of the pedeſtall four flowers ſprowted up in the forme of a Pinetree, which budded our of feillage worke of gold, whoſe artificiall poſture ſhew'd art had emulated nature. In the midſt of the front of the pillar was a meddal of the colour of a roſe limn'd with gold, with ornaments about it of ſeverall flowers diſtributed with proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſimmetry.</p>
            <p>Then a clow'd was diſcover'd in another, all reſplendent with gold, on which was extended the Chariot of the Sunne, which drawn by four hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, was guided by <hi>Apollo,</hi> who carried in his right hand a bundle of gilt eares of corn, or'e which a little Angell ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported a Crown of gold, and with the left hand held the reyns of the horſes finely barded with ribbands of gold and ſilver, a little boy going before

            <p>There was beſides another round Pillar, on which a ſilver cliffe ſquezed his locks wreathed with lawrell, the extremity of the Figure ending in a rock, on which grew a palm tree dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it's boughs over it, and was with the left hand embraced by the ſame, the right hand pointing to the herbes it produces for the ſervice of Kings. About the Pillar were carved four lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones, where were as many little boyes with Coronets of <hi>Cedar,</hi> within which they diſcovered the leaves of the flowers ſuſtained by the round Pillar, four Harpies of braſs with gilt Spaniſh olives, and a Chaplet of gold in their hands, preſenting each a diſh of Pomegranates, which afterwards was intermixed with Pine-apple ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells in a little guilded Chaplet joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd to the feillage work of other fruites the earth does produce, with carvings adorned with gold.</p>

            <p>This repreſented Immortality, which on a ſquare Pillar adorned with antique faces of gold, held up with her hands o're her head a gilt circle, within which was a meddall with the Picture of her Majeſty, as one that had no confines, but what were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned her by eternity. Three boyes ſtood diſtributed on the brims of the diſh, one of which repreſenting pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a table of gold, made her Picture with the penſill, the other ſignifying ſculpture carv'd her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the third denoting hiſtory with the pen, made characters on a book, all three ſhewing joyntly, they were buſie in perpetuating the name of her Majeſty. Among them were three little vaſes, adorn'd with antique faces cover'd over with gold, which held gilt eares of corn, and in the ſpace
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170463:176"/>
between the boyes, and the vaſes, flowers of Sugar budded forth of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable workmanſhip, all reſting on candid Sugar, which ended in a very fine Chaplet.</p>

            <p>The Cardinall having comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her Majeſty returned into his Coach, and went before, to be ready to receive her in his Biſhoprick,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170463:179"/>

Among all the foreſaid Arches, the remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt was that, which was repaired o're an ancient gate of the City, where beſides the Inſcription ſet there, in honour of the Queen, there was another alluding to the place where <hi>Haniball</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> after the battail won at <hi>Thraſymenus,</hi> deſiring to advance towards <hi>Rome,</hi> was put to flight, whereupon the ſame gate retains to this day the name of the gate of the flight.</p>
            <p>The Queen paſſed through the <hi>Piazza</hi> reduced into the form of a

            <p>When the Legates had advice the Queen was arrived at <hi>Bracciano,</hi> and would be at <hi>Olgiata</hi> on the 19th. of <hi>December,</hi> they haſtened their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Rome,</hi> to execute their

He kep't open houſe, and profuſely diſtributed bread, wine, fleſh, and ſweet meats, to all that were there, though they were not of the train.</p>
            <p>After that, the Civalcata of the Legates advanced, which for the great quality, and condition of the Perſons there preſent, and the rich cloathes, and liveries, with which they appear'd, was extreamly remarkable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. It reached from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the <hi>Medici</hi> aforeſaid, 200. paces without the gate of the people, where they leaving, their horſes took Coach.</p>
            <p>Three trumpets, and a tabour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, with the led horſes of Captain <hi>Corradino,</hi> at the head of a hundred Cuiraſſiers well mounted and armed, with his ſword in his hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:170463:190"/>Five trumpets followed after, and a tabour of the Cardinall <hi>Landgrave,</hi> with Caſſocks of Scarlet fringed with thick broad liſts of azure velvet bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd on both ſides with rich trimming of ſilver, which in that mixture of the red and ſkie colour made the ſhew very handſome, eſpecially by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the thick plumes on their heads, which enriched their haire, and their ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>After theſe came the trumpets of the Cardinall <hi>de Medici,</hi> who had likewiſe Caſſocks of fine cloth of Cinnamon colour, all trimmed with thick twiſts of gold, which about twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light caſt a mervellous luſtre.</p>
            <p>The eyes of the ſpectators were greatly allured, with the appearance of a numerous, and noble Company of Pages on high metalled courſers, trapped with rich furniture of gold and ſilver, and ſutable valizes. The pages, beſides their cloths trimmed all over with gold, had either their doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of cloth of gold, or embroyder'd with rich branched work.</p>
            <p>Four trumpets of his Holineſs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170463:191"/>
after, with red Caſocks liſted with gold, and about ſeventy Knights of the train of the Cardinall Legates, who with their ſumptuous cloaths, and noble aſpects, gave luſtre to all the retinue. Among theſe were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly mingled, without any order of precedence, the Dukes <hi>Salviati, Lanti,</hi> and <hi>Mattei,</hi> the Marquiſſes <hi>Nari, Corſini, Tarquinius Santa Croce,</hi> and <hi>Patricii.</hi> The Lords <hi>Paul Francis Falconteri,</hi> Baron <hi>Mattei,</hi> the Counts <hi>Prainer, Slavata, Sciaffcutz,</hi> and <hi>Tilli,</hi> and Cavalier <hi>Paſſionei,</hi> theſe particular camerads of the Cardinall Legates, with many ſervants richly apparrelled.</p>
            <p>Near theſe, on two generous ſteeds came the Legates, with their uſuall Cardinalls habits, of Purple waved tabby, and red hats on their heads, who gracefull, and moſt affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with a ſeriousneſs and ſweetneſs in their faces, made their Majeſtique gravity reſplendent, which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced every one to a reverence, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiousneſs.</p>

After the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates came the troop of light horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his Holineſs, armed with cuiraſſes, but without lances, with Caſſocks of red cloth fringed with gold.</p>
            <p>The Legates coming out of the gate of the people, took Coach, as the Cavaliers likewiſe did that were with them, the Pages, and footmen, and purſued their journey.</p>
            <p>Each of the Cardinalls had five ſumptuous Coaches with ſix horſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice, the Coachmen and grooms which were many, having liveries like the Pages, and trumpetters. Before the Legates Coach, went a Coach with the maſters of the Chambers, and another came after them full of noble Prelates, being followed by thirty others with ſix horſes a peice, all rich and ſplendid, belonging to
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170463:192"/>
the Princes, Cavaliers, Prelates, and Gentlemen with forty others with 4 horſes a peice.</p>
            <p>At the Inne called <hi>la Storta</hi> eight mile off, they found <hi>Don Antonio della Cueva,</hi> her Majeſties great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the horſe, accompanied by many Gentlemen, with the Coaches of the Queen. He complemented the Legates, who went into her Majeſties Coach made after the Dutch faſhion, covered with crimſon velvet fringed with gold, in which they arrived at <hi>Olgiata,</hi> a mile beyond the ſaid Inne. The Queen at the entrance into the gate, came down to the foot of the ſtaires, with wonderfull courteſy and kindneſs, receiving the Legates, and with ſo much honour, than it may well be ſaid, this was a true argument of her piety, and veneration towards the Vicar of Chriſt, the holy Sea, and the Sacred Apoſtolicall Colledg. In the midſt of the ſaid Legates ſhe aſcended to her lodgings, where they complemented her in the name of his Holineſs, in order to their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Her Majeſty accepted the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170463:192"/>
with all the terms of reverence and eſteem towards his Holineſs, by declaring herſelf moſt highly obliged to the Pope, for the many great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours he had done her.</p>
            <p>It was ſomewhat late, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without further ſtay, the Queen, and the Legates deſcended, and went all three into his Holineſſes Coach, ſent thither for that purpoſe, her Majeſty ſitting alone, and the Legates together.</p>
            <p>The Queen was clad plainly in grey, with a hongerlin, and black ſcarfe on her ſhoulders, inſtead of a band, without any ornament of Gold, Silver, Jewells, Ribbonds, or Flowers which ſhe alwaies had abhor'd, as a vain and idle thing, one little Ring on her Finger, being all the adorning ſhe had. But with her ſprightly carriage, and maſculine and majeſtick aſpect, ſhe diſcovered the greatneſs of her birth, and the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her rare and vertuous Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives. She hath a very quick and nimble body, and is in her geſtures and motion moſt comely and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

of a proportionable ſtature, a freſh colour, and royall features. And ſince her cheekes are careleſs of the deckings of roſes and lilies, her moſt comely face darts lightning from her eyes, as which, never na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made any ſo lively and reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. She hath a high forehead, and ſpatious, with a fine and pleaſing mouth, her haire ſeeming curled and browne. Her Majeſty is ſupported with modeſty, and her ſprightlineſs and ſmiling with gravity, ſhe having above all things a grace ſo attractive, which together with the heart, forces praiſes, and applauſes. She eats not much, drinkes little, and almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually water. She ſleeps but five hours, and ſtudies for the moſt part, the books of <hi>Plato,</hi> ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, good Latine Poets, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures being the Soul of her Majeſties entertainments.</p>
            <p>She hates mortally idleneſs, and is adorned with ſo many vertues, that every Queen may eaſily envie her, but very hardly imitate her. She is of a great and generous minde, but
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170463:193"/>
her ſolid goodneſs hath nothing elſe to equall it, but the glory of her great thoughts, and incomparable reſolutions.</p>
            <p>She arrived in <hi>Rome</hi> after two hours in the night, accompanyed by the light of an infinite number of Torches. She came in at the gate <hi>Pertuſa,</hi> where ſhe was met by the Captain of the Dutch-men, with many of the Switzers of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Guard, who attended on her afterwards. She alighted at the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican</hi> on the ſide of the Garden of <hi>Belvedere,</hi> where by my Lord <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> the Popes Steward, and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſes domeſtick Prelates, ſhe was met and received at the foot of the ſtairs in the plain of the Garden, whence her Majeſty was conducted to her appartament, which was moſt richly furniſht with all things.</p>
            <p>The people flockt thither in ſuch throngs, that they filled the very rooms that were above, and the Queen beholding ſuch a multitude, ſaid pleaſantly jeſting, Uſe they thus, to enter privately into <hi>Rome,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:170463:194"/>She no ſooner had reſted a little, but ſhe ſent <hi>Don Antonio della Cueva</hi> to deſire audience of his Holineſs, who ſpeedily diſpatched to her my Lord <hi>Bonvili</hi> the Maſter of his Chamber, a Prelate of great quality, attended by all of the Privy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſeverall other Gentlemen. At the head of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Gallery he met the Queen, who was coming in haſt between the two Cardinall Legates, where he complemented her Majeſty in the name of the Pope, who returning the civility with all due reſpect, went on towards his Holineſſes lodgings, many of the Popes train going before.</p>
            <p>As ſhe paſſed along through ſo many Lodgings, Chambers and Galleries, all illuminated with Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſhe admiring the vaſtneſs of that great habitation, ſaid, that ſhort delay was more troubleſome to her, than all the journey ſhe had gone, ſince her Majeſty deſired nothing more, than the time to ſee his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
            <p>When ſhe came to the Popes
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170463:194"/>
anti-Chamber, the door was ſet wide open, and ſtood in that manner, all the while ſhe remained with his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. At the entrance into the Chamber, where his Holineſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her (my Lord <hi>Fibei</hi> the chief Maſter of the Ceremonies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing her ſo to do) She kneeled the firſt time, then the ſecond, and the third time with her hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſe on her breaſt, and her eyes on the ground, kiſſed firſt the foot, and afterwards the hand of his Holineſs, who intimating with a ſmile an act of the kindeſt reception, becken'd quickly to her with his hand ſhe ſhould riſe, which no ſooner ſhe had done, but ſhe ſate down on a royall Chaire, the Cuſhion and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being of Crimſon Velvet, and ſumptuouſly adorned with Gold.</p>
            <p>They diſcourſed but little, for his Holineſs ſuppoſing ſhe was weary with her journey, cut off the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and her Majeſty returned to her appartament.</p>
            <p>His Holineſs afterwards to ſhew her the greater reſpect, aſſigned her

four Cavaliers, all his Chamberlains of honour, to the end they might continually be aſſiſtant in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties anti Chamber, which were Signior <hi>Dominick Jacovacci</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Rome</hi> of known prudence, and excellent behaviour, <hi>Horatius</hi> Marquis <hi>Spada</hi> the deſerving nephew of Cardinall <hi>Bernard Spada</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Altano, James Mignanelli</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman likewiſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>Bevilacqua</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> whoſe nobility is equall to the qualities of his minde.

            <p>The following morning the Queen aroſe betimes, as ſhe uſed to do, and went into the Garden, where
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170463:195"/>
ſhe walked with my Lord <hi>Acarigi</hi> his Holineſſes Cupbearer, ſtill ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing French to him. She deſired to ſee the Coach, the litter, and chaire the Pope had given her, which were ſoone brought to her, and with them came Cavalier <hi>Bernino</hi> the inventour of the deſigne of the figures adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Count <hi>Raymund Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecuccoli</hi> there preſent, deſired the Queen to take notice of the Figures which ſupported the Coach-box, adding that they were the deſigne of Cavalier <hi>Bernino.</hi> The Queen turn'd about to contemplate them, and the Cavalier very modeſtly told her Majeſty, if there was any thing that was amiſs, 'twas his doing. The Queen at theſe words turning about, very gracefully replyed, then you have done nothing there. Then cauſing the horſe to be brought, which his Holineſs had given her, ſhe rode him with a foot-cloth, and without, and turning and winding him here and there, made every one admire her dexterity and comelineſs, ſhe making all good,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170463:196"/>
which fame had delivered before, that there was none in <hi>Swedland</hi> could mannage a Steed better than her, nor ſit him better in his full Carrieer, of which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being curious, deſired to ſee her pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that action. And indeed ſhe is ſo franck, and dexterous in this, that if ſhe had another <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> ſhe would tame him as well as an <hi>Alexander.</hi> Her Majeſty went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with my Lord <hi>Holſtenius</hi> to ſee the Vatican Library, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his owne, which was fine and rare, and gave her great content.</p>
            <p>The day after about 23. hours ſhe went again in a chaire to the Pope, with whom ſhe remained (the dores ſtanding open) above an hour. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the morning, the ſolemn <hi>Cavalcata</hi> ſhould have been, but it was deferred till the following day, all the things not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in order. In the mean time his Holineſs went in a chaire, to ſee her in her appartament, who no ſooner heard of it, but ran a great pace through ſome Chambers to meet
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170463:196"/>
him, at whoſe feet ſhe ſoone fell downe with great humility, but he cauſing her to riſe, and they going into the Chamber, they walked up and downe diſcourſing together, the <hi>Portalls</hi> being up. When his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs departed, her Majeſty accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him to his chaire, into which he being entered, the Queen with her owne hands endeavoured to ſhut it, as ſhe did other acts of humility, and obſequiouſneſs, though his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs had often diſmiſſed her with his bleſſing, ſhe freely confeſſing, ſhe never had felt herſelf awaken'd to more reverence, than in ſeeing the Majeſty of the Pope. The two dayes they ſpent in muſick, ſinging, and other royall entertainments, in which no coſt was ſpared by the magnanimous Pope.</p>
            <p>The ſaid ſolemn <hi>Cavalcata</hi> was ordered on <hi>Thurſday</hi> after dinner, of which the Maſters of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies had the direction. The ſhops were ſhut that day, and the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men commanded not to worke, which every one obeyed very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170463:197"/>
veneration and curioſity cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all to ſo noble a ſpectacle. And as a Princes actions ſhould ſtill be great, and elevated, ſo the Pope o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing, that might make this Function remarkable.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>David Vidman,</hi> a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Venice,</hi> brother to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of this name, and Sergeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Generall of the battaile, had the charge to give the orders, which he thought in his prudence moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to honour this reception, with diſpoſing of his Holineſſes Souldiers.</p>
            <p>On the day aforeſaid at 17. hours her Majeſty took Coach in the Court of <hi>Belvedere,</hi> and went out of the Gate <hi>Angelica</hi> toward the bridg <hi>Molle,</hi> The Courtiers of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Legates, and of the Queen went before, with the Trumpetters of the Cardinalls, and the 26. horſes of her Majeſties guard, being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the led-horſes, the Pages, Camerades, and Prelates of the train, of the Legates, the led-horſes of the Queen, her Pages, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petters,

            <p>An hour before departed from his Palace my Lord <hi>Bonelli</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Vice-Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> Nephews Son, the troope of light horſemen preceding, and his Page with the Batton and his Hat. He himſelf came afterwards a horſeback on a very fine Nag, attended by eighty Halbardiers of his guard with red Caſſocks, and great ſtore of grooms, and followed by the Officers of his Tribunall.

            <p>All the Trumpetters and light horſemen marched before, then the Trumpetters of the people, and the Noblemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> part accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the Senate by order of the Pope, which were thoſe, who in the year 1655. had ſome Office in the Capitol, and part voluntarily coming thither for the greater decorum of their Countrey. They went all without order of Precedence, and confuſedly, as the Marſhall of the Campe, and the forty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men elected before by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to attend the new Pope in the <hi>Cavalcata</hi> of his Poſſeſſion, and the preſidents of Juſtice, and Over-ſeers

            <p>Before her Majeſty arrived at the bridge <hi>Molle,</hi> ſhe was met in the meadows without the Gate <hi>Angelica</hi> by a company of Carabines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain <hi>Graſſi.</hi> The foreſaid Count <hi>Vidman</hi> came o're againſt the bridge, who had cauſed <hi>Rochetta</hi> to be armed, and the bridg on both ſides with choice foot, and in the plain beyond the River in a very fine proſpect, had reduced into ſquadrons a great body of a thouſand foot, at the head of which was the Sergeant Major <hi>Molinari,</hi> with ſix pieces of Artillery, and other Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which counting the guard of the bridge, were two thouſand, who when the Queen was paſt, gave her

very handſome volleys of ſhot, which were ſeconded by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the Canon.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſties Coach ſtopt, and the Governour, the Senatour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers, and Prior, complemented her in the name of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> repreſenting the joy of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for her Majeſties arrival.

            <p>Being come to the Vineyard of Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> which is a Palace with a Vineyard, Garden, Courts, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Walkes, and Allies, ſcituate between the Gate of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the foreſaid Bridge <hi>Molle,</hi> the Governour, the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, Conſervers, and Marſhalls of the Campe, with the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> there complemented her Majeſty again, who received

            <p>'Twas paſt 18. hours when her Majeſty arrived at this Vineyard, where alighting out of the Popes ſumptuous Coach, which was all of rich Velvet and Gold, ſhe went into the higher rooms of the Palace, where a Table was nobly furniſhed with variety of meats, wines, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſtore of ſweet-meats, her Majeſty ſtaying there above an hour and a half, till the rain might be over, which hindered the Function very much. But as they were conſulting to deferre it till a more propitious ſeaſon, the Heaven, as if aſhamed not to give place to ſo ſplendid a Triumph, diſperſed the clowds in a moment, chaſed away the darkneſs, and brought back the Sun, that he might be likewiſe aſſiſtant to the train of ſo rare, and ſo renowned a ſhow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:170463:201"/>With the Queen came four of her Coaches of the German faſhion, driven by Coach-men in a livery of fine Scarlet, trimmed with great Gardes of black Velvet border'd with Gold-lace, with many ſervants and attendance in the ſame. On the Gate of the Palace were three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions with the arms of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which are a ſheafe of Wheat traverſed by two white Bars in an azure Field, ſince the three Crowns, and the reſt of the empreſs, which are the proper arms of the Kingdom of <hi>Swedland,</hi> were voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by her with the ſaid King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhe only retaining the ancient and glorious Enſigne of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Progenitors.</p>
            <p>In the Court before the Palace, on the left hand towards the City, were ſquadron'd 300.

            <p>Many perſons of quality came to

waite on her Majeſty, who ſweetning the gravity of her Majeſtick aſpect, with her courteous entertainment, received them with all terms of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility.</p>
            <p>All ſaid, they were obliged to the courteſie of this ſo great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who ſcattering like the Sun, the light of her favours, makes all that behold her, pay tribute to her affability.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the preſent, given her by his Holineſs, was brought, to wit, a Coach, a Litter, a Chair, and an ambling Nagge; the Coach was all of ſilver, with ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, little figures, cut-works, and myſterious deviſes of the invention of Cavalier <hi>Bernino.</hi> The lining, and covering were of azure Velvet, and the fringes of the broad Gardes inter-woven with ſutable twiſts, and buttons and loops of Silver, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pailed with large, and rich maſſy ſtuds.</p>
            <p>'Twas drawn by ſix dapple Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, with Furniture of Velvet of the ſame colour twiſted with Silver, with

The Litter and Chaire were ſutable to the Coach, the Mules covered with the ſame, and had the ſame furniture, and the dapple ambling nagge with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans riding foot-cloth of the ſame Velvet, all beſpread with little fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures finely wrought.</p>
            <p>This Preſent was given the Queen in the name of the Pope, by my Lord <hi>Farneſe</hi> his Holineſſes ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.

            <p>Before all went the troope of Cuiraſſiers of the foreſaid Captain <hi>Corradino,</hi> in the very ſame manner, as he met the Queen before at <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giata.</hi> The light horſe-men of the Guard of the Queen followed after, with Caſſocks of Scarlet, each having

            <p>The reſt of the time was ſpent by her Majeſty in receiving of viſits, and other noble entertainments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming her vertuous prerogatives, and eſpecially her great talents in literature. This learned Princeſs had therefore a particular deſire to go ſee the <hi>Sapienza,</hi>

               </note> which is a noble Palace, or <hi>Lyceum</hi> deſign'd for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſtudies. She was met at the Gate, and attended by Cardinall <hi>Rapaccioli</hi> the Vice-Chamberlain in the place of Cardinall <hi>Anthony Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino,</hi> who as Chamberlain is the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:170463:223"/>
head of that Univerſity, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by my Lord <hi>Richi Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor di Rota,</hi> as Lieutenant of the Cardinall Chamberlain, and all the Advocates of the Conſiſtory. The great Hall, and the leſs, the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were very richly furniſh't; o're the door of the firſt ſtood her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties picture at length, and in the ſaid Hall was erected a cloth of ſtate, in the midſt of which ſate the Queen, and the Cardinall on her left hand. The Advocates ſtood on one ſide, and at the bottom of the royall ſeat all the Profeſſors in a ring, and the Bedells with maces of Silver in their hands. On the right hand was prepared a chair for the Profeſſors, whom her Majeſty would hear ſpeak. Firſt ſhe deſired to hear a Divine, which place was performed by Doctor <hi>Peter Maria Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarino</hi> of <hi>Modena,</hi> Procurator Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Order of St <hi>Dominique,</hi> who made his rare parts, and deep learning appear, after whom a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian was deſired by her Majeſty, ſo as Signior <hi>Giouanni Benedetto Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldi,</hi>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:170463:223"/>
moſt learnedly, and to his great praiſe, diſcharged his part. Then Signior <hi>Henrico Chifellio</hi> a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt was call'd, who though a long time blind, ſhew'd he hâd ſeen much in the knowledge of Humanity. Her Majeſty ſeem'd afterwards deſirous to hear a Philoſopher, and Dr. <hi>John Baptiſt di Lezana</hi> a Carmelite, was not wanting to give laudable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his knowledge, whom Signior <hi>Giacomo Cincio</hi> a Canoniſt ſucceeded, who rarely performed his part, and gave the Queen great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. The Mathematician <hi>Don Antonio Santini</hi> did the like, who in his demonſtration on paper, came down from the chair to ſatisfie her Majeſties curioſity, who deſired to ſee it nearer her.</p>
            <p>The Queen was askt afterwards, if ſhe pleaſed to hear the Profeſſors of tongues, and ſhe ſeeming content, ſeverall of them went into the chaire one after the other, fully ſatisfying the genius of her Majeſty.

            </p>
            <p>This royall entertainment being ended, the Advocates of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory preſented her Majeſty in a hundred and twelve volumes, the works in print of the Profeſſors of that ſtudy, as well of thoſe now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as the others lately dead, which volumes were all bound richly in Gold, with the Arms of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſhe had too a Catalogue in print of the works aforeſaid, with an elogie compoſed by Count <hi>Charles Emanuel Vizzani,</hi> one of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of the Conſiſtory, and a perſon of great fame.

               <hi>Forregiani,</hi> and four others of the moſt eminent Fathers of the Order of St. <hi>Dominique.</hi> She went preſently into the Quire, where ſhe was welcomed with a conſort of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall muſical inſtruments, and heard with much pleaſure a Moletto ſung moſt exquiſitely. From thence ſhe was conducted under a Canopie to the Hall, where two tables were furniſht with a noble collation. Here ſtaying a little, ſhe afterwards went up into the Tower, from which ſhe diſcovering not only all <hi>Rome,</hi> but much of the Countrey there abouts, was ſo pleaſed with the proſpect, that ſhe ſtaid there two hours with great ſatisfaction, coming afterwards down into the Church, and hearing there Maſs, ſhe return'd from thence to her Palace, whither the Nuns ſent her Majeſty many pretty devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with a little Cofer of Carnation ſattin embroydered with Gold, in which was a relique of St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> and another of <hi>San Romano,</hi> with a relique of St. <hi>Nicholas da Bari</hi> in chriſtall, and ſix viols of Manna of

            <p>She was pleaſed too to viſit the Convent of the Nuns of St. <hi>Sixtus,</hi> of the moſt noble order of St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> ſeated in <hi>Quirinale</hi> on the Mountain <hi>Magnanapoli,</hi> for noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and beauty equall to the other there contiguous, of St. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Sienna</hi> of the ſame order.

            <p>On the 16. of <hi>January</hi> her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty

going into the Coach,<note place="margin">And the Church of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> which his Holineſs gave her, accompanyed by the Princes, Prelates, and other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, went to the Greeks Church, which was adorned with very rich Hangings, eſpecially the Cloyſter called <hi>Sancta Sanctorum,</hi> as alſo the door of the Sacriſty, where a throne was erected for her Majeſtie, to the end ſhe might ſee the better the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies they did within the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum.</hi> She was received in the Church by Father <hi>John Rho,</hi> Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and Father <hi>Octavius Maſſa</hi> Rector of the Greeke Colledge. At her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties arrivall they began the Greek Maſs, which was ſung by my Lord <hi>Laurence Conſtantino</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> with three Prieſts, a Deacon and Subdeacon, they uſing the ſame ceremonies the Greek Church is accuſtomed to do, when the Biſhop does ſolemnly celebrate, the ſaid Prelate veſting himſelf in a pontifical habit, in the midſt of the Quire on a little throne.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſtie was much pleaſed

fam'd for learning, and experienced in the Academies of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with her Majeſties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to have them hold their Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in her Palace. And as every one juſtly ſought, to ſhew her a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull reſpect, not only with the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of reverence, but with their parts, and talents, ſo they were moſt ready to comply with her deſires, which no ſooner were made known unto them, but many fruitfull wits, with which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill abounds, were employed in her praiſes.</p>
            <p>The Fathers of the Society, who juſtly may be called the Oracles of the Sciences, not permitting their ſublime wits to ſleep, nor their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Pens to be idle, as they knew, that the Queen, ſo great a lover of learning,<note place="margin">She ſees the Roman Colledge.</note> would ſee their Roman Colledge, the moſt happy ſchools of the Sciences, and piety, ſo they put thoſe compoſitions together, which they thought not ſo much to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ornament of the place, as meet for the reception of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:170463:227"/>
who exceeded the capacity of men in the knowledg of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found literature. And indeed in the rich mine of their ſublime wits, they found ſo much matter, that all that beheld it, were aſtoniſht and amazed at the numerous, and proper appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of ſo many images, Mottos, Hieroglyphicks, and Emblems, all alluding to the Perſon alone of this renowned Princeſs.</p>
            <p>On the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>January</hi> after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner her Majeſty came to the ſaid Colledg with her uſuall attendance, accompanied by ſo many Perſons, that ſhe could hardly get in her ſelf, though the gate was well lookt to by the Guards of the Switzers, ſet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly there to hinder the diſorders, which uſually occurre in the like crowds and throngs.</p>
            <p>At the entrance into the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg was a great quadrangle, with walkes round about ſupported by Pillars, under which in three parts the Schooles are extended. All the Pillars were adorned with the pictures of women remarkable in
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:170463:228"/>
learning, with their medalls of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſſed work coloured like braſs, and under two thick paſtboords of the like emboſſed work. In the firſt they read the elogy of each one, which was ſtill applied to the qualities of the Queen, and in the ſecond they ſaw a Motto on the ſame ſubject. In the ſemicircles of the Arches, the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Colledges, in which thoſe Fathers teach, were painted with their Inſcriptions. Between the Pillars, and each door of the Schooles were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the particular donatives of each City offered to the Queen, and diſplaied underneath with an Epigram written within a wreath ſupported by an Angell.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Roman Colledg which was adorned to receive her.</note>The ſecond place was the room of the gate, through which they goe into the Colledg. In this they repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſtatues of the Queenes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their raignes, expreſſed in darkiſh colours, and ſtanding on their baſes, under which in ſeverall paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boords hung their Elogies, all appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Majeſty. Between one ſtatue and another on a great gilt paſtboord
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:170463:228"/>
were the Emblems relating to the vertues required in Princes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Epigrams of the Emblem. All theſe roomes ſeemed adorned with red damaske with twiſted gold, being ſo naturally painted, that they cozened the eyes, in caſe they were not toucht. The leaf-workes had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably on them the Armes of her Majeſty, and the Mottos alluded to the vertues aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>In the third place were extended the little walkes, which are behind this roome, in the which as contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the garden, was painted moſt excellently a beautifull garden, with a proſpect of various Pillars, in which were written elogies and odes on the Empreſſes and Queens renowned for their vertues and piety, on the doores four Emblems with their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams being delineated. The fourth and laſt place was the ſpace between the ſacriſty and the Church, and there they ſaw painted the Empreſſes and Queens come to <hi>Rome,</hi> to honour there the Vicars of Chriſt. The pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting repreſented a plain, in which
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:170463:229"/>
were erected great Pyramides, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of which was imprinted an Elogie in praiſe of that picture, which ſtill had relation to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, between the one Pyramide and the other, was a fained bound of braſs, which held up an ode on the ſame ſubject, and on the other between theſe, hung a paper with an Epigramme.</p>

As her Majeſty went in at the great gate, ſhe ſaw on the firſt arch within, an inſcription con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the argument of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and in the ſpace between the great gate, and the walkes of the Court on the right hand was painted the heavenly wiſdom deſired by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, and preferred before riches, and Kingdoms, on the left hand <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> the wiſdom of the ancient Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who with her ſpeare made an Olive-tree grow up in oppoſition to Neptune, who cauſed a horſe to

            <p>Being come without the Court, ſhe went up and down all the Schooles, in every one of which, ſhe was welcom'd by one of the moſt eminent Scholars, with a ſhort Epigramme. Being afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the ſaid roome, o're the gate, ſhe was by Father <hi>Rho</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, informed of the contents of that noble preparation, and heard him read the names of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Princeſſes.

She went thence into the gallery, that was near, where Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Athanaſius Nircherius</hi> the great Mathematician had prepared many curious and remarkable things, as well in nature, as art, which were in ſo great a number, that her Majeſty ſaid, more time was required, and leſs company to conſider them with due attention.</p>
            <p>However ſhe ſtayed ſome time to conſider the herb called <hi>Phoenix,</hi> which reſembling the <hi>Phoenix</hi> grew up in the waters perpetually out of its own aſhes.

Then paſſing through the Hall, where ſhe looked on ſome Pictures well done, ſhe went

through the walkes and the garden, into the Apothecaries ſhop, where ſhe ſaw the preparation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of herbs, plants, metalls, gemms, and other rare things, for the making of treacle, and balſome of life.

In fine being preſented with treacle, and pretious oyles, ſhe went into the ſacriſty, where they opened all the preſſes, vvhere they keep the Plate, and reliques of the Church, vvith the great candleſticks, and vaſes given them by the deceaſed Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Lodowick Lodoviſio</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church.

particularly the blood of St. <hi>Eſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antia</hi> a Virgin and Martyr, which, after a thouſand and three hundred years, is as liquid as if newly ſhed. Then going into the Church ſhe heard Maſs, and at her departure, gave teſtimonies to the Fathers of her great ſatisfaction and content.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Venus</hi> being come to the earth with her Son, heard <hi>Cupids</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, who accuſed the Ladies of <hi>Tybur</hi> for being too rigid, and the authority of his Mother not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his anger, he ſhot ſome arrowes towards the Ladies, and together with <hi>Venus</hi> returned to the Chariot, both of them ſinging joyntly the praiſes of her Majeſty.</p>
            <p>As they vaniſhed they ſang a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſong, inviting ſome Ladies, who formerly were followers of <hi>Cupid,</hi> to give with a dance ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them he had ſubdued. The

machine vaniſhing away, from the ſides of the maritime ſcene iſſued forth eight Ladies of the Princeſs aforeſaid, moſt ſplendidly apparrel'd, with lighted Torches in their hands, and danced a rare dance, eſtabliſhing love with thoſe unſtable motions, and ſecuring the motions of the will with the meaſure of ſhort diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>After this the room was refurniſht as before, and her Majeſty was ſo highly contented, that ſhe publickly declared, ſhe had not ſeen any thing in <hi>Rome,</hi> to her greater ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The words were compoſed by the ſaid Prince <hi>Don Camillo,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her Majeſty with a ſong made by him on her renouncing of her Kingdoms, which was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by her, ſhe celebrating the Prince for a very vertuous perſon, and deſerving all praiſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
            <p>Still in all theſe actions, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Roſſano</hi> was accompanyed by many Princeſſes and Ladies, and ſeverall Princes and Cavaliers were

               </note> made it evidently appear, her mind is as illuſtrious and generous, as her family is great, ſhe being the Niece of many Popes, and allyed to many Potentates in <hi>Italy.</hi>

            <p>The Abbot <hi>Caeſar Malvicino,</hi> and Signior <hi>Carlo Centoſiorini,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the Secretary, and the latter the chief Gentleman of the horſe to the Prince aforeſaid, ſtill aſſiſted at theſe functions, as likewiſe Signior <hi>Mario Raviera</hi> his Excellences do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Gentleman, who applyed himſelf to it very earneſtly.</p>
            <p>In Carneval-time notwithſtanding theſe vertuous entertainments, her Majeſty ſhewed her piety in viſiting ſeverall Churches, and particularly that of <hi>Gieſu,</hi> where with a moſt ſplendid preparation, the forty hours were expoſed.</p>

               </note> on the top of which, according to the prophecie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> they ſaw the Church ſitting in a beautifull manner, who, while with her left hand ſhe ſupported the croſs, with the other pointed at the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime throne of glory, on which they diſcovered the Saviour of the VVorld. On the two contiguous mountains were erected two figures repreſenting Religion, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, while the theological ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues plac't on the three mountains below, did court and attend her.</p>
            <p>At the feet of the mountains they ſaw come from all parts throngs of people to do homage to that great Monarcheſs, and captivate their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings convinced in obedience to the Catholick Faith. Thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages afterwards appeared, who thought it a thing of glory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert to preferre the reproach of the croſs before worldly greatneſs. They repreſented too the Princes, Kings, and Emperours, who ſhewed they regarded not their titles, but to have
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:170463:243"/>
ſome worthy argument, to make known to the VVorld their eſteem of the true Religion, while for the love of it, they deſpiſed thoſe dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. There were likewiſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and Queens, whoſe piety was as generous; and as the famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had given life and eloquence with their penſills, to the Pictures, ſo they were all contented with their ſtate, but in a certain manner confeſſed, they were conquered with the modern miracle of a couragious and maſculine woman, who remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the midſt of the reſt, with a countenance breathing majeſtick, as well as devotion, the more ſhe endeavoured to obſcure the titles of a Queen, acquired them the more.</p>
            <p>The three Crowns and Scepters, the victimes offered up by her to the Catholick Faith, ſhe did not now behold, but every one admired them, and it ſeemed ſhe would plant them in that mountain, ſhe judging it worthy to have Scepters for trees, and Diadems for flowers, where
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:170463:244"/>
Monarchs, and Princes excited by her ſingular example, might, inſtead of birds, build their neſts.</p>
            <p>To this great Lady, the ſupream Commandreſs of the mountain bowed her face, as if ſhe had ſaid, many daughters have heaped up riches, and thou exceedeſt them all; You would have thought, in ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a ſight, the holy Church ſucking conſolations with her eyes, and milk as it were from ſo many breaſts, as there were triumphant ſoules, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to the eyes of the beholders, and with thoſe mountains quickened with ſome inviſible breath, was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much higher.</p>
            <p>Behind the Mountains and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, they diſcovered ſeverall fine diſtances, which was all in the low region.</p>
            <p>But the eye looking upwards, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Paradiſe, which being wide open, while it would be a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of what was done on earth, became a delitious, and fortunate ſpectacle to way-faring men. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it ſelf in many circles propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:170463:244"/>
ſtill greater, and abounding with beautifull figures of knots, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins, Cherubins, Angels, and Saints, even to the top of the Arch, and profundity of the royal Court, the receptacle of glory, which could not be bounded with limits, fine knots, appearing without the Arch. The moſt holy Sacrament the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent, and Horoſcope of the holy Church, was in the midſt of Heaven as it were, nor could they diſcern how, or where it repoſed, and yet it ſtood faſt. The bleſſed ſoules ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, as they ſhewed, they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its glories, ſo likewiſe preſaged, by vertue of its influences, greater happineſs to the Catholick VVorld, and it ſeemed they heard them ſay to thoſe mountains, enjoy peace O Mountains, at which tidings, they ſhall skip for joy like Ramms, for the hope, they ſaw they had.</p>
            <p>The Father eternall was Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all, whom we there repreſent, as when he had finiſh'd the VVorld, and ſaid all was good; ſo there he appeared ſupported in himſelf, and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:170463:245"/>
joyning together the high with the low, the Earth with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven made one ſingle Region, as it were.</p>
            <p>How then that noble machine was illuminated, we may gueſs by the ſtarres, that are ſtill reſplendent, though the Sun, the Fountain of light, be not ſeen in the ſcene of Heaven. The machine was every where bright, but they could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from whence the light came, nor tell if it was in the Pictures, or borrowed from ſome Sun, aſſembled by art; ſo with many very pleaſing deceits of near diſtances, and diſtant nearneſs, fixed flights, and endings without end, they ſweetly loſt their curioſity, and had their devotion free, ſo as they might employ themſelves wholy in thoſe holy exerciſes.</p>

            <p>The German Colledge deſired too the occaſion of paying their dutifull reſpects to the Queen in a muſical Play called the ſacrifice of <hi>Iſaack,</hi>

            <p>The great Court of the ſaid Palace, which is long and ſpatious, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Theater. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen

by demoliſhing ſome houſes of their own, that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous, cauſed two large, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious aſcents of degrees, to be erected on the left ſide capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3000. Perſons, in the midſt of which, a magnificent great gate was built o're againſt the Queens place, adorned with various figures, which being about the Queens armes, made a very fine proſpect. On the top of the ſaid great Gate in four great windowes with lettiſes before them, was the Quire for the Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who with various inſtruments, made moſt exquiſite muſick.</p>
            <p>In the ſide of the Palace, two rowes of ſcaffolds were erected, the one o're the other, covered with rich tapiſtries, and ſo with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable ſymmetrie, from both the ſides two other ranges anſwerable, were extended, ſo as by an ingenious induſtry, that Court was reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the forme of a beautifull Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>To give light to the field, beſides the thick Torches of white wax, and
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:170463:247"/>
artificiall materialls, which burnt on ſeverall rowes of the Pillars, on the aſcents of the degrees, and at the head of the liſts, there were ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen great ſtarres artificially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of iron wire, each of which being ſet up very high in the aire, with a new invention not ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the middle of the field held ſixteen great Torches, ſo as by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, the lights alone coſt above a thouſand Crowns.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the ſide aforeſaid, on the firſt floore of the apparta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a very capacious box was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for her Majeſty, adorned within and without with moſt rich cloth of Gold, with her ſtate of crimſon velvet, bordered and fringed with Gold. All thoſe royall appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments were very richly furniſhed, and altogether anſwerable to the greatneſs, and generoſity of the minds of the <hi>Barberini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near her Majeſty were four Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, to wit <hi>Retz, Imperiale, Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romeo,</hi> and <hi>Azzolino,</hi> and all the Gentlemen of her Court. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Cardinalls had their places ſomewhat higher than the Queens, and likewiſe all the windowes were nobly adorned, and abounded with other eminent Perſons. On the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſcaffolds were the Princeſſes and Ladies, moſt finely attired, and reſplendent, to augment with the ſplendour of their beauty and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the luſtre, and Jewels of ſo handſome a ſpectacle.</p>
            <p>The pompe and majeſty of this ſhew, made all <hi>Rome</hi> curious to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, together with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countreys, ſo as though the concourſe of the people to get in, was very great, yet all civill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were let in without confuſion, by the excellent order of Cardinall <hi>Barberin,</hi> with whoſe good direction all things were regulated.</p>
            <p>After 3. hours in the night, they began. The 24. Cavaliers, each one of which was moſt ſplendidly ſet out, were divided into two ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons.

            <p>Eight Trumpetters went before, and a hundred and twenty grooms, all cloath'd in a Livery embroyder'd with Silver on blew, and great blew and white feathers on their heads, each of them carrying a great lighted

Torch in their hands, which greatly augmented the luſtre and ſplendour, all marching very orderly.</p>
            <p>After the twelve Cavaliers came at laſt a moſt beautifull Chariot moſt rarely deſigned, which was of blew and ſilver adorn'd with figures, and admirable deviſes of emboſſed work. It was ſo high, it reached to the box of the Queen, and was drawn by three Muſitians habited like Goddeſſes, and repreſenting the three Graces, one concealed within it, moving it ſecretly, and with great agility. In it ſate joyfull <hi>Rome</hi> in a moſt majeſtick manner, who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to diſcover her joy for the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of a Princeſs ſo great, ſeemed to look like love, which being the Soul of the World, elected her heart for his unchangeable throne, as a City the head of the VVorld.

               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:170463:249"/>After this from the oppoſite ſide, came forth the other twelve Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, who fained themſelves to be Amazons, and they were <hi>Don Maf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feo Barberini</hi> Prince of <hi>Pelleſtrina,</hi> Signior <hi>Urbano Rocci,</hi> the Marquis <hi>Ferdinand Torres,</hi> Signior <hi>Gaſparo Alveri, Ferrante</hi> Count of <hi>Maſſa</hi> in the roome of the Marquis <hi>Patritii,</hi> who fell ſick, Signior <hi>Stefano Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natelli,</hi> the Marquis <hi>Fabritius Mari,</hi> the Marquis <hi>Cintius Silveſtri,</hi> Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Giouanni Battiſta Coſtaguti,</hi> Count <hi>Marc. Antonio Monte Marte della Corbara,</hi> Signior <hi>Paola Mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanelli,</hi> and Signior <hi>Angelo Leonini,</hi> all cloathed in red, and Gold, with high plumes of feathers, very rich cloaks, noble trappings, and ſprightly horſes, eight Trumpetters, and a hundred and twenty grooms going before them, all cloathed in red, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered with Gold, with great and thick feathers on their heads, and lighted Torches in their hands, who were all, like the firſt, Souldiers of fortune choſen out of good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that their marching, and rankes
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:170463:249"/>
might be regular, as they were, they being conducted by a very expert Officer who ſupplyed that place.</p>
            <p>Another Chariot like the firſt, followed after, diſagreeing in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the colours, this being of red and Gold, and varied with not inferiour ornaments, drawn likewiſe by three Muſitians in the likeneſs of three furies. In it with a dreadfull aſpect, and menacing poſture ſate another Muſitian repreſenting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</p>
            <p>This after a handſome, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion, his Champions preceding, ſtood oppoſite to the other of the God of love, who ſtopt before the Queen. There between the Graces, and the Furyes, was a pleaſant and curious dialogue in muſick, each of the parties calling in the end their own warriers to arms, for the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the buſineſs. The ſame contention had Love and Diſdain, each one concluding for the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail.</p>
            <p>The Amazons with much courage and generoſity, moved from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:170463:250"/>
ſide of the field, and ſtood in array at the head of the Theater to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Garden. The Cavaliers, as fierce and hardy, did the ſame, and went to the oppoſite ſide in their rankes.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe ſquadrons was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by their own Chariot, which moved in good order. The Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers putting off their high plumes of feathers, and long Cloakes for the ſhew, were more fit for the fight, and putting on their Helmets, that were eaſy and light, were armed on the bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt and the back, with brachals and gauntlets. The Chariots retired aſide, to give no impediment to the field, and the Grooms attending there, filled all the circumference of the Theater, making a very fine proſpect, which from the light of the Torches, and the glittering of their clothes, received much beauty.</p>
            <p>The Quire of the Muſitians on the arch aforeſaid, juſt againſt her Majeſty, as it did from time to time make moſt exquiſite muſick, ſo gave place to the ſound of the Trumpets,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:170463:250"/>
with which they were awaked to the battail, ſo as three of the Cavaliers with piſtolls in their hands rode a gallop towards the Amazons. The ſaid piſtolls were charged by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Vaini,</hi> who being a perſon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly borne, and very valorous, was honoured with that charge, much eſteemed and uſed in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the motion of the foreſaid Cavaliers, three of the Amazons rode againſt them, and meeting them in the midſt of the Careere of the Theater enterchangeably diſcharged their piſtolls, turning twice quickly about to meet the ſecond time, which ſucceeded very well, they afterwards retiring in good order. Four after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on a ſide iſſued forth, and did the ſame thing, then five, afterwards ſix, and laſtly all twelve, they ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in order, ſo as between the ſmoake, the fire, and the noiſe of their arms, they ſaw a ſeeming fray, and pleaſant contention.</p>
            <p>This no ſooner was ended, but a curtain being drawn, from the arch,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:170463:251"/>
or great Gate aforeſaid, came a great machine repreſenting a monſtrous Dragon, which vomited flames of fire, and like a great Chariot, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on his back another Muſitian, who ſeemed the famous <hi>Hercules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He with a ſhrill, and grave voice, ſuſpending the fight, offered, inſtead of it, two golden apples, taken vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently by him out of the orchard of the <hi>Heſperides,</hi> the renowned acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his glorious labours. At thoſe words three of the ſaid <hi>Heſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> very finely attired, iſſued forth, and bewailing with lamentable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents the prodigall conceſſion of that treaſure, obtained the favours they themſelves might diſtribute thoſe apples, which they gave to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, and to the Amazons.</p>
            <p>This act being ended, which was boldly performed, and with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent muſick, the Dragon walked by courſe o'e the field, and returned to his firſt ſtation in the great Gate. In the mean time two Cavaliers brake from their troope, brandiſhing their ſhields in their left hands, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying

the apples in their right, and riding a gallop towards the front of the Amazons, aſſailed them fiercely, and endeavoured to ſeize on their apples, turning ſwiftly on the right hand, but two Amazons purſued them cloſely, and charging them home, followed them to their own ſquadron. Then three Cavaliers iſſuing forth, put the Amazons to flight, and returned to their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of which ſometimes four in a Company coming forth, then five, and ſix, and at laſt, all together, made ſo handſome a mixture, ſo well led, and ſo dexterous, that the eyes of the Spectators could not ſee it enough.</p>
            <p>This skirmiſh being ended, which was no leſs ſtrange, than delightfull, they came all in rankes, with their ſwords in their hands before the Queen. Then from the left ſide came forth another great Charior, all guilded, and adorned with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ornaments, repreſenting that of the Sun, on which ſate glittering a Muſitian in the habit of <hi>Phoebus,</hi>

who was attended by the four ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year, with 24. Virgins waiting on him, which related to the hours. The ſaid Chariot was drawn by four horſes, of a right mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey colour very well matcht, and barded with Gold.</p>
            <p>This, ſtopping before the Queen, reconcil'd the hoſtile troops, and having ſung ſome verſes, to expreſs the love of <hi>Rome</hi> towards her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Majeſty, the Cavaliers and Amazons united themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether three by three, and preceded by all their train, and followed by the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Queen ended afterwards the recreations of <hi>Carneval,</hi> with hearing in the Palace <hi>Mazarino</hi> at <hi>Quirinale</hi> a French Play, intituled <hi>Heraclius,</hi> done by <hi>Cornelius</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Poet of <hi>France,</hi> whither her Majeſty was invited by Signior <hi>di

Lionne</hi> the French Embaſſadour to the Princeſs of <hi>Italy,</hi> who then was at <hi>Rome</hi> for the affairs of his Maſter. This Miniſter in all his great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments for the ſervice of that Crown, as well within, as without the Kingdom, hath ſufficiently made known the vivacity of his Spirit, the readineſs of his wit, and conſtant fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. He is of a moſt affable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, a vigorous judgement, great foreſight, and rare capacity in every affair. His wit is refined with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, his mind very ſprightly, and his thoughts aime only at glory, and an excellent report. He is full of ſolidity in his diſcourſes, of wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and dexterity in affairs, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and ſweetneſs in his carriage, being eſpecially a friend unto vertue, with which he deſervedly attracts to himſelf, the encomiums and praiſes of every one that know; him.</p>
            <p>Beſides the ſaid Comedy, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her Majeſty with a ſtately collation, of moſt excellent ſweet-meats, and in extraordinary abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and gave her a fine Ball, danc'd

after the French faſhion, by ſome nimble and agile Savoyards, with which the Queen was very highly ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>On the firſt day of Lent her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty went to the houſe of the Prince of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata of his Holineſs to St. <hi>Sabina.</hi>
               </note> to behold the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne <hi>Cavalcata,</hi> with which the Pope accompanyed by the ſacred Colledge, and the reſt of the Court, went from the <hi>Vatican</hi> to <hi>Aventino,</hi> to viſit there St. <hi>Sabina,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Dominicans.</hi> This Convent is famous for ſeverall memorialls of the reſidence there, of the glorious St. <hi>Dominick.</hi> After dinner ſhe went likewiſe to that ſtation, where the Father Generall received and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her, as likewiſe the chief Fathers of that order, which met there that day.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of <hi>March,</hi> her Majeſty went to the Church of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna della Scala</hi> the diſcalceate <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inelites,</hi> an order ſhe loved well.

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:170463:253"/>
by the moſt eminent Friars of that order. While ſhe prayed before the moſt holy Sacrament, a very fine Motetto was ſung. Thence paſſing into the Convent, ſhe went into the Oratory, which ſhe found richly hung, and adorned with Pictures, Mottos, and Emblems. Here ſhe heard Maſs, at which the devotion of her mind was augmented with exquiſite Muſick. She then honoured a pretious relique of a foot of St. <hi>Tereſia,</hi> the foundreſs of that order, and heard a Latin oration recited by one of thoſe Fathers.</p>
            <p>The day after, which was the firſt <hi>Friday</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> ſhe viſited St. <hi>Peters,</hi> as ſhe did all the <hi>Fridayes</hi> of the moneth aforeſaid, for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the treaſures of that famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</p>

            <p>This Colledge had deſired, ever ſince her arrivall in <hi>Rome,</hi> to teſtifie to her their dutifull reſpects, and Father <hi>Edward Courtney</hi> the Rector, employed ſoone his parts in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a book, in which are contained the Elogies of above fifty Saint, the Queens, or daughters of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> he adding to each Elogie ſome verſes very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly applyed to this Princeſſes rare qualities.

to the Pope, and a Gentleman no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly borne, who was likewiſe there. Her Majeſties prayers were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with moſt admirable muſick, and a harmony of Viols, in which the Engliſh excell. She ſitting down afterwards under a ſtate, had recited to her a ſhort Latin oration, with ſome verſes by two of thoſe young Scholars, they preſenting to her the ſaid book of printed Elogies, which her Majeſty moſt courteouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>On the day of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> the ſolemne Feaſt of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> her Majeſty went to the Church of <hi>Minerva,</hi> of the Fathers aforeſaid, one of the chiefeſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well for the ſervice of the Church, as the ſacred Congregation of the Cardinalls, held in that Convent every <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in the morning, of the holy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the greateſt importance in <hi>Rome.</hi> The rooms where they hold the ſaid Congregation, were ſeen by the Queen, as likewiſe all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, her Majeſty remaining highly

pleaſed with the magnificence both of the one and the other. She was received and attended by the Father Generall, and Father <hi>Raymund Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſucchi</hi> Maſter of the Sacred Palace, and one of the examiners of the Biſhops, a Prelate of much vertue, and rare parts, which are the more remarkable by the ancient Family of the <hi>Capiſucchi,</hi> which as appears by authentick writings, and is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the very ſame arms, is a branch ſprowted out of the moſt noble ſtock of the Counts of <hi>Tunn</hi> in Germany, the head of which now, is the Prince Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi> a Gentleman of moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent qualities.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty had likewiſe ſome thoughts of ſeeing the curious ſtudy of the Knight of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Gualdo</hi> of <hi>Rimini,</hi> a Gentleman well deſerving of the learnedeſt of the ancients, which he gave to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, but the ill weather, and the greater affairs of this Princeſs, have not yet permitted her to behold it. I therefore forbear

to ſpeak of the ſaid ſtudy, till a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunity be preſented me.</p>
            <p>The Queen then continuing her vertuous entertainments, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Lent, introduced the ſpirituall exerciſe of a devout orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in her Palace every <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> which was ordered by the Prince of <hi>Gallicano.</hi> They began the ſecond <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> and the hiſtory of <hi>Daniell</hi> was recited in muſick, a compoſition well becoming the ſaid Prince.

            <p>But behold us at the end of theſe our relations. The ſincerity of my Penne, which cannot deliver truly to Poſterity, the glorious name of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> great without the true Characters of a perpetuall <hi>Panegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi> concludes, that as 'tis doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
