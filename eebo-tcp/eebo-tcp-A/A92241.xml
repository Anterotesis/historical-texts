         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reaſons humbly Exhibited, why Miniſters Tithes and Profits
ſhould not be taxed as a Reall Eſtate of yearly Rent, or yearly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of Land, as hitherto they have beene, but as a Perſonall Eſtate
of Goods and Chattels onely.</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or that their Tithes do ariſe from, and by the yearly improving of the Stock of the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or Ocupier of Land, and if the Farmer ſuffer loſſe therein, the Miniſter ſuffers in
his proportion with him; neither hath the Miniſter a right in Law to any thing Titha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
which is fixed to the Free-hold untill it be ſevered therefrom, and then if the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
nine parts thereof be juſtly deemed Goods and Chattels, and in juſtice and equity
is aſſeſſed but as a perſonall Eſtate, then ſurely the Miniſters tenth part of the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
juſtly be deemed other then Goods and Chattels, and in like juſtice and equity ought to be aſſeſſed but
as a perſonall Eſtate of Goods and Chattels only, and not as a reall Eſtate of yearly Rent, or yearly value of
Land.</p>
            <p>2. For that the Act compriſeth all Eſtates under Reall and Perſonall, and (as is humbly conceived) holds
forth yearly Rent or yearly value of Land to be onely Reall Eſtate, and all other Profits, Money, Goods,
Chattels, Stock, Merchandizes, &amp;c. to be Perſonall Eſtate, as in <hi>fol.</hi> 308. Now Tithes being but the tenth
of Goods and Chattels Tithable as aforeſaid, and of no other or more value, then ſo much Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels:
How in juſtice and equity can they according to the Rule of the ſaid Act bee aſſeſſed for more then a
Perſonall Eſtate of ſo much Goods and Chattels?</p>
            <p>3. For that the late Committee of Parliament for the Army by their Order of the 3. of February, 1652.
Reſolved that all Profits and Salaries ariſing or allowed to any perſon, by, or in reſpect of any Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Common-wealth, <hi>ought to be aſſeſſed as perſonall Eſtate,</hi> and that the Commiſſioners for
the Aſſeſſments for the Army in the City of <hi>London,</hi> do take care that the reſpective Aſſeſſors and Collectors
for the ſaid City do proceed in the aſſeſſing collecting of the ſaid Aſſeſſments and Arrears accordingly,
and is there not the ſame reaſon, the like Rule ſhould be obſerved in the Countrey? Now how far the Office
of a Miniſter will be deemed belonging to the Common-wealth, is humbly ſubmitted, yet ſure as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
Tithes and Profits are allowed as a Sallary or Reward, or hire for his labour and pains in the diſcharge
of his ſaid Office (which will clearly appear to be ſo in the next reaſon) ſo there is an adequate ſuitableneſs
to receive a like benefit by the ſaid Order, <hi>viz.</hi> of being aſſeſſed, but as a Perſonall Eſtate.</p>
            <p>4. For that the whole yearly Incumbe of the Miniſters Living, is but the Sallary, Reward, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire for their
conſtant labours, <hi>viz.</hi> they by their conſtant labours in their Miniſteriall Office do produce ſo much yearly
towards the maintenance of themſelves and Families: and that it is the Sallary, Reward, or Hire for their
labour appears, firſt, becauſe the Scripture ſo termes it, ſaying, the <hi>Labourer is worthy of his hire,</hi> referring
to the Office of the Miniſtery. 2. Becauſe they have no other Salary, Reward, or Hire for their labour and
ſervice allowed them by or from men. 3. Becauſe if they ceaſe to perform the conſtant ſervice and labour
of the ſaid Office, they are liable to be ejected by Law and Equity, which of late yeares, to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of many fearing God in ſeveral places, hath often been done and practiſed; unto which ſervitude and
incumbrances a Reall Eſtate of yearly Rent, or yearly value of Land is no way liable: Therefore how in
juſtice and equity can the yearly profits of a Miniſters labours be aſſeſſed equall with yearly Rent, or yearly
value of Land, or for more then a Perſonall Eſtate as aforeſaid?</p>
            <p>5. For that no Lawyer or Phyſitian, &amp;c. although he get 500 l. a yeare by his Science and Practice is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
for the ſame as ſo much Reall Eſtate of yearly Rent or yearly value of Land, but as a Perſonall Eſtate of
ſo much money: Therefore in juſtice and equity, how can the product of the poore Miniſters labours
(which to many is not ſufficient maintenance for themſelves and Families) be aſſeſſed at more then ſo much
Perſonall Eſtate of money or Goods? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6. For that the ſaid Act, to the end that there may be an equall and right proportioning of the Tax,
doth enact that a pound rate be made of all Reall and Perſonall Eſtates, <hi>according to the value thereof,</hi> and
gives by way of rule an inſtance how they ſhall be valued; that is to ſay, every 20 l. money, Stock, or other
Perſonall Eſtate ſhall bear the like charge, as ſhall be laid upon every twenty ſhillings yearly Rent, or year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
value of Land; ſo that 100 l. yearely Rent or yearly value of Land, according to that computation, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
worth 2000 l. money, and ſo of a greater and leſſe proportion, which ſaid Rent, as it ariſeth certain
without labour or ſervice, ſo is it deſcendable or alienable to Heirs or Aſſignes, when as the Miniſter muſt
firſt performe the ſervice of the place, if he looke to receive the Profits thereof, which if they amount at the
yeares end to 100 l. are never more worth to him, then ſo much money, Goods, or Chattels, if hee happen
to live to the end of Harveſt, &amp; can get it in; nor is it deſcendable to wife &amp; children, nor can be by him put
to ſale, as in the caſe of Lands aforeſaid, although the Miniſter beſtow his whole time from his child-hood,
till the age of 23 or 24 years at the ſooneſt, ſometimes much longer at the great Charge of Friends to fit and
prepare himſelf for the work before he is capable in Law to take upon him the Office of a Miniſter and take
the profits of a Benefice: Therefore how in juſtice and equity can their Tithes and Profits be aſſeſſed equall
which the yearly Rent or yearly value of Land, or for more then a perſonall Eſtate of money, or Goods and
Chattels as aforeſaid?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The aforeſaid Reaſons conſidered and humbly conceived to be valid, the Miniſter hath hitherto
been aſſeſſed at nineteen times in twenty, more than his due proportion.</hi>
