         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Saints. The words are the words of

Wisdom, they are (I say) the
words of Wisdom it self. <hi>I love
them that love me; and those that
seek me early shall find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which, I shall only take notice
of these two parts, or branches.</p>
            <p>1. In the first part, there is a most
glorious display of Divine Grace
And Love, in an act of wonderful
condescension, enough to astonish
Men and Angels: <hi>I love them that
love me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Here is a most gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
the product of that glorious
infinite Love; <hi>And those that seek
me early shall find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first part of the Text is a
fair Preface and Introduction to a
most excellent Promise.</p>
            <p>The second part is a Promise
every way suited to the glory and
excellency of such a Preface.</p>

'Tis true indeed, it begins with
some kind of limitation and strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
<hi>Those that love me, Those that
seek me early.</hi> But then it hath a
most pleasant and desired <hi>Exit</hi>
with abundant satisfaction, <hi>They
shall find me.</hi> There is your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
your heaven, your eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
here is the work of your
lives. I beseech you remember it,
and let not this Text, or Sermon,
be ever forgotten by you.</p>
            <p>Here (I say) is the work of
your lives, to seek early; The happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Eternity, to find God, and
to enjoy him for ever.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
give me leave to speak a
little to these two things.</p>
            <p>1. To the Author of these words,
that I may not leave one Soul here
at an uncertainty. And</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:30334:8"/>
2. I would speak a little to the
Form of the words, that I may leave
none of you under any mistakes.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Author of this great and
glorious Text (if you look into
the beginning of the Chapter) is
Wisdom uttering her voice.</hi> Vers. 1,
Doth not wisdom cry? and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
put forth her voice? <hi>vers.</hi> 2,
She standeth in the top of high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by the way, in the places of the
paths. <hi>Vers.</hi> 3, She crieth at the
gates, at the entry of the city, at the
coming in at the doors. Behold, I
stand at the door and knock, Rev. 3.
20. <hi>Wisdom knocks, Wisdom calls,
Wisdom cries, and uttereth her
voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Acceptations of <hi>Wisdom</hi> in
the Holy Scriptures, in the Word
of God, are various.</p>
            <p>'Tis sometimes taken for the


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30334:9"/>
God of Wisdom himself. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the Son of God, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Father. Sometimes for
the Spirit of Christ, who reveals
wisdom to the Saints of God, the
Spirit of wisdom and illumination.
Sometimes for the grace of wisdom,
and spiritual knowledg. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the Word of Wisdom,
the Gospel of Christ, as he says
himself, <hi>Matt. 11. 19, Wisdom is
justified of her Children.</hi> That is,
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the wonderful Wisdom of God
is displayed. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>But to wave the rest (as having
many things to speak to you this
day, that concern the happiness of
your precious and immortal souls
to Eternity, and therefore I hope,
that you will not only bear with


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30334:9"/>
me, but also bear me up by your
prayers.)</p>
            <p>Doubtless by Wisdom here in
this Text, is meant the <hi>Interna sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Filius Dei;</hi> and
we are to understand the Internal,
Eternal Wisdom of God, that is
called in Scripture, The Word of
God, <hi>the Word that was made Flesh,</hi>
Wisdom speaking, the speaking
Wisdom, the Son of God, the Son
of God <hi>(In quo, &amp; a quo omnis
sapientia)</hi> in whom and from
whom is all wisdom, all counsel
and spiritual understanding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom we cannot know God
the Father, or the Truth as we
should do; and by whom we know
the Truth <hi>as it is in Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first Verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Wisdom is intituled to this
great Speech, and indeed in the


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30334:10"/>
whole Chapter (if you will but
take the pains, when you are gone
from hence, to read it seriously)
before you come to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
you will be convinced, as well
as I, that this Wisdom is <hi>the Son of
God,</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ, making
this great Proclamation to all the
World, <hi>I love them that love me;
and those that seek me early shall find
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I told you, that I would
shew you somewhat concerning
the form or manner of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>I love them that love me:</hi>
to prevent the mistakes, and
errors, as we have need to do,
especially in this Age, wherein the
minds and hearts of men, like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
suck poyson from the most
precious and most glorious Truths
of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:30334:10"/>
               <hi>I love them that love me,</hi> doth
not in the least, 1. Intimate, that
our love, or the love of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is the cause of the love of
God to our souls; nor doth it in
the least imply that our love is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedaneous
(the least moment of
time) to the love of God; which
will the more clearly appear, if we
curiously observe the manner of
expressing it: 'Tis not said, I will
love them that will love me, but <hi>I
love them that love me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, the Apostle <hi>John</hi> clears
the Text, and puts all out of doubt,
in 1 <hi>John 4. 10, Herein is love, not
that we loved God, but that he loved
us.</hi> And vers. 19, <hi>We love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he first loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As it doth not at all any way
intimate, or suggest the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of our love to God, before he


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30334:11"/>
loved us; so in the next place, I
must tell you, that it is a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Truth, a golden Maxime,
fit to be written on your Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posts;
yea, on your very hearts,
Wisdoms thus saying to you, <hi>I love
them that love me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may serve especially for
these four great ends:</p>
            <p>1. For the support and comfort
of poor doubting souls, that now
lye very low, in a dark day, in a
time of sickness, under great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
perhaps God hath come, and
snatcht away a dear Wife out of an
Husbands bosom, or hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Child of his delight; it
may be many and long continued
afflictions lye on him, and he looks
upon these bitter and severe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,
and begins to question
now, whether God doth love him:


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30334:11"/>
Time was, when all things went
well with me, and I had peace
within, and comfort without, a
House full of enjoyments; but
now 'tis a dark day, God hath
smitten me with the strokes of an
enemy, the chastisements of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
one are upon me, so that I
doubt whether God loves me. Thus
the poor doubting soul is apt to
reason. But says God, look not
at my providences, on thine own
losses, crosses, troubles, and on
these outward dispensations; look
rather into thy own heart, and if
thou canst read there but one line
of love to my name, if thou canst
read there any true love to Jesus
Christ, then thou maist conclude
with thy self, that whatever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
thou hast met (or maist
yet meet with) shall be for thy


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30334:12"/>
good. <hi>I love them that love me.</hi>
And these Providences are not the
fruits of wrath, but rather the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of pure love. <hi>Rom. 8. 28,
And we know</hi> (says the Apostle)
<hi>that all things work together for good
to them that love God.</hi> I can cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise,
correct, smite, but cannot
hate my Sons and Daughters, says
God. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth, he
chastneth, and scourgeth every Son
whom he receiveth,</hi> Heb. 12. 6. <hi>I
love them that love me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For the Relief of despairing
souls, that are affected, deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with their sinning against
God, and their utter unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by reason thereof, of any
smile from Heaven; but are ready
to reason against their own souls,
and to say, that surely God can
never love such a treacherous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate,


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30334:12"/>
and backsliding sinner as
I have been, and am; it's in vain
for me to expect any love from
Heaven, but rather in fury to be
turned into Hell, and to be for
ever rejected; my case and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is worse than that of <hi>Cain.</hi>
But for the relief of such, God
reasons thus, Didst ever love me?
Didst ever love Jesus Christ, and
the Children of God? If so, take
comfort to thy soul: for certainly,
<hi>I love them that love me.</hi> Though
it be so low, as it is, though thou
canst see nothing but wrath, and
vengeance, and hell; yet, if thou
hast any love to me, to Jesus Christ,
and the Saints, thou maist be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that I love thee. <hi>I love
them that love me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For the help, wonderful help,
and encouragement of poor sinners


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30334:13"/>
to duty: How is this glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of Love and Grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
for the help of poor
souls, through their whole lives?
Have you any true love for God?
You say, you have no strength, no
might, so that you are not able to
do any thing to please God: Why,
what is the matter? You cannot
see, that you have any share of the
Love of God. Look into the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
look into the Copy in your
hearts, and if you can see any true
love to God there, go and pray,
and hear, and suffer what's alotted
for you, and you shall find all
sweet and easie to you.</p>
            <p>4. And Lastly, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
this great truth from
the mouth of Wisdom, <hi>I love them
that love me,</hi> is intended for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
proclamation of sovereign


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30334:13"/>
grace and mercy to all the Sons
and Daughters of men, and a
sweet invitation to all persons, to
perform the duty contain'd in the
next words, namely, <hi>to seek early
after God:</hi> Here is wonderful free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and fulness of Divine Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
large enough for all men; and 'tis
enough to encourage those persons
(that are naturally haters of God
in their minds) to return, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because God is
ready to meet them, and requite
them with reciprocal love: Do
your duty, and if you love me, and
seek me, be sure I have a love for
you.</p>
            <p>But I will detain you no longer
among the terms and words of the
Text, though to keep my usual
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ont and method, I must always
endeavour to make the way plain
before you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:30334:14"/>
The Text I told you had two
branches, and 'its my purpose (if
the Lord enable me) to gather
some fruit from each of them.</p>
            <p>From the first part, <hi>I love them
that love me.</hi> I would offer this
to you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That there is a mutual
and reciprocal love between Christ
and his Saints.</p>
            <p>I told you, that it was a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the love of Christ, and
where he loves, he begets love;
so that whensover a Saint truly
loves Christ, he may be sure, that
Christ doth intirely love him: <hi>I
am my beloveds, and my beloved is
mine.</hi> The believing soul says so;
And who can but live and dye on
such a word as this is? especially
when Christ says, as in the Text,


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30334:14"/>
               <hi>I love them that love me.</hi> I love
this Saint, and he loves me.</p>
            <p>That is the first Observation.</p>
            <p>The second is much like it, and
that is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That they that seek the
Lord early, shall certainly find him,
shall certainly enjoy, eternally enjoy
him, shall find him a God of Grace
and Mercy, and shall enjoy him for
ever.</p>
            <p>But first, of the first of these:</p>
            <p>That there is a mutual and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
love between Christ and his
Saints.</p>
            <p>To dispatch this, (and yet not

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o make more haste than good
speed) that you may understand it,
shall endeavour to shew you here,</p>
            <p>1. That Christ loves his Saints.</p>
            <p>2. How he discovers, and


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30334:15"/>
manifests his love to them.</p>
            <p>3. That the Saints of God do
love the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>4. How they do express and
manifest their love to him: That by
all this put together, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
conclude, that there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and reciprocal love between
Christ and the Saints.</p>
            <p>1. First of all, That Jesus Christ
hath a peculiar, a special, dea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  </gap>


                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:30334:15"/>
and without blemish:</hi> And this
Text I mention the rather, because
it is one of the last Scriptures that
our <hi>Deceased Friend</hi> insisted on,
when she took her last farwel of
me; <hi>Who loved his Church</hi> (said
she) <hi>and gave himself for it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. For the manner, how the
Lord Jesus Christ doth express
and discover his love to his Saints.
Though I might instance in many
methods and ways of his disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
his love to them; yet I shall
confine my self to these <hi>three</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
by which he eminently
makes known the intireness of his
indeared love to his Saints; and
by the same ways I shall shew you
by and by, that the Saints of God
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> express their love to Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>1. First of all, he discovers and


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30334:16"/>
makes known his love to his Saints,
in denying himself of all the glory
he had with his Father, in leaving
those Regions above, that he might
come down, and gather his Saints
together, that he might redeem
them out of the hands of Hell,
and deliver them out of the House
of their Prison and bondage. <hi>Rev.
1. 6, Vnto him that loved us, and
washed us from our sins in his own
blood;</hi> he gave his heart blood for
us. <hi>Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7, Who being
in the form of God, thought it no
robbery to be equal with God,</hi> Gods
fellow, coequal with the Father:
What did he do? why, <hi>He made
himself of no reputation, and took
upon him the form of a Servant, and
was made in the likeness of men. And
being found in fashion as a man, he
humbled himself, and became obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30334:16"/>
unto death, even the death of
the cross.</hi> Was not here love?
Greater love hath no man than
this, That a man lay down his life
for his friend; yet this was greater
love, for <hi>Christ laid down his life
for his enemies,</hi> Rom. 5. 10.</p>
            <p>2. He manifests his intire love
to his Saints, in the delight he hath
in their communion, and in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with them: Christ is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
better pleased, or more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted,
than when his Saints are
in communion and fellowship with
him. When, and <hi>Where-ever two
or three are gathered together in my
name,</hi> there is my heaven, here I
delight to dwell: If you read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this <hi>8th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Proverbs,</hi>
it the 31 <hi>verse,</hi> you shall see the
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edundancy of Christs love to his
people, before ever he had a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30334:17"/>
they were his contemplative
delight, that he should come down
and be with them, and give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for them. <hi>Rejoycing in the
habitable part of his earth, and my
delights were with the sons of men.</hi>
Do but read <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 5, and there
you shall see how the Spouse her
self takes notice of the delight her
Beloved takes in communion with
her; <hi>The King</hi> (says she) <hi>is held</hi>
(or bound, as in the Margin) <hi>in
the Galleries.</hi> What are the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
why, they are the Ordinances,
wherein he promises to meet his
Saints: the King will sit at his round
Table, he will walk with them in
the Galleries, in private commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
he is held or bound there:
That is, he takes so much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight, he is taken so
much with the beauty he hath put


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30334:17"/>
upon his Saints, that (to speak it
with reverence) he cannot tell
how to go from them, and leave
them; as a man with his best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
is bound (as it were) with
chains of love.</p>
            <p>3. And lastly, Christ manifests
his love to his Saints, in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
longing he hath to have them
with him in his glory. When any
one sinner is converted, it is said
<hi>there is joy in heaven,</hi> the King of
Saints rejoyceth, all the Angels
and Saints sing together; there is
(I say) joy in Heaven when one
sinner comes in; Christs sends forth
his Angels to entertain them, and
to bring them into his Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
nay, he leads them in, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
In <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2, 3, Christ tells
his Disciples, <hi>In my Fathers house
are many mansions; if it were not so,


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30334:18"/>
I would have told you; I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a place for you. And if I go
and prepare a place for you, I will
come again, and receive you unto
my self, that where I am, there y<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
may be also.</hi> And you may read
at your leisure that ravishing
Chapter <hi>Joh.</hi> 17, and if you read
it with understanding, and your
souls go with your eyes (be it
spoken with reverence to such a
glorious God and King as he is)
you will perceive, that he seems
not satisfied with his own glory at
the right hand of the Majesty on
high, without the Company of his
dear-bought Saints, that he hath
bought with his own blood; Read
especially the 22, 23, 24 <hi>verses;
And the glory that thou gavest me. I
have given them; that they may be
one, even as we are one.</hi> Vers. 23,


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30334:18"/>
               <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they
may be made perfect in one, and that
the world may know, that thou hast
sent me, and hast loved them, as thou
hast loved me.</hi> Vers. 24, <hi>Father, I
will, that they also whom thou hast
given me, be with me where I am,
that they may behold my glory which
thou hast given me: for thou lovedst
me before the foundation of the
world.</hi> Then Christs Mediatory
Kingdom will be compleated, and
the shame and sufferings that were
undergon by him, will be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when he hath gathered his
Saints to himself, to behold his
glory.</p>
            <p>3. And now I shall shew you the
second part; if we turn the Table,
then we shall see, that the Saints of
God, in their measure, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their strength, those that


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30334:19"/>
are truly such, do love the Lord
Jesus with all their hearts; and
you find it not thus with you, you
have reason to be jealous of, and
to suspect your selves; I say the
true Saints of God do love the
Lord Jesus with all their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Whom having not seen, ye love: i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
whom, though now you see him not
yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.
8. <hi>Whom having not seen ye love,</hi>
with such a love as raises your
hearts; it is, <hi>Amor vulnerans li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
&amp;c.</hi> a love (as one says)
that wounds, that strikes them to
the very heart; a love that binds
their souls to Christ; which made
the Spouse cry out, <hi>Cant. 2. 5, Stay
me with flagons, comfort me with
apples, for</hi> I <hi>am sick of love.</hi> The
truth is, you may imagine that it


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30334:19"/>
is an Hyperbolical expression; but
indeed there is no expression that
can fully set it out; and therefore
you see, how the Spouse hangs, as
it were, on the lips of Christ, <hi>Cant.
1. 2, Let him kiss me with the kisses
of his mouth: for thy love,</hi> or loves,
<hi>is better than wine.</hi> And every
Saint, while he is <hi>in the wilderness,</hi>
in his Wilderness-state, <hi>leans on his
beloved:</hi> What would a Saint have
in any condition? None but Christ,
Christ is his All in all.</p>
            <p>4. And therefore in the second
place I shall shew you, That the
Saints of God do mutually and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally
express and discover
their love to Jesus Christ, in their
measure, in their degree, as he
makes known his love to them.
As,</p>
            <p>1. They express their love to


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30334:20"/>
Christ, in denying all for him.
Christ left a Kingdom, and all the
glory of his Fathers House: But
alas! the Saints of God they have
nothing to leave in comparison of
what he left. They that leave
Houses, Lands, Mannors, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
for Christ, all this is little
(I say) in comparison of what
Christ left for them; but the truth
is, whatever the Saints have, all
that they have, they will lay at the
feet of Christ when he calls them
to it, and this, as soon as ever they
apprehend that love of Christ
to them; as soon as ever they
come to be made sensible of the
worthiness of Christ, of the All-sufficiency
that is in Christ to do
them good, away goes the world,
they sit loose to it, as loose as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi>'s
Mantle, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 13, which


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30334:20"/>
fell off when he was taken up to
Heaven: Thus said, and thus did
the Disciples of Christ, <hi>We have
left all and followed thee.</hi> But I shall
only add the example of one emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Saint, who left all for Christ;
and if all the Princes in the World
had thrown their Crowns into his
lap, he would have left them all.
Phil. 3. 7, 8, <hi>What things were gain
to me, those were counted loss for
Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count
all things but loss for the excellency
of the knowledg of Christ Jesus my
Lord: for whom I have suffered the
loss of all things, and do count them
but dung that I may win Christ.</hi> v. 9,
<hi>And be found in him, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As Christ discovers his love
to the Saints, in his delight of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them, so the people
of God do intirely love, earnestly


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30334:21"/>
desire, and delight in communion
with the Lord Jesus Christ; the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

Daughters of Jerusalem, by the Roes
and by the Hindes of the field, that

               </gap>
she had said) is come to abide with
me, and I take so much delight in
communion and fellowiship with
him, that I charge you not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
him: I would not have the
dearest lust, I would not have any
sin whatsoever to interpose betwixt
Christ and me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:30334:21"/>
3. As Christ discovers the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his love to his Saints, in
longing to injoy them with himself
in his glory; so the Saints of God,
here upon earth, do long (earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
long) to injoy him in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
presence, in the House of his
glory, to be in those Mansions
that he hath provided for them,
in those Regions of glory above:
<hi>They look earnestly for the glorious
appearance of the great God, and
the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to <hi>Titus</hi> expresses it, <hi>Titus 2.
13, 14, Looking for that blessed
hope, and the glorious appearing of
the great God, and our Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, Who gave himself for us,
that he might redeem us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and purifie unto himself a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
people, zealous of good works.</hi>
They look out, as <hi>Sisera</hi>'s Mother,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30334:22"/>
out of her Window, and cry
through the Lattice, <hi>Judg. 5. 28,
Why is his Chariot so long in coming?
why tarry the wheels of his Chariots?</hi>
So the soul of a Saint looks out at
every cranny, at the eye, and at
the ear, and cries out, Why tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
his Chariot? why is he so long
in coming? That <hi>dear Saint</hi> that
is gone before us, was wont to tell
me, That she had waited a long
time for her great change, and did
continue waiting: And the truth
is, it cannot be otherwise, when
once a Soul is espoused to Jesus
Christ, and hath been kissed with
the kisses of his mouth, and knows
any thing of his love, and loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
from the very day of espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,
there will be, there must be
a longing desire of enjoyment; as
it is with young Lovers, when once


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30334:22"/>
true love is between them, all the
time after is a time of desire and
longing: Make haste (says the
soul to Christ) and come away;
<hi>Egredere anima,</hi> says the longing
Saint; go out, Soul, to meet Jesus
Christ: this is the Case, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and a believing Soul:
Says the Soul to Christ, either come
down to me, or take me up to
thee; Dear Jesus Christ, when
shall I come, and appear before
God? <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and
to be with Christ,</hi> which is best of
all. I would also observe to you,
that passionate out-cry of the
Spouse to Jesus Christ, <hi>Cant. 8. 14,
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou
like to a young Roe, or to a young
Hart upon the mountains of spices.</hi>
It is the voice of a believer to Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:30334:23"/>
I should now make a transition
from hence to the next Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but let me first a little, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this.</p>
            <p>And the use I shall make of the
first Doctrine is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. To stand a while, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with you, admiring at the
infinite, sovereign, and free Grace
of God, who hath set his love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
man, and hath done poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that honour, as to engage
their hearts to love God, and the
truths of God. God is not behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us for our love; for he is an
object infinitely above our love,
and 'tis a wonder of mercy, that
God accounts us worthy to love
him, and to love Jesus Christ:
What a mercy is this, that God
should beget in us any love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30334:23"/>
by revealing his infinite love
to us! that <hi>his love should be shed
abroad in our hearts!</hi> Oh! stand
amazed at this! especially when
you hear God saying, <hi>Isa. 65. 1,
I am sought of them that asked not
for me; I am found of them that
sought me not: I said, behold me,
behold me, unto a nation that was
not called by my name.</hi> But more
of this anon, when I come to the
second Branch. Only here we may
go away with admiring thoughts
into Heaven, at this infinite, free,
and condescending love of God to
our poor souls: and to raise up our
hearts to the greater admiration,
consider,</p>
            <p>1. What a great, what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and immense Love this Love
of God is, that he bears to poor
creatures, <hi>his favour is better than


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30334:24"/>
life it self.</hi> Psal. 63. 3, <hi>Because</hi>
(says the <hi>Psalmist) thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is better than life, my lips shal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
praise thee.</hi> What shall we call it
A Fountain, a Fountain without
brim or bottom: <hi>Amor Dei est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundens
&amp; creans bonitatem.</hi> The
Love of Christ (as one says) 'tis
that which creates and infuseth
goodness, all manner of good, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
spiritual, and eternal.</p>
            <p>2. Would you see the fruits and
effects of this Love? Alas! 'tis not
a small matter for the great, and
glorious, and holy God, to tell a
poor soul, I love thee. Men may
say so, and it may signifie little:
but God never says so to any, but
it creates a Heaven in the Soul, it
fills the Soul with all the joys and
delights of Heaven, it leads him
into the Regions of Life and Peace,


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30334:24"/>
peace, peace, and assurance for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 3. and 32. 17. In
all your duties, this will be your
delight, That God loves you: In
a time of darkness, this will be
your light; and in the pangs of
death, this will be your living
comfort, That God loves you, and
that you have had an heart truly
to love God; and you know that
he loves you by your love to him,
and your love to God being (as
it were) the transcript of Gods
Love to you in your souls. And
indeed, (which may raise your
admirings) where God loves, and
whom he loves, he never leave,
he never ceases to love. <hi>Rom. 8. 38,
39, For I am perswaded</hi> (saith the
Apostle there) <hi>that neither death,
nor life, nor Angels,</hi> good or bad
Angels, <hi>nor principalities, nor pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30334:25"/>
nor things present, nor things
to come: Nor height, nor depth, nor
any other creature shall be able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
us from the love of God, which
is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Use of exhortation to them
that truly love the Lord Jesus:</p>
            <p>Dear Saints, you that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a true love to God, and do
by that see his love to your souls;
Oh, keep your selves in the love
of God. To that end,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Set a high price on
this grace that is wrought in you,
and (as the Apostle says) let it be
your great care to preserve, and to
keep life in this love of yours to
Jesus Christ. <hi>Jude vers. 21, Keep
your selves in the love of God, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ unto eternal life.</hi> And for
this purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:30334:25"/>
1. First of all consider the worth
of this love to Christ, what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and wonderful grace this is,
to have a heart truly to love the
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>1. It is that, which is the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
evidence of the Love of God,
it gives you all your life and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in a time of darkness, in a
dark day, to know by your love
to Jesus Christ, that he loves you,
and that the Father loves you; there
is no such clear evidence as this in
all the World: If a man had all
the treasures of gold and silver in
the world, he could not read the
love of God in them; but in your
true love to Jesus Christ you may.
When you walk in darkness, and
can see no light, this is that spark
of light that will give you light
when you are at a loss. When it


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30334:26"/>
is dark round about us, when we
can see little or no faith, little or
no hope, little or no strength that
we have; let us then inquire, and
see whether we have any love, and
if we have any true love to Christ,
this will give us light and life.
Rom. 8. 28, <hi>We know that all things</hi>
(says the Apostle) <hi>work together for
good,</hi> To whom? <hi>to them that love
God.</hi> If one should ask me this
question, Why is the promise made
to those that love God? I answer,
because the Saints do want some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to comfort, to support, and
relieve them in a dark day; and
when all other light fails, and we
can see no faith, find no holiness,
this will never fail them: If there
be once true love to Christ, there
will be some spark remaining, that
will administer comfort to them in
the darkest day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:30334:26"/>
2. Consider with your selves,
that if you preserve and keep up
this love, this love to Jesus Christ
in your hearts, it will work in you
a likeness to Christ; And can you
desire to be like any person that
you love better? or that is more
exactly and perfectly pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is, more lovely than Christ?
This true love is a fire that makes
all things like it self; true love to
God is of an assimilating vertue,
it will make us like to God, and
like to Christ, whom we love:
Love is like a Looking-glass, if you
turn the Glass downward, there will
appear nothing but the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of earth, and terrestrial crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
all earth; but if you turn
it upward, then there will appear
Heaven, and celestial, and the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
glory of another world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30334:27"/>
as to our bodily eyes, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to the eye of faith: If we give
forth our love to Christ, why then
all Christ, all Heaven, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is on the soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direction</hi> 2. Be diligent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
on your watch: if you do prize,
and set any value upon this love
to Jesus Christ, endeavour to keep
it, as you would keep your lives;
keep it as you would keep the best
Jewel in the world; nay, the world
cannot give, cannot afford you
such another Jewel: This Christ
hath bought for you with his own
most precious blood, by his death,
his shameful and accursed death;
and therefore you have reason,
great reason to keep it safe, for its
own worth, and because it is of so
great use, as hath been before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
because it will be a light to


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30334:27"/>
you in a dark, in the darkest day,
and because it will make you like
God, and like Christ; take heed
therefore, lest it be stoln from
you, or abated in you. As persons
that have a Jewel of great price
and value, will be often looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place where they laid it up,
to see whether it be safe; so this
spark of Divine fire, which is put
into, and laid up in our Souls, is a
Jewel of matchless and inestimable
price; How therefore should we
inquire concerning it, how it is
with us, as to our love to God and
Christ? We should be trying and
examining our selves, whether
Wives, or Children, or any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Relations, or worldly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or enjoyments, have not stoln
away our hearts, or abated our
love: We should say to our own


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30334:28"/>
hearts in this case, as Christ to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
on another account, <hi>Lovest thou
me more than those? Joh. 21. 15,
16,</hi> 17. So we should say to our
hearts, Dost thou love Jesus Christ?
dost thou love him indeed and in
earnest? dost thou love him better
than these, than these Children,
these pretty little Idols that are set
up before our eyes? dost love him
better than all creature-comforts
and relations? dost love him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than all earthly treasures, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than thy estate, better than all
the world, better than all these?
Yea, better than Heaven it self
without Christ? Thus I say, we
should still be examining our
hearts, and see how it is with us,
as to our love to Christ: for to tell
you the truth, our hearts are very
treacherous: I know not how it is


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30334:28"/>
with yours, but I find it so with
mine, and that it is a very hard
matter to keep up that height of
love to Jesus Christ as there should
be. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells us,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9, That <hi>the heart is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
above all things, and desperately
wicked, who can know it?</hi> And as
it is so in general, so especially
with God, the heart is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to be treacherous with God,
and in things relating to God, than
in any other things; and therefore
we have great need to look well
to them, to be diligent, and exact
upon our watch, in reference to
this love to Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. If God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
this grace to you, as he hath
made you partakers of his love,
and given you the transcript or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
thereof, be you sure that


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30334:29"/>
you love him again, and be you
sure also to keep off every thing
that may stifle or quench the heat
of your love; take heed of those
strong blasts, those wicked and
cursed temptations that arise from
Hell; take heed also of those
damps that arise from the world; if
you set your affections there, those
cold vapours arising thence, will
either abate or extinguish the heat
of this pure heavenly fire of love;
take heed of being Servants, with
the World, to the lusts of the flesh;
beware of these things: Sin, the
lusts of the flesh, the love of the
World, and Christ, are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent,
they cannot dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one Soul. 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 15,
If any man love the world, the love
of the father is not in him.</hi> These
are like two fires in one Chimney,


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30334:29"/>
the one will extinguish the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Fourthly and Lastly,
Be sure to add fuel to this fire,
and keep this heat you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from Heaven warm, take
heed that your hearts never get
cold; I must confess, that we live
in a cold and frozen age, in the
worlds old age, in an age wherein
there is little love to God, to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and to the Saints; and
if you would in this cold season
keep up the height of your love
to Christ, I would advise you,</p>
            <p>1. To be much in communion
with him; the nearer you are to
the Sun, the more heat you will
have.</p>
            <p>2. Be diligent, and active, and
vigorous in the performance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
duty, clothe your selves well
with the constant performance of


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30334:30"/>
duty; tender bodies, delicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
if they leave off a Garment,
are very apt to catch cold, and so
it will be with us if we neglect
the constant performance of duty;
the neglect of praying morning and
evening, the neglect of praying
constantly in your Closets, the
neglect of hearing Sermons, the
neglect of the due observation of
the Sabbath, in the neglect of these
things you will be apt to get cold;
yet it is not enough barely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
these duties (which is too
common a folly and sin) but there
is one thing more to be done, and
that is, when you have been in the
exercise of your love, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ, when you
have warmed your selves in your
Closets, or at an Ordinance, go
not too soon into the world; this


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30334:30"/>
care we do usually take for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
when we are warm, when
we are hot, we do not presently
expose our selves to the cold; and
thus we should do in reference to
our souls, when we have been at
an Ordinance, and have been
warmed and heated there, we
should not too soon adventure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
into the world; this hath
done a world of mischief, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have thereby cool'd and dampt
their love.</p>
            <p>3. And one thing more: When
you meet together, not to be
quench-coals one to another, not
to abate the love and zeal one of
another, but (as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,
<hi>Heb. 10. 24,) Consider one
another;</hi> What to do? <hi>to provoke
unto love and to good works,</hi> love
to God, love to Christ, love one to


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30334:31"/>
another, love to the Ordinances of
God: When you meet together,
do not meet together (I say) to
cool one another, but meet as so
many live-coals, that will kindle
and enliven one another, that you
may make the greater heat, that
you may warm your selves, and
one another, and so keep your
hearts and affections continually
warm for God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. I have yet a word to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sort of people by way of
Application, and that is, to such
as have never yet tasted of the love
of God, nor never yet have found
any love to Christ in their souls; I
hope there are, or may be none,
or few such here, and therefore I
shall speak but little to this; if
there should be any such here, or


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30334:31"/>
any of yours at home should be
such, their case is as bad as that of
<hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas.</hi> If they have yet
no love to God, and to Christ, I
tell them that are here, and do you
that are here tell them that are at
home, that they must never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves without it any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
without which they can never
be able to say, truly to say, that
God loves them: for if they hate
Christ, Christ will hate them, and
set himself against them; yea, there
is a curse gone out, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against them already, 1 <hi>Cor.
16. 22, If any man</hi> (says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
<hi>love not the Lord Jesus Christ,
let him be Anathema Maranatha.</hi>
And therefore you that are such
as I am now speaking to, be you
perswaded from henceforth to love
Christ, and in order thereto, wait


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30334:32"/>
upon the means of grace, where
God hath promised to shew forth
his love, and to inkindle it, and
inflame their hearts with a greater
and higher love to himself. In
<hi>Job</hi> 22. 21, says <hi>Eliphas</hi> to <hi>Job,
Acquaint thy self with him,</hi> that is,
with God, <hi>and be at peace: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
good shall come unto thee.</hi> And
this brings me now at last (though
I have staid long from it) to the
second Observation from the Text,
wherein lies much comfort for poor
souls, though you have had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
but a little light and love from
God, and but little love to God;
And that is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That they that seek the
Lord early, shall certainly find him,
and shall find him a God full of
grace and mercy, and shall certainly


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30334:32"/>
enjoy him eternally in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>deceased Friend</hi> (that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Saint of God that is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us) having found the benefit
of an early seeking after God and
Christ in the way of his Ordinances,
desired that her nearest Friends,
Relations, and Children, might be
(and indeed by chusing this Text
doth advise us all to be) <hi>a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Seekers;</hi> and oh that God
would make every one of us such,
as may <hi>seek thy face, O Jacob,</hi> O
God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> that is, that may
seek after Jesus Christ: This is the
work of our lives, and it is well
for us that Jesus Christ came into
the world to seek and to save that
which was lost, and to put this
great advantage into our hands,
that we could never have had


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30334:33"/>
without him. In <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 7, 8,
Christ exhorts us, <hi>Ask, and it shall
be given you: seek, and ye shall
find: knock, and it shall be opened
unto you. For every one that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
receiveth: and he that seeketh,
findeth: and to him that knocketh,
it shall be opened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Covenant of works
you might seek, and seek, till your
eyes sunk into the holes of your
heads, and never have found Christ
nor God; but now he tell us,
that he is come into the world, and
that if we seek him with our whole
hearts, in the way of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and appointments, we shall
find him; and that if we knock
there, it shall be opened unto us.</p>
            <p>In the prosecution of this Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
I shall only speak to these
three things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:30334:33"/>
1. First of all I shall shew you,
That man is born in a natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strangement
from God, every man,
every individual person, every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Child is brought into the
world, naturally estranged from
God. In <hi>Psal. 58. 3, The wicked
are estranged from the womb, they
go astray as soon as they be born,
speaking lies.</hi> There is the very
Character and Picture of a man in
a natural state, he is born with his
back upon God, and going with
his face towards Hell; before he
can walk with men, he can run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from God.</p>
            <p>2. I shall shew you, That they
that would escape that sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
that attend this estate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strangement
from God, must seek
him early; for they are in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of darkness, and in a state of sin


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30334:34"/>
and misery (as the Apostle expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it, <hi>Ephes. 2. 12,) Being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ, aliens form the common-wealth
of Israel, strangers from the
covenant of promise, having no hope
and without God in the world.</hi> And
the Apostle speaking of such, so
living, and so dying, in 2 <hi>Thes.
1.</hi> 9, says, <hi>Who shall be punished
with everlasting destruction from the
presence of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from the
glory of his power.</hi> And there is
no way to escape this, but by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
early after God, by seeking
early after Jesus Christ. And this
is that which I shall now speak to,
and which the Prophet <hi>Isa. 55. 6,
7,</hi> offers to us in the like terms.
<hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be
found; call ye upon him while he is
near. Now is the accepted time,
now is the day of salvation, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 2,


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30334:34"/>
You cannot tell how soon it may
be, that you may seek, and God
will not be found; that you may
call, and he will not answer; that
you may knock, and yet it shall
not be opened to you: for I tell
you, (yea, Christ himself tells you)
<hi>Luke 13. 24, That many shall seek
to enter in, and shall not be able:</hi>
and it must be, and is spoken of
such kind of persons as we be, of
persons that make a high profession,
that injoy the Ordinances of God;
<hi>Mat. 7. 22, 23. Many</hi> (says Christ) <hi>will
say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
have we not prophesied in thy name?
and in thy name have cast out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils?
and in thy name done many
wonderful works? And then will I
profess unto them, I never knew you:
depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi>
Now is the time of your seeking.


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30334:35"/>
And because there is the greatest
Emphasis intended in this term <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
early seeking after God, I shall
wave all the rest, and apply my
self to a timous, to an early seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after God, if God shall give
us the wisdom of the Swallow, the
Turtle, the Stork and the Crane,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 7, to let us know our sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the things that belong to
our peace.</p>
            <p>And in reference to this, I should
have thought it most proper for me
to have spoken more largely to
five or six particulars; but the time
will not give me leave, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall but only name them.</p>
            <p>1. I should have shewed you,
what it is to seek, what is meant
by the act of seeking.</p>
            <p>2. What it is to seek God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the act with the object,


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30334:35"/>
what it is to seek Christ: And that
under these Four Heads.</p>
            <p>1. To seek the Lord, is to seek
an acquaintance with God, to seek
after the knowledg of Christ: this
we should do early; and because
we cannot do it more early, we
should do it now; and it is our
great concern to get an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with God; we should seek
now to know God and Christ;
this is of so great weight, that Christ
himself tells us, <hi>Joh. 17. 3, This is
life eternal, that they might know
thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To seek God, is to seek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God: for there is
enmity and hostility between God
and us poor sinful wretches; every
one of us, as we are sinners by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and by practice, ought to seek


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30334:36"/>
               <hi>reconciliation with God, and an
interest in Christ, aud to make him
our Friend; and for this we are
Ambassadors; the whole Gospel
serves for this end; it is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of reconciliation.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.
18, 19, 20, All things are of God,
<hi>(says the Apostle)</hi> who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
us to himself by Jesus Christ,
and hath given to us the ministry of
reconciliation; To wit, that God was
in Christ, reconciling the world unto
himself, not imputing their trespasses
unto them, and hath committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us the word of reconciliation.
Now then, we are Ambassadors for
Christ, as though God did beseech you
by us; we pray you in Christs stead,
be ye reconciled to God.</p>
            <p>3. To seek the Lord, is to seek
communion with God, and to seek
communion with Jesus Christ, to


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30334:36"/>
seek him in his Ordinances, in his
publick Ordinances, Institutions,
and Appointments; to seek him
in our private duties, in our clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,
to have close communion with
God, and with Christ there: <hi>If
any man love me, he will keep my
words: and my Father will love him,
and we will come unto him, and
make our abode with him</hi> (says
Christ), <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. So that it
is a duty that lies on us to seek
God more in secret duties, and
more in publick Ordinances night
and day, wherever we be, to have
further rnd more intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with him, and to have a
more clear interest in Christ, and
more intimate communion with
him: <hi>By night on my bed,</hi> says the
Spouse, <hi>Cant. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, I sought
him whom my soul loveth, I sought


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30334:37"/>
him</hi> (on her bed, but that perhaps
may be drowsily, it was a kind of
drowsie seeking) <hi>and I found him
not.</hi> What then? <hi>I will rise now
and go about the City in the streets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in the broad ways I will seek
him whom my soul loveth: I sought
him, but I found him not: The
watch-men that go about the City,
found me: to whom I said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saw ye
him whom my soul loveth? It was
but a little that I passed from them,
but I found him whom my soul lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth:
I held him, and would not
let him go,</hi> &amp;c. Thus should we
seek Jesus Christ, thus should we
seek communion and fellowship
with him. And in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7. She
thus bespeaks the Lord Jesus, <hi>Tell
me, O thou whom my soul loveth,
where thou feedest, where thou makest
thy flock to rest at noon: for why


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30334:37"/>
should I be as one that turneth aside
by the flocks of thy companions?</hi>
And this Scripture I mention the
rather, because I now it was much
the spirit of our <hi>deceased Friend,</hi>
that precious Saint now with God,
who did seek Jesus Christ in pure
Ordinances, and desired to wait
for him in the most uncorrupt, and
purest ways of Communion; for
which she had a great zeal, to my
certain knowledg.</p>
            <p>4. And Lastly, To seek the
Lord, is to seek the eternal injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, and so to seek the
Lord Jesus Christ, as that we may
injoy him in his glory, setting our
faces heavenward, as in <hi>Jer. 50.
4,</hi> 5, It is said of the Children of
<hi>Israel,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Judah,</hi>
that they shall come together, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and weeping; that they shall


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30334:38"/>
go and seek the Lord their God.
And that <hi>they shall ask the way to
Zion, with their faces thitherward,
&amp;c.</hi> They did not only look, but
they went; they did not look one
way and go another, but they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and went where they might find
God; for they said, <hi>come, and let
us joyn our selves to the Lord, in a
perpetual covenant that shall not be
forgotten.</hi> I should have also shewn
you</p>
            <p>3. Where you should seek the
Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>4. How you should seek him.
And then</p>
            <p>5. Why you should seek him.</p>
            <p>But the time constrains me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to that one single term (early)
to that circumstance of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in it lies the greatest Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
(as I said before) and may be of


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30334:38"/>
great use to us at this day: and
here I shall shew you, what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by early seeking of God.
I am sure, those that have lived
longest, are most concerned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
the youngest, yea, every one
of us should account it our greatest
concern, early to seek the Lord.
But what is it that is intended by
this expression, early to seek the
Lord? This I shall shew you in
Three particulars.</p>
            <p>1. It seems to have reference
unto a day of Gods severe dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
when he goes forth to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Nations, to afflict Families,
and persons; there is such a day,
and that is the day of the Lord;
and in this day, as it is our duty
so it should be our wisdom to seek
the Lord early, before he kills and
destroys us, before he makes an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30334:39"/>
end by the severity of his stroke.
In <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, says the Prophet,
<hi>Gather together, O nation not desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Before the decree bring forth,
before the day pass as the chaff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fierce anger of the Lord come
upon you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>seek ye the LORD, all
ye meek of the earth, seek righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
seek meekness, it may be ye
shall be hid in the day of the
LORD's anger.</hi> And in this sense,
this is the most seasonable word
that I could have offered you in
such a day as this is, when God is
gone forth to contend with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
we hear of much sickness
and death both in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
God is shaking his Rod, now
therefore it is time early to seek the
Lord: It is a hard matter for a
man that is secure, to be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
though the rod be coming


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30334:39"/>
upon him, though the Lion roar,
though judgments are breaking in
upon us; as long as we can tell
what shift to make, (with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
Son) we never think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to our Fathers House, we
never think of seeking unto God.
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 29, 30, 31, 32, When
<hi>Absalom</hi> set <hi>Joabs</hi> Corn on fire, he
then made haste to come to him.
And thus it is with us, we will not
seek after God; but if he set our
Houses on fire, our bodies with
burning Fevers; when he comes,
and consumes, and scorches our
comforts, then it may be we make
haste, and seek after him. In <hi>Isa.
26. 16, LORD,</hi> (says the Prophet)
<hi>in trouble have they visited thee:
they poured out a prayer, when thy
chastening was upon them.</hi> And so
in <hi>Hos. 5. 15, In their affliction


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30334:40"/>
they will seek me early,</hi> says the
Lord by the Prophet. <hi>When they
saw their sickness, and their wound,
they sought other means:</hi> when none
would do, and their case was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,
they will then plead guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
acknowledg their offence, and
seek my face. <hi>In their affliction
they will seek me early.</hi> And so
likewise in <hi>Psal. 78. 34, When he
slew them, then they sought him,
and they returned, and enquired ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after God;</hi> Here were a people
(methinks) much of the spirit of
the people of <hi>England;</hi> when he
slew them, then they sought him,
and they returned, and enquired
early after God; early, that is in
respect of themselves, though too
late in respect of others that were
already consumed and destroyed;
early, that is, before they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30334:40"/>
were destroyed: though it
was not early absolutely, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
so; though it was late,
yet the Lord accounts it for an
early seeking.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> To enquire and seek
early after God, may have respect
to the morning of every day of our
lives, and then the duty lies thus
upon us, <hi>They that seek me early
shall find me;</hi> that is, if we seek
God in the morning, we shall find
him all the day long with us. <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the morning</hi> (says <hi>David)
will I direct my prayer unto thee,
and will look up.</hi> And in another
place (says he) <hi>I prevented the
dawning of the morning.</hi> And if
we would learn this lesson this day,
and constantly practice it, we shall
find greater advantages thereby,
than we are aware of. The Poets


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30334:41"/>
say, That <hi>Aurora Musis amica,</hi> the
morning is a friend to the Muses;
and doubtless the Saints of God
will find the morning as much a
friend to their Graces, as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
did to the Muses. <hi>When I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,</hi>
says <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 139. 18,
<hi>I am still with thee;</hi> when I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
I season my self with the
thoughts of God.</p>
            <p>3. In the <hi>3d</hi> place, and that
which doubtless is most properly
to be understood, and is especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended here is, as it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the day of our lives, and
the morning-part of that day.
Now then, you that are young,
awake betimes, improve your
morning, make use of it before it
pass away; consider seriously your
follies and neglects, what they have
been, and be ashamed: It is well for


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30334:41"/>
you that you are in the morning of
your day; look out therefore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after Jesus Christ, study to know
God betimes, study to know Jesus
Christ while you be young. In
<hi>Matt.</hi> 6. 33, The Lord Jesus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
to <hi>seek first the Kingdom of
God, and his righteousness;</hi> and
doubtless he there intends this,
namely, seeking after God and his
Kingdom in youth; do not first
seek your pleasures, do not first
seek to fulfill your lusts and vain
delights, and think it will be time
enough to seek the Kingdom of
God afterwards: No, you ought
to seek that in the first place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and above all other things
whatsoever. It is a Maxime of Hell,
<hi>Quaerenda pecunia primum, virtus
post nummos,</hi> (but the Sons and
Daughters of men are too apt to


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30334:42"/>
take it up; yea, it is their rule
they walk by) first to get an estate,
and to grow rich, and when they
have done that, then (if they can
find leisure) to serve God, and to
seek after Christ. But I say, that
it is good to begin betimes,
and so did this <hi>servant of God</hi> that
is gone to Heaven before us; she
began betimes to seek after Christ,
and hath left upon record her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enquiries after the ways of God,
after the knowledg of Christ: And
oh what an honour is it to be like
<hi>Obadiah?</hi> who says of himself,
1 <hi>Kings 18. 12, That he feared the
Lord from his youth.</hi> Children,
hear me, possibly I may never
speak to you more; Do you, as
<hi>Obadiah</hi> did, fear the Lord from
your youth. Do as <hi>Timothy</hi> did,
in your childhood; hear this Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30334:42"/>
your souls are precious and
immortal, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, It is here
said of him, that from a Child, he
had known the Holy Scriptures,
which were able to make him wise
to salvation: Oh let it be truly so
said of you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Of <hi>Information.</hi> The
folly and inadvertency of the most
of the Sons and Daughters of men,
who seek the world, serve their
lusts, pursue lying vanities, and
forget God, and seek him not. Oh
what cause have we to complain of
Children, of Parents, and Masters
of Families, how little care there
is among any of an early seeking
after Christ? Parents (generally)
teach their Children to seek pride,
to seek the lusts and pleasures of
this world, and their carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights:


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30334:43"/>
But who is there that goe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
forth early to seek the Lord?</p>
            <p>We can rise early for the world,
go from Mountain to Hill to seek
after the Profits thereof. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 11,
The Drunkard will rise early that
he may follow strong drink; the
Thief watches the twilight, but
none seek the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse 2. Exhort.</hi> To those that
have sought the Lord while they
were young, and do yet continue
to seek him, I have a word or two
to you.</p>
            <p>1. The first is, to advise you to
admire (exceedingly to admire)
the goodnefs of God to you, in
that he ever gave you hearts to
seek him: Oh wonderful grace,
that you that were born at the same
time with others, have sate under


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30334:43"/>
the same means with them that
never yet have lookt towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and their souls are now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
dropt into Hell. Oh (I say)
admire, exceedingly admire, that
God gave you, and not them, an
heart to seek after him, to mind
Christ, and Heaven, and the great
concern of your souls; and surely
you cannot but admire it, if you
consider how little of man there
was in it, and how much of man
there was against it. When did ever
a straying Sheep seek the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd?
When ever did the wild-Goats
look after one to lead them?
If Jesus Christ had not found you
first, you would never have sought
after him; if he had not found
you, you would, or could never
have found him; if he had not
took hold of your hearts, it had


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30334:44"/>
been impossible for you to lay hold
on him: It is utterly impossible for
any man in his natural estate and
condition, to seek after Jesus
Christ; this is a work that never
will or can be done, unless God
give a new heart, and a new spirit;
there wants something within to
promote and effect this work, which
God only can, and must give.</p>
            <p>2. You that have so done, you
that have sought the Lord early, I
would advise you to go on, and to
persist in seeking Christ; and as
you go on, forget not what sweet
experiences you have had of the
love and kindness of Jesus Christ,
what discoveries of light and grace,
what comforts and revivings, what
refreshing joys and delights you
have met with in your seeking of
him; these things ought not to be


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30334:44"/>
forgotten by you. And here I shall
set before you the worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a Knight of 80 years of age,
who two or three days before he
dyed, set a-part a day on purpose
to call to mind the former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
he had of God, and of what
kind, and how God had dealt with
him in his waiting upon him in his
Ordinances from time to time. And
I am informed that this <hi>dear servant</hi>
of God that is now gone, hath left
behind her a Diary written with
her own hand, what experiences
she had of God in her waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in his Ordinances; and
how, and what God had spoken to
her, and by what Ministers. And
these examples are worthy both of
your serious consideration, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
excellent patterns for your imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:30334:45"/>
3. You that have so done, you
that have sought God and Christ
early, I would advise you to go
on in seeking the Lord till you
have found him in his glory: As
you have in your seeking, found
him in a way of grace here; so go
on (I say) till you have found
him in his glory hereafter, what
darkness and difficulties soever lye
in the way of your waiting upon
him in his Ordinances and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
that you may be like the
Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> and that it
may be truly said of you, as it is
said of that Church; <hi>Rev. 2. 19,
I know thy works, and charity, and
service, and faith, and thy patience,
and thy works, and thy last to be
more than the first.</hi> This Testimony
Christ himself gives concerning this
Church. The nearer you come to


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30334:45"/>
Christ, and to enjoyment of him
in glory, the more haste you should
make; every thing in nature does
so; a Stone, the nearer it comes to
the center, the swifter is its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And the Sun seems to move
swiftest, when it is near setting:
Trees of Gods planting, bring
forth more fruit in old age. <hi>Psal.
92. 13, 14, Those that are planted
in the house of the Lord, shall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the Courts of our God. They
shall still bring forth fruit in old age:
they shall be fat and flourishing.</hi> See
<hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 29, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>2. I have a word of advice to
them (if there be any such here)
that are full of days, and it may
be full of the world; but empty,
very empty, of the knowledg of
God, and have had little, or it
may be no acquaintaince at all


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30334:46"/>
with Jesus Christ, nor did ever
look after any. We may perhaps
say, as <hi>Job</hi> said, <hi>Job 12. 12, 13,
With the ancient is wisdom; and
in length of days, understanding.
With him is wisdom and strength,
he hath counsel and understanding.</hi>
But is it always so? Is there wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and understanding always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the aged? Be there not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them such, as are like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim?</hi>
of whom it is said, <hi>Hos. 7.
9, 10, Gray hairs are here and there
upon him, yet he knoweth it not.
And the pride of Israel testifieth to
his face, and they do not return to
the Lord their God, nor seek him for
all this.</hi> They do not consider the
grave, whither they are going.
Be there not careless men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
among us, that do not yet
look out after Christ? that do not


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30334:46"/>
provide for the welfare of their
souls, but are <hi>cumbred about many
things,</hi> as <hi>Martha</hi> was? Yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
aged men and aged women, who
have lived all their days pudling
in, and about the world, and
worldly concerns, and have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
neglected <hi>the one thing necessary,
viz.</hi> seeking after Christ, and the
knowledg of him, and to get an
interest in him. Do you not yet
know, that you are going to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the Judgment-seat of
Christ? And will you not yet come
off from this world, but the longer
you live, you will love the world
so much the better? Is it not high
time, that something of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of another world should
interpose between your life and
your death? I shall offer you only
two or three considerations in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to this,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:30334:47"/>
1. And first, I would beseech
you, and perswade you, as I would
be perswaded my self, That seeing
you have hitherto neglected your
souls, your precious and immortal
souls, your spiritual (which are
your greatest) concernments till
now you are grown old, I would
perswade you, yea, even beseech you
to consider, that now you have but
a little time left to do your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
work; you have now but one
hour. In <hi>Matt.</hi> 20. 6, it is said,
that <hi>Christ went out about the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
hour,</hi> (when there was but
one hour more to night) <hi>to hire
labourers into his vineyard.</hi> So it
is with you, it is the eleventh
hour, your last hour. Besides,
have you no eyes, no ears, to see,
and hear, that many dye dayly and
weekly? how many goodly plants,


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30334:47"/>
(that God had planted in his own
house) have of late been plucked
up by the roots, and laid in their
Graves? yea, every day the death
of young and old do ring a peal in
our ears, to awaken us to consider
what is to come; And will not
Conscience it self (think you)
ring a dreadful peal in our ears,
when we come to dye, for that
neither a voice from the Grave, nor
yet a voice from the Temple, have
yet prevailed with us to seek, and
secure to our selves an interest in
God and in Christ? Younger per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
than our selves are often taken
away, and may we not thereby see
and read that death it self is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to teach us all to be prepared
and in readiness for this our great
change? Death lies (as it were)
in Ambuscado for us, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30334:48"/>
men are taken away by it in
the field, and sometimes at home,
sometimes by this, and sometimes
by that disease; but death comes
to old age, <hi>aperto marte,</hi> in the
plain and open field (as it were);
and old men and old women can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine that death is many
days march from them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they (of all persons) had need
to seek after God, and an interest in
Christ night and day; seek after this
in your Houses, in your Closets, in
your Beds, in his Ordinances; yea,
where-ever he is to be found, and
not to give over seeking, till (with
the Spouse before mentioned) you
have found him.</p>
            <p>2. Consider how Christ calls on
you in the Text. Read the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Chapter, <hi>Doth not wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
cry? and understanding put


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30334:48"/>
forth her voice?</hi> vers. 1. From
whence? <hi>She standeth in the top of
high places, by the way in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the paths,</hi> vers. 2. <hi>She cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at the gates, at the entry of the
city, at the coming in at the doors,</hi>
vers. 3. To whom doth she cry?
<hi>Vnto you, O men, I call, and my
voice is to the sons of men,</hi> vers. 4.
What doth she call to them for?
That they would come and seek
wisdom of Christ, that they would
come and get understanding of
him, that they would come and
get knowledg of him, which is
wisdom indeed; <hi>The fear of the
Lord, that is wisdom indeed.</hi> Doth
Christ thus call, and will you not
regard, nor answer this call? What
then will be his next call? For
ought I know it may be this,
Arise from the dead, and come


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30334:49"/>
to judgment. Consider this.</p>
            <p>3. And Lastly, Consider your
grand inducement and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>They that seek me early, shall
find me:</hi> They that will yet seek
him, that is your early, and God
acconnts it so. In <hi>Psal. 78. 34, When
he slew them, then they sought him,
and they returned, and enquired
early after God.</hi> While grace is
proclaimed, while God says,
<hi>They that seek me early, shall find
me;</hi> This (I say) is your early,
and that which God himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
so; and will God yet be
found of you, if you seek him?
Oh! what cause have you to bless
God, that ever he made such a
promise as this, which is, <hi>Tabula
post naufragium.</hi> And that in <hi>Isa.
55. 6, 7, Seek ye the Lord while he,
may be found; call upon him while


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30334:49"/>
he is near.</hi> Oh wonderful grace!
that such promises should be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to you and me! <hi>I love them
that love me; and those that seek me
early shall find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I shall no longer be
burdensom to you, but shall beg
of you Children, for whom I have
provided a few words, a short Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
To hearken to your own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi>
or, <hi>a short Sermon to young ones:</hi>
Children seek the Lord <hi>early,</hi>
whiles you are yet tender and
young. The <hi>Children</hi> of their <hi>dear
deceased Mother,</hi> should hear her
always saying what the Lord said
to her, <hi>They that seek me early,
shall find me.</hi> O little Children!
you lye much upon my heart, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your Creator in the days of


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30334:50"/>
your youth,</hi> and seek him betimes,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
            <p>1. Consider you must dye, <hi>It
is appointed to all men once to dye,
Heb.</hi> 9. 27. And you may dye
whiles you are Children. How
many pretty little ones are every
day taken away before your eyes?
And if you be snatcht away by the
cold hand of death, before you
know God, and have found Christ,
what will become of your precious
and immortal souls? Would you
be willing to dye, and be <hi>damn'd?</hi>
Would you leave this world, and
be content to be turn'd into <hi>Hell,</hi>
and be punished with the <hi>Devil</hi>
and his <hi>Angels?</hi> Can you think of
losing your Friends, and your God
too for ever?</p>
            <p>2. Consider what was the great
errand upon which God sent you


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30334:50"/>
into the world? Not to gratifie
your <hi>Lusts,</hi> nor to pursue <hi>lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;</hi>
but <hi>to know God, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</hi> And will you, dare you
neglect your special work? O!
whiles you are in your prime, mind
what you have to do for your souls.
Can you think it reasonable, that
the Devil should have your youth,
the flower and strength of your
days, and God be serv'd only with
a crazy body, or the rottenness of
old Age?</p>
            <p>O, then, delay no longer, but
seek the Lord. And.</p>
            <p>1. Do it speedily, the <hi>Manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers</hi>
must go forth betimes,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 21, so must the <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seekers,</hi>
before the Sun be up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the heat of youthful lusts, or
earthly cares, hinder your diligent
seeking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:30334:51"/>
2. <hi>Do it in earnest, with all
your hearts:</hi> Psal. 119. 2, Blessed
are they that keep his testimonies,
that seek him with their whole heart.</p>
            <p>3. Resolve to seek the Lord
till you find him in glory; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
while your Father, Mother, or
Friends live, but as long as you
live. It was a sad story in <hi>Gen.
35.</hi> 19, That <hi>Rachel dyed, when
she was but a little way from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrath:</hi>
But more sad, <hi>Luk. 13.
24,</hi> When <hi>many shall seek to enter
into Heaven, and not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Consider, That if you seek
him early, you shall be sure to find
him; I would bespeak you, as</hi>
David <hi>did his young</hi> Solomon,
1 Chron. 28. 9, And thou Solomon,
my son, know thou the God of thy
Father, and serve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
heart, and with a willing mind:


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30334:51"/>
for the Lord searcheth all hearts,
and understandeth all the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the thoughts: if thou seek
him, he will be found of thee; but
if thou forsake him, he will cast thee
off for ever. <hi>It was a very serious
speech of</hi> Azariah <hi>to</hi> Asa, <hi>and to
all</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Benjamin, 2 Chron.
15. 2, The Lord is with you, while
you be with him; and if you seek
him, he will be found of you: but
if you forsake him, he will forsake
you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But what shall we do to
seek him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If you will seek, you must
forsake sin, and <hi>flee youthful lusts,
2 Tim.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
            <p>1. Especially take heed of lying,
that's the Devils chain, by which
he holds poor Children from Christ;
Lies are the refuge of guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30334:52"/>
folly, where the inconsiderate
youth hides himself from man, and
is kept from God; as <hi>Adam,</hi> when
he knew he was naked, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7,
sewed Fig-leaves together; a poor
shift to hide his nakedness! so the
sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> when they become
guilty, make Lies their covert;
and instead of seeking, fly further
from God, and bring a double
guilt and punishment upon their
heads.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Beware of Pride; the wanton
youth is like the wild Asses Colt,
or as</hi> Jer. 2. 23, 24, The swift
Dromedary traversing her ways, or a
wild Ass used to the wilderness, that
snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure.
<hi>The souls not seeking God, is
charged upon his Pride,</hi> Psal. 10.
4, The wicked through the pride of
his countenance <hi>(his looks testifie


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30334:52"/>
his pride)</hi> will not seek after God,
God is not in all his thoughts.</p>
            <p>3. Be not of a stubborn or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
spirit to the counsels of
Parents and Teachers; but hearken
to their instruction. It is the most
sad and certain presage of the ruine
of your souls, if you refuse the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and early advice of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and spiritual Fathers. That's
a dreadful saying, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25,
concerning <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, <hi>They heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
not unto the voice of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because the Lord would slay
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Go read the Scriptures; the
Eunuch found Christ there, and
<hi>Augustine</hi> found him there while
he was reading <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. Go,
ask your Teachers, and they will
direct you in the way; go hence
into your corners, and weep, and


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30334:53"/>
pray, and God will come to you;
and when you hear the word
Preacht, mind what is spoken to
you; it is God that speaketh, whom
you should seek.</p>
            <p>4. Consider, If you will seek the
Lord early, you will lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of your own peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
living and dying; O how
may you prevent the sighs, the
groans, the repentings, the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akings
that have fill'd up our days,
for want of an early seeking after
God: What a comfort was this to
our dying Friend, as also to her sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
Friends and Relations, That
<hi>She did, and could truly say, that she
began to know God betimes, and her
great preparation-work for death</hi> (to
use her own words) <hi>was not now to
do:</hi> And as that was your comfort
then, so let it be your Copy now.


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30334:53"/>
What a great advantage was that
to <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 71. 17, 18, That
when he was old, he could plead
an old acquaintance with God? <hi>O
Lord, thou hast taught me from my
youth.</hi> Now also <hi>when I am old,
and gray-headed (O God) forsake
me not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things more I would brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew you.</p>
            <p>1. What will be the difference
between them that made it their
business early to seek the Lord, and
them that sought him not, or sought
him too late; and that with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to eternity, in a dying hour?</p>
            <p>2. Whence that difference doth
arise?</p>
            <p>1. What will be the difference
betwixt Saints and Sinners, with
respect to death at last?</p>
            <p>1. The wicked and ungodly


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30334:54"/>
sinner, that would seek the world,
his own pleasure and sinful lusts;
When he comes to dye, Conscience
rings a dreadful peal, and makes
him cry out in the bitterness of his
soul, Alas! Friend, I must dye,
<hi>Animula, vagula, blandula, quos nunc
ad ibis locos?</hi> Poor flitting, dear
departing soul, whither art thou
going? Christ is an enemy, God is
a stranger, I have no friend to save
me, I must be damn'd, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
I am undone for ever.</p>
            <p>But the dying Saint, when he hath
the sentence of death in him, hath
the hopes of life before him; I must
dye (says he) O welcom Death,
<hi>I am now going to enjoy him whom
I have loved; to possess him whom
I have sought</hi> (as this precious Saint
said to me a little before her death,
<hi>I know whom I have trusted) I am


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30334:54"/>
my Beloveds, and my Beloved is
mine,</hi> says the Believer, Now shall
I ever be with the Lord.</p>
            <p>2. The careless sinner that would
not seek the Lord, when he comes
to dye, bids a doleful adieu to all
his comforts; farwel Friends, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
pleasures and delights, for
ever, I shall never see a good day
more.</p>
            <p>But he that sought the Lord while
he liv'd, when he comes to dye, says,
Behold, I dye, now farwel troubles,
temptations, sin, and sorrow for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
I am lanching forth into a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
eternity, I shall never see a
sad day more.</p>
            <p>3. The wilful sinner, when he
is about to dye, (after all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
he hath slighted, and now time
shall be no more) cries out with
horrour, I have for ever lost my


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30334:55"/>
opportunities of seeking God, it is
now too late, I am left to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
howlings.</p>
            <p>But the gracious Soul, who hath
sought, and found God in seeking,
when he is about to dye, looks
back with delight upon all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
wherein he hath many
times met with Christ, and found
God nigh to his soul, and says, I
am going where I shall need Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
no more, but God shall be
all in all; I am going to mine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
rest, to an everlasting Sabbath-keeping
in Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. Whence doth that difference
arise? From the wisdom of the
one, and foolish inadvertency, or
rather obstinacy of the other; one
knew his season, and did the things
that did belong to his peace; the
other had his season, but knew it


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30334:55"/>
not, and now his misery is great
upon him; one sought after Christ,
that he might have an interest in
him, and make God his friend; the
other refused Christ, and now God
is his enemy, and so death is to him
<hi>the King of terrors:</hi> But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
soul can (to allude to that
in <hi>Isa. 11. 8,) play upon the hole of
the Asp, and put his hand on the
Cockatrice Den;</hi> and when the pains
of an irksom disease are upon him,
and pangs of death before him, he
says, all these rackings and grievous
aches, be but like the ratling of
the Charriot-wheels that <hi>Joseph</hi>
sent to fetch his Father and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to him; and all his wearisom
waking nights, be to him as the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of <hi>Achor,</hi> or door of Hope.</p>
            <p>1. Because he knows death is no
death to him, but a passage unto a


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30334:56"/>
glorious life with God, whom <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
hath sought and serv'd all his days
he is but going unto his Beloved
the Lord Jesus, who is gone <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
way before him.</p>
            <p>2. Because he looks on the Grave
not as his Prison, but a bed of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
or rather the Saints Tyring-Room,
where they throw off mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
to put on immortality; and
lay aside corruption, to put on
incorruption.</p>
            <p>I thought here to have spoken
a word to the nearest Friends and
Relations of this deceased Saint, to
let them see how little cause they
have to mourn and to afflict their
souls; but the Lord, who knows
how to speak comfort infinitely
better, hath been with their hearts.
Only let not the Husband grieve,


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30334:56"/>
and say, Ah! what a dear Wife
have I lost! nor the Children say,
what a dear Mother have we lost!
But rather,</p>
            <p>1. Consider, What she hath
found; She hath found that, which
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he hath been seeking all her days;
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he hath found that God, that
Christ, that Heaven, that Bosom,
and those embraces that she waited
and long'd for.</p>
            <p>3. Consider, You will never be
happy till you be where she is
gone before you.</p>
            <p>3. Consider, It is but a very
little while and you shall see her
again; as <hi>Augustine</hi> comforted his
<hi>Italica</hi> concerning her dead Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and let you, and I, and all
of us mind our work, and be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our march towards Heaven, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our encouragement from the


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30334:57"/>
Text, where the Lords makes a
proclamation of Grace, <hi>I love them
that love me; and those that seek
me early, shall find me.</hi>

            <p>NOW though the Husband
of our <hi>Deceased Friend</hi> has
been somewhat averse from
publishing any thing of her own;
yet being at last prevail'd upon, I
shall commend to the <hi>Reader</hi> some
particular <hi>Experiences</hi> of the Lords
<hi>early</hi> dealing with her soul, as I
have found them written by her
own hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, I find this Position laid
down by her in her own Book,</hi> viz.
That very many Scriptures do imply a
possibility, that a believer may know
that he is elected of God, and that
his election is of free grace through
our Lord Jesus Christ unto holiness,
which shall end in glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12,


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:30334:58"/>
13. 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 10. with
very many more, which I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to mention.</p>
            <p>On which ground she proceeds
to take a particular account of
her own spiritual estate, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>IT hath been much upon my
thoughts to write some of those
<hi>Scriptural Experiences</hi> which I have
found and received great comfort
in from the Word of God; being,
as I judg, brought home to my
soul, by the Spirit: And being
now past the Fortieth year of my
age, not knowing how soon the
Lord may call, having always had
a desire to be on my watch, that I
may be found ready and willing
when ever my Lords time is (This


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:30334:58"/>
Mercy I have been begging many
years).</p>
            <p>I can truly say, for some Months
past I have had no rest in my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
till I began to write these
things; and after fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by my self, while in doubt
what to do, fearing the falsness of
my own heart, I was encouraged
by a Sermon that I heard on these
words in <hi>Psal. 77. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the works of the Lord; surely
I will remember thy wonders of old.</hi>
Where was much pressed the duty
of Christians, To relate what God
had done for them.</p>
            <p>And out of the longing desire
I have for the good of you my
<hi>dear Little ones,</hi> that you may va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the precious Word of God
wherein your <hi>Mother</hi> hath found
so much comfort; you two, that


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:30334:59"/>
is, <hi>SA.</hi> and <hi>MA.</hi> are the only rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that God hath spared (and
blessed be God that hath left us as
to this day a Berry or two): You
are the children of many prayers;
the Lord grant you may be blessed
with all spiritual blessings in
Christ Jesus; and make you ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
while you live, and fit
you for an inheritance among the
Saints in light. In order to that, I
beg you in the name and fear of
God, that you highly prize the
Word of God, and every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Jesus Christ appointed
in his Word: I would say with
<hi>David, Come my Children, hearken
unto me, and I will tell you what
he hath done for my soul,</hi> Psal. 34.
11. Psal. 66. 16. I have found the
Word read and preached, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Scripture that I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:30334:59"/>
I read or heard preached
on; yet it hath pleased my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
God to send many a word
to relieve and comfort my soul:
his word hath been to me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
word, a reproving, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing,
and a very comforting
word, and that my soul knoweth
by great experience.</p>
            <p>I intend, if the Lord permit,
and will send his Spirit to bring
things to my remembrance (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that I can do nothing) to set
down the kindness of the Lord
from my Childhood, that was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to begin with me be-times. <hi>O
the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledg of God,</hi> &amp;c.
Rom. 11. 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
            <p>I can remember, while a Girl at
school, about the age of nine or
ten, I took great delight in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30334:60"/>
the stories in the Scripture,
which did much affect me. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
I was more taken with the
<hi>New Testament,</hi> that did reveal more
of Christ to me. Then I began
to pray as I was able. I do not
remember, that I ever did make
use of any written or printed
form.</p>
            <p>The first sin that I remember
troubled me, was telling my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a lye; and it had this aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
with it, that he told me, If
I would tell him how it was, he
would believe me rather than my
Brothers and Sisters; and out of
fear of them, I said as they did;
but with a very trembling heart,
which much troubled me some
years after this, when I begun to
hearken to the word Preached,
where I heard that sin set out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:30334:60"/>
I was much affected, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much under the sense of sin;
seeing a burden in it, I desired to
look after a remedy.</p>
            <p>The first Minister that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I hearkned to, was Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
of <hi>Kensington,</hi> where my Father
was, in the summer. I did then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to understand my state by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
how under the wrath and
curse of God. Then I began to
see my need of, and did desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Jesus Christ, being, as I thought
then, willing to take him on his
own terms. Jesus Christ was then,
as I thought, precious to me; and
being willing to understand my
own case and condition, it pleased
the Lord to open my heart, to
hearken diligently to the word
Preached, wherein I found much
comfort, which ingaged my heart


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30334:61"/>
unto the Lord, and made me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to neglect any duty which
he commanded, or to commit any
sin which the Lord forbids. This
I well remember to be the frame
of my spirit near thirty years ago.</p>
            <p>Hearing much, that it was the
end of life to glorfie God, it made
the earnest breathings of my soul
to be this; Oh, but how shall I
glorifie God!</p>
            <p>After this, by a Providence I
heard Mr. <hi>M.</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
my Father being there for some
months; he was on that Scripture,
2 <hi>Chron. 15. 17. Nevertheless the
heart of Asa was perfect all his
days.</hi> I took great delight to hear
him, being often angry he had
done so soon. My soul was much
refreshed by the signs and marks
he gave of a perfect heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:30334:61"/>
I did usually go from hearing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Chamber, and beg earnestly
of God for a perfect heart, in
which as I thought, I saw more of
value, than in any injoyments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
it was what did concern my
spiritual estate.</p>
            <p>I begun to be much troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
how such a poor sinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that was by natnre under the
wrath and curse of God, should es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
this. I did believe as I had been
taught, it was by a Redeemer; I did
also believe that there was no name
given under Heaven, by which I
must be saved, but the Lord Christ
Jesus. I did also much hearken to the
tenders of Christ in the Gospel, and
how he invited sinners to himself,
and that he offered himself freely:
this gave me encouragement. But
as I had read and heard it was a


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:30334:62"/>
strait gate, and a narrow way, few
that find it: this made me very
careful, lest I should be deceived.</p>
            <p>And here came in the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
But how shall I know that
God in Christ will accept me?
<hi>For many are called, but few cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen;</hi>
God hath mercy on whom he
will, and <hi>it is not of him that will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
nor of him that runneth, but
of God that sheweth mercy.</hi> This
made me very diligent to hearken
to marks and signs of grace.</p>
            <p>The first that I remember trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
me, was this; understanding
it was the common lot of all Gods
People, <hi>through many afflictions to
enter into heaven:</hi> This did much
trouble me at that time, and I was
apt to think I should be able to
bear any thing that God would
lay on me, so it might evidence


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30334:62"/>
to me the love of God to my soul:
but fool that I was! I judged too
soon; for when it pleased the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
God to try me, I quickly saw
that my strength was but small, by
my fainting so much as I did in a
day of adversity, which by many
sad experiences I can shew, how
unable to bear any thing when try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
However then I thought I
could bear any thing from with
out, so all might be well within.</p>
            <p>After this, by a Providence, I
came to hear Mr. <hi>V.</hi> at St. <hi>Olaves;</hi>
the first Sermon that I heard him,
was on these words, <hi>And all the
things thou canst desire, are not to
be compared unto her,</hi> Prov. 3. 15.
Wherein was set out the value of
Jesus Christ above all that the
world afforded, which very much
wrought on my heart, with great


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30334:63"/>
longing after this Christ; but still
came this question, <hi>How shall you
know your interest?</hi> However, it
pleased God so to bless his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
to me, that usually I found my
doubts so resolved, and my heart
so opened, that I went away with
great joy and comfort; but for all
this I was perplexed with dreadful
thoughts; after I had such peace and
joy, then Satan begun to work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
<hi>I, but is there such a God,
and such a Christ to be believed in?</hi>
How to answer this temptation, I
was at a great loss, and would tell
none what did ail me; I mourned
much under it, and thought, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
whether there was a God
or no; yet then I did not neglect
praying, and did as it were pour
out my soul daily unto God for
victory, that he would not give me


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30334:63"/>
up to an unbelieving heart, and of
his free-grace (who knew my soul
in adversity) by his word to send
me relief.</p>
            <p>Going to hear on a Lecture-day,
he then Preached on these words,
<hi>Hos. 2. 7. I will go and return to my
first husband, for then was it better
with me than now.</hi> It pleased God
so to order it, that he gave great
caution against such thoughts, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Take heed, poor soul, when the
Devil casteth in such thoughts: Is
there a God, or a Christ? Take heed,
for then Satan will have you in his
snare.</hi> This, with many other things
was set home on my heart; then
he did convince me, by appealing
to the Saints experience, <hi>Is it not
better to entertain good thoughts of
God, and of Christ? was it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with you then, than now?</hi> The


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30334:64"/>
Lord gave me so to close in with
the truth of that word, that I had
great joy and peace through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
and went home full of
comfort, that God had so met me
with a word. By that means it
pleased the Lord to give check to
those unbelieving thoughts that so
overcame me.</p>
            <p>And yet to this day, I have great
cause to mourn, for that unbelief
I find in my heart, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the experiences that God
hath given me; that Scripture doth
often reprove me, <hi>Heb. 3. 12. Take
heed, lest there be in any of you an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
heart of unbelief, in departing
from the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this I kept waiting at the
posts of Wisdoms gate, that I might
understand the state of my soul,
which was the one thing necessary


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30334:64"/>
that I desired to look after; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the word Preached, that the
usual way and method of God,
was to strike the soul down, as he
did them in the second of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
and the Jaylor, and the like; this
did raise in me great doubts what
to think of my self, because I could
not find in my self such convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of, and humiliation for sin, as
was pressed; and as to Original sin,
it did not seem much to affect me;
this did bring me into great fears:
However, I took that way I had
found comfort in, which was by
prayer to the Lord, to bless his
word to me. Mr. <hi>V.</hi> was then
on this Text, <hi>Ephes. 2. 8. By grace
are ye saved through faith, and that
not of your selves, it is the gift of
God.</hi> To this I diligently hearken'd,
and received great support, for all


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:30334:65"/>
my objections seemed to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
yet for all this I did as it
were refuse to be comforted: he
being on signs of grace, closed the
Text with these two marks: 1. <hi>A
souls going on in a way of duty,
was a very hopeful sign. 2. But
the Spirit of God was the only
infallible witness: the spirit it self
beareth witness with our spirit,
that we are the Children of God.</hi>
The first did comfort me, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
did very much trouble me;
for I could not understand the
meaning of the spirits witness,
which fearing lest I should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in a matter of so great a
concern, made me give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in reading and hearing,
that my doubts might be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
but as yet no rest in my
spirit: and the more increased,


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30334:65"/>
being the time to go into the
Country, where usually our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was; this added much to my
grief to be taken off from hearing
Mr. <hi>V.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I began to look more into the
Scriptures, and to pick up what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
did come suddenly into my
mind; and it pleased God to cast
in many that seemed to comfort
me, which I wrote down in that
year.</p>
            <p>But then came this question,
These are marks and signs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to such and such Saints in
Scripture: But what is this to thee?
These thoughts much cast me
down; what to do I knew not, but
kept still praying and waiting on
God, and I found speedy relief,
when I least thought of it. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being at <hi>Hammersmith,</hi> I went


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:30334:66"/>
constantly to hear there, and that
Summer several City-Ministers did
supply the place; and among the
rest, I heard Mr. <hi>G.</hi> on these words,
<hi>Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast
the words of eternal life, Joh.</hi> 6. 68.
As I remember, this was his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>That soul that had once given
up it self to, could never bear a going
off from Jesus Christ.</hi> His arguing
thus with a doubting soul; <hi>Try thy
self; cannot you bear a leaving of
God? then doubt not that he will
leave you: would you know whether
God loves you? consider, do you
love God? for you could not love him,
unless he loved you first.</hi> By these
and several arguments, the Lord
was pleased so to set it home on my
heart; I may well forget the words,
my heart being so full of peace
and joy through believing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30334:66"/>
that I cannot express it, being
as I judg, better felt than exprest;
it did seem at that time to me, as
if I had tasted of that <hi>joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and full of glory.</hi> I know not
what to make of it, except it were
a <hi>sealing unto the day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
I thought then my joy being
so great, I could willingly have
gone out of the body, to have been
with the Lord. I remember I went
home and fell on my knees, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the freeness of grace to such
a worm as I; crying out with the
Apostle, <hi>O the depth!</hi> The sense
of free-grace and rich mercy did
much overcome me; the which, I
hope, I shall admire to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
O the goodness of God! when
I had again and again refused to be
comforted, yet he waited to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to me! This I write and


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30334:67"/>
speak, that God the <hi>Father,</hi> and
God the <hi>Son,</hi> and God the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> may have the glory of their
own work.</p>
            <p>When under my doubts and
fears, I seldom went to hear, but
the word did seem to speak unto
me; and several Scriptures came
suddenly to my mind, that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
and quiet, and comfort me,
such as these, <hi>Why art thou cast
down, O my soul? and why art
thou disquieted within me? hope
in God, for I shall yet praise him.</hi>
This hath been made good unto
me; and that in the <hi>Psalm; In
the multitude of my thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me, thy comforts delight my soul;</hi>
and that <hi>it is good for me to draw
near to God,</hi> Psal. 73. 28. And
that <hi>a day in thy courts is better
than a thousand,</hi> Psal. 84. 10. And


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30334:67"/>
I can truly say as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I had
rather be a door-keeper in the house of
my God, than to dwell in tents of
wickedness.</hi> Experienced I have that
of <hi>Job, I have esteemed thy word more
than my necessary food, Job</hi> 23. 12.
I have had great support from that
Scripture, <hi>All that the Father giveth
me, shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me, I will in no wise cast
out,</hi> Joh. 6. 37. I have often thought
of that Scripture with joy, <hi>Lord,
how is it that thou wilt manifest thy
self unto me, and not unto the world?
for who maketh thee differ from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
and what hast thou that thou
didst not receive?</hi> I have again and
again in these words, and many
more, admired freeness of grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
such a poor doubting soul as
I was; I doubt not, but he which
hath begun, will finish his own


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30334:68"/>
work on <hi>Sarah Lye.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have written a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the first 20 years of my age,
what was the great thing that most
troubled me; it was, That I might
have assurance of the love of God,
and a well-grounded hope of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christ; that what the Lord
Jesus had done and suffered, might
be applied unto me; and having
hopes through grace, and rejoycing
much in hopes of the glory of God,
<hi>which hope maketh not ashamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this I began to have great
tryals, as to the loss of my relations;
my Parents; that were very dear
to me, both dying within four
Months; this with many more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
much cast me down; yet to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Providences of God to me,
and how by his word he sent me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30334:68"/>
experiences, should I set
it down in order, would swell to a
great Volume.</p>
            <p>Only thus much I may speak to
the praise of God, that when Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother forsook, God
took me into his care, and hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
provided for me, and hath
given me an <hi>Agurs</hi> portion, which
I beg'd of the Lord when but a
Girl: I can truly say, <hi>All the ways
of the Lord are, and have been to
me mercy and truth:</hi> For this God I
have chosen to be my God, for ever
and ever; and I doubt not, but he
will be my guide even unto death.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Child, or
Children, that shall read of this way
and method that the Lord did use
in bringing me off from all things
to himself, take heed, pray, take
heed you <hi>do not limit the holy One


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:30334:69"/>
of Israel;</hi> nor tye up God to this,
or any way of working; the Lord
worketh all things after the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of his own will: but we are
commanded to <hi>search our hearts, and
try our ways, and to examine our selves,
and to give all diligence to make our
calling and election sure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look that the work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be wrought, and leave time and
way to the All-wise God, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
the world, and orders all
things, to whom be glory for ever
and ever, <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I have written in these
few sheets, is not out of any book
but that of my own <hi>conscience;</hi> no
assister, but the <hi>spirit;</hi> and to no
end, but <hi>that God in all things may
have glory,</hi> for I will not dare to
speak of any of those things which
Christ hath not wrought in me.</p>
