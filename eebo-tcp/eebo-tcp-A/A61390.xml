            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102503:7"/>It is clear, that there are divers <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods</hi> in the life of Man, which are like so many <hi>Stages</hi> in the <hi>Race</hi> which is set before us. Herein we have some light in the Holy <hi>Scriptures.</hi> In <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where <hi>One Interval</hi> of time is, from a <hi>Month</hi> to <hi>Five</hi> years of Age; a <hi>Second,</hi> from <hi>Five</hi> years of Age to <hi>Twenty;</hi> a <hi>Third</hi> from <hi>twenty</hi> to <hi>sixty;</hi> and the <hi>last</hi> from <hi>sixty</hi> to the <hi>end of Life.</hi> And mens <hi>Strength</hi> and Ability, at least in those <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> may be collected from their <hi>Valuation,</hi> which is there adjusted by <hi>God</hi> himself. Humane <hi>Authors</hi> have variously divided the Life of <hi>Man.</hi> Some into <hi>Four</hi> parts, answering the <hi>four</hi> parts of the <hi>Year; Spring, Summer, Autumn,</hi> and <hi>Winter. Others</hi> into <hi>Seven;</hi> assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <hi>ing</hi> each part of it to a different <hi>Planet;</hi> and so <hi>Old-age</hi> to <hi>Saturn.</hi> But Man's <hi>Age</hi> seems most fitly to be distributed into, 1. His <hi>Growing.</hi> 2. His <hi>Ripe</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, and 3. His <hi>Decaying</hi> Age.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>First</hi> of these; we need not be so Critical, as to begin it at his Conception, or <hi>Quickning</hi> in the Womb, tho he doth then begin to live and to grow; sith the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> above-said makes no reckoning of his Age, until he be a <hi>Month</hi> old.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102503:7"/>
Leaving therefore that State of <hi>Non-age,</hi> we may distinguish his <hi>Growing</hi> Age in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Infancy, Child-hood</hi> and <hi>Youth. Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> ends when we begin to go and speak. <hi>Child-hood</hi> reacheth to the fourteenth or fifteenth year; and <hi>Youth</hi> lasts to Twenty five. Unto these years we usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in Strength or Stature. Not but that some particular Persons, or in some <hi>Countries</hi> do ripen sooner; and also that <hi>Females</hi> are reckon'd to attain to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Stage of their <hi>Growing</hi> Age, <hi>two</hi> years sooner, and to the <hi>third</hi> Stage, <hi>four</hi> years sooner than the <hi>Males;</hi> yet still the foresaid Computation agrees with the nobler Sex, and comprehends the Generality of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ripe</hi> Age of Man follows, when the <hi>Parts</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> and the <hi>Powers</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> are come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

in causing so noble a creature to tarry so short a time in the world, and to grow old as soon as he begins to grow ripe; And <hi>Others</hi> as wisely concluded, that Men were sent into this world on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their Punishment, for crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>others Bodies</hi> before.

If a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Architect</hi> should frame and rear up a firm and stately pile of <hi>Building,</hi> and being compleatly furnished, the same should presently shrink, and in a short time decay and fall to the ground; Passengers would be apt to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the <hi>sidelity</hi> or <hi>skill</hi> of him that made it; or exceedingly wonder by what means it came to ruine, till they come to know, that the <hi>Inhabitant</hi> himself undermin'd, pluck'd down, or fir'd his own house: So in the <hi>Case</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, it is matter of grief and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to see the most exquisite piece of Gods workmanship upon earth, to become decrepit in so short a space, and to be reduc'd so soon into <hi>dust and ashes.</hi>

There is according to the Old Philosophy, a certain Native Heat and Radical Moisture ingenerated in all mankind at their Conception, whereby Life is preserved: The one is like the <hi>Flame,</hi> the other like the <hi>Orl</hi> that feeds it. Diseases and Disasters are like a <hi>Thief</hi> in the Candle, that makes it wast the sooner: but if no such thing happen, yet the Lamp will consume, and at last extinguish.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Unwholsome Air.</hi> For the <hi>Air,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the constant Food of the <hi>Vital</hi> parts, must needs contribute much to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair or Decay of the <hi>Body;</hi> and the more impure it is, must consequently impair and weaken it. Hence and from the Corruption of <hi>Food</hi> it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102503:17"/>
that the Age of Man, after the <hi>Deluge</hi> became so much diminished; insomuch as <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> who was the <hi>first-born</hi> in the <hi>New World,</hi> lived scarce half so long as those before the <hi>Flood;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 27. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 13. the Air being now become more impure and unwholsome, than it was before. However it is most evident, that people do commonly at this day grow weak, crazy and impotent, who live in those places, which mourn under a malignant <hi>Air;</hi> and others are fresh and lusty at the same years, that injoy the blessing of a purer breathing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Diseases</hi> are another <hi>Cause</hi> that brings on <hi>Old-age.</hi> For these must needs weaken that strength of Nature, whereby our life is supported, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 11. <hi>When thou with rebukes dost correct man for Iniquity, thou makest his Beauty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume away like a Moth:</hi> and not only his <hi>Beauty,</hi> but his <hi>Strength</hi> and Spirits, for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> runs there,—<hi>Thou makest that which is desirable in him to melt away.</hi> And thus it was with holy <hi>Iob.

And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by reason of <hi>sickness</hi> complains, <hi>Mine Age is departed,</hi> and <hi>is removed from me as a Shepherds Tent,</hi> Isa. 38. 12. Thus the <hi>Lord</hi> doth sometimes <hi>weaken a mans strength in the way, and shortneth his days,</hi> Psal. 102. 23. implying, that a mans life is like a <hi>Iourney</hi> through this into a another World; now by <hi>Diseases</hi> he <hi>weakens us in the way,</hi> as we are travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through the World, causes us to commence <hi>Old per saltum,</hi> and shortens our days: so that by this means, some have but a <hi>winters day</hi> of life, while others injoy a <hi>longer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Another <hi>Cause</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens Old age, is, <hi>immoderate Care or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> Each of these, when they exceed a due proportion, do exhaust the Spirits,

Great indeed is mens folly thus to ruin themselves; sith it is certain that neither our immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>cares,</hi> nor our immoderate <hi>labour,</hi> do us any good at all: less <hi>Care</hi> and more <hi>Prayer</hi> would avail us much more; yea, and they do us much hurt, they disquiet the Mind, they disturb the Body, they provoke <hi>God</hi> to leave us to our selves; and then we shall soon find, that it is <hi>vain to rise early,</hi> to <hi>sit up late,</hi> and <hi>to eat the Bread of Sorrow:</hi> whereas the <hi>blessing</hi>

Assure your selves, if moderate care and labour will not bring in Riches, then they are not good for you; and whatsoever is gained otherwise, hath a Curse in it, and will bring misery on the Body, or on the Soul, here or hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A <hi>Fourth Cause</hi> which hastens <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> is <hi>Intemperance,</hi> that is, excess in <hi>Eating,</hi> or in <hi>Drinking,</hi> or in <hi>lustful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces.</hi> Any of these, especially the <hi>last,</hi> do bring Old-age into youthful years. Sad it is, that our Life being in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extent so short, and our Bodies by nature so frail; we, that have a desire to live, and who for that end will be content to use the most irksome remedies, should yet so commonly invite distempers by our <hi>Luxury,</hi> and so shamefully dig our Graves with our Teeth, and deprive our selves of the residue of our years. In so much, that altho in St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> time he affirmed, that there were reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>five thousand Martyrs</hi> for every day in the Year, save one, yet we may sadly conclude, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> have had daily more <hi>Martyrs,</hi> if we may so call them, in one place or other of the World, than <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> In this sense doth <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>

I know, that some of the worst of men have, without this, flourished long, and some that have been most <hi>Religious,</hi> have withered quickly.; and therefore do conclude, that all such <hi>Outward blessings</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> are <hi>conditionally</hi> promis'd and threatned: and yet it abides certain, that the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> way to a vigorous <hi>Age,</hi> and a long Life, is the true fear of God; and that which makes it short and miserable, is <hi>Ungodliness.</hi> And the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press herein, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>The fear of the Lord prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortned.</hi> For doubtless, <hi>our Lord God,</hi> who is the giver of Life, is also the <hi>Conserver</hi> of it; and whose word we may rely upon, as the best Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Preservative in this case. This Holy course doth contribute to this end</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a <hi>Natural</hi> way. And that, 1. By Mortifying and discarding those <hi>Sins</hi> which do more directly hurt the Body.

                     <hi>Ambition,</hi> and many such like, which like wind in the Intrails of the Earth do rend and shatter it. I think there is no Sin, whatsoever, but it hath a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant influence upon the Body; either to disorder and inflame it, or to macerate and dispirit it: Now the <hi>Fear of God</hi> obliges a man not only to <hi>restrain,</hi> but to <hi>pluck up</hi> all such by the Roots. Those are the <hi>Weeds,</hi> which both rob the sweet Flowers of their nourishment, and also depauperate the soil where they grow; which being cast out, the whole man fares the better after them. And 2. True Piety refresheth the Body with the <hi>Comforts</hi> of a <hi>good Conscience.</hi> That Peace, that Hope, that Joy which result from a Conscience, that is pacifi'd by the Blood, and purified by the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> do most efficaciously cherish the whole man, they daily feast him. This is that <hi>merry Heart,</hi> that is called a <hi>continual feast,</hi> Prov. 15. 15. And that <hi>doth good like a Medicine,</hi> Prov. 17. 22. There is that <hi>Intimacy</hi> between the Soul and the Body, that whatsoever refresheth the <hi>one,</hi> doth also cheer the <hi>other.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Learned</hi> have judged, that <hi>Hope, Love</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi> are great prolongers of <hi>Life,</hi> by the influence which these have upon the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102503:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Humours and Spirits in the Body: much more when these Affections have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and eternal things for their Object: and the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> speaks that way, when it saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 23. <hi>The fear of the Lord tendeth to Life, and he that hath it, shall abide satisfied.</hi> 3. True Piety is the best Preservative against Old-age in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> way, to wit, by Procuring the <hi>Blessing</hi> of God. For when the Body is consecrated to him, and imployed for him, we may expect it to be blessed by him; it is under his peculiar care and Providence. When it is united to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> it will receive influence from <hi>Him</hi> for its good. So that <hi>true Religiousness,</hi> tho it more immediately tend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and felicity of the <hi>Soul,</hi> yet it is really most friendly also to the <hi>Body.</hi> He that <hi>feareth God,</hi> and <hi>walketh in his ways, shall see his Childrens Children,</hi> Psal. 128. last. And on the other hand, all those destroying, and life-shortning Diseases mention'd, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 27. 61. even <hi>every sickness,</hi> and <hi>every plague,</hi> are denounced to the ungodly. And fully <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 12, 13. <hi>Tho a Sinner do Evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him. But it shall not be well with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>

                     <hi>neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he feareth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi> Therefore you that would <hi>protract</hi> the time of your flourishing strength, learn to love and fear God, devote your selves to him, bestow your Hearts upon him, imploy your time and strength to please and honour him: abide not in a State of <hi>ungodliness,</hi> rest not with a <hi>form of Godliness;</hi> but resolve upon that <hi>Real Holiness,</hi> which will produce a long and happy life in this World, and a longer and happier life in a better.</p>

                     <hi>Loquacity</hi> or <hi>Talkativeness;</hi> that is, an exceeding proneness to speak much; so that it hath pass'd into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Senex psittacus,</hi> an old person is a Parrot. Herein they are <hi>twice chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> whose faculty you know lies this way.</p>
                  <p>Speech is a most wonderful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Faculty</hi> conferr'd only on humane nature, and for their common good, and it is great pity that it should be abused. As our <hi>Reason</hi> begins to work, so our <hi>Speech</hi> comes in; which shews that all our words should be govern'd by Reason. And yet how unruly is this little member! insomuch as the <hi>Apostle Iames,</hi> c. 3. 6. calls the Tongue, a <hi>World of iniquity;</hi> the <hi>hand</hi> is not call'd a <hi>world of iniquity,</hi> for that cannot reach very far; but with the <hi>tongue</hi> we can walk over the whole world, and by the venome of it hurt even all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

And <hi>Old</hi> people, whose eyes and ears, whose hands and feet are much decay'd and disabled, are apt to make the greater use of their <hi>tongues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas the noblest and best <hi>subject</hi> of Discourse is the ever blessed God, his Properties, Word and Works, too few of them deal in this argument; but the ordinary Theme of their speech, is concerning <hi>Other folks,</hi> and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Themselves:</hi> and here you may find in their tongues the <hi>Perpetual Motion.</hi> About <hi>Others,</hi> their tongue travelleth round about, and few of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours escape the scourge of it. It is their delight to be judging, censuring, and condemning all mankind. How much good might the same breath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, if it were imployed in good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, in faithful counsel or in wise reproof? But their talent lies not that way, but rather like <hi>Zoilus</hi> of old, who being asked, why he carped so much at others, answer'd, that <hi>he spoke ill of them, because he could do no other ill to them;</hi> so the impotence of old people must be a plea for their ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: but God will <hi>reprove thee,</hi> and <hi>set this</hi> and <hi>all thine other</hi> sins before thee, because <hi>thou sittest and speakest</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now all this must be nauseous to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingenuous hearer, and is most loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in the sight of <hi>God.</hi> For <hi>He</hi> and <hi>his Glory</hi> is the only center, towards which all our words and actions should tend. All other discourse is no other or better, than wherein <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> may vye with you: and our <hi>Blessed Book</hi> assures us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36. That <hi>every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the day of judgement.</hi> If all your extravagant words in one day should be written down, and presented at night to you, it would amaze you; how then will ye answer whole <hi>volumes</hi> of them at the day of Judgment? say not, that

                  <p>Bridle therefore this unruly member.

Envy.</note> is <hi>Envy,</hi> which is <hi>an inward Grudging at those who do in any thing excell us.</hi> Now because they which are <hi>Old</hi> do see many that surpass them in strength, beauty, riches or esteem, they are too apt to look at them with an envious Eye, and to grudge them those blessings, which God hath vouchsafed them. Hence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102503:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is but too usual with them, to lessen their deserts, to carp at their enjoyments, to abound in all such reports and stories, as may degrade or blacken them; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a great mistake, that what is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted</hi> from others, is <hi>added</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Thus when an House is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all the props men can get, they will buttress it up withall: but these are but rotten Pillars, and will but expose you to more contempt.</p>
                  <p>For this is an <hi>odious sin</hi> in it self: from hence proceeded the <hi>Fall</hi> of the <hi>first Adam,</hi> and the <hi>Death of the Second,</hi> for which mischiefs we should hate it the more. And indeed it is a very unreasonable thing to envy those mercies to others, whereof we have had our share as well as they. Are they strong, comely or respected? You have in your time partaken of them, and why should you grudge at those that do but come after you? It is like as if the <hi>Southern Husbandman,</hi> who hath inn'd his Harvest in <hi>Iuly,</hi> should repine at them that live more <hi>Northerly,</hi> whose Harvest is in <hi>September:</hi> why, the <hi>former</hi> had his Harvest as well as the <hi>Other;</hi> and hath reason rather to be thankful to <hi>God,</hi> than to envy them that follow him. Besides, would you have two Harvests? What
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102503:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
answer can you give to our <hi>Saviours</hi> questions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? is thine eye evil, because I am good?</hi> He that grudges at Gods gifts, would make a miserable distribution of them among men, if they were at his disposal. No no, younger people have their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of comeliness, strength, estate, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and parts, and you have yours; and they are distributed by a wise Hand, who is ever <hi>righteous in all his wayes,</hi> and <hi>holy all in his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore labour with all your might to extinguish this <hi>cursed flame.</hi> Remember that <hi>wrath killeth the foolish man,</hi> and <hi>that envy slayeth the silly one, Iob</hi> 5. 2. You envy <hi>others,</hi> but you hurt your <hi>selves.</hi> Few sins have a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant influence upon <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> than this Sin of Envy.

Alas, your Riches will be no certain refuge for you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 10, 11. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a strong Tower: the Righteous runneth into it and is safe. The Rich mans Wealth is his strong City, and as an high wall</hi> (but 'tis only) <hi>in his own conceit.</hi> That bond, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. sealed to us, is worth all your Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all your Estates: He hath said, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> Can you justifie your immoderate scrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a just provision for <hi>your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and Relations? No, no, That's but an excuse; for they that have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are as sick of this Disease as others. But if you have Children, this course of yours is the way to undo them. A moderate care for Posterity, is a Duty, wherein we may expect a Blessing: but the <hi>Covetousness</hi> of the Parent, doth but provide for the <hi>Luxury</hi> of the Child, and so the Parents Soul is ruin'd in the <hi>getting,</hi> and the Childs in the <hi>spending</hi> of what is so gotten. If your posterity fear God, they shall want no good thing, they shall have <hi>enough:</hi> but if they do not, they will have <hi>too much.</hi> God will be dishonoured, and themselves undone for ever.</p>

some <hi>Good</hi> with your Estates, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse your present penuriousness: for that is to do evil that good may come of it. Hear what <hi>God</hi> himself saith to this, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 8. For <hi>I the Lord love judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I hate robbery for a burnt Offering.</hi> They that will part with nothing while they <hi>live,</hi> nothing will be accepted from them when they <hi>dye. Plead</hi> not your unspotted Justice, Honesty and Equity, against this charge; as if a Man could not be <hi>covetous,</hi> that meddles only with <hi>his own.</hi> For tho fraud, injustice and oppression be sometimes the <hi>Effects,</hi> yet the <hi>Nature</hi> of covetousness stands in <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving the World;</hi> and so you may be damnably guilty of this Sin, tho you keep you within the limits of your Estate. For as a man may be guilty of uncleanness with his <hi>own</hi> Wife, and be drunk with his <hi>own</hi> drink, so a man may be covetous with his <hi>own</hi> Riches. We do not find that the <hi>rich Fool, Luk.</hi> 12. nor that the <hi>rich Glutton, Luk.</hi> 16. did other folks wrong; nor those on the left hand of <hi>Christ, Mat.</hi> 25. that they robb'd the poor or wrong'd the needy, but yet all guilty of this accursed vice.</p>
                  <p>Strive therefore to break this snare; And to this end, 1. Consider these few

things, namely, The absolute <hi>Vanity</hi> of all these worldly things; that is, they are not able to satisfie the Mind, or to cure the Body, or to imbelish your Name, or to lengthen the Life, or to save the Soul: and all this hath been prov'd, and concluded by <hi>Solomon</hi> a King of vast <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>experience.</hi> And their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is yet further seen in their <hi>uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> there being an hundred ways to rend them from you, and as many ways to rend you away from them. And are they not vain then? And why <hi>wilt thou set thine Eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves Wings, they fly away as an Eagle to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ards Heaven,</hi> Prov. 23. 5. Consider again the <hi>End</hi> for which these things are bestowed upon you, which is, that you should imploy them, and use them for him. God doth hereby try you, whether you will deny your self, whether you will glorify him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will lay out your Talent, or lay it up. He makes some persons <hi>poor,</hi> that he may exercise their patience and humility; and others <hi>Rich,</hi> to exercise their bounty and their charity. In short, Riches were never given to any man to spend upon his Lusts, or to hoard them up without just cause; but to <hi>do</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:102503:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>good withal,</hi> first to your selves, then to your Families and Relations, and then to others: when they are not thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, you utterly pervert the End for which you are intrusted with them. Consider also, that you are but <hi>Stewards</hi> in your Estates, and you must give a just account of them to him. All that you possess is <hi>His Stock</hi> only in your Hands, it is not your own. <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulness of it.</hi> If you really believed this, you would never pinch or grudge to your self or others, that which is convenient. For what is it to a Steward, when his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster shall order him to abate so much to his Tenant, or pay so much to another poor man? He sticks not at it, he knows it will pass in his account, and there's an end. And why cannot you, who are only Stewards to the God of Heaven and Earth, of that Estate which is in your hand, when you can discern that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; I say, why cannot you give, forgive, lend, lay out freely, for none of it is your own? and whether will it pass better in your accounts; so much left in Bags or Bonds, or to a prodigal Heir; or so much of it spent in hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, so much in well-plac'd bounty,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102503:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and so much in prudent charity? And lastly, consider the plain <hi>Command</hi> and blessed <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Let your Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be without Covetousness—For he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> q. d. Thou shalt have <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>sufficient,</hi> or, thou shalt have <hi>him</hi> that is <hi>All-sufficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Pray earnestly against this Sin.</hi> Let your Eyes be ever towards the Lord, to pluck your Feet out of this Net. Without his divine Grace, this snare will be too strong for you. There are <hi>Medicines</hi> to purge choler, and such Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which feed our Corruptions, but none to purge Covetousness: No, this Lust is rooted only in the Soul, the bodily Complexion is very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd: and therefore you have the more need to cry earnestly to God with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Psal. 119. 36. <hi>Incline my Heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Testimonies, and not to Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Labour for Faith.</hi> To believe what <hi>God</hi> hath revealed, and to rely upon what he hath promised. I have read of a <hi>certain Person,</hi> that in a change of times, after some debate about what was then impos'd, swore <hi>by his Faith,</hi> he must live;

but <hi>another</hi> of the same Cloth answered, that he would learn to <hi>live by his Faith:</hi> so when you plead for your selfish pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious course, that you <hi>must live,</hi> I counsel you to learn the <hi>life of Faith:</hi> for if you did believe the <hi>Revelation</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath made of his <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> if you did believe the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to come, and the everlasting World after it, if you did believe the <hi>Promises</hi> or the <hi>Threatnings,</hi> which referr to this affair, you would readily despise all the things of this World, and set your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on things above; you would, as you ought, be rich in good works, <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for your selves a good foundation against the time to come,</hi> that sith this life is slipping from under your feet, you may <hi>lay hold on eternal Life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 18, 19.</p>

That is, such a <hi>deep resentment</hi> against such as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, as is scarce abolished. On the one hand, their <hi>impotence</hi> is such, by reason of their Age, that they cannot easily revenge themselves; and on the other, their thinking, Sedentary, and wakeful condition gives, them opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to rowl their disgusts in their minds, till they are boil'd into a settled rancour. Thus they who in <hi>malice</hi> should be <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and in <hi>understanding</hi> should be <hi>Men,</hi> are on the contrary <hi>men in malice,</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in understanding:</hi> not apt to forgive, not easie to forget.

that the contentions of Old People, like those among Brethren, are <hi>like the Bars of a Castle.</hi> They will owe a Man an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn seven long years together, and then pay him at last.</p>
                  <p>But this is an inhumane, and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temper. Would you have every one deal so by you? have you offended no body in all your course? What <hi>Brute</hi> is it, that continueth an everlasting Rage? Would you be so treated by the great <hi>God,</hi> when you have offended him? How can you pray in this condition without <hi>Cursing</hi> your selves? If you do not forgive, you cannot be forgiven. I am sure the affronts and injuries which you have received <hi>from men,</hi> are not to be compared to those which you have offered <hi>to God.</hi> Away then with this devilish Distemper; make your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour sensible of his offence, by a <hi>cool re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi> of it to him, by your self if possible, or else by some fit Friend, perhaps you may gain him. By <hi>revenge</hi> you can be but <hi>even</hi> with him, but hereby you'l get <hi>above</hi> him, and <hi>conquer</hi> him. However do not you punish your self for his aversion, by suffering a Fire in your Bosom, which will hurt your own Soul, more than it doth your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

And do not nullifie all the good that is in him, nor all the kindness that you have received from him, but muster up all his worthy qualities, and all the former respects and benefits that you have received from him, and this will melt you into a better temper.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Speculative wickedness</hi> is another Sin too incident to <hi>Old-age.</hi> That is, either <hi>Reflecting</hi> upon <hi>former</hi> Sins, or <hi>Fancying others</hi> with delight. There is a <hi>Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> complacence in sin; <hi>before</hi> its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, by <hi>contrivance; in</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission by present <hi>satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the Commission <hi>by remembrance:</hi> and as the set purpose before, so the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>reflexion</hi> afterwards, is a Sin before God.

fancy. They do not, and perhaps they cannot now profane the <hi>Lords day</hi> as they have done, fight and quarrel as they have done, nor commit uncleanness as they have done, nor drink and debauch themselves as they have done: but they can reflect upon these things with <hi>content;</hi> strength and opportunity is wanting, but their Hearts are as wicked as ever. Hence it is, that you shall hear divers <hi>Old</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rehearsing their former disobedience to Parents, their refractoriness to their Masters, their petty purloynin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Now this is in effect to act over those Sins again: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>She mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied her Whoredoms in calling to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the days of her Youth, wherein she had plaid the Harlot in the Land of Egypt.</hi> Yea, perhaps this guilt will be found in some respects <hi>greater</hi> than the <hi>first:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it's likely that <hi>then</hi> there was <hi>less knowledge,</hi> and <hi>more temptation,</hi> than <hi>now</hi> there is. This contemplative wickedness nails on the former guilt, and contracts more: this demonstrates, that the man would be always sinning, if he could; and that he is a meer stranger to true Repentance. I deny not, but that the

first sudden glance of the memory upon former Vanities may be pleased, but 'tis only a surprize; every pious Soul hath them still in <hi>remembrance,</hi> and is <hi>humbled in it.</hi> Thus <hi>Holy Augustine</hi> in his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions</hi> reflects upon his <hi>Robbing</hi> an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> in his younger days, with all the heart-breaking Aggravations imaginable. Thus <hi>Holy David</hi> cryes out, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 7. <hi>Remember not the Sins of my Youth,</hi> nor <hi>my Transgressions.</hi> Labour you to write after their Copies; let the remembrance of your former follies be always <hi>bitter:</hi> never dwell upon the thoughts of them, but with a Sigh.

Make not the Wound to bleed again by rubbing it afresh, lest it fester and grow incurable at length. Let it appear some way, that it is not want of <hi>power,</hi> but want of <hi>will</hi> that makes you Sober. A diligent care to avoid the Sins of your <hi>present Age</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> will be a good proof, that you would not commit the faults that are past, if you were to live over your life again. <hi>A better Life is the best Repentance</hi>

So that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102503:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as <hi>Reason</hi> is much improved by <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> so is <hi>Faith</hi> by <hi>use</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> hereby <hi>Recumbence</hi> is advanced into <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophory.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> is represented, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19, 20. <hi>Not weak in Faith,</hi> when he was an <hi>hundred</hi> years old, and so <hi>stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered not at the promise of God through unbelief.</hi> Tho his years rendred the Promise very unlikely, yet those years had taught him, that the performance would be certain, and so being <hi>strong in Faith, he gave Glory to God.</hi> As <hi>they have heard, so have they seen it in the City of God,</hi> and what they have <hi>often seen,</hi> they may <hi>well believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have seen <hi>the wicked in great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, flourishing like a green Bay-tree, and yet suddenly they have passed away;</hi> and therefore they are not so startled at the <hi>prosperity</hi> of ungodly men, as younger people may be. They have also seen the <hi>righteousness of the upright brought forth as the light;</hi> and so are hir'd to believe, that it shall be <hi>well with the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> and it shall go <hi>ill with the wicked</hi> at length. They themselves have been in outward straits and dangers, and then wonderfully preserved and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, and doth not this strengthen their Faith? And then in case of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102503:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wants and troubles, when their Spirit is overwhelmed, the <hi>Old-man</hi> can say with <hi>Asaph, Psal.</hi> 77. 5. <hi>I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the days of old, the years of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times,</hi> and so prop up their Spirits in their greatest dejections. If you that are <hi>Old</hi> want <hi>Faith,</hi> it is an arrant shame for you. For you have been so often told and assured of the <hi>Veracity,</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> and the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God; and then you have so often <hi>seen</hi> these <hi>Properties</hi> of his exemplified to others, and to your selves, so many wonders of <hi>Providence</hi> done in your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that ye your selves must be the greatest <hi>wonder,</hi> in case you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and trust him. When your Soul is cast down, <hi>you</hi> may do as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>remember</hi> God <hi>from the Land of Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, and of the Hermonites, from the Hill Mizar:</hi> that is, you may review the help and comfort which you have had in this and the other place of your Pilgrimage, and so <hi>hope still in God,</hi> that <hi>the Help of his Countenance will be the Health of yours.</hi> Psal. 42. 5, 6, 11.</p>
                  <p>Learn therefore this life of <hi>Faith;</hi> and endeavour as you grow <hi>weaker</hi> in <hi>body</hi> to grow <hi>stronger</hi> in <hi>Faith.</hi> 1. For <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>

                     <hi>mercies.</hi> You may be tempted to fear want in your <hi>Old-age:</hi> here's now occasion for Faith, whereby you are firmly to believe either that you shall want <hi>nothing,</hi> or else <hi>no good thing,</hi> Psal. 34. 9, 10. That the Lord will either <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> your wants, or <hi>inrich</hi> you by your wants. It was a memorable saying of an <hi>Ancient pious Woman, I have made many a meal upon the Promises, when I have wanted bread.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> hath said it, that <hi>Man lives not by bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by every word that cometh out of the mouth of God,</hi> Matth. 4. 4. So that a child of God shall never want a <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,</hi> so long as there is a <hi>Promise</hi> in the <hi>Book of God.</hi> But then he had need of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the stronger the faith, the chearfuller life he lives. For as by it he injoyes <hi>God in all things</hi> in case of <hi>plenty,</hi> so by it he injoyes <hi>all things in God</hi> in case of <hi>want.</hi> 2. For <hi>Spiritual blessings</hi> it concerns you to live by <hi>Faith</hi>

then diligently to apply himself to know, love, serve and enjoy him.

then the <hi>Mercy</hi> hath been conferr'd.

these things do too often work the <hi>wrong way,</hi> that is, they produce fretfulness, rage, melancholy, and other dismal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; but in the upright man, they sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Spirits, they break the pride, security and stubbornness of his Soul, and make him by <hi>patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, honour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> and so fit him for <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>

                  <p>And the <hi>Aged</hi> do or should exceed those that are <hi>young</hi> herein.

desire. Time and trials have taught the <hi>Old-man</hi> to digest hard words, and hard things, rather than to fight it out. Good <hi>David</hi> could better bear <hi>Shimei</hi>'s Curse when he was grown into <hi>years,</hi> than <hi>Nabal</hi>'s Uncharitableness, when he was <hi>younger:</hi> Now it was nothing but kill and slay, at least every Male in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s house; but afterwards, so <hi>let him Curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David: Who shall then say, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hast thou done this?</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 10. And those <hi>Disciples</hi> of our Saviour, who in their younger years would have had <hi>Fire</hi> sent from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to revenge the incivility of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> they in their riper years had learned, when <hi>reviled to bless,</hi> when <hi>persecuted to suffer it;</hi> and to bear all indignities not only with much <hi>patience,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 4. but <hi>with all patience,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 12.

                  <p>And you that are in <hi>years</hi> must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable, if you be defective in this <hi>Grace,</hi> because you have been for a long time <hi>Scholars</hi> under a <hi>Patient Master,</hi> who <hi>hath lest us an Example, that we should follow his steps; who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered,</hi>

No great wonder to see an unback't <hi>Colt</hi> to winch and curvet at the spur or whip, but if the old tryed <hi>Beast</hi> do so, he is better <hi>fed</hi> than <hi>taught.</hi> No, you should be <hi>Patterns of Patience</hi> to others. We may well feel things as <hi>Mortal men,</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi>) yet overcome them as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men.</hi> Outward Afflictions may prick us, but yet they should not pierce us. The <hi>Old Soldier</hi> will not fret at hard Marches, hard Weather, hard Usage, for he hath been beaten to them: The <hi>Old Mariner</hi> repines not at the boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Winds, or the threatning Waves.

                  <p>Labour therefore to get and increase your stock of <hi>Patience: Let Patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and intire, wanting nothing,</hi> Jam. 1. 4. This Grace you will daily need, and

daily use. For we <hi>have need of Patience, that after we have done the Will of God, we may receive the Promise,</hi> Heb. 10. 36. It will be like a <hi>Buckler,</hi> to save you harmless from the evil of Affliction: Though you have Faith, Vertue, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Temperance, yet ye must add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these <hi>Patience, that ye may never fall,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6.

                     </note>: For an impatient man, whilst he is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by another, even then punishes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so is his own greatest torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Alas! you must still expect a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of troubles, and unexpected cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, until your Course be finished; and if you escape these from abroad, yet you may find occasion enough for your <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> with your own <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and perhaps with <hi>nearer Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and though you should miss of these, yet your own <hi>Distempers</hi> will try your <hi>Patience;</hi> when you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat your meat, nor live without it; neither sleep with refreshment, nor lye awake with ease; neither endure company, nor be contented alone; when you will be weary of every place, of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102503:57"/>
every posture, and without <hi>Patience,</hi> weary of your self: And therefore it greatly concerns you to store your selves with this needful, this useful Grace.</p>
                  <p>And to that End, Inure your selves unto it <hi>by degrees:</hi> Strive to digest <hi>lesser</hi> wrongs, provocations and losses, which will prepare you to be quiet under <hi>greater.</hi> Whilst others are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to out-wit, or out-power their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, be you labouring to overcome your own resentments, to conquer your selves: And then set before you that mirrour of <hi>Patience,</hi> the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> who alwayes had <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> on his side, and yet patiently bore the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, the reproaches of Men, and the rage of Devils.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102503:58"/>
there; he is <hi>Fixed</hi> in his <hi>Will,</hi> and not easily charm'd or drawn from his well-chosen Objects. In respect of God and the things of <hi>Religion,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in years is or should be like a <hi>Rock,</hi> unmoveable, not like the <hi>Ship</hi> that is tossed to and fro. Having considered and weighed their <hi>Principles,</hi> no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consideration, no plausible harangues, no loss or punishment will induce them easily to alter the same. In respect of <hi>Others,</hi> their <hi>Friendship</hi> being grounded upon a firm bottom is constant, and they have learned to overlook ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry failings, and to put the best sense on the words and actions of a <hi>Friend.</hi> So likewise their <hi>Conjugal Love,</hi> though the frothy <hi>fondness</hi> of it be worn off, yet the strength and <hi>substance</hi> of it is unquestionable and unalterable. And then as to <hi>Themselves,</hi> their <hi>Passions</hi> are by long endeavours so moderated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, that as their temper is far more even and uniform, than once it was; so also their <hi>Actions</hi> and course of life are more steady and consistent, than in the dayes of their Vanity.</p>
                  <p>I will not contend that <hi>all Aged</hi> People excell in this <hi>Stedfastness,</hi> especially when <hi>Dotage</hi> invades <hi>Old-age;</hi> but that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102503:59"/>
it is so, and universally it should be so; and particular exceptions do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confirm general conclusions: Nor do I conclude that all young People are light and inconstant, but it is too manifest to be denyed, that <hi>Childhood</hi> and <hi>Youth</hi> have usually the large <hi>Sails,</hi> but <hi>Old-age</hi> hath the solid <hi>Ballast,</hi> and and therefore doth sail more steadily and more safely.

When the <hi>Wise man</hi> exhorts to <hi>remember our Creator in the days of our Youth,</hi> Eccles. 12. 1. that <hi>word Youth</hi> comes of a root signifying <hi>Choice;</hi> which seems to imply, that Youth is a time wherein Persons are <hi>undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;</hi> they have their Religion, their Relations, their Vocation to choose; but when a man is crown'd with years, then he is in a <hi>settled</hi> estate: Settled in Judgment, settled in his Purposes, settled in his Practice, and commonly settled in his Comfort: When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> was near his End, then he could

say, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12 <hi>I know whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and I am perswaded,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For indeed the <hi>Constitution</hi> and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Aged</hi> disposeth them hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Their Sanguine and <hi>Mercurial</hi> days are done; their Phlegm and <hi>Melancholy</hi> further their Stedfastness, either in good or evil. They have seen the World, the vanities and varieties of men and things, of opinions and practices, they have <hi>tried all things,</hi> and therefore are likelier to <hi>hold fast that which is good.</hi> And as there is a wearisomness of the Body, so there is a certain weariness of the Mind, which makes it desirous to be fixt, and to be at rest. And having often heard, read and pondered the things of Religion, and also tasted the real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and sweetness in them, they are not easily either flatter'd, or frighted out of them. Their approach to <hi>Death</hi> adds also to their <hi>Constancy;</hi> why should they through <hi>fear</hi> recede from their <hi>Principles,</hi> that in a short time must <hi>dye</hi> of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Hence that saying of Archbishop <hi>Whitgift, Two</hi> things help men to be resolute in a <hi>good Cause,</hi> namely <hi>Old-age</hi> and <hi>Want of Issue.</hi> And it is recorded, that when all the City of <hi>Athens</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Tyranny of <hi>Pisistratus, Solon</hi>

only oppos'd him; and being interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, what made him have such Confidence, he answer'd, <hi>It was his Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:</hi> He knew the <hi>Tyrant</hi> could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise him of many years; and he that cannot lose many years, needs not fear other losses; and so may well be sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast and unmovable in his Duty.</p>
                  <p>Let it be your Care therefore to be <hi>rooted</hi> and grounded in the <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of true <hi>Piety:</hi> Be not like <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren tossed too and fro with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> It is an arrant shame for you that are <hi>Old,</hi> to have your <hi>Religion</hi> to chuse, or to change it every month: It is not for you to follow fashions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: But you should be <hi>rooted and built up in Christ, and stablished in the Faith as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving,</hi> Colos. 2. 7. <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Stability</hi> should be your peculiar honour.

They have observed, that true Grace hath liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midst of great <hi>infirmities;</hi> yea, they have found this <hi>Flower</hi> in divers persons, where they thought there had been nothing but <hi>VVeeds.</hi> Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant most at home in their <hi>own Souls,</hi> they have in their long experience disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered so much Vanity and Iniquity there, that they are are very charitable <hi>Iudges of all other</hi> persons. They grow like the famous <hi>Pliny,</hi> who so past by others offences, as if himself had been the greatest offender; and yet was so severe to himself, as if he would pardon no body: their <hi>Charity covers a multitude of Sins.</hi> In short, their <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> have so happily humbled them, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102503:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they are ready to esteem every one bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than themselves; and so they are far from that uncharitable <hi>Censoriousness,</hi> which tears mens Names in pieces, and keeps up a continual civil War among mankind.</p>
                  <p>And then for other <hi>Acts of Charity,</hi> who should be more ready to Give <hi>a part,</hi> than they that know they must shortly leave the <hi>whole?</hi> who should be good in his <hi>Stewardship,</hi> but he that is <hi>sure</hi> he must shortly be out of it? But the noblest <hi>Charity</hi> is that which respects the <hi>Soul,</hi> which consists in <hi>Counselling, Perswading, Reproving</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> for Others. And <hi>Old-age</hi> is evidently quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for these above the young. Their <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> gives them a great advantage herein: and they have found by experience, that sometimes a word of good Counsel and charitable Reproof <hi>fitly spoken, hath been like Apples of Gold.</hi> And then for <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is observed that the Charity of young persons therein, doth begin and end at <hi>themselves;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Prayers of the Aged are much imployed for the good of <hi>others.</hi> Few Children pray for their <hi>Parents,</hi> as the Parents pray for their <hi>Children.</hi> Yea, they have learned to love and pray for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102503:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their <hi>Enemies,</hi> as well as for their <hi>Friends;</hi> and for the <hi>ungodly,</hi> as well as for the <hi>godly.</hi> And the poorest <hi>Old</hi> Man or Woman may be rich, in these acts of <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore as <hi>ye abound in every thing, in faith, in utterance and knowledge, see that ye abound in this Grace of Charity also.</hi> It is the <hi>Apostles</hi> Exhortation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7. We use to say, that in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the natural heat retreats inward, and there resides about the vital parts: ye that are in the <hi>winter quarter</hi> of your life, let this <hi>warm Grace</hi> dwell richly in your Hearts, and then it will influence all your words and actions. It is the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>God is Love;</hi> it is the fulfilling of the <hi>Law,</hi> and it is the great command of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and tho you have Knowledge, Faith, Wisdom, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if you have not <hi>Charity,</hi> you are nothing. You are going out of the World, now is your time to exercise this <hi>Grace.</hi> In the World where you are going, there will be no infirmities to cover, no poor to relieve, no injuries to forgive, no ignorant persons to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, no miserable Creature to pray for: and you have but a <hi>short time</hi> for these imployments. Yea, perhaps you
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102503:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are reprieved all this while for these Services; and to be useful in these and such like ways is the greatest happiness on Earth, it is the next step to eternal Glory. Yea, nothing should hire an <hi>Old</hi> person, or make him content to live out of Heaven with such a Body of Sin about him, but only that they may do <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> that service, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the obtaining this sweet <hi>Grace,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, that it is a <hi>Fruit of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and <hi>there</hi> it is ranked in the <hi>first</hi> place: It must be sought then in the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which is the <hi>vehicle</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> where, it being carefully read and heard, we shall find an account of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>love of God</hi> to us, and of the stupendous <hi>love of Christ.</hi> There we shall discern how nearly we are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all men, especially to all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and how unnatural it is for <hi>one hand</hi> to be unkind to <hi>the other.</hi> And in short, we shall there find, that Love and Charity is still the Character of good men, and hatred and uncharitableness of the bad. And you must beg this Grace of God, that the <hi>Spirit of Love,</hi> would plant this Grace of <hi>Love</hi> in your
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102503:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hearts. You will feel your hearts warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you are praying, and the Lord will fill you with this <hi>Charity which is the bond of perfectness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so I have done with the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> and <hi>Excellencies</hi> of <hi>Old-age:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may perceive that all <hi>Old</hi> things are not to be cast away: But as <hi>Old Wood</hi> is best to burn, <hi>Old Wine</hi> best to drink, <hi>Old Authors</hi> best to read, and <hi>Old Friends</hi> best to trust; so <hi>Old People,</hi> if they have improved their <hi>Time</hi> aright, are good for something <note n="i" place="margin">Old <hi>Fish,</hi> old <hi>Oil,</hi> and an old <hi>Friend</hi> are best. <hi>Ital.</hi> Proverb.</note>; yea are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently good for their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> for their <hi>Faith,</hi> for their <hi>Wisdom,</hi> for their <hi>Patience,</hi> for their <hi>Stedfastness,</hi> for their <hi>Temperance,</hi> and for their <hi>Charity.</hi> And so much for the <hi>Fourth Point</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Old-age,</hi> viz.

                  <p>AND now let us more <hi>distinctly</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey<note place="margin">§. 1. It is deprived of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</note> the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> of <hi>Old-age;</hi> the chief whereof are these following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Aged are Deprived of many Pleasures.</hi> They cannot divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Hunting, Hawking, Fishing: They can neither well <hi>ride</hi> abroad, nor <hi>walk</hi> about home. They have done with <hi>Visits,</hi> and <hi>Feasts,</hi> and <hi>Musick:</hi> All the recreations of <hi>sense</hi> are generally tastless to them. Yea, they have scarce any pleasure in their <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>sleep:</hi> So that their Condition seems to be sad and lamentable. And we have the substance of all this confessed by an <hi>Old man</hi> himself, namely <hi>Barzillai,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 35. <hi>I am this day fourscore years old; and can thy servant tast what I eat, or what I drink? can I hear any more the voyce of singing men and singing women? q. d.</hi> These things will signifie nothing to me; they have forsaken me, and I value them as little. Here you have the Verdict which <hi>Barzillai</hi> brings in the Case. Yea instead of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> a constant <hi>Sadness</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:102503:72"/>
takes place in their Countenance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and, as may be judged, in their Hearts within. <hi>Sobs</hi> and <hi>sighs</hi> are the accent of their language, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are frequently mixt with <hi>tears.</hi> Their Condition then must needs be miserable, when they have such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant heaviness <hi>within,</hi> and no recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>without</hi> to alleviate it. <hi>Company</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens them, and <hi>Solitariness</hi> saddens them. Yea they are loth that any body should be <hi>merry</hi> about them: So that they seem to lead a <hi>dolorous</hi> life, and to be estrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all manner of Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Pleasure</hi> is the <hi>life</hi> of Life: What is Life without Delight? why do men toyl to get Estates, but for the <hi>pleasure</hi> they take in them? why do others hunt for Applause, and climb for Honour, but to <hi>please</hi> their fancy and their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? even the Schollar would take leave of his Books, if he had not <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in them: So that <hi>Pleasure</hi> acts all mankind, and rules the world. Now those years are lamentable, wherein a man shall say, <hi>I have no pleasure in them.</hi> And this makes some <hi>Old</hi> People wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their lives, they reckon that a Life stript of joy and comfort, is not worth the keeping.</p>

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:102503:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>Nevertheless, <hi>Old-age</hi> may support it self very well under this <hi>Inconvenience:</hi> Inasmuch, as the <hi>Pleasures</hi> they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of, are <hi>in themselves</hi> and <hi>to their experience,</hi> dangerous Injoyments: For nothing is more apt to disorder and fully the Soul, than <hi>carnal Pleasure.</hi> Those very <hi>Recreations</hi> which may be harmless in themselves, yet too commonly lead to <hi>Intemperance,</hi> to <hi>Lasciviousness,</hi> to <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,</hi> and other <hi>mischiefs.</hi> Now if a Dish be never so <hi>palatable,</hi> yet if there be but <hi>danger</hi> of Poyson in it, no wise man will meddle with it: Therefore <hi>Tully</hi> brings in <hi>Cato</hi> congratulating with himself, that he was delivered from the <hi>slavery of Pleasure,</hi> and concludes, that it is a singular <hi>Priviledge</hi> of <hi>Old-age,</hi> that it frees us from that which is most <hi>pernicious</hi> in youth <note n="o" place="margin">Magnum munus sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctutis est, quod id no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis aufert, quod in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolescentia est vitiosissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum. <hi>Cicer.</hi>

                     <note n="r" place="margin">Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> saith, None can think <hi>God</hi> so unkind to his own Image in humane nature, as in dispensing Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to assign the larger share to the <hi>Beast.</hi> No, all these sensual <hi>Pleasures</hi> are so <hi>distracting,</hi> or so <hi>fulsome,</hi> or so <hi>transient,</hi> that the utmost fruition of them, cannot make a man happy, nor the want of them miserable. And this is the more Evident, in that the <hi>wisest</hi> men have found the <hi>greatest Pleasure,</hi> in refusing those pleasures; and as an <hi>Epicure</hi> hath <hi>eaten</hi> for his pleasure, so many an <hi>Abstemious</hi> man hath profest, that he hath <hi>forborn</hi> for his pleasure also.</p>
                  <p>Again, as the <hi>Aged</hi> person is deprived of these <hi>Pleasures,</hi> so he is freed from any <hi>Desires</hi> after them. As his sensual <hi>Delights</hi> fail, so his <hi>Desires</hi> to them fail also. As he hath not the Pleasure of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102503:73"/>
                     <hi>Scratching,</hi> so he is free from the trouble of <hi>Itching,</hi> and what man ever complains of such a want? We are never molested by the <hi>want</hi> of any thing, which we do <hi>not desire</hi> 
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Nihil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum, quod non deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus. Non caret is, qui non deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. <hi>Cicer.</hi>
                     </note>. Neither is <hi>Old-age</hi> without it's particular <hi>Pleasures. Tully</hi> tells us of divers <hi>Old-men,</hi> that diverted themselves with great delight in their <hi>Studies.</hi> And for those that have any smattering of <hi>Learning,</hi> there is no <hi>Earthly</hi> Pleasure comparable to that of penetrating into the works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> of observing the <hi>Natures, Causes,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of those things, the <hi>Surface</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of only is known to younger people.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the <hi>Religious Old</hi> person hath an unexpressible <hi>Pleasure</hi> in the <hi>Reflexion</hi> of a <hi>well-spent Life,</hi> and upon the various <hi>Preservations</hi> and <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> hath vouchsafed him, out of many <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi> They have also the solid <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> of seeing their <hi>Posterity</hi> grow up in the endowments of <hi>Mind, Body</hi> or <hi>Estate;</hi> and so of a <hi>Generation</hi> after them to serve and honour God, while the World stands.</p>
                  <p>There are also several <hi>honest Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in which their <hi>Years</hi> do not hinder them. And however, it can be no disparagement
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102503:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to them, if they can take as much <hi>Pleasure</hi> in <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating</hi> upon Gods Word, as ever they did in any other <hi>Divertisement</hi> whatsoever <note n="t" place="margin">

This is certain, that their <hi>Pleasures</hi> are more <hi>Pure,</hi> more <hi>Sound,</hi> more <hi>Strong,</hi> and more <hi>Lasting,</hi> than the frothy and unsatisfactory pleasures of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> which are but <hi>for a Season.</hi>

                  <p>Finally, <hi>Sickness</hi> of Body or <hi>Trouble</hi> of Mind, to both which the Young are equally obnoxious as the Old, are able to divorce the <hi>youngest</hi> persons from all sensible <hi>Pleasures,</hi> and to cloath their Faces with sadness: so that this <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience</hi> must not be so appropriated to <hi>Old-age,</hi> but that any Age may partake thereof. Even St. <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us, that in his younger years, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted such sadness upon his Spirits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion of his good <hi>Mothers</hi> Death, that nothing could comfort him. He went into the <hi>Bath,</hi> hoping for some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment thereby, but his sorrow met him when he came out again.

left little of a Man but his <hi>Shape:</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Proverb, Senex est, &amp; non est.

                  </p>
                  <p>For when a mans <hi>Strength</hi> is gone, he seems to be <hi>useless.</hi> He can neither <hi>defend</hi> himself, nor <hi>help</hi> others.

and the burden of his discourse is, <hi>I have known the time, that I could have done this and that.</hi> Thus <hi>Milo</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious man of strength, when coming in his <hi>Old-age</hi> to see them exercise in the <hi>Olympick Games,</hi> is said to look down with tears on his own Arms, and to cry, <hi>Alas, these now are dead.</hi> Yet this <hi>Loss</hi> some <hi>Aged</hi> persons can better bear, than <hi>Others</hi> can digest the decay of their <hi>Beauty.</hi> O to be lean, withered, and deformed vexeth them at the Heart.

                  <p>But yet neither of these <hi>Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> are chargeable upon <hi>Old-age</hi> it self.

                     </note>, the <hi>defects</hi> of strength, whereof we are sensible, do rather proceed from the <hi>Vices of our Youth,</hi> than from the <hi>fault of Old-age.</hi> An intemperate <hi>Youth</hi> transmits a weak body unto the time of <hi>Old-age</hi> 
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Ista ipsae defectio vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentiae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> efficitur saepius, quam senectuti. <hi>Id.</hi>
                     </note>, and then we lay all the blame on <hi>Age. Galen</hi> in one place tells us, About the <hi>28th.</hi> year of my Age, when I knew there was a certain way to preserve Health, I
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102503:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
followed the same all my life after, so that I was never Sick but of an Ague for a day, and that seldom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was vegete and brisk at <hi>Sevenscore</hi> years of Age. And <hi>M. Valerius Corvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was strong enough to be the <hi>sixth</hi> time <hi>Consul,</hi> when he was an <hi>hundred</hi> years old. Whereas on the contrary a Luxurious youth, produces a loathsome Age. As the <hi>Thief</hi> in the <hi>Candle</hi> wasts it more than the <hi>Flame;</hi> so any <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> or <hi>Incontinence,</hi> doth wast the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> more than <hi>years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is <hi>Old-age</hi> alone subject to these Evils. For one Weeks <hi>Sickness,</hi> to which Youth is as lyable as <hi>Old-age</hi> will ruine your <hi>Strength</hi> and spoil your <hi>Beauty,</hi> as much as <hi>twenty</hi> years time can do. How many are crippled in their Youth? how commonly doth the Small-pox disfigure their beauty! <hi>David</hi> himself complains, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 23. <hi>He weakened my strength in the way; he shortned my dayes.</hi> And he cries, <hi>O my God, take me not away in the midst of my dayes.</hi> So that these <hi>Decayes</hi> must not be impropriated to <hi>Old-age;</hi> any Age may be afflicted with them as well as that.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this <hi>Loss</hi> so insupportable, if we consider the true <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi>

of these <hi>Mercies.</hi> They are but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily accomplishments; they are not the endowments of the <hi>Soul.</hi> Many <hi>Brutes</hi> surpass the youngest in <hi>Strength,</hi> and many <hi>Flowers</hi> surpass them in <hi>Beauty.</hi> Why should I, saith <hi>Cato in Tully,</hi> now more desire the strength of a Young man, than I should, when young, desire the strength of a <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Lyon?</hi> There is the like absurdity in both these desires. Or as <hi>he</hi> saith in <hi>another</hi> place, we may as reasonably in our <hi>Youth,</hi> call back the State of <hi>Childhood,</hi> which few will do, as in <hi>Old-age</hi> to expect the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> of youth, which is past and gone. You have, if it be not your own fault, the <hi>Priviledges</hi> proper to your Age, and according to the <hi>Old Observation</hi> it is far better to want the <hi>strength of Milo,</hi> than the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102503:78"/>
but their <hi>Invention</hi> now is grown poor, and their <hi>Notions</hi> flat. But the most sensible loss is of their <hi>Memory,</hi> whereby formerly they could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced things both new and old; but now their Memory is so wofully shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that this day forgets what yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day said and did. O the excellent things that they have <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>read:</hi> and now they are <hi>like water spilt on the Ground,</hi> no notices left that ever such things had been within. Time was, their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, and their <hi>Hatred</hi> to Sin was <hi>strong as Death,</hi> and ardent as the <hi>Coals of Fire, which hath a most vehement flame: many waters could not quench it.</hi> Their holy <hi>Ioys</hi> and <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi> were transcendent; penitential Tears were frequent with them: But now their <hi>Hearts</hi> are cold, and their <hi>Eyes</hi> are dry.

                  <p>Now this manifest stroke upon their <hi>Faculties,</hi> is a very sensible <hi>Inconvenience.</hi> The Decay of the <hi>Outward man</hi> might be someway tolerable, but this <hi>inward Decay</hi> sinks their Spirits.

What's a Knife good for, when the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is gone? When a man can <hi>attain</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and <hi>retain</hi> nothing?

When his <hi>affections</hi> flagg, and his words freeze in <hi>Prayer?</hi> Why, he thinks he has lived long enough, he feels himself more than <hi>half dead</hi> already.

                  <p>2. These Decays proceed not from <hi>Old-age only,</hi> but many times from <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Negligence.</hi> Their <hi>Faculties</hi> would continue more intire to them, if they did exercise them with <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Industry.</hi>

                  <p>3.

                  <p>4.

                     </gap>ose which are called <hi>Senses of Discipline, Seeing</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> by which as through windows Light is derived into the Soul. For as in <hi>Natural</hi> things nothing is found in the <hi>Understanding,</hi> which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>senses;</hi> so in <hi>Spiritual</hi> things, the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> are not <hi>invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by our <hi>Minds,</hi> but conveyed to us by the <hi>sacred Oracles.</hi> And therefore it is very probable that <hi>Satan</hi> beareth a particular spite to these, as <hi>some</hi> have observed from the <hi>Persons</hi> possest by him, whom he so frequently struck <hi>deaf,</hi> and <hi>dumb,</hi> and <hi>blind.</hi> But it is evident, that as by these <hi>Doors</hi> sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Soul, so we find our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes</hi> sooner in them, than in our <hi>other Senses.</hi> The <hi>Eye</hi> it grows dim, and the <hi>Ear</hi> it grows dull, and both grow worse
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102503:81"/>
and worse, and that without hopes of Cure. This was the case of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch Isaac,</hi> Gen. 27. 1. <hi>And it came to pass,</hi> that <hi>when Isaac was old and his Eyes were dim, so that he could not see,</hi> &amp;c. whereupon using his Hands for Eyes, he was mistaken in his own Sons. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Degrees</hi> of these Decayes are <hi>different,</hi> in some less, in some greater: but as in <hi>Houses</hi> the <hi>Windows</hi> suffer first and most; so in our <hi>houses of Clay,</hi> the Organs of <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> do more or less, wax out of tune, before the <hi>Fabrick</hi> fall.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Decayes</hi> of the <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Ear</hi> are grievous <hi>Afflictions;</hi> when one can scarce discern one thing, or person, or one letter from another; to continue in a perpetual night or twilight, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable must it be? Or, to see peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple speak, and yet scarce to hear what they say, it is next to being buried alive. For man is a <hi>sociable</hi> creature; and the <hi>All-wise God</hi> saw that it was <hi>not good for Adam</hi> himself, <hi>to be alone:</hi> but the <hi>Privation</hi> of these senses leaves a man to <hi>himself alone.</hi> He <hi>sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath born it upon him.</hi> He is liable to be abused and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured both in word and deed, and is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102503:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
uncapable to help himself. He is also rendred useless; hereupon <hi>T. Manlius Torquatus</hi> excused himself from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship,</hi> saying it was not fit he should be intrusted with the Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of others, that could not see or hear, but with others eyes and ears: yea, which is worst of all, such persons are precluded from the <hi>Means of Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> There is no better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany sometimes than a good <hi>Book,</hi> but they cannot see a <hi>letter.</hi> And then <hi>Faith</hi> comes by Hearing, and it is preserved, and increased by the same means; but let them press never so near, they can scarce hear a distinct word, much less a whole sentence: and what a dry and dead Soul must that be, that lives out of the road of these ordinary helps?</p>
                  <p>It is some <hi>Question</hi> whether of these losses is the <hi>greater,</hi> of the <hi>Eye-sight</hi> or of the <hi>Hearing.</hi> And upon some accounts the <hi>latter</hi> seems to be the sadder loss of the <hi>two;</hi> partly because <hi>God</hi> hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hearing,</hi> to be the ordinary Means of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Comfort:</hi> partly because there are no such, at least no such ready and commodious <hi>Helps</hi> yet found out, for the <hi>Dulness</hi> of the <hi>Ear,</hi> as there are for the <hi>Dimness</hi> of the <hi>Eye.</hi> However,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102503:82"/>
the Decayes of either of them, especially of Both these <hi>senses,</hi> are a great <hi>Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> and a heavy burden upon <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding all this allegation, <hi>Old-age</hi> is not altogether so miserable as it is painted. For there are many <hi>Aged</hi> People, of whom it may be said, as it was of <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 34. 7. <hi>his Eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated:</hi> So it pleaseth the <hi>Lord</hi> to continue to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Aged</hi> persons<note n="d" place="margin">Constant Visus &amp; Auditus, nec quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in iis imminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. <hi>Guil.

But though it must not be denyed, that for the most part <hi>Old-age</hi> is <hi>dim of sight</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nec dum caligant oculi eo usque ut perspicillis opus sit. <hi>And. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet.</hi> aetat. 78.</note> and <hi>dull of hearing;</hi> yet 'tis as true, that even these decayes are incident to <hi>younger</hi> persons. How many young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may we meet with, that are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi> in one or other of them? Some that are <hi>purblind,</hi> others <hi>dim-sighted,</hi> some from their <hi>birth,</hi> some by casual <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> some by <hi>distempers:</hi> nay, it is one of the wonders of Gods <hi>Providence,</hi> that considering the folly and rashness of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> any of us carry our <hi>Eyes</hi> untouched unto <hi>elder</hi> years: so that neither is this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to be confined to <hi>Old-age.</hi> Yea, if we grant that these <hi>Defects</hi> should
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102503:82"/>
unavoydably befall <hi>Old</hi> people, yet they do not alwayes make them <hi>useless,</hi> and then all's well enough. Even <hi>Blind</hi> and <hi>Deaf</hi> persons have bin more serviceable in their places, than multitudes of some people, that have their <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>ears. Tully</hi> tells of divers, that were wholly dark, yet Ornaments to their <hi>Countrey.</hi> In particular, he relates of <hi>Appius,</hi> that was <hi>old</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> yet retaining his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he governed a great Family with that dexterity, that his Children feared him, his Neighbours respected him; and when a dishonourable Peace was likely to be made with <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> he caused himself to be carryed in his Chair to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and there did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually interpose to hinder it.</p>
                  <p>But that which should chiefly support a wise and good man under these <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes</hi> of the <hi>Senses,</hi> is, The comfortable <hi>review</hi> of the <hi>right use</hi> he hath made of them, that he hath not us'd them as <hi>Instruments of unrighteousness unto Sin,</hi> but as the <hi>Instruments of righteousness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God;</hi> or an hearty <hi>Grief</hi> for his <hi>Abuse</hi> of them: And the joyful <hi>Prospect</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> when all our Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will be done away, and <hi>our vile bodies made like Christs glorious body.</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:102503:83"/>
There's no body much grieved at the want of repair in a <hi>House</hi> which he is <hi>leaving,</hi> when he is ready to go to one that will need <hi>reparation</hi> no more. Yea, there is cause of <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> that we have enjoyed the use of these <hi>Senses so long,</hi> whereas we might have bin born <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>deaf,</hi> and <hi>dumb:</hi> but especially, that God hath given us a <hi>spiritual Eye,</hi> and an <hi>inward Ear.</hi>

                     <q>You should not, saith he, take it <hi>heavily,</hi> that you want such <hi>Eyes</hi> as <hi>Mice</hi> and other brute <hi>Animals</hi> enjoy, but rather reckon your self a <hi>blessed</hi> man, in having such <hi>eyes</hi> as <hi>Angels</hi> have, whereby you may <hi>behold God himself</hi> .</q>

                  <p>And through the <hi>Goodness of God</hi> it often falls out, that these outward <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> are more than compensated with greater measures of <hi>Understanding</hi> and of <hi>Memory.</hi> He may well be contented to lose an <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Ear,</hi> which must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish at last, that in lieu thereof receives a greater portion of <hi>Faith, Love, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and so becomes the

                  <p>It is also some <hi>alleviation</hi> of this <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi> to consider that all these <hi>Visible</hi> things are but <hi>Vanity,</hi> yea <hi>vanity of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi> That the <hi>Eye is not satisfied with seeing,</hi> nor <hi>the Ear filled with hearing, Eccles.</hi> 1. 2. 8.

And the <hi>Answer</hi> is not to be forgotten which <hi>Maris</hi> the <hi>Godly Bishop of Chalcedon</hi> gave to <hi>Iulian the Apostate,</hi> who upbraided him, that his <hi>God</hi> had not cured him of his <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> which was, That he praised his <hi>God</hi> with all his heart for his Blindness, whereby he was kept from seeing such an ungracious face, as his was.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> let us that feel these <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes,</hi> greatly magnify the <hi>Lord,</hi> who hath directed us to the use of <hi>Glasses</hi> and <hi>Spectacles,</hi> whereby we have in a

                  <p>Now this is a very <hi>sensible Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience:</hi> None of these afflictions <hi>are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but grievous</hi> with a witness.

And then for <hi>Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties,</hi> there are far more of young and middle-aged persons, that are <hi>slain</hi> and taken <hi>captives,</hi> than of the <hi>Old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither are <hi>all Aged</hi> people so laden with these <hi>pains and distempers;</hi> many of them having a very convenient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of health to their lives end. Thus <hi>Tully</hi> brings in <hi>Cato</hi> at <hi>eighty four</hi> years of age declaring, that notwithstanding these years, he was well enough to appear in the <hi>Senate,</hi> to defend his <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> and to entertain his <hi>Friends:</hi> And <hi>Masinissa,</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> that at <hi>fourscore</hi> and <hi>ten</hi> years old, he would not be perswaded to ride in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or to be covered on his head in the hardest frost, or sharpest storm. And one of the <hi>old</hi> men mentioned in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102503:86"/>
the <hi>first</hi> chapter, made nothing of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>twenty</hi> miles to dine with a <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> when he was above an <hi>hundred</hi> years old. Neither are these <hi>Diseases</hi> always the <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>Old-age,</hi> but rather of an <hi>heedless</hi> and <hi>intemperate</hi> youth. This layes up such crudities, surfeits and noxious humours, which lurk in us till <hi>Old-age,</hi> and then seize upon us; and then we find fault with the <hi>Choler</hi> in our <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,</hi> but forget the <hi>sweet meats</hi> which have caused it. So that this <hi>Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience</hi> doth neither befall <hi>all Old</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor <hi>only</hi> them, nor only upon the <hi>account</hi> of their <hi>Old-age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The best <hi>Supports</hi> however for the <hi>Aged</hi> under their <hi>Maladies,</hi> are a <hi>deep Study</hi> on the <hi>Wisdom, Power, Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> of God. His <hi>Wisdom,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he knows what condition is best for us. His <hi>Power,</hi> whereby he hath all Diseases at his Command, as the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> had his servants. His <hi>Goodness,</hi> whereby he pities us more than the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest Parent doth his weak Child; who also <hi>knoweth our frame, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that we are but dust,</hi> Psal. 103. 13, 14. His <hi>Promises,</hi> that he will not <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict</hi> without <hi>need,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. that he <hi>will correct</hi> in <hi>measure,</hi> Jer. 30. 11. that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102503:86"/>
he will not <hi>leave us,</hi> Psal. 23. 4. that all shall <hi>work</hi> for the best, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. that he will <hi>cease,</hi> when his good <hi>Ends</hi> are accomplished, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>And then we should revolve the great <hi>Benefit</hi> and use of them. For by our <hi>Distempers</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> is pleased to shew us more effectually the <hi>frailty</hi> of our Condition, the <hi>Evil of sin,</hi> the <hi>Vanity</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and many other <hi>Lessons</hi> that are not commonly learn'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. It's plain, that these are fair <hi>warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to us to provide a <hi>better house</hi> for the <hi>Soul,</hi> that will endure. In this <hi>Disease,</hi> said <hi>Old Olevian,</hi> I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know aright what <hi>sin</hi> is, and what the <hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is. Nay, said that <hi>Learned Rivet</hi> near his death, I have learned more <hi>Divinity</hi> in these <hi>Ten dayes</hi> of my <hi>Sickness,</hi> than in <hi>Fifty years</hi> before; it hath sent me home into my self. And now who would not be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> with such useful <hi>Discipline?</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, try it who will, there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Life without some <hi>Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Marriage</hi> is desired, they are S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi>'s words<note n="h" place="margin">Hom. 11. in Hex.</note>, but how many <hi>troubles</hi> in it? <hi>Children</hi> are long'd for, but how many <hi>griefs</hi> with them? rich People are counted happy, but how many thorns

are found there? These are the <hi>tributes</hi> of Life, which if a man know how to bear patiently, his <hi>Soul</hi> will be better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his <hi>Vertues</hi> adorned. Our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to prepare for them beforehand, to lay up a stock of <hi>Prayers,</hi> of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> of <hi>Promises,</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> of <hi>Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and when they come, to <hi>possess our Souls in patience,</hi> to resign up our selves to the holy will of <hi>God,</hi> and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not turn off this our <hi>Burden,</hi> to carry it with all the ease and satisfaction we can; and to keep a sound mind, if we cannot have a sound body.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102503:87"/>
The <hi>Cynick Philosopher,</hi> when he was asked, what was the most calamitous Creature in the world, confidently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>It was an indigent Old person.</hi> Likewise every body is ready to injure and run down the <hi>Aged,</hi> reckoning that they are least able to defend themselves. For as to the weakest part of the body, there is a confluence of all <hi>humours,</hi> which settle there, so very often it falls out, that a combination of troubles seize upon <hi>Aged</hi> people, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 18. <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when thou wast young thou gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst thy self, and walkedst whither thou wouldst: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of these Troubles, the <hi>sharpest</hi> are from their <hi>Relations;</hi> the <hi>Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of some, or the <hi>Death</hi> of others. How doth the pride, prodigality or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Grand-children</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, and grieve the hoary head! And how many <hi>Aged</hi> persons see husband, wife, children, and other dear Friends, and Relations posted to the grave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, which do each of them, as it were, tear away a piece of him, and leave him as <hi>a sparrow alone upon the</hi>

                     <hi>house-top?</hi> In short, <hi>Old-age</hi> is recorded as the <hi>Sink</hi> of mans life, into which run all the miseries incident to humane nature.</p>
                  <p>And that which makes this <hi>Burden</hi> more grievous, is, That these seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the persons when their <hi>strength</hi> is <hi>spent,</hi> their <hi>spirits low,</hi> and their bodily <hi>infirmities many.</hi> They are within sight of the shore, and yet in danger to be sunk and wrack'd, with the storms which beat upon them. When they had thought all their troubles had been blown over, it frets them sore to meet them again. And especially, if they have had <hi>plenty</hi> and <hi>prosperity</hi> in the course of their lives, their <hi>straits, losses</hi> and <hi>troubles,</hi> now ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their affliction.</p>
                  <p>Now to Mitigate these Pressures we must know, 1. That these <hi>Crosses</hi> are <hi>common</hi> to all. As they do not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attend <hi>all Aged</hi> persons, for many have fair weather all their journey long; so they befall <hi>all mankind</hi> indifferently in every part of life. If these be <hi>Miseries,</hi> there's no mortal man without his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. We are in this World, as <hi>Israel</hi> was in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> who had no <hi>day</hi> without a <hi>Cloud,</hi> but then they had no <hi>night</hi> without a <hi>glympse of light.</hi> Where
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102503:88"/>
dwells the man, or of what Cloth is his coat made, who hath not met with <hi>straits,</hi> and with <hi>vexations?</hi> that hath not buried many of his <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Friends?</hi> so that we must quarrel with every age, as well as <hi>Old-age,</hi> yea with the <hi>Providence of God</hi> by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>2. These <hi>Crosses</hi> and <hi>Losses</hi> are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>Hurtful to none.</hi> They are not properly and intirely <hi>Evils. Criminal</hi> evils are <hi>real</hi> Evils, <hi>poenal</hi> Evils are not so. These <hi>fluunt a summo bono,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by <hi>Him</hi> that is eminently <hi>Good; ducunt ad summum bonum,</hi> they guide and help us towards the greatest <hi>Good; erant in summo Bono,</hi> they were upon <hi>him</hi> who was intirely <hi>Good. Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> hath, but <hi>Adversity</hi> hath never hurt a good man. Yea some of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>

                     </note> have been bold to judge those men <hi>miserable,</hi> that have never met with <hi>any</hi> troubles. They are our <hi>Physick,</hi> which may <hi>disturb</hi> us; but <hi>Sin</hi> is our <hi>Poyson,</hi> which will <hi>destroy</hi> us.

                  <p>3. They are <hi>Useful</hi> to those that are <hi>good.</hi> Though they be briars, thorns and thistles in themselves, yet by the

blessing of <hi>God,</hi> they prove <hi>sweet-bryars</hi> and <hi>holy-thistles</hi> to holy men. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things do we count Evil, that are most wholsom for us? They Exercise our <hi>Faith,</hi> our <hi>Wisdom,</hi> our <hi>Patience,</hi> and the tryal of these is more precious than <hi>of fine gold.</hi> They teach us, as was said of <hi>Diseases,</hi> many lessons more effectually, than the <hi>Word</hi> it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them can do. The <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> and the <hi>Executioner</hi> do both <hi>bind</hi> men, but to different Ends; the one doth it to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave</hi> of life, the other to <hi>preserve</hi> it<note n="k" place="margin">Chamier.</note>. When the good man is <hi>bound in fetters, and holden in cords of affliction, Then the Lord sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. He openeth also their ears to discipline,</hi> Job 36. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>4. These <hi>Crosses</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> are most fit for <hi>Old men.</hi> They are or should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102503:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may the better receive <hi>evil.</hi> As <hi>Cato</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi> answers <hi>Caecilius,</hi> who objected this against <hi>Old-age,</hi> that living long a man sees many displeasing and <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable</hi> events; Yea, said he, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many <hi>comfortable</hi> things also<note n="l" place="margin">Quod diu vivendo multa quae non vult vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det: R.

                     </note>. But the true and only <hi>Remedy</hi> against this <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> is <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience;</hi> which the wise <hi>God</hi> hath largely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the <hi>11th. and 12th. Chapters of the Hebrews.</hi> By these a sound <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> shall not only <hi>bear</hi> these Onsets, but <hi>overcome</hi> them, and adorn the hoary head with <hi>trophies.</hi> We cannot, saith a <hi>Foreigner</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> change the course of things, but we can take a good heart, a masculine spirit, to bear <hi>sad accidents</hi> with <hi>substantial courage,</hi> and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to <hi>Providence</hi>

And present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again, It is our best way to abide what we cannot amend, and to attend <hi>God</hi> without murmuring, from whom all ailments come; for it is an ill Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that follows his <hi>Commander</hi> grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note n="n" place="margin">Optimum est pati, quod emendare non possis; &amp; Deum, quo auctore cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta proveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt sine mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muratione comitari: malus miles est, qui Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorem ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Sen.</hi>
                     </note>. But we have a more sure <hi>word of prophecy,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. <hi>All things,</hi> mark it, <hi>all things work together for good to them that love God, that are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpose:</hi> Which blessed <hi>word,</hi> if it be understood, believed and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102503:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
considered; and our love to God and effectual calling evinced, is alone able, <hi>Gods spirit</hi> accompanying it, to settle, quiet, and comfort our hearts under all troubles whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore be the chief care of all <hi>Aged</hi> Persons to <hi>make their calling and election sure,</hi> to strengthen their Faith in <hi>God,</hi> and by their hope to travel into the other World; for then only will our <hi>afflictions</hi> feel <hi>light, while we look not at things seen, but at things unseen.</hi> The thoughts of the grave will mortifie us to <hi>things seen,</hi> and the thoughts of the Countrey beyond the grave will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the <hi>unseen World,</hi> and then our troubles will be easie, and our crosses blessings. The sight of the approaching shore, will make an <hi>Aged</hi> Person bear the present storms with chearfulness, knowing that he shall shortly be well, either <hi>under Heaven,</hi> or <hi>in Heaven: None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my self, so that I may finish my course with joy,</hi> Act. 20. 24.</p>

At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> charged on <hi>Old-age</hi> is, <hi>That it is attended with Contempt.</hi> Old People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are <hi>despis'd,</hi> especially when they are not supported with <hi>good Estates.</hi> Most People avoid them, and treat them as <hi>superfluous Creatures.</hi> For the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men do value others not for their <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>real Vertue,</hi> but either for some <hi>likeness</hi> of disposition, or some <hi>usefulness.</hi> Now the <hi>Ancient</hi> are not, by the <hi>disparity</hi> of their years, so <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant,</hi> nor by their <hi>disability</hi> so <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> as heretofore; and thereupon they are <hi>contemned</hi> by younger people: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially also when they are grown <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit,</hi> and confin'd to their chairs or chambers; then are they an eye-sore to their <hi>successors,</hi> who secretly wish them well in Heaven, or any where out of their way upon Earth. It is too evident, how unpleasing their groans, their coughing, and their other weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are. They that can brook the <hi>peevishness,</hi> and the <hi>uncleanliness</hi> of their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102503:91"/>
                     <hi>Children,</hi> cannot bear with it in their <hi>Parents:</hi> All their former <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> are forgotten, and they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, as last years <hi>Almanacks,</hi> wholly out of date.</p>
                  <p>Now this is a sore <hi>Affliction,</hi> and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es man or woman to the quick. For such as have been regarded and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, to be neglected and despised, grates even the most ingenuous spirits. <hi>Iob</hi> 29. 30. <hi>Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel: but now they that are younger than I, have me in derision; they abhor me, they flee from me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Miserrimum est fuisse felicem.</hi> The <hi>respects</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> that one hath <hi>formerly</hi> had, makes his <hi>present contempt</hi> more intolerable. Not but that a good man is <hi>satisfied with himself;</hi> but he is aware, that hereby he is rendred <hi>unuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to others: For when the <hi>Person</hi> is despised, his <hi>Example</hi> nor his <hi>Counsel,</hi> let them be never so profitable, will be regardable or useful: He passes for an old <hi>Dotard,</hi> and there's an end. The truth is, every man would be <hi>beloved,</hi> and in some sort <hi>esteemed,</hi> but when on the contrary, he perceives that he is <hi>nothing set by,</hi> what should he do in this world? That man is a burden to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102503:91"/>
                     <hi>himself,</hi> who discerns that he is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to <hi>every body else.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet as we have observed in <hi>other Cases,</hi> This <hi>Inconvenience</hi> is not <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>Old-age,</hi> as if they <hi>only</hi> were despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or set at nought: For they that will contemn them, will set light by any other sober and wise Person also, yea they will contemn <hi>God himself.</hi> Plain is the connexion, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 32. <hi>Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.</hi> They that will despise an <hi>Ancient</hi> Person upon that score, will despise the <hi>Ancient of dayes</hi> himself; so that they are not alone under this <hi>Inconvenience.</hi> Neither is this <hi>Contempt universal;</hi> some young persons have that <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which teacheth them to value, and respect their <hi>Elders.</hi> Thus <hi>Tully</hi> again brings in <hi>Cato</hi> answering <hi>Caecilius,</hi> who had said, that there was nothing more miserable in <hi>Old-age,</hi> than to find themselves <hi>odious</hi> to others; nay, sayes <hi>Gato,</hi> I believe such <hi>Old</hi> men as we, are very acceptable to such young men as you, <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius:</hi> And so goes on, shewing that look as <hi>Old men</hi> take pleasure in vertuous young men, though far inferiour to them, in age and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102503:92"/>
so all <hi>Iudicious</hi> young men take delight, and yield great respect to grave and <hi>Ancient</hi> men: And thus <hi>Plato</hi> brings in <hi>Socrates</hi> saying, I love to hear the Discourses of <hi>Old</hi> men, seeing they have already traced the way that I must go.

                  <p>But as we have observed in <hi>other</hi> Cases, this <hi>Grievance</hi> is not <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>Old-age.</hi> But people of all Ages have divers ways become unable to serve their generation.

their places. Some by the <hi>Procurement</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> by whom many in the prime of their time have been laid aside; sometimes <hi>justly,</hi> sometimes <hi>unjustly,</hi> and all opportunity taken from them of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good in the World.

And not only the <hi>Tongues,</hi> but the <hi>Hands</hi> of very many <hi>Old</hi> people are found as nimble to <hi>good works,</hi> as of younger Persons.

Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> observes that an industrious <hi>Bee,</hi> never degenerates into a <hi>Drone,</hi> in its <hi>Old-age.</hi> Too many there be of every Age that live only to themselves, that neither <hi>Serve God,</hi> nor <hi>observe Man,</hi> but in order to their own <hi>Interest,</hi> or <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite:</hi> These are good for nothing, young or old; but they that understand, and embrace the true <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> will be useful one way or other, to their lives end.</p>
                  <p>And the great <hi>Service</hi> that the <hi>Ancient</hi>

So that although they cannot do <hi>that</hi> service, which younger persons may, yet they do greater: For the greatest things are compassed, not by <hi>strength,</hi> but <hi>counsel.</hi> They cannot be counted useless, says <hi>Tully,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the more raw and ignorant their work. Like as a <hi>Pilot,</hi> who thô he run not up and down the Ship, but sits at the helm, yet is the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful person in the ship: So the <hi>Aged head</hi> is the most useful part in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Commonwealth, though it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the <hi>fire side</hi>

For when a man is harras'd with cares and troubles all the week long, yet he is relieved and refreshed in his approach unto <hi>God</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>own Day:</hi> But with the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit <hi>Old man,</hi> every day is alike, and his Soul is left destitute of spiritual supplies in an ordinary way. And this <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is saddest of all, when by <hi>disuse</hi> of the means of Grace, the <hi>Soul</hi> grows <hi>stupid</hi> and unconcern'd in the matter; as without special <hi>Grace,</hi> we shall be apt to be: So that the misery is <hi>great</hi> in the <hi>want,</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> when <hi>insensible</hi>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:102503:97"/>
of the <hi>want.</hi> No great wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that when all these miseries meet together, a man cry out with <hi>Iob, I would not live always.</hi> So that <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> had a saying, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, that it was a shameful thing for a man that was past <hi>sixty,</hi> to stretch out his hand to a <hi>Physician;</hi> reckoning that it was fit he should then be content to dye.</p>
                  <p>But yet, if we weigh the matter well, the Case of <hi>Ancient</hi> people is not so <hi>desperate</hi> as it seems.

Thus <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> though his <hi>Eyes were set for Age,</hi> yet was enabled to prophecy to <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s wife. And <hi>Iacob</hi> could <hi>worship God, leaning on the top of his Staff.</hi> And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> when he was an <hi>hundred</hi> years old.

                  <p>And though they should become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to frequent the <hi>Publick Ordinances of God,</hi> yet they may pray, and sigh, and meditate in their <hi>chambers;</hi> and these, proceeding from a sincere and sensible Soul, are most acceptable unto <hi>God.</hi> As for the <hi>external Acts</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they avail nothing without <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> which lodge in the heart. The <hi>immanent Acts</hi> of the Soul, which are to understand, to meditate, to will, and to desire, do most perfect the same. And where the <hi>Deed</hi> cannot be done, <hi>God</hi> doth accept the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>Deed.</hi> The weakest and poorest <hi>Old man</hi> or <hi>woman</hi> may have <hi>high</hi> meditations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>low</hi> roof, and a <hi>large</hi> heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>narrow</hi> walls.</p>
                  <p>No <hi>Aged</hi> person therefore should be discouraged by their <hi>Inability</hi> for <hi>Gods Service;</hi> since <hi>He knoweth their frame,</hi> he <hi>remembreth that they are but dust.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> hath said, <hi>When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst: I the Lord will</hi>

For in <hi>Religion</hi> there is a <hi>Body</hi> and a <hi>Soul.</hi> The <hi>Body</hi> of it consists in the <hi>Form of Godliness;</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> of it, is that which animates all the outward Acts, and is fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Power of Godliness;</hi> for that the <hi>Activity</hi> and force of any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Soul,</hi> or inward <hi>Principle.</hi> Now the separating this <hi>form</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of Godliness, like as that of the Soul and Body, is the <hi>death</hi> of Godliness.

it's just Latitude, comprehending the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> from a right <hi>principle,</hi> in a right <hi>manner,</hi> and to a right <hi>end,</hi> and expressing it self in a <hi>sober, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> life. And however the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Atheist</hi> may wickedly <hi>deride</hi> it on the one hand, or the rotten <hi>Hypocrite</hi> falsly <hi>pretend</hi> it on the other; yet there is a wonderful excellency in it, and an absolute necessity of it, even the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> of it's greatest <hi>Enemies,</hi> first or last, being <hi>Iudges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this serious <hi>Piety, Old-age</hi> is more propense, than any other age of man. Insomuch as we find divers in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and other <hi>Stories</hi> bent for Heaven in their <hi>declining years,</hi> who in the former parts of their lives minded nothing, but the World and the Flesh. They whom no Perswasions, no Ordinances, no Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could fully reduce to the <hi>obedience of Christ,</hi> yet the lively sense and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own <hi>decay,</hi> and of their <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> to the eternal Judgment obligeth them to true repentance, and to <hi>make their calling and election sure.</hi> So that it hath pass'd for an <hi>Observation,</hi> that they who are not <hi>fair</hi> at <hi>twenty, strong</hi> at <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wise</hi> at <hi>forty, rich</hi> at <hi>fifty, pious</hi> at <hi>sixty;</hi> are never like to be <hi>fair,</hi> or <hi>strong,</hi>

As a Man in <hi>sailing,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> the nearer he comes to the Shore, the nearer he would be; so the nearer I am to <hi>God,</hi> the nearer still I would be.

and having more leisure, and being somewhat <hi>retired</hi> out of the throng of worldly business, they are fitter to <hi>recollect</hi> these things, and to <hi>reduce</hi> them into practice.</p>
                  <p>And this certainly is a great <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> to have a greater <hi>Aptitude</hi> to that which is <hi>good.</hi> Alas, young people are under a great disadvantage herein: it's true, their <hi>Faculties</hi> are more nimble, and their <hi>Memories</hi> more fresh; but then they come into the World like <hi>raw Souldiers</hi> into the Field; they are compassed and daily allured with divers <hi>Temptations,</hi> and have boisterous <hi>lusts</hi> within themselves, and so they are in a more remote distance from true <hi>Piety.</hi> They are like an unruly <hi>Colt</hi> in a large and fat Pasture, there's no coming near them, till they are driven into a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, till their way be <hi>hedged up with Thorns,</hi> and then you may catch them.

be heard, and his counsel shall be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that though <hi>Old-age</hi> will not <hi>bring</hi> a man to Heaven, yet it will <hi>fit</hi> a man for it, it removes the Obstacles of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and promotes the Exercises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Repentance</hi> may be considered, in a <hi>Double</hi> respect. 1. <hi>Initially,</hi> at the <hi>first Conversion</hi> of the Soul to God; and 2. <hi>Secondarily,</hi> at the <hi>Renewing</hi> of the <hi>acts</hi> thereof afterwards. It concerns <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> people to be acquainted <hi>respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> with both. This needful message then is directed,</p>
                  <p>1.

Now that a <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Repentance</hi> or <hi>Conversion,</hi> call it how you will, is <hi>necessary</hi> to all that shall be saved, I should think is past dispute. For it cannot be denyed, that we come into the world in a <hi>sinful</hi> state: And it is manifest, that <hi>Baptism</hi> doth not cure the Soul of that <hi>Disease;</hi> but that all people in general have a strong <hi>propensity</hi> either to the <hi>lusts of the flesh,</hi> or <hi>to the lusts of the eyes,</hi> or to <hi>pride of life,</hi> until an inward <hi>Change</hi> be wrought in the <hi>heart;</hi> which is the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102503:126"/>
effectual <hi>Calling</hi> of a careless Sinner, to turn to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Godliness.</hi> Now if an <hi>Aged</hi> person have been a stranger to this <hi>Grace,</hi> though perhaps he hath led a sober, industrious, just, yea a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>life,</hi> and also hath complied with the outward <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>devotion</hi> in use: Yet except the <hi>tree</hi> have been made good by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> it cannot have its <hi>fruit unto holiness,</hi> nor <hi>the end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would therefore conjure all such <hi>Unconverted Old</hi> people, to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with all speed and seriousness to this <hi>First Repentance;</hi> to be <hi>renewed in the spirit of your minds,</hi> to make you <hi>new hearts and new spirits,</hi> or else infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly you <hi>must dye.</hi> Say not with <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, How can a man be born when he is old?</hi> For the <hi>Work</hi> is <hi>possible</hi> and the <hi>Method</hi> is <hi>plain.</hi> Harder it may be for an <hi>Old man</hi> to become a <hi>New man,</hi> than for the younger; hence the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, An old naught, will never be ought:</hi> That is rarely, or difficulty, according to the <hi>Greek</hi> saying<note n="s" place="margin">

Nor lastly, is this <hi>Assurance</hi> confin'd to <hi>Grace</hi> at <hi>present,</hi> but extends to <hi>final Salvation.</hi> Thus the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed;</hi> there is <hi>Assurance</hi> of his <hi>present</hi> State, but was he certain of his <hi>Perseverance?</hi> Yes, that follows, <hi>and I am perswaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That such <hi>Assurance hath been attained,</hi> is clear enough from the Instances of <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 25, 26. of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 16. 9, 10. of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. and <hi>many</hi> others. That it <hi>may</hi> be <hi>attained,</hi> is as clear; sith there is no intimation that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102503:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
these, or the rest, had any <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Discovery</hi> thereof unto them, but arriv'd thereat in the use of <hi>those means,</hi> and by the consignation of <hi>that Spirit,</hi> unto which we have <hi>access</hi> as well as they. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth expresly comprehend the generality of Believers in this <hi>Priviledge,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>For we know, that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved,</hi> we <hi>have a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God,</hi> &amp;c. That it <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured</hi> by all true <hi>Christians,</hi> is most evident from the plain <hi>commands</hi> to that purpose, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give diligence to make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election sure,</hi> &amp;c. That few <hi>do labour</hi> to attain it, thinking it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible or unnecessary, is to be bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That <hi>many deceive</hi> themselves with a false perswasion of present Grace and future Glory, is manifest by <hi>Scripture</hi> and daily <hi>Experience.</hi> And that it is most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>needful</hi> for <hi>Old</hi> people, the thing it self speaks.</p>
                  <p>For you cannot deny but that you have <hi>Souls,</hi> immortal Souls, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spirits</hi> cannnot dye, but must return to <hi>God</hi> that gave them: and are these Souls of so small value to be left to a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> to an <hi>everlasting</hi> venture? And it
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102503:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is as evident, that this <hi>life</hi> is <hi>uncertain:</hi> we may say as <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> 27. 2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now, I am Old, I know not the day of my Death;</hi> and therefore it's time for us to go about this work without <hi>delay.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren desire the time of youth, and youth longs to be at mans age, and they then would live to be <hi>Old,</hi> but <hi>Old-age</hi> hath no further <hi>Age</hi> to desire<note n="b" place="margin">August. <hi>Ep. 110.</hi>
                     </note>, it hath none other to succeed it here, and they are wholly uncertain how long it will last; and therefore it is absolutely necessary, that they should be on <hi>sure</hi> grounds for <hi>Eternity,</hi> and then the <hi>day of death will be better than the day of their Birth.</hi> You know how much of your life is already spent, you can see the <hi>Sands</hi> that are run into the <hi>nether</hi> end of the <hi>Glass,</hi> but the <hi>upper</hi> Part is covered with a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> you know not how <hi>few Sands</hi> are left there to run.

You are <hi>filled with Wrinkles which is a Witness against you, and your leanness rising up in you, beareth witness to your Face, as it is,</hi> Job 16. 8. For as it is observed of <hi>All</hi> men, that they are <hi>Mortales,</hi> apt to dye, and of all <hi>Good</hi> men, that they are <hi>Mortificati,</hi> dying to Sin; so it is of all <hi>Old</hi> men, that they

                  <p>And here the <hi>Aged</hi> shall do well not only to plead their <hi>own Cause</hi> with God, but to lay up a stock for <hi>Posterity,</hi> that the generations yet <hi>unborn</hi> may be the better for them.

our incessant <hi>Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Increase,</hi> the <hi>Unity</hi> and the <hi>Happiness</hi> thereof.

                     <hi>of the Younger. God</hi> hath in great Wisdom lodged his various gifts in divers subjects, that there may be a <hi>mutual dependance</hi> one upon another, and a <hi>mutual helpfulness</hi> of each to others. Thus he intrusts the <hi>Young</hi> with <hi>Strength</hi> to support and aid the <hi>Elder,</hi> whose strength is decayed; and the <hi>Aged</hi> with <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi> to guide the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whose judgment is yet unripe. And as it is a great misery, when the <hi>Aged</hi> are not relieved by the strength and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of those that are <hi>young,</hi> so it is a great infelicity, when the <hi>Aged</hi> are either unable or unwilling to instruct, or when those who are <hi>young</hi> are too <hi>careless</hi> or <hi>conceited</hi> to receive Instruction. That is therefore a barbarous Precept in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and like the rest of that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, You are not obliged to lead men in</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The whole Current of <hi>Scripture</hi> runs for this <hi>Practice.</hi> Thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we may gather from <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. Thus <hi>Iacob</hi>—Thus <hi>Moses,</hi> leaving more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that excellent <hi>Chapter, Deuter.</hi> 32. just before he died, for an <hi>Instruction</hi> to those he left behind him. The like did <hi>Ioshua,</hi> in <hi>Cap.</hi> 24. when he was <hi>Aged,</hi> and about to dy. So <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. So <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. to his Son. <hi>And thou Solomon my Son,</hi> &amp;c. Thus did <hi>Peter</hi> when he was <hi>ready to put off his Tabernacle,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13. and the like did <hi>Aged Paul</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> when the time of his departure was at hand, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5, 6. So that we have a whole <hi>cloud of Witnesses,</hi> showring down their counsels and directions on the younger sort.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Aged</hi> are furnished for this <hi>Imployment,</hi> having <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> for such purposes. Their peculiar <hi>Talent</hi> lies this way; For <hi>Dayes should speak and multitude of years should teach know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Ioh</hi> 32. 9.

                     <hi>sinful</hi> acts and practices, and endeavour to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them unto posterity, that each ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration may be <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>worse than other; so all wise and good men, especially when they are <hi>in years,</hi> should transmit the knowledge and practice of <hi>Piety</hi> to their Successors, that the next age may be better than this; and that when we are dead and gone, yet it may be truly said, <hi>the world was the better for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides these <hi>Instructions</hi> in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> it lies in the power and way of many <hi>Ancient</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to direct and advise the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102503:141"/>
in many useful <hi>Observations</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: As concerning the <hi>Education</hi> of their Children, and the disposing of them into <hi>Callings</hi> or <hi>Marriage;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preservation or recovery of their <hi>health.</hi> And in case they have any peculiar <hi>Skill, Receipt,</hi> or <hi>Art</hi> use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the good of Mankind, they ought not to bury it in their graves, but to assign it to Posterity. And whatsoever you have learned or observed, that may be <hi>beneficial</hi> or any way <hi>useful</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> to your <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, Town</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> all these <hi>Notices</hi> you should communicate to those that are younger, with all possible fidelity and exactness. And if need be, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to <hi>writing</hi> for the benefit, at least, of your own <hi>posterity.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your <hi>Instructions</hi> may not at present seem to be much <hi>regarded,</hi> yet be not discouraged by this; for the wise Counsels of the <hi>Ancient,</hi> like the <hi>seed of the word of God,</hi> seems to dye and to be lost, and yet in process of time it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives, and brings forth fruit.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, there is <hi>Wisdom</hi> to be used in the <hi>Instructing</hi> of young people. For they too commonly are proud, conceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ed, and self-witted: your <hi>Lessons</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

must be at such <hi>seasons,</hi> and by such <hi>degrees,</hi> as may render them most valuable and welcome: and must be sweetned with that <hi>love</hi> and <hi>dearness,</hi> and withal interlac'd with such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant <hi>Diversion,</hi> that their Appetite may not be cloyed, nor your grave Advices be distasted. Thus the <hi>Emperor Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> accosted his Hearers. <hi>Audite Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes senem, quem senes juvenem audiverunt;</hi> You that are young, hearken to me, that now am old, whom Old men hearkened unto, when I was yet but young.</p>
                  <p>Finally, your <hi>Example</hi> should be a <hi>Continual Instruction</hi> to young people. They that will not heed your <hi>good words,</hi> yet seeing your <hi>good works</hi> will have a constant copy before them, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to write after it.

most comfortable for <hi>Ancient</hi> people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 4. <hi>Even to your Old-age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear, even I will carry, and will deliver you.</hi> When our feeble <hi>legs</hi> will not <hi>carry</hi> us; when the <hi>pillars</hi> of the <hi>house tremble,</hi> and in effect cry out, <hi>we can bear you no longer;</hi> then will the power and goodness of God <hi>carry us</hi> up and <hi>deliver us,</hi> yea when we approach to <hi>Death,</hi> and fear presents it, and the grave most formidably, we may then apply what the <hi>Lord</hi> spake to <hi>Old Iacob,</hi> concerning his going down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 46. 3. <hi>I am God, the God of thy father, fear not to go down into Egypt: For I will go down with thee, and will also surely bring thee up again.</hi> So assuredly will the <hi>Lord go down</hi> with us to the grave, and as surely <hi>bring us up</hi> again, and how can we be afraid with such <hi>company,</hi> and with such a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise?</hi> Hoard on still, there is another gracious <hi>Promise,</hi> Psal. 23. 4. <hi>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me:</hi> More yet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. last. <hi>For this God is our God for ever and ever, he will be our guide even unto death.</hi> These

and such like <hi>Promises,</hi> left by him that <hi>cannot lye,</hi> will support the sinking spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a poor <hi>Christian</hi> more than all the <hi>friends,</hi> the <hi>cordials,</hi> the extrinsick <hi>comforts</hi> in the whole world.</p>

What is it that makes <hi>Death</hi> terrible to a poor creature?

But a lively <hi>Faith</hi> flies to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> runs into his wounds, lays hold on his everlasting righteousness, and so bids defiance to <hi>Satan,</hi> yea even to the <hi>law,</hi> and all his <hi>sins,</hi> with, <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that dyed.</hi> It is related in an <hi>Epistle</hi> prefixed to <hi>Brenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s works, that when a certain <hi>Senator</hi> in <hi>Suevia</hi> lay dying, one like a <hi>Scribe</hi> came into his chamber with pen and paper, calling to him to reckon up his <hi>sins;</hi> for, saith he, I am sent from <hi>God</hi> to bring an account of them to his <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal:</hi> Well, saith the <hi>Sick man,</hi> raising up himself as well as he could, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he had to do with his great Enemy, the <hi>Devil;</hi> write this down <hi>first, The seed of the woman shall break the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head,</hi> and thou mayst write all my sins under it: Whereupon the <hi>Accuser of the brethren</hi> presently vanished, and left the weak man in peace.</p>
                  <p>And you will have need of <hi>Patience</hi> also, that after ye have <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the <hi>will of God,</hi> ye may <hi>receive the promise,</hi> Heb. 10. 36.

                  <p>Many <hi>useful</hi> things may be done in <hi>this life,</hi> which cannot be done by you when this life is ended.

                  <p>Bethink your selves therefore, which way you may yet do some good in the world.

                  <p>And here let all <hi>Aged</hi> persons beware of the <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Carnal Security</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.

argument for your salvation; for <hi>God</hi> hath said, <hi>that the sinner being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old shall be accursed,</hi> Isa. 65. 20.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Others</hi> that have been serious and serviceable in their dayes, may perhaps presume upon what they <hi>have been</hi> or <hi>have done,</hi> as if they might be <hi>justified</hi> thereby; or else that they need to take no further pains about their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or others good; whereas in <hi>the morning</hi> we must <hi>sow our seed,</hi> and not <hi>withhold our hand in the evening; for we know not whether shall prosper, either this or that; or whether they both shall be alike good:</hi> Which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> applies to this matter; Say not, saith he, I have been diligent while I was able; I may rest my self in mine <hi>Old-age;</hi> for thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not, whether shall more please and honour <hi>God</hi> in thy Youth, or in thine Age <note n="r" place="margin">Hier. in <hi>Eccl. 11.</hi>
