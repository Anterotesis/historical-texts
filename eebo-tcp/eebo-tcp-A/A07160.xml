            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ARY THE AEGIPTIAN being but 12. yeares old, left her Parents and came to Alexandria: where for 17 yeares she prostituted her selfe to insatiable lust. And to allure more to her company, exposed on free cost to their pleasure, mayntayning her self in the meane time by begging and spinning of wool. It hapned that many sailed to Hierusalem to celebrate the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuity of the exaltation of the Holy Crosse; whither she also trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not out of piety, but to gaine new associats to her sensual delights. And now arriued euen at the gates of the Temple, the rest continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entring, she alone strangely suffred repulse. Which hauing 3. or 4. times susteyned; at length she vnderstood that for her sinnes she was deemed vnworthy to behold the holy Crosse. Wherefore seriously touched with compunction, and prostrate before an Image of the Blessed Virgin, she implored her aide, that with the rest she might behold &amp; honor that sacred Instrument of our Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption; promising from that time neuer to contaminate her self with luxurious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. Then assaying to enter, she found no stoppage as before; but (like the sea rowling forward the waues) the multitude impelle her into the Temple. There according to her desire, hauing honoured the sanctified wood; she returned to the place, where formerly she had made her promise to the Blessed Virgin. And a voice from heauen directed her how she should dispose of her self for the glory of God
<pb facs="tcp:12682:3"/>
and her eternal behoof. Whervpon taking with her three loaues of course bread, she hastned to the wildernes; and there for the space of 47. yeares, liued in such austerity as she neither beheld man nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature, confining her self to the presence of God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels her sole spectators; her loaues after lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g tract of time being spent, she for 17. yeares sustained her feeble body with hearbs onely &amp; rootes; her garments rotting &amp; falling from her: she was long so afflicted with winters cold and scortching heats of that clymate, as often fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; void of breath, she layd on the ground destitute of sense &amp; motion. For the first 17. yeares after her entrance into the wildernes, she was assayled with vgly and violent temptations; but through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine assistance still victorious. To conclude after a wonderful and most penitential life, interseasoned with diuine consolations, Zozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas (a blessed Monk) coming into that part of the desart, found her out; and ministred vnto her the B. Sacrament on the Euening of Maundy Thursday, and after spiritual conference with her departed the yeare following vpon her appointment, returning he found her deceased in a caue: whither a lyon then approaching digged vp a graue, in which with teares &amp; prayers she was interred by Zozimas. The Romane Martyrologe and</hi> Vsuard <hi>recount her day the 2. of Aprill. The Grecians in their Menaloge obserue it the day before. Nicephorus lib. 7. cap. 5. affirmeth her life to haue been written by Sophronius Bishop of Hierusalem. The same is cited in the 2. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice. And by St. Iohn Damascen. orat. 3. de Imag: and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Latine by Paul Diacon. Neopoleas, is extant in vitis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum: it was also composed in verse by Hyldebrand Episc. Senon: and by Bonad. Santon lib. 3. Monad: 29. and others. She liued about the yeare of Christ. 520. in the time of Iustine the elder.</hi>
