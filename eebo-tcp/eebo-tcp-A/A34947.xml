            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Play was written by a Gentleman, (my
particular Friend) whoſe Affairs call'd him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own Country juſt as 'twas Acted; and
having left the Publiſhing of it to my Care, I knew not
a Nobler way to diſcharge my Truſt, than that of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the forſaken Infant at your Door, under whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
it may ſafely venture into the World. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of your Houſe will guard it from the Aſſaults of
Criticks, and your Generoſity (I hope) will allow it a
portion of your Eſteem. Your Love to Muſick is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
great, and your Skill confeſs'd by the beſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Age. 'Tis reaſonably to be ſuppos'd then,
that you bear no ſmall Affection to its elder Brother Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry.</p>
            <p>I'm not a Poet, Sir, and therefore won't offer to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Beauties, or excuſe the Infirmities of this. But
ſince the Town has receiv'd it as good, it gave me
Courage to lay it at the feet of ſo great a Judge as your
ſelf.</p>
            <p>In this Dedication, Sir, I find an Happineſs of which
every Man is conſcious; I mean, Sir, I'm freed from the
neceſſity of flattering my Benefactor, and expoſing my
own weakneſs. Your Virtues are already ſufficiently
<pb facs="tcp:56577:3"/>
known, and your great Character exalts you above ſo
mean a want as my Praiſes. Beſides, Sir, I'm no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to your Modeſty. My buſineſs then is only to beg
your Pardon for this Preſumption, and to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Acknowledgment of thoſe many Favours I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from you. I know this is not the way to ballance
'em, the Sum already exceeds my Stock, and I muſt of
neceſſity add to the Score, by begging the honour of
ſubſcribing my ſelf,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Play was ſo long expected e're it came into the World,
that I'm oblig'd in Juſtice to my ſelf, to excuſe its appearance at
a time when there were ſcarce Witneſſes in Town of its Birth.</p>
            <p>It was enter'd in the other Houſe, where Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> did me all
the Juſtice I cou'd indeed reaſonably hope for. But that Example he
gave, was not it ſeems to be follow'd by the whole Company, ſince 'tis
known that Mr. <hi>Bowman</hi> (I mention his Name to keep the reflection
from other ſharers) kept the firſt Character of my Play ſix weeks, and
then cou'd hardly read ſix lines on't. How far that way of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
makes of late for the Intereſt and Honour of that Houſe, is eaſie
to be judg'd. Some who valu'd their reputations more, were indeed
rarely or never abſent. To theſe I gave my thanks; but finding that
ſix or ſeven people cou'd not perform what was deſign'd for fifteen, I was
oblig'd to remove it after ſo many ſham Rehearſals, and in two days it
got footing upon the other Stage. Where 'twas immediately caſt to the
beſt Advantage, and Plaid in leſs than twenty days. How far it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
their labours, I leave to be judg'd by themſelves. Their Care and
Readineſs is confeſs'd by every Man, tho', at the ſame time 'tis not to
be ſuppos'd, that they act any Plays without a proſpect of pleaſing the
Town, of whoſe favour they juſtly ſtand poſſeſs'd. What juſtice I had
done me in the publick Performance, is very well demonſtratted by my
Succeſs.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Decoy</hi> ſo often receives money, is by ſome I find reputed a fault.
Women of her profeſſion do nothing without the ready pay. And let it
be ſuppos'd that ſhe gets too much, 'tis but to raiſe the Character, and
expoſe thoſe Cheats to better purpoſe. For you ſee, that notwithſtanding
of the Gentlemens Liberality, ſhe's falſe to their Intereſts, and owns that
ſhe's honeſt, only becauſe ſhe cou'd hope no benefit by being otherwiſe; and
indeed had ſhe baulk'd them at laſt, 'tis not to be thought they wou'd have
truſted again to her fair promiſes.</p>
            <p>That the Ladies give her Money, derogates nothing from that reſpect
I owe to the Fair Sex. Becauſe 'tis certain, there wou'd be no <hi>Decoys,</hi> if
ſome young Women did not entertain 'em; and tho' indeed it ne're had
been practis'd, (and I'm half perſwaded that it may be ſo) yet it was
<pb facs="tcp:56577:4"/>
neceſſary upon the Stage. For what's Scandalous there, muſt needs be ſo
in the Cloſet too; and by repreſenting it as real in Publick, 'twill enduce
ſome to diſcourage thoſe inſinuating old Seducers, leſt the World ſhould
think they actually brib'd them to hunt for Husbands, when they are only
paſſive in the matter.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Freelove</hi> is ſo eaſily Cozen'd is very pardonable. He durſt not
ſtay to examine her Fortune, leſt he had expos'd the weakneſs of his own;
and ſhe lying under the ſame hazard, a ſpeedy Marriage Naturally
follow'd.</p>
            <p>I've made <hi>Willie</hi> a down-right ignorant Clown, therefore—But
ſtay, leſt I ſhould be thought to mimick one of my own Characters,
and fight without an Adverſary, I lay aſide the trouble of apologizing any
farther. The Town receiv'd my Play, and my Letters of Amours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the <hi>Unfortunate Dutcheſs,</hi> &amp;c. with more favour than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
either of them merited, and I've Reaſon to be very well ſatisfied
with my fortune in my firſt Eſſays, and the more, becauſe I writ this
Comedy in ten ſucceſſive Mornings. Beſides being a Stranger, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the Criticks can't in honour attack me, for as I have done it in my
Book, ſo here too I claim the priviledge of a dead Author.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE,
Written by Mr. Farquhar, and ſpoken by Mr. Powell.</head>
            <l>THE bus'neſs of a Prologue, who can ſay?</l>
            <l>I think it has no bus'neſs in a Play:</l>
            <l>For if the Play be good it need not crave it;</l>
            <l>If bad, no Prologue on the Earth can ſave it.</l>
            <l>But you plead Cuſtom for this needleſs Evil,</l>
            <l>Cuſtom! why ay, this Cuſtom is the Devil.</l>
            <l>For Cuſtom chiefly all our Ills inſures;</l>
            <l>'Tis Cuſtom makes Men Knaves, and Women—s.</l>
            <l>You know the Rhime, if not, let each Man ask</l>
            <l>His pretty little Neighbour in a Mask.</l>
            <l>Cuſtom makes Actors, Poets keep a pother,</l>
            <l>And Cuſtom ſtarves the one, and damns the other.</l>
            <l>Cuſtom makes Modern Criticks ſnarle and bite,</l>
            <l>And 'tis a very evil Cuſtom makes 'em write.</l>
            <l>'Tis Cuſtom brings the Spark to <hi>Sylvia</hi>'s Lap,</l>
            <l>Cuſtom undreſſes him, and Cuſtom gives a Clap.</l>
            <l>Why Poets write ill Plays, why Maids miſcarry,</l>
            <l>Ask why <hi>Beaux</hi> paint, they'll ſay 'tis Cuſtomary.</l>
            <l>Cuſtom makes modern Wives break Marriage Vows,</l>
            <l>And Cuſtom damns moſt Plays at t'other Houſe.</l>
            <l>'Tis Cuſtom makes our Infant Author fear,</l>

it turns a man inſide out, and of a cloſe-minded intriguing
Fellow makes a babling Fool; it can baniſh all thoughts of buſineſs, but
Love ſtill keeps the Field; 'tis a powerful Paſſion, and thoſe to whom

are baffled from their ſurly Precepts of rigid gravity, and forc'd to
ſigh and love, nay doat as we do.</p>

have reliev'd me from my poſt; my three principal Lovers are
uneaſy on both ſides, and from the Gentlemen I've receiv'd fifty Guineas
this morning to compleat their cure; nor have I forgot to ſqueeze the young
Ladies, even to their very Jewels; I can expect no more than I've already
got by both parties; for ſhou'd I now baulk them in this Intrigue, they'd
never truſt me again: I've worn them almoſt threadbare, and 'tis time to lay
them aſide; I'll give therefore the finiſhing ſtroke to this plot, hitherto ſo
well manag'd, and ſhow my ſelf honeſt, becauſe I can find no profit by a
longer delay. As for Mr. <hi>Freelove</hi>'s marriage with <hi>Lucy,</hi> 'tis eaſy, their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
fears will force them to a ſpeedy obedience, and I'll enjoin an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
