            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, I muſt deſire your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
if my words deliver too
much truth, and thereby of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend:
You have withdrawne
from you the hearts of the
Eſſex Souldiers, who came
with willing mindes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
Noble ſervice; but the
change of their Captaines
hath alſo changed their affections; neither will they
be commanded by any other but thoſe worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
in whoſe wiſedome, courage and fidelity they
dare boldly confide. My Lord, that action cannot
thrive that is diſcouraged at the beginning; and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
doe not (like the Moone) decreaſe in honour,
and afterward ſhine with full glory. Honour is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thing, and once loſt, is loſt for ever, and not to bee
reſtored. Though I complaine unto your Honour in
the name of the reſt of the Captaines, I doe but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the hazard to expreſſe their diſcontent, rob'd
of that they held ſo deare, their places being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:62094:3"/>
of their own merit, and ſealed unto them by the
conſtant love of the people. Our Eſſex Souldiers,
my Lord, are all men of able eſtates, whoſe zealous
affections to their King and countrey, hath thus led
them forth, to give a cleare teſtimony of love and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
in their perfect ſervice. Vnkindnes doth wound
deſert deepeſt, and deſerved honour is the reward of
vertue, that doth create and confirme courage, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, a Souldier becomes a deſpiſed thing, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
therefore my Lord, that a Captaine ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of the people, can ſuffer no iniury without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
repining, from whence doth ſpring the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
danger of an Army. I am engaged my Lord, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, and muſt ſpeake the truth before I
goe to defend it, drawne thereunto by my friends diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
and my owne, being diſcarded from thoſe
places which the people in their good affection
had deſigned us. Laſtly, my Lord, if my ſpeech ſeem
to be of a courſe and rugged threed, an iniured Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
is farre from flattery, and I muſt tell you, we
ſcorne that our hearts ſhould give place to any
Captaines, in being right and true to our
King and countrey, this honour wee
cannot loſe, living or dying: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
think it a high indignity
to reſigne our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainſhips.</p>

Speech, it being comely in a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to deliver his thoughts without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
of words, and to utter Truth in a
plaine and cleare manner. If your Eſſex Souldiers
be offended at the election of other Capta<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nes, let
them conſider that the preſent occaſion doth require
men bred in warre, and experienced in thoſe affaires;
neither can the other Captaines grudge, that the
Common-wealth ſhould receive benefit by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
ſince if this warre may thrive in the proſecution
thereof, it matters not who have beene principall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
therein. Their love unto their Countrey de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
highly to bee commended, and their cheerfull
undertaking to aſſiſt this action, doth magnifie their
brave reſolutions. But give mee leave to ſay, that
thoſe other Captaines nurſt at the breaſt of Warre,
are growne exceeding quick-ſighted in military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and being long trained up in the Schoole of
Warre, deſerve to bee ranked in the chiefeſt File of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62094:4"/>
Honour. In <hi>Holland</hi> they have hazzarded their lives,
and ſpent ſome blood to gaine a perfect knowledge
in all warlike Diſcipline; yet I preferre them not as
men of greater ability, much leſſe loyalty then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Captaines; but antiquity of ſervice ought to
have ſome preheminence. You may informe the reſt
of the Captaines, whoſe mindes you have delivered,
that I beleeve them to bee men not inferior to thoſe
in courage, but as knowing, as full of <hi>Heroick Spirit,</hi>
as the other Captaines, and would doe as far in the
defence of their Countrey as the other; yet ſince
they and the other cannot ſerve both in the ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
let them thinke it no diſhonour in point of
warre, to ſuffer the Common-wealth to bee ſerved
by others as well as themſelves: their free intent is
as acceptable as the deed. There hath been alwayes
contentions about ſuch matters, but without any
diſgrace: for I doe not accuſe their ſufficiencie, but
thinke them as worthy in all degrees of valour, as the
other which are elected. Perſwade therefore the
Souldiers to be well affected to thoſe Captaines: for
you and all men ought to preferre the good of the
Common-wealth before private reſpect, or any
particular places in the Warre, ſince all
our actions ſhould move to one end,
which is the defence of our King
and our Countrey.</p>
