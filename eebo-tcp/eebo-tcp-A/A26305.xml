            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAD you not power enough with me to perſwade me for your ſatisfaction, to neglect my own, I ſhould ſcarcely at this time have comply'd with your deſires, in anſwering your ſeveral <hi>Quaeries</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi> againſt both the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orie and Practice of <hi>Chymical Phyſick</hi>; for I find almoſt all the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> that are either totally ignorant of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only with the Vulgar; ſuch as is that of <hi>Crollius, Hartman, Beguin,</hi> and their like, ſo riged oppoſers of the more occult Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of <hi>Hermes, Raymond, Lully, Baſilius Valentinus, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus, Vanhelmont,</hi> &amp;c. that they cannot but proteſt againſt all their Schollars and followers, as <hi>Heterodox,</hi> deſerters of the Schools, and (to uſe your own expreſſion) Phanaticks and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch a Philoſophy, that were <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf again living upon Earth, he would not be able to underſtand it; and although for your own part I have no reaſon to believe you of the number of thoſe ſupercilious Opiners, that ſcorn to forſake an Errour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vulgarly received; yet I doubt whether the Truth in ſo plain a dreſs as I ſhall expoſe it, may not ſtartle you alſo. You are perhaps too tender of the Reputation of <hi>Galen,</hi> for you ought not to think it any diſcredit to him, that had never ſeen ſo much as common Diſtillation in his life, to be ſaid not to underſtand the profound and hidden Myſteries of Natural Phyloſophy, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in an Abyſs inacceſſible and imperceivable by any poſſibility of Witt, without the help of Fire; He well ſaw that the tenuous and aethereal ſubſtance of things, was of greater efficacy than their groſſer part, as he confeſſeth in his 11 Book <hi>De Simp. Med. Facul. Quae tenuium ſunt partium, iis quae ſunt craſſarum plus habent efficaciae etiamſi parem ſortita fuerint facultatem, nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quia melius penitrent</hi>; but he knew not how to ſeparate the tennous parts from the implication of the groſs, which we do by the help of Fire. Whence I conclude, that he (had he underſtood
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66048:3"/>
the Art of Chymiſtry, which in his time lay hid in obſcure Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks in the Shrines of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> would have left us both his Phyſiology, Pathology, and eſpecially his Method of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, quite different from what it is; for it cannot reaſonably be imagined, that ſo curious a ſearcher into the hidden things of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would have contented himſelf with a bare rational Analyſis of Bodies exiſting only in the Underſtanding, had he been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Encheiretick, reſolving all bodies into Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſubject to Senſe, and fit for the uſe and manual operation of a skilful Phyſician by the help of Fire. Your Ideal Analyſis, by a progreſſive agitation of the Mind, by which you find contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation to end where natural compoſition begins, leads you at laſt but into the dark Chaos of the Elements, and there begets but this unprofitable concluſion; <hi>That becauſe all things are by a mental Reſoluſion ultimately reſolv'd into the four Elements, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe are the common Principles of all things.</hi> Now how much it may really improve any mans underſtanding in the Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, to tell him all things are compounded of the four Elements, more than in Ship-Carpentry, to tell him a Ship is made of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Iron, Hemp, and Tarr, I leave you to judge. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (in regard the Elements are but remote Principles upon which only God and Nature can work) have by the Reſolution of Fire found out nearer Principles ſubject (as I ſaid) to Senſe, and fit for the uſe of a Spagyrical Phyſician: theſe are <hi>Mercury, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> which being firſt ſeparated and cleanſed from all heterogeneous feculency, then exalted (by the help of Fire) in power and virtue, we can either uſe them ſeverally, or conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to their virtues, and the curative intention of the Phyſician; And thus by the help of Fire, we make Medicines eaſily curing thoſe obſtinate Diſeaſes you eſteem incurable; By the help of Fire we underſtand the occult Hermetick and Helmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Philoſophy; and by the help of Fire, with much ſtudy, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſweat (never by the bare reading of Books at your eaſe) may you alſo be ſatisfyed of the reality, truth, and excellence of that Phyſick which you now profeſs (and I believe you) no more to underſtand, than the Cantings of <hi>Gipſies.</hi> But now to your firſt <hi>Quaerie:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66048:3"/>
               <hi>Whether it be poſſible to cure a Diſeaſe without a Remedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Diſeaſe, or at leaſt to its Cauſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer with the <hi>Adepti</hi> in the affirmative, and ſay, <hi>Nulla fit ſanatio per contraria, quia Morbus proximè &amp; primariò con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtit in Arbéo at ſubſtantiae in eſſe</hi> (according to <hi>Ariſtotle) nihil eſt contrarium.</hi> It is not the corporeal ſubſtance of the Brain, Heart, Liver, Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſuffers primarily, <hi>&amp; per ſe</hi> in their ſeveral diſtempers, though Idiopathical, but the Juſitous Spirit governing the part, and diſpoſing it to perform all natural, Vital, and Animal Functions, which being hurt by the Errour and depravation of the Jufluous Spirit and Topick Ferment, the part neceſſarily ſuffers by accident, <hi>Quia actio terminatur in corpus.</hi> Now the atonie of the Jufluous Spirit and deviation of Ferments happens by ill air, Contagion, Malignant Influence, poiſonous Fumes or Odours inſpir'd, or entring by the Pores, by Meat or Drink hurtful either in quality or quantity, by Poiſon or Virulency of ill Phyſick, by natural or accidental inequality of ſtrength, by retention of Excrements of the ſeveral digeſtions, by tranſmiſſion from one digeſtion to another, before a perfect Concoction in the former, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then the right Method of curing Diſeaſes, is primarily by pacation of the Enormontick Spirit, and extinction of Morbifick Idea's, and but <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> by expelling the peccant matter generated by the ataxie of the Spirit: But ſuch a ſedation of the Spirit cannot poſſibly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by contraries; does not Fire burn moſt vehemently, when conſtring'd by an extreme cold of the ambient? and hot water ſoonet extinguiſh Fire than cold, becauſe ſooner penetrating its Pores? I could multiply arguments againſt the Method of curing Diſeaſes by contrary Remedies; but my deſign is rather to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate than tire you with too long a Letter.</p>
            <p>To your next <hi>Quaerie,</hi> therefore, <hi>Whether we acknowledge four<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Humours</hi>; and if ſo, <hi>Whether various Diſtempers flowing from the depravation or exceſs of various Humours, as</hi> Synochus ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, <hi>of too much abundance of Blood</hi>; Quotidiana Intermittens, <hi>of Flegm</hi>; Tertiana Intermittens, <hi>of Choler</hi>; Quartana Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittens, <hi>of Melancholy; all putrifying in the firſt region of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66048:4"/>
Body; and both Quotidian, Tertian, and Quartan, continual from the ſame humours putrefying in the Vein, may be all cured by one Medicine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this; Firſt, We deny your <hi>Humours,</hi> as moſt repugnant to reaſon, that under one act of Sanguification, and in the ſame Veſſels, four different <hi>Humours</hi> ſhould be produc'd, and that naturally in ſound and healthful Bodies theſe Humours ſhould be the efficient cauſes of future Diſeaſes; For this were to ſuppoſe Nature always to erre, <hi>etiam in ſuis finibus.</hi> Senſe likewiſe aſſures us, that although there be a Liquor ſwimming upon Blood, emitted and cold, of a yellow colour, yet that it is not therefore yellow Bile; for that it is not bitter to the taſte: And though the <hi>Yellow Jaundies</hi> ſtaining the whole Body with a yellow colour, and the Urine with a deep tincture of Red, ſeem (<hi>prima faciè</hi>) to prove your Hypotheſis of Humours; yet upon an exact Spagyrical examination, you ſhall find the contrary; for if this tincture of Urine were <hi>à flava bile,</hi> there muſt be found in it by Diſtillation at leaſt ſome bitterneſs, either in the Liquor that comes over, or in the Hypoſtaſis, or <hi>Caput mortuum</hi>; but there is found none, nor could a ſmall quantity of yellow Liquor tinge a large quantity of Urine with a colour deeper than its own. So that we ſay, <hi>Nullus in natura Humor noſter, niſi</hi> Cruor, Latex, <hi>&amp;</hi> Secundarius. Now ſometimes this <hi>Latex,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Chyle,</hi> from the Errour and contagion of degenerated Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pre-diſpoſition of the matter, receives various tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and puts on the diſguiſe of your ſuppoſed Humours. But granting you a Quaternary of Humours, yet we deny them to be truly the efficient cauſes of Diſeaſes, for <hi>manente cauſa non tollitur Effectus</hi>; but very many Diſeaſes we ſee daily cured by <hi>Amulets; Plaiſters, Laudanums, Anodynes, Magneticks,</hi> &amp;c. without any evacuation of Humours at all; ſo then the truly Efficient and conjunct Cauſe is Spiritual, and ſuch a Medicine as can quiet the <hi>Archeus,</hi> and reduce it to its natural ſtate, ſhall eaſily cure all theſe Diſtempers, without any regard had to the Purgation, or carrying away of Peccant Humours; for the Juſitous Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrengthened, and the local Ferments reſtored to their proper
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66048:4"/>
Energy, your peccant Humours ſhall ſoon, by the power of theſe, be either ſubacted and compell'd into their genuine perfection, or driven out by the ways moſt familiar and eaſie to Nature, truly acknowledged by <hi>Hypocrates</hi> to be <hi>Morborum Curatrix</hi>; and in my Opinion, the reaſon why meer <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſeldom perform any conſiderable cure in obſtinate Diſeaſes, is for that they wholly proſecute evacuation, and by that means oftentimes diſable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (eſpecially by Phlebotomy) from doing what ſhe would be able oftentimes of her own ſtrength to perform, never aiming pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and directly (but thus only by accident) at the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of Nature; and no marvel, ſince this way of Healing is not performable without the help of ſuch <hi>Arcana</hi> as are only known to Chymiſts, and of them, only to the <hi>Adepti,</hi> not every vulgar Profeſſor of Chymiſtry. But you urge a neceſſity (in the right Method of Healing) of having reſpect not only to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of Peccant Humours, but alſo to the extinction of prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural heat by cooling Medicines, and refocillation of cold, by heating ones; as for Example, in the cure of <hi>Anaſarcha,</hi> which you ſay is from an immoderate refrigeration of the Liver and Veins; of a Fever, which is from a praeternatural heat kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled firſt in the Heart, and thence diffuſing it ſelf through the whole Body; of <hi>Bradypepſia</hi> and <hi>Apepſia,</hi> from the coldneſs of the Stomach; of <hi>Boulimia,</hi> from an extraordinary heat of the Stomach ſuddainly precipitating digeſtion, and cauſing almoſt a continual want of aliment; and likewiſe in implicite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Diſeaſes that are contrary to each other, as a hot Liver, and cold Stomach; whatſoever Medicines ſhould by their heating quality be proper in the Cure of <hi>Anaſarcha, Bradypepſia, Apepſi,</hi> and cold Diſtemper of the Stomach muſt in reſpect of that heat, be quite contrary in a Fever, <hi>Boulimia,</hi> and hot Liver. I anſwer ſtill with the <hi>Adepti; That Heat and Cold</hi> (as I ſaid of Hmours) <hi>are not the efficient Cauſes of Diſeaſes, but the Antecedent,</hi> and therefore though their conſideration be Diagnoſtick yet not Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, <hi>non calor &amp; frigus</hi> (ſays <hi>Hypocrates) ſed acidum, acre, amarum, ponticum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſunt morborum cauſae.</hi> Heat and cold praeternatural, are indeed an effect of the enraged vital Spirit,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66048:5"/>
which being once quieted, the natural temper preſently returns; and as for the hot Liver and cold Stomach, which ſo much puzzles you, that you know not which way to direct your curative inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as appears by your Method: <hi>Impliciti compoſitique morbi ſi diſſentiant, nec prorſus huic, nec illi, ſed utrique mediocritate quâdam ſuccurendum</hi>: which is in effect but a needleſs kind of deſpair of a Cure; whereas I am able to aſſure you, that if for the future you can find out ſuch a Remedy as can re-invigorate the languiſhing tone of the Stomach and Liver, reſtore their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated Ferments, and appeaſe the <hi>Archeus,</hi> which may be all done with one Medicine, without any regard had either to the cold of the one, or heat of the other, you ſhall quickly, ſafely, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly cure both; and by the like Method, all other Diſeaſes vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly aſcribed to Heat and Cold. You attribute Concoction to the Heat of the Stomach, and to the diminution of this Heat, want of Digeſton, and all Diſeaſes happening thence; but that Heat is not the efficient Cauſe of Digeſtion, ſeems manifeſt; For 1. Fiſhes digeſt without any actual Heat, and to ſay that poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſufficeth, is ſcarcely conſonant to Reaſon, that a thing barely in <hi>potentia,</hi> ſhould <hi>actu jam agere.</hi> 2. There ought to be as many Degrees of Heat ſpecifically different, as there are ſpecifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Concoction, in the Stomachs of Animals of different <hi>ſpecies</hi>; for whatſoever is produc'd ſpecifically different, ought likewiſe to have the efficient Cauſe of that difference ſpecifically different, otherwiſe, <hi>Quidlibet generetur à quolibet indifferenter,</hi> which I think no man will affirm. Beſides, What degree of Heat muſt we allow the Stomach of an <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> eaſily digeſting Leather, Cloth, and even Nails of Iron? what degree of heat in <hi>Boulimia</hi> for the Digeſtion of the courſeſt Food, in ſo large a quantity, and ſo faſt, that the Stomach is ſcarcely ever to be ſatisfi'd? <hi>Riverius</hi> confeſſeth this cannot poſſibly be from a more intenſe Heat, ſince Meat boiled in a Pot with the ſtrongeſt Heat that can be invented, and continued for many days, cannot by this means be reſolv'd into a Chylous Liquor, much leſs Bones, as in the Stomach of a Dog in the ſpace of an hour: I know you ſhift this off to a peculiar faculty, but a faculty cannot act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

an Inſtrument, ſo that you are conſtrained to flie to the Idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyncraſie of the part, which you teach to be a certain proportion of firſt qualities; but of all the firſt qualities, Heat is the moſt active, which nevertheleſs, as has been already ſhew'd, cannot have the power of ſo ſuddain a liquation of Meats, ſo that after much ſtruggling, you are at laſt but where you began. We therefore aſcribe the difference of Digeſtions, not to Heat, but to formal proprieties, and the operation of the ſpecifical Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid, your Objections borrow'd out of <hi>Helvetius,</hi> againſt the poſſibility of an univerſal Medicine, ſeem ſufficiently anſwer'd; Nevertheleſs, take this Argument: Health is but one ſimple Homogeneal integrity of Life, Nature but one, but one ſole Spirit, the Governour and Moderator of Life, which alone labours under Diſeaſes, and is alone (it by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Medicine ſufficiently ſtrengthened) able to overcome all Diſeaſes; why then may not one Medicine, ſuch as the Liquor <hi>Alkahest</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> his <hi>Tinctura Lili ab Electro Minerali,</hi> his <hi>Tinctura Lili Antimonialis,</hi> his <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> his <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Diaphoreticus dulcis &amp; fixus,</hi> his <hi>Ignis veneris,</hi> his <hi>Corallatus,</hi> his <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> or any other equal to theſe, be able to cure all Diſeaſes? and although I am not as yet ſo happy my ſelf, as to be Maſter of any one of theſe, yet in Confirmation of this Hetrodoxical Doctrine, I will undertake (provided the Patients you ſhall aſſign me for the tryal, will faithfully comply in taking the Medicines, and carefully obſerve the order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd them) to cure all ſorts of Fevers how malignant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated ſoever, with one Medicine; your diſtempers of a hot Liver and cold Stomach, with one Medicine, and for the moſt part, Sanguine, Bilious, Melancholy, and Flegmatick Diſeaſes, (as you eſteem them) with one Medicine, which I hope will make you change you Opinion of the neceſſity of curing Diſeaſes by their contrary Remedies. And as for thoſe obſtinate Diſeaſes, whereof many are eſteemed by you incurable, and the reſt ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never cured by the vulgar Method, as the Dropſie, the Gout, Stone in the Reins and Bladder, Apoplexy, Co<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But you apprehend Chymical Medicines to be dangerous, as being many of them extracted out of poyſonous Metals and Minerals, as Iron, Copper, Tinn, Lead, Mercury, Antimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and corroſive Salts, as Vitrial, Nitre, Tarter, Bay Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but you ſeem more eſpecially to be affrighted at Antimony and Mercury; and truly if you mean their vulgar preparations, (which nevertheleſs you commonly make uſe of your ſelves,) ſuch as are the <hi>Vitrum,</hi> and <hi>Flores Antimonii, Crocus Metallorum,</hi> the ordinary <hi>Mercurius vita,</hi> Praecipitates and Sublimates, I ſo much abhor them my ſelf, that I deteſt the uſe of them. But I have by me certain preparations out of ♁ and ☿ far more precious than Gold, with which I know how to cure almoſt all curable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes in the body of man, and ſo ſafe, that I give them common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to little Children, without ever having found the leaſt harm or inconvenience in them; ſome of them Purge not at all, but are Diaphoretick, Alexipharmacal, Balſamical, Reſtaurative, and Pacative: and thoſe that do, never cauſe any ſuperpurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though the Patient by miſtake ſhould take a double or treble Doſe. Out of ☿ can I make many excellent Medicines, whereof one particularly and eſpecially cures the <hi>POX,</hi> though ever ſo full of raging pains, <hi>Tophi,</hi> and Ulcerous exeſions. Cut of Antimony, <hi>Baſilius Valentinus</hi> ſays, he knew how to make above 300 ſeveral preparations, whereof he valued many as more precious and univerſal than potable Gold; Nevertheleſs, eſteeming himſelf yet but a Learner and Searcher into the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Virtues and Proprieties of Antimony. <hi>Quercitan</hi> ſays, there are in ♁ 600 Proprieties. Our moſt Learned <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> made an Oyl out of Antimony, which he affirms to be little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour not only in Medicine, but alſo in Tranſmutation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, to the great <hi>Elixir</hi> of the Phyloſophers. Of Antimony <hi>Paracelſus</hi> made ſome of his moſt ſtupendious <hi>Arcana</hi>; as his <hi>Lili Antimoniale,</hi> his <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> with which he could cure all the Diſeaſes in the Body of Man, and ſays of ♁, that as it ſeparates from Gold all Heterogeneous admixture and impurity, ſo doth it from the Body of Man all Diſeaſes. And of <hi>Mercury,</hi> both he and <hi>Van Helmont</hi> made their miraculous. <hi>Alkaheſt.</hi> ☿ is certainly the moſt precious Jewel in the whole treaſure of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Kingdom of Nature, from which alone ☉ it ſelf borrows its perfection. If I would now comunicate to you but what is known to my ſelf that am but a Scholar in the Schools of theſe two great Maſters of Natural Philoſophy of the Virtues and hidden Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of theſe two Minerals, I muſt inſtead of a Letter, write a Volumn, which is at preſent far from my purpoſe and your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.

praiſe of ♂ in the cure of Hypochondriack Melancholy, Scurvy, moſt affectious of the Liver and Spleen, Ulcers of the Stomach, Green Sickneſs, and many others. <hi>At caeteris omnibus remediis palmam praeripit Sal Martis, quod obſtructiones aperit viſcera corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berat, earumque calidam intemperiem emendat,</hi> &amp;c. A certain Phyſician you well knew, got more Fame and Riches than any of his time in this Town, by means of a ſecret operative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Steel, with which he really perform'd many grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more conſiderable Cures, than others equal to himſelf in all other conſiderations. But you fill me with admiration, that you ſhould fear the corroſive quality of Vitriol, Tartre, Nitre, and Bay Salt, you may draw a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> out of Bread or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that will diſſolve Flints, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſtadius</hi> out of Honey makes a diſſolvant of Gold; would you therefore be affraid of the uſe of Bread or Honey? you know the juice of Limons diſſolves Pearl and Coral, and yet moſt grateful and friendly to the Stomach; and why ſhould theſe Spirits temper'd with the allay of other milder Liquors, <hi>ad gratam aciditatem,</hi> be more dangerous? Indeed common experience ſhews you the contrary; beſides you ought to conſider the difference between the hard Bodies of Stones and Mettals, and the ſofter Membranes of the Stomach, irrigated continually with a Balſamick vital moiſture: <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> that corrodes Stones and Mettals, whill not penetrate Wax. But to leave you no ground of ſuſpition, I can ſhew you how to make them freed from their corroſive aciditie, pleaſant to Taſte and Smell, and highly exalted in Virtue. But this I confeſs is a great ſecret, eſpecially that of the Volatile Salt of Tarter, of which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Van Helmont</hi> affirm, that it penetrates into the moſt inward and remote parts, cleanſing them from all impurity, <hi>inſtar ſaponis cuncta abſtergens &amp; omnem è venis amurcam deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens, &amp;c.</hi> But though you have oblig'd me to make this juſt vindication of Chymical Phyſick, I would not have you think I either deſpiſe or neglect the excellent uſe of Herbs, which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with <hi>Van Helmont,</hi> to be <hi>pentacula Divini amoris.</hi> Out of Animals and Vegetables I can make Medicines that cure the Gout and Dropſy, with that certainty, as ſcarcely to miſs two in

twenty. But indeed, as is our Method of Healing, ſo are our ways of preparation very different from yours; You in your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions conſume commonly a third part, ſometimes half or more, in which conſumption a great deal of the Spirit and Volatile Salt of the Ingredients, which contains their higheſt Virtues, is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated and loſt; of the certainty of this loſs, both your Smell and Taſte will bear you witneſs: We, on the contrary, ſo make our Decoctions, that the whole virtue of the Craſſis of the Plant is preſerv'd without any diminution; I leave it now to your ſelf to judge whether you or we may reaſonably hope for the better ſucceſs in this particular; the like difference is between your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations and ours; you for the moſt part add water, or at leaſt draw over but the Flegmatick part of the Plant, with ſome very ſmall part of its Sulphur, which gives it ſomething of its natural ſmell and Taſte, leaving nevertheleſs almoſt all its Sulphur, and totally all its Alkalious Salt behind; ſo that your diſtill'd waters carry only the name, little of the virtue of the Plant from which they are drawn: We firſt ſtamp the Hearb, and draw its water, then cohobe it ſo often upon the <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> till we have brought over its Sulphur, and laſtly calcine the remaining <hi>feces,</hi> and with the waters extract its own Salt, and then Circulate them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and thus are the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt united, which completes the virtue of the whole Plant, and compar'd to yours, is worthy of the name of an Eſſence; this is indeed laborious and coſtly, but in its effects largely recompenceth both. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains yet an Objection againſt Chymical Phyſick to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which you offer not as your own, but as received by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Report.</p>

            <p>There is indeed ſuch a ſenſeleſs calumny current amongſt Women, and the weaker ſort of Men induſtriouſly diſſeminated amongſt them, by ſome hoping perhaps by this art the better to keep up their own Eſteem and Reputation, which otherwiſe by their abilities they find themſelves not likely to maintain. But
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66048:8"/>
to avoid contention, let common Experience determine this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between us. For my own particular, I can faithfully aſſure you, that by Chymical Phyſick I have cured my ſelf of the Vertigo, and Gout, both in great extremity; it is now 4 years ſince, and I have not (I bleſs God) to this day relaps'd again into either, nor have I found any harm, but on the contrary, many benefits to my health by ſuch Medicines, tending in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to the prolongation of my life; and if I had not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my eſteem of Chymical Phyſick upon good reaſon and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient experience, you might think me mad, to make deſperate practices upon my own Life. My Lungs are naturally ſo tender and weak, that had it not been for Chymical Medicines, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think I could have liv'd to ſee this day. But inform your ſelf further, and you ſhall find that thoſe that have been long accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to Chymical Phyſick, have preſerv'd their Lives and Health much longer, and more comfortably, than thoſe acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only with your Druggs; for conſider impartially, how few eſcape death in contumacious Diſeaſes by means of <hi>Galenical</hi> Medicines, loathſome, tedious, and for the moſt part ineffectual; and thoſe that do, how ſlowly do they recover their colour, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and ſtrength, remaining long in continual fear and danger of relapſe? ſuch large quantities of Phyſick as your ſlow Method requires, ſo depauperates the vital Spirit, and oppreſſes Nature, that it may be known many times a year after, from what Method they receiv'd their Cure: whereas we in the ſame Diſeaſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Cure quickly, with little Phyſick, and in ſmall Doſes, ſuch as can hardly be nauſeous to the niceſt and moſt delicate Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs; and in our whole ſcope, our Method directs us not to enervate (as you do) but to erect deficient Nature, not to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, but reintegrate the languiſhing Spirit: and is it then likely that Chymical Medicines taken from the hands of a skilful Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Phyſician, appeaſing and ſtrengthening the <hi>Archeus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the Ferments, which alone in their intire vigour, are able to overcome all Diſeaſes, as being the undoubted Authors of tranſmutation, friendly and comfortable to Nature, ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſhorten Life? beſides the evidence of Reaſon, I can
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66048:8"/>
teſtify out of my own diligent Obſervation and Experience (and that <hi>fido animo</hi>) the contrary. But I believe I need not take much pains to ſatisfie you in this particular, I know you are too ſharp ſighted to be miſs-led by ſuch an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi>; on the contrary, I rather believe you inclinable to acquaint your ſelf fully with the Theory, and manual operations of Chymiſtry, which though it coſt you (as it hath done me) much Time, Sweat, and Money, yet if you prove equally ſucceſsful, I dare promiſe it ſhall never give you cauſe to repent you: for (I ſpeak it without boaſting) I have by the help of this Art eaſily and quickly cured Diſeaſes quite deſperate in the hands of very able and experienced <hi>Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Phyſicians. Truly were not Chymical Phyſick incomparably more powerful and ſafe, than <hi>Galenical,</hi> I do not ſee how I could excuſe my ſelf in leaving at any time, the trodden, ſmooth, and eaſie paths of the vulgar or <hi>Galenical</hi> Method, in which I am gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated as well as you, to follow thoſe of the Chymical, painful, coſtly, ſublime, and ſo ſecret, that but a few have ever rightly underſtood:

                     <hi>Jupiter,</hi> hoc potnêre—</l>
               </q>
At the worſt can be ſaid; ſurely he that underſtands both Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, is likely to perform more than he that underſtands but one; but I muſt not tranſgreſs the limits of a Letter, let what has been ſaid ſuffice for the preſent, till I Print my <hi>Synopſis Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico-Chymica,</hi> which is almoſt finiſhed, and I ſhall be ready at our next meeting to give you further ſatisfaction in any thing: In the mean time I pray do me that right to believe, that what I have ſaid in Vindication of Chymical Phyſick, hath been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt animoſity, or intention of prejudice to the Perſon or Practice of any man, purely in defence of the Truth, and that whatſoever I have undertaken to do my ſelf in my own particular, the better to confirm you, I will by the Grace of God, whenſoever you ſhall offer me the occaſion, faithfully
