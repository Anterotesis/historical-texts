            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The True
CONFESSION
OF
MARGARET CLARK,
WHO
Conſented to the Burning of her Maſters
Houſe in SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THWARK, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Margret Clark</hi> being ſhortly to ſuffer Death for that
which I have deſerved, and am much humbled for,
and deſire to lye low before God under the ſenſe
of my own Guilt, do give the World an Account
of the truth of my Caſe, for I would not be guilty of
a Lye now I am to appear before my Judge within a few
minutes. Therefore I do ſay, aud ſhall declare the Truth of
the matter, as I ſhall anſwer it before my Lord and Judge.</p>
            <p>Upon the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January, John Satterthwait</hi> came to
me as I was going out of my Maſters Gate, and did deſire
me to tell him whether my Maſter and Miſtriſs were at
home? And I anſwered him, no; and he told me that he
hoped he ſhould have an opportunity to ſpeak with me, for
he had ſomething to ſay. And I anſwered him, if he had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52242:3"/>
any thing to ſay, I ſhould be ſo civil to give him the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when I had time (for then I was in haſte). Then he
came on the next day with the ſame Requeſt, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the ſame Anſwer. Then the Third time, being
<hi>Wedneſday,</hi> he came again, and uſed great Importunity,
and expreſſed ſome kindneſſes, as if he had been a Suitor,
and prevailed with me to go into the Burrough with him
to an Alehouſe, where were two Men more of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and after ſome little time of diſcourſe, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to me this wicked and horrid Deſign which I
was to have been ingaged in with them, that is, to let
them into my Maſters Houſe to ſet it on Fire; and for a
Reward, they promiſed me Two thouſand pounds, which
Sum I was to receive at the <hi>Fleece-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi>
inquiring for a Room in the ſaid Tavern, called the <hi>Figure
Nine.</hi> Then coming out of the Alehouſe, they would fain
have had me away with them, ſaying, Come let us take
Coach, and go into <hi>Fleetſtreet;</hi> for, ſaid they, there we
have a Prieſt of ours, who Lodges at a Grocers, that ſhall
Confeſs you, and give you the Sacrament; I told him I
could not poſſibly go then. So this <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> went
homewards with me almoſt to my Maſters Gate; and as we
went along, he charged me that I ſhould not divulge it to
any perſon in the world living; for if I did, I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
dye for it (and that quickly) in this world, and be
damn'd in the other.</p>
            <p>Then he came on the next day, and gave me the ſame
charge to keep it ſecret: And then on <hi>Saturday</hi> he came
and inquired of me the beſt time that he might come to do
this moſt horrid and deviliſh Action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, Would not
four or five of the Clock be a good time? and I ſaid, Yes:
Accordingly he came, and conveyed himſelf into the Dye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
or thereabouts, while Nine or Ten of the Clock
that evening; about which time the Fire was diſcovered;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52242:3"/>
whereupon with the fear and dread he had put upon me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I did deny it to the company that came in to quench it;
but after that, he was there, whom I ſaw amongſt the reſt of
the company; but I had much horrour upon my Conſcience;
and after ſome ſhort time I confeſt the whole Crime for
which I now dye: And my Examination before Juſtice
<hi>Reading,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Freeman</hi> was all true. And this I affirm,
and do deſire all Proteſtants to believe, that <hi>John Satterth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait</hi>
kindled thoſe three Fires in my Maſters Houſe. Firſt in
the Dye-houſe by the Pump; ſecondly in the Buttery;
and thirdly in the Garret, which laſt Fire he kindled
whileſt the People were putting out the other; And I do
declare in the words of a dying Maid, that I was under
great trouble of Conſcience, and was many times about
diſcovering it, but could not; Satans Temptations, and the
wickedneſs of my own heart did ſo much prevail with me;
Oh that covetous deſign of gaining the Moneys, was that
which I deſire all who read theſe Lines which I have writ
to beware of; I ſaw him among the People in the Houſe
very buſie, and I made ſigns at him, to diſcover him; but
the people being in a great hurry, did not mind the things
I then ſaid to them.</p>
            <p>I do alſo think in my conſcience, that if my Maſter had
examined me, I ſhould have declared the whole matter, for
I gave out often ſuſpicious words of my fear of Fire; and
on the <hi>Friday</hi> before this happened, I went out to a friends
houſe, and there I was ſo afflicted and troubled in my mind,
that they took notice of it; and one that went with
me thither was importunate with me to know the reaſon
of my trouble; but the Devil had ſo ſubtilly ingag'd my
wicked heart, that I could not tell him. But to paſs by my
Conviction and Impriſonment, which you have all heard of,
and to come to this one thing which fell out in the time of
my Confinement in Priſon (which I bleſs God for, rather
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52242:4"/>
than that my moſt Loving and Honoured Maſter, with I
know not how many others, ſhould have ſuffered by my
wicked compliance with that Man) that which I ſpeak of
is this: When I had been about three weeks in Priſon, I was
then walking in the Yard, having that liberty granted me
by the Jaylor, there <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> look'd out of a
Window, and ſaid to me, Are you there? I wiſh I could
come to you, I would ſpoil your telling of Tales; but I
gave him no anſwer; neither do I deſire his hurt or death, but
beg of God while I am here in this world, Repentance for
him; and oh that God would give him a ſenſe of theſe his
great Sins, both in tempting me, and his deſigning the
ruine of many Thouſands of Families; I can ſay before
the Lord, I deſire not his Death; it would have been but
a poor relief for me to have had him dyed with me: But
this I muſt and will declare before I go hence, and am no
more ſeen, That <hi>John Satterthwait,</hi> though he was clear'd
by the Jury, was Guilty, as I ſaid before, that is, of making
thoſe three Fires, and I only did conſent, and let him in.
Now I would not have you to think that I have written
this to leſſen or excuſe my own fault; I deſerve Death,
nay a worſer Death for conſenting to ſo horrid a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
even eternal Death. But now I hope, that through
the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt alone, not truſting to my own
Works or Pardons from Men (as I fear the Papiſts do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon) to be ſaved from Eternal Fire; and that I ſhall
be juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption
which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</p>
            <p>Whereas there is a Report that is gone commonly about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that I had ſtol'n many of my Maſters things, as Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I think it fit now I am to dye, to give the World an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what I then took; the things which I had then
put into my Box, was a little Tape, Lace, and other frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
things, which now makes me wonder why I then put
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52242:4"/>
them up; for I might have put up Jewels and Plate, which
was under my Charge to the value of ſome Hundreds of
pounds; but as to the carrying out of a Box which I was
met with, it is a moſt falſe report, for I was ſo full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and trouble of Conſcience, that I did not then think
of my Box. And now I deſire all that read theſe Lines,
would conſider, and have a great care how they break the
Lords Day; for my neglecting thereof, was the firſt ſtep to
my downfall; and I deſire this downfall of mine may be
a warning to all young Men and Maids; Oh! let them be
content with the places that God by his Providence places
them in, and not covet after great things (as I have done)
and ſo err from the Rule; and have a care of Pride and
a worldly mind; for this I ſay, Pride and Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath been my downfall; and I earneſtly beg of you
for the Lords ſake, and for your Souls ſake, to let theſe
Lines, and my bad Example be a warning to you. Alas, I
did once enjoy the means of Grace, and have lived in good
Families; yea, he againſt whom I committed this great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
is a very Worthy good Man; Oh! I did once fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the Worſhip of God, and took delight in it, and
thought I underſtood ſomething of the Excellency of
Chriſt, and the worth of my own Soul; but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I fell into this Sin, I neglected the Worſhip of God;
and thoſe precious hours upon the Lords day which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
I had ſpent well. And thus I have fallen foully,
and have offended God and Man; and my horrible Sin hath
made me a publick ſpectacle to the world. I pray all whom
I have offended in it, for Gods ſake to forgive me; and I
forgive all men that have offended me, eſpecially I deſire
to forgive this <hi>John Sattarthwait,</hi> that hath brought me to
this untimely and ſhameful Death, which, I hope, is brought
upon me for my good; for ſurely I have obtained Mercy,
and am joyful to think of my going hence; I long to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52242:5"/>
diſſolv'd, and to be with Chriſt; even ſo come Lord Jeſus,
and receive me an unworthy Soul.</p>
