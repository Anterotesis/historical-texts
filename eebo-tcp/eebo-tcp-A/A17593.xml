            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great injuries which are offered, and ſmall remedies which are uſed in caſes of Coppy-holds, which as it ſeemeth, doe grow by the obſcure knowledge what Law &amp; Cuſtome judgeth in theſe matters of Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: moveth mee to ſhew ſome part of my Travailes in theſe poynts, not thereby to animate Coppy-hold Tenants which would by too much advancing their Tenure, pretend only to be Tenants by Cuſtome, and not Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants at <hi>Will,</hi> nor to encourage any <hi>Coppy-hold</hi> Lord, which could by too much abaſing theſe <hi>Tenures,</hi> pretend to have ſuch <hi>Coppy-holders</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7887:3"/>
onely <hi>Tenants</hi> at <hi>Will,</hi> and not regard their cuſtomes, but to proove unto you, that as their Title and name ſheweth they are <hi>Tenants</hi> at <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>Tenants</hi> by Cuſtome in their Land, and they conſiſt both of their Lords <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of the <hi>Mannour</hi> in their degrees. And that this <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Cuſtome</hi> be contained within the Limits of Law and reaſon, according to ſuch rules as ſhall be hereafter declared.</p>
            <p>Firſt I will ſhew what a Coppy-hold is, then whereof it doth conſiſt, and what eſtimation the ſame is of, by the Antiquity of time, and by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Littleton</hi> in his firſt booke of <hi>Teuures,</hi> defineth a Tenant by Coppy of Court Role, and to be where a man is ſeiſed of a <hi>Mannour,</hi> in which is a <hi>Cuſtome</hi> that hath been uſed time out of minde, that certaine Tenants of the same <hi>Mannour</hi> have uſed, to have certaine Lands and Tenements to hold to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their heires, in Fee Simple, Fee Taile, or for Life at the will of the Lord after the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Mannonr: And that they have no other evidence but the Roles of the Court, by which difinition, and by certaine other obſervations of the Law it may bee gathered, that a Coppy-hold doth conſiſt of theſe ſixe principall grounds, or Circumſtances. <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:7887:3"/>
Firſt, there muſt be a <hi>Mannour,</hi> for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of <hi>Coppy-hold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a cuſtome for the allowing of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there muſt be a Court holden for the proofe of the Coppy-holders.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there muſt be a Lord to give the <hi>Coppy-hold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, there muſt be a <hi>Tenant</hi> of Capacity to take the <hi>Tenement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, the thing to bee granted which muſt bee ſuch as is grantable, and may bee held of the Lord according to the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt before I ſpeake of theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I will briefly declare unto you the Dignity and Eſtimation of <hi>Coppy-holders,</hi> by the Antiquity, and allowance of time, and by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme.</p>
            <p>It appeareth by a certaine booke intituled <hi>De priscis anglor: legibus:</hi> Tranſlated out of <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue by Maſter <hi>Lambert</hi> of <hi>Lincolns Inne;</hi> that <hi>Coppy-holds</hi> were long before the Conqueſt, and then called by the name of (Bookeland) as you may ſee in the beginning of the Booke, in the Treatiſe <hi>De rerum &amp; Verborum explicatione;</hi> and by Maſter <hi>BRACTON</hi> an Ancient Writer of the Lawes of ENGLAND, who in his Booke VVriteth divers preſidents
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7887:4"/>
and Records of King <hi>Henry;</hi> of allowance, Copi-holders or Cuſtomary Tenants that do their due ſervices, the Lords might not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them; according to the opinion of the latter Judges, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4. and <hi>Edward</hi> the third: And it appeareth by Maſter <hi>Fitz-Herberts Abridgements,</hi> they were preferred by a ſpeciall writ for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and the Lord thereby compelled to do right. And in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, Tenants by the Virge, which are the ſame in Nature, as Copy-holders be, were allowed by the name of Sokemaines in <hi>Franktenure;</hi> as in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. were allowed, and of the King, for defence of their eſtates. So that in every Kings time Copy-holders have had their allowances according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, unto this time preſent, wherein our Juſtices are of opinion, as the ſaid grave Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have beene in times paſt. Now I will further proceede in ſome perticuler uſe of theſe Tenures, according to the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme: And becauſe I finde none that doth ſo much deface the eſtimation of Copy-holders, as Maſter <hi>Fitz Herbert</hi> doth in his Writ <hi>Derecto Clauſo.</hi> I will begin with his words and judgement in the ſame, and proceed to other Authorities.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Fitz-Herbert,</hi> ſaith that this Terme Coppi-holders is but a new Terme, newly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7887:4"/>
found out, &amp; that in old time they were called Tenants in Uilenage, or baſe Tenure; and this ſaith he, doth appeare in the old Tenures, for no Coppy-holders are there ſpoken of, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were at that time ſuch Tenants. But then ſaith, they were called Tennats in Vilenage and ſaith, as appeareth 44. <hi>Henry</hi> 4. If a falſe judgement be given againſt them, in the Lords Court, they ſhall have no remedy, but ſue to their Lord by petition, becauſe to hold by Coppy of Court Role, which is as hee ſaith baſe Tenure, is to hold in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenage, which ſaid opinion of <hi>Fitz-Herbert,</hi> have beene by divers wreſted, to make no diuerſity betweene Tenure in Villenage, and Tenure, by Coppy of Court Role or baſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, wherein whatſoever interpretation may be made, Maſter <hi>Fitz Herberts</hi> meaning is very plaine, and the Booke of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, is to be farre otherwiſe underſtood: as alſo I ſuppoſe, all other Authorities in our Law doe make and appoint difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Tenures. And firſt touching the Booke of the old Tenures it is plaine, that the Booke maketh a plaine diſtinction betweene Tenure in Villenage, and <hi>Tenure</hi> in Fee Baſe, which is underſtood this <hi>Tenure</hi> by Coppy-hold, and calleth it a Fee although a baſe Fee, and maketh diverſe diſtinctions betweene them, and ſayth, that the <hi>Tenants</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:7887:5"/>
in <hi>Villenage</hi> muſt doe all ſuch things as their Lord will command them. But otherwiſe, it is of the <hi>Tenants</hi> in Baſe Fee. And this it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſayd Booke of olde <hi>Tenure;</hi> to be by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> miſ-recited, which I am the bolder to affirme, ſaving the due reverence to his Learning: becauſe one Mr. <hi>Thornton</hi> of <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inne, a man very learned in his late Reading there upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Forger facts:</hi> Speaking of <hi>Forging Court Roles,</hi> did playnly affirme the Booke of the olde <hi>Tenures</hi> to be miſtaken by Mr. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in this poynt. And beſides, for the further credite of <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holds,</hi> we ought to conſider the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Mr. <hi>Littleton,</hi> who amongſt the reſt of his <hi>Tenures,</hi> doth make a divided Chapter thereof, differing from his <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in <hi>Villenage,</hi> ſhewing there the Suites and Plaints of <hi>Coppy-holders,</hi> ſaying that they haue an Eſtate of Inheritance according to the Cuſtome: And delivereth his owne opinion, that if a <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> doing his Services bee compelled by the Lord, he ſhall haue an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tranſgreſſion. And ſayth, that <hi>Danby</hi> and <hi>Brian 21. Ed.</hi> 4. were of the ſame Minde, according to which is <hi>Bracton,</hi> and the ſayd Preſidents of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and the Writ vſed in <hi>Tempore, R.</hi> 2. beſides many other reaſons at the Common-Law, &amp;c. prooving that by uſe and circumſtance things may alter and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7887:5"/>
change their originall nature.</p>
            <p>As for example, the ſervice of <hi>Socage Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi> was at the beginning, (as Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> ſayth) to Till the Lords Land, &amp;c. And yet now by conſent of the Lord, and by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time are turned into money, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Services in lieu thereof. Even ſo may be ſayd of <hi>Coppy-holds,</hi> as long as the <hi>Tenants</hi> themſelves be free, though their <hi>Tenure</hi> were at beginning never ſo bound and baſe: yet by courſe of time, they may gayne more liberty and freedome, and grow to more eſtimation and account. An other reaſon and Rule there is at the Common-Law, to this intent, that ſome things there were which in the beginning were but <hi>voluntary,</hi> and yet in the end by continuance became <hi>Compulſary,</hi> as appeareth 27 <hi>Aſſ. praeſcript. Bract.</hi> That a man that did at the firſt of his owne meere benevolence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre a high way or a Bridge by often uſing, was afterwards compelled <hi>volens nolens.</hi> Even ſo it may be ſayd of the <hi>Coppy-holders,</hi> who at the firſt held but at the free will of the Lord; yet now by uſage and continuall gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting time out of minde, they haue gotten an eſtate after the Cuſtome, that doing their Services, and behaving themſelues well, they cannot by Law or Reaſon be put from them. Thus much for the allowance of <hi>Coppy-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> by the Common-Law, now let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7887:6"/>
the Reputation of them by the Statutes and Parliament Law.</p>
            <p>It appeareth by the Statute of 1. <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. <note place="margin">Statutes and Parliament Lawes.</note> 4. &amp; 19. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 23. That a <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> that may diſpend twenty ſixe shillings eight pence by the yeare ſhall be Empanelled on a Iury, as hee that may diſpend twenty shillings by the yeare of Free Lands. And by the Statute of the 2. <hi>Ed. 6. cap.</hi> 8. the Intereſt of <hi>Coppy-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> are Reſerved, being found by Office after the Death of the Kings Tenants, as well as other Eſtates at the Common-Law, and ſo doth the Statute of Monaſteries. 31. <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 13. &amp; 1. <hi>Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 14. preſerue <hi>Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds</hi> from diſſolving. And it will ſeeme that <hi>Coppy-holders</hi> are for the Common-wealth, and therefore to bee maintayned, for that ſome haue beene erected and eſtabliſhed by Parliament, which were not <hi>de viſible</hi> by <hi>Coppy</hi> before, as appeareth by the Statutes 32 <hi>Hen. 8. 2. 2.

            <p>
               <hi>Demeanes</hi> are ſo called, for that the Lord himſelfe occupieth and manureth them <hi>In ſon maine Demeaſne.</hi> But all Lands that have been in the Lords owne hands, bee not called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes,</hi> for all Free-holds and Coppy-holds were in his owne hands at the beginning. But <hi>Demeanes</hi> is that which is now, and time our of Minde have beene in the Lords hands, or occupation of his Bay liffe or Servants: And that alſo which auncient Coppy-hold may be to ſome purpoſe called <hi>Demeaſnes,</hi> becauſe in every Surrender in <hi>Manus Domini,</hi> and every grant <hi>extra manus Domini,</hi> the Lord hath a medling with it, and may thereupon keepe his Court, and for the moſt part cut downe Timber, and ſuch like: And that it is alſo called <hi>Demeaſnes,</hi> which now is in the Lords hands by any new Eſcheate or Forfeiture. And alſo the Lands which are in the hands of the Coppy-holders, is ſuch a <hi>Demeaſne</hi> as with other Services will make a Mannour,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7887:7"/>
though the Lord hath none other demeanes there in his owne hands, nor in the hands of his Bayliffe, or ſervants Services, as with a Demeaſne ſhal make a Mannour to maintaine: Coppy-holds is where a man holdeth Lands or Tenements freely to ſuite to the Court of the Lord of the Mannour within the ſayd Fee: But yet euery kind of Service will not make a Mannour, for Services are of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> That is by Tenure and by covenant; Service by Tenure is alſo of two ſorts, as if a man at this day giveth his Land in tayle, or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it for Life or Yeares, ſaving the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: here is a Service of Fealty incident to this Tenure, betweene the <hi>Doner</hi> or the <hi>Leſſor,</hi> and the <hi>Donee</hi> or the <hi>Leſsee.</hi> And yet though this be a Service by Tenure, yet is it no ſuch Service as will make a Mannour. For if a man at this Day be ſeiſed of twenty Acres of Land, and <hi>Enfeffeth</hi> nineteene ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſons of nineteene of theſe Acres, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the twentieth to himſelfe, and reſerveth of every of his <hi>Fcofees</hi> ſuite of the Court and other Services to be done to this Court, to be held on the twentieth Acre, though the <hi>Feofments</hi> be by Deed indented, or in tayle or of Lives, yet all is voyde, and avayleth not to make a Mannour.

            <p>It is to bee noted, that although a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of his proper ought to conſiſt of demeanes and ſervices, yet in ſome caſes that may bee a Manour, and maintaine Coppy-holders, and a Court Baron, by uſage and cuſtome, which otherwiſe by Common Law is no Manour, nor cannot ſo be called, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Cuſtome</hi> is where by continuance of time, a Right is obtayned concerning divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in common.</p>

               <hi>Vſage</hi> is by continuance of time the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of them both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:7887:11"/>
Limitation is where a right may be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by reaſon of a <hi>non</hi> claime, by the ſpace of a certaine number of yeares, differing in the Accoumpt of time, from cuſtome and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
            <p>But what meaſure of time ſhall make a Cuſtome; divers have differed in opinion; ſome judging the ſame to bee according to the Computation of yeares, from the time of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. untill the Statute of M. 1. which appointeth the limitation in a writ of right: The accompt of which time unto the ſaid Statute, from the ſaid K. time is 76. yeares, others have thought a hundred years maketh a preſcription, becauſe in old time an hundred yeares was accompted a Fee ſimple.</p>
            <p>But the true meaſure thereof according to Maſter <hi>Littletons</hi> Rule, is where a Cuſtome, or Uſage, or other things have beene uſed, ſo long as mans memory cannot remember the contrary. That is, when ſuch matter is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that no man then in life, hath not heard any thing, nor know any proofe to the contrary.</p>
            <p>And by this it appeareth that <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> and preſcriptions, reſteth onely in the memory
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7887:11"/>
of man, &amp; limitation conſiſteth onely of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time, which hath a certain beginning and of certaine ending, and is not directed by mans memory, wherein is ment limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time, and not limitation of eſtates.</p>
            <p>If Lands have been demiſed by Coppy by the ſpace of 60. yeares, and yet there be ſome alive, that remembreth the ſame occupied by Indenture, this is not a good Coppy-hold.</p>
            <p>And if Lands have beene demiſed by Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py but 40 yeares, and there is none alive that can remember the ſame to bee otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: This is a good Coppy-hold, for the number of yeares makes not the matter, but the memory of man. And it is not 60. 80. or 100 yeares that maketh a Coppyhold or a cuſtome, though it makes a limitation. But ſuch certaine number of yeares makes onely a likely-hood, or preſumption of a preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, that it commonly happeneth not that any mans memory alive, can remember alone ſuch a number of yeares. But if any chance to be alive, that remembreth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, then ſuch preſcription muſt give place to ſuch proofe.</p>

            <p>Alſo if a Surrender of a Coppy-hold bee made to the uſe of a ſtranger for Life, and the Lord makes a grant thereof, to the ſame ſtranger in Fee, this ſhall not binde the heire of the Tenant, but that hee may enter after the death of the grantee, for hee tooke the Land by the Surrender, and not by the grant made by the Lord: for the Lord is but an inſtrument for the conveyance of the Land, for if I make a Surrender unto the Lord <hi>ea Intentione,</hi> that hee ſhall grant over unto ſuch a man, if the Lord will not grant the ſame, I may then reenter, but the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath no meanes to enforce the Lord to grant the ſame over unto him, but hee may maintaine Treſpas againſt the the Lord, if hee doth ſuffer mee to reenter, and this is the opinion at this day.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7887:47"/>
Lord to make him a new Copy if he will not, but hee may retaine the Land in his owne hands, and therefore the grants of ſuch Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes as are expired, made by a leſſee for yeares, are void.</p>

            <p>FIrſt, Land Demiſeable, by Coppy in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, is perfect Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-hold; ſo if it bee demiſed by <hi>Coppy</hi> 15. or 16 yeares.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the Lord purchaſe the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pihold of his Tenant money, this is clearly a ſurrender, and an extinguiſhment of the Coppy, and it is not demiſeable by <hi>Coppy</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But if the Lord enter for forfeiture without preſentment found, that is demiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Coppy againe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Lord bring Treſpas againſt a Coppy-holder, who pleads that it is Free
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7887:47"/>

            <p>Fourthly, the Lord cannot ſeiſe, becauſe his <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> was ſworne to give evidence againſt him, for this is no forfeiture.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, if a <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> diſſeiſe his Lord of other Land, that is not a forfeiture of the Coppy-hold.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, if a Coppy-holder dye without heire, and the Lord enter by eſcheat, this is demiſeable by Coppy againe; but if the Lord afterwards doe make a feoffment, or ſuffer a recovery, and after doe repurchaſe it, it is not demiſeable; but if the <hi>Lord</hi> reverſe the Judgement upon recovery by error, attaint, or deceit, and hath reſtitution, then it is demiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Coppy againe.</p>
            <p>A diſſeiſin doth not extinguiſh the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, nor acts done by the diſſeiſor.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, if a Coppy-holder ſuffer a recovery by preſcript at common Law by colluſion, or make a Feofment, or bargaine and ſale, and the Lord enters and makes a leaſe for yeares thereof; the Land is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeable by Coppy againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:7887:48"/>
Eighthly, if a Coppy-holder ſurrender his Land, to the intent that a ſtranger ſhall have the Rent out of it by Coppy; it is no good Coppy-hold Rent.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, if there bee two joyn-tenants in Common of a Mannour; and a Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder ſurrenders to the uſe of one, this is not Coppy-hold Land.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, if the Husband and Wife bee joynt-coppy-holders of the purchaſe of the husband during Coverture, and the Husband is attainted of Felony and dyeth, this is not a Forfeiture of any part of the Coppy-hold; but if the purchaſe was made before the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture, then it is a Forfeiture of the moyty.</p>
            <p>Eleventh, If two Coppy-holders ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change by licence, and after the part of the one is recovered by an elder title, he may enter in the Land which the other hath in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
            <p>Twelvth, If two Coperceners Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders make partition, and the one is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded and doth looſe by juſt title, and the recoverer enters into the Land, ſhee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter upon her ſiſter, becauſe ſhe did

not pray in aide for the rate. A feme Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Joynt Coppy-holder with another in Fee, may ſurrender her moyty to the uſe of her Husband and it is good.</p>
            <p>Thirteenth, the Kings Steward without ny patent of his Office ſeiſeth divers Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and afterwards the Lord Treaſurer and thoſe of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> doe leaſe the ſame Land for yeares; and thereupon it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whether Coppies made by the Steward without patent were good? and the Lord <hi>Dier</hi> thought they were good <hi>Copyes;</hi> but in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> the Barons were of another opinion.</p>
            <p>Fourteenth, a man ſeiſed of a Mannour, to which Coppy-holders for yeares and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are belonging, hee deviſeth by teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſame Mannour to a ceraine perſon for payment of his debts, during which time divers Coppyes expire, and the deviſees grant new Coppyes, and afterwards during the terme, the deviſees grant in reverſion, and a particular Tenant ſurrenders in <hi>Court</hi> to the uſe of the grantee, and after the wife of the deviſor recovers in Dower part of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and hath execution of thoſe <hi>Coppy-holds</hi> aſſigned by the Sheriffe for her Dower: And it was mooved, whether the Wife ſhall
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7887:49"/>
avoid thoſe Coppyes made by the deviſees? And <hi>Browne</hi> Juſtice was of opinion that no; to which <hi>Weſton</hi> agreed, for they ſaid, that thoſe are ordinary things, and which muſt bee done of neceſſity by force of the Cuſtome, and not any deede or new charge created by the deviſees, who are but officers to execute the Cuſtome which of neceſſity muſt bee done, for they cannot bee made by any others who have the poſſeſſion of the Mannour; for it hath beene adjudged, that ſuch Coppyes and ordinary things, as preſentment to a Church made by a diſſeiſor, or by a Leſſee for Life or Yeares ſhall ſtand good, and ſhall not bee avoided by reaſon of the neceſſity: but other charges created by the Heire after the death of the Huband, as a Leaſe for yeares Rent charge in which there is no ſuch necſſity, the Tenant in dowre ſhall diſcharge them, and although the Wife ſhall bee adjudged in by her husband, yet ſhee ſhall not have thoſe things which chance before aſſignment of her dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. If a wardſhip fall, or an avoidance of a <hi>Church,</hi> or a villaine regardant hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and the heire enters, or preſents, theſe things the heire ſhall have, and not the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Dowre, and it may be that the wife will never ſue for her dower, or peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7887:49"/>
ſhe ſhall have other Mannours aſſigned her for the ſame. And as to the reaſon, that it is not a thing of neceſſity to grant Coppies in reverſion, yet they were of opinion that becauſe the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> doth allow it, it is <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome ley,</hi> and therefore it may bee put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: for the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> is annexed unto the Land, and not unto the intereſt of the Lord. But <hi>Wray</hi> ſaid, that of eſtates that are to <hi>Coppyholders</hi> and their heires ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtome of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if ſuch a Coppy-holder dye without heire, the Cuſtome is determined. If ſuch a Leſſor for life or yeares of the ſame Mannour grant new Coppyes, they are not good, and ſo there is a diverſity.</p>
            <p>A man cannot devise that his friends ſhall make Coppyes or hold Courts, for none ſhall make Coppye: but he that is Lord of the Mannour, and hath an intereſt.</p>
            <p>The Lord of the Mannour ſhall have the government of the Coppy-hold during the infancy of his Tenant: Executors ſhall have a Leaſe for yeares of Coppy-hold Land without any new admittance.</p>
            <p>The Husband of a Wife that is Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder for yeares, ſhall not bee newly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after the death of the <hi>Wife,</hi> nor bee tenant by the courteſie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:7887:50"/>
Where inheritance of a <hi>Coppy-hold</hi> deſcends, the heire may enter without admittance; but it was a doubt whether he ſhould have an action of Traverſe againſt a ſtranger before admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for before admittance he is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tenant; if such an heire will not come to the next <hi>Court,</hi> the Lord may make proces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> ſhall have Traverſe againſt his Lord, paying his Services and cuſtomes.</p>
            <p>If erronious judgement be given againſt a <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> in the Lords Court, the Lord in his Court may reverſe it, for it is not amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in any other place or Court.</p>
            <p>If the Leſſe of a Coppy-hold commit waſte and the Lord ſeiſeth for forfeiture; the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holder ſhall not have an action of waſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Leſſee, as if Tenant for life make a Leaſe for yeares, which Leſſee maketh waſte, and the Leſſor recovers, the Tenant for Life ſhall not have an action of the Caſe, but is without remedy; for it was his folly that hee would not have a Collatterall covenant of the Lesſee that he ſhould doe no waſte.</p>
            <p>A Coppy-hold is not forfeit for hereſie, by the laſt of 2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>A Coppy-holder is not Ter-tenant, but is Tenant at the Lords will; and a Coppi-hold is not bound by the ſtatute of Wills nor of

Tines, nor of Limitations</p>
            <p>A <hi>Coppy-hold</hi> ſhall not be extended by a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, Marchant or Staple.</p>
            <p>The Husband and Wife being ſeiſed of a Mannour to them and the heires of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; hee grants a Rent charge out of it, and dyes, the <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> ſurrenders, the Wife makes another <hi>Coppie</hi> and dyes, the grantee ſhall diſtraine upon the <hi>Coppy-hold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Lord of a Mannour hath a great waſte, and grants a rent charge out of the ſame, and the <hi>Coppy-holders</hi> have <hi>Common</hi> in the waſte, and they put in their <hi>Cattell,</hi> the grantee ſhall diſtraine them, if they cannot make preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> surrender to the uſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Lord will not admit him, nor make a grant unto him, the ſurrender is void.</p>
            <p>If there be two Joynt <hi>Coppy-holders,</hi> and the one commits a forfeiture, he ſhall forfeit but the Moyty.</p>
            <p>Leſſee for yeares ofa <hi>Coppy-hold</hi> ſhall have an <hi>eiectione firme;</hi> by <hi>Plowden</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>If there be a Leaſe for yeares of a Mannour, and one Coppy-holder purchaſe the reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in, fee, this is a deſtruction of the Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and the Leſſee of the Mannour may put him out, and occupy during his terme. 8. <hi>Eliz.</hi> adjudged.</p>
            <p>A Coppy-holder purchaſeth the Mannour to him and another in fee, the companion may occupy the Coppy-hold joyntlyp reſently 14. <hi>Eliz.</hi>

               <hi>Nota,</hi> it was agreed in the common Bench. 21. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that the Bay liffe of a hundred or of a baſe Court, may take goods upon <hi>levari facias,</hi> to give execution to the plaintife, as well as the Sheriffe; yet they agreed that divers Bookes are againſt it. 4. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 22.</p>
            <p>Two Joint Copy-holders in Fee make a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is good, and no forfeiture, nor aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 12. <hi>Eliz.</hi> agreed in duchie chamber.</p>
            <p>If a Coppy-holder ſurrender, and then the Lord doth acknowledge a ſtatute marchant, and after the Lord grants it by Coppy, the Coppy-hold is liable, for at the time of the knowledgment it was annexed to the free hold; but if a <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> acknowledge a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that is not liable.</p>
            <p>If a man enter with force upon a <hi>Coppyholder,</hi> he ſhall not have forceable entrey, nor indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Lord ſhall have it, and upon reſtitution to the Lord the <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> ſhall enter.</p>
            <p>The Lord grants to a <hi>Coppy-holder</hi> his trees growing, or that ſhall be growing upon the Land, he may fell trees now growing, and no forfeiture, by reaſon of the diſpenſation, but he cannot cut the trees which ſhall grow in time to come.</p>
            <p>If the diſſeiſor of a Mannour make <hi>Coppyes</hi> for life, and the disſeiſee enter, he ſhall defeat them, but of <hi>Coppy-holds</hi> in fee before diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, and a new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
