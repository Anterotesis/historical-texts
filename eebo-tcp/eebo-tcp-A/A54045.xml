            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving bad a Book of <hi>Lodowick Muggleton</hi>'s ſent me to peruſe, and having been earneſtly preſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by ſome, who had let in his ſpirit and doctrines, to their great hurt: in the fear of the Lord, and in the ſenſe of his holy Spirit of Truth, and in tender love to them who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted this of me, I caſt my eye thereupon; wherein I obſerved very many things contrary to the Spirit of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Lord, the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the holy Scriptures, and the nature of Truth; ſome whereof (for the ſervice of others) are here communicated. To which, there aroſe ſomewhat in my heart to add concerning my ſelf, in reference to my weariſom ſeekings, journeys and travels after the Lord. Indeed it came upon me very freſhly and livingly: and the Lord may pleaſe to make it uſefull to others, even to help to ſtay the minds and quicken the hopes of ſuch that are fainting, as I deeply was. Now if ſo be any ſhall reap any benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, let them give glory to the Lord alone, who alone is worthy thereof. For I ſeek not eſteem of men; but all my deſire is, that men might know the Lord and the Power of his Truth, and by him be gathered into and preſerved in that which is pure of him It is the day of the Goſpel, even of Gods Eternal Power, which is riſen in many hearts: for indeed the Light of the Everlaſting Day of God ſhines gloriouſly, and doth conquer and ſhall conquer the darkneſs and corruption in mens minds daily more and more. O that more might partake of its vertue, and not ſtumble at that ſtumbling Stone, which the Builders out of the Life and Power, in every Age and Generation, have firſt diſpiſed and rejected. O that men might ſeek after Chriſt, the Wiſdom of God aright: not in that ſpirit and wiſdom which ſhall never find him. For it is eaſie to ſeek amiſs, but none can ſeek aright, ſave only thoſe that are led and taught of God ſo to do.</p>

               <hi>Obſervations on ſome paſſages of</hi> Lodowick Muggleton, <hi>in his Interpretation of the 11th Chapter of the</hi> Revelations.</head>
            <p>IN Page 9. he ſaith, [The Law is not written in the Seed of Faiths Nature at all, but in the Seed of Reaſons Nature only. (Reaſon, or the Spirit of Reaſon, he ſaith, is the Devil, p. 15.)]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The Sum of the Law is Love: <hi>Even to love God above all, and ones Neighbour as ones ſelf.</hi> And this Love, which is the Sum of the Law, and fulfils the Law, God writeth in the hearts of his ſpiritual Seed.</p>
            <p>In p. 15. he affirmeth, [That that ſaying of the Devil was true which he laid to Chriſt, <hi>All the Kingdoms of the Earth are mine.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof. The Devil hath no right to it. God never gave it him: <hi>but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is Judge, who throweth down one and ſetteth up another, diſpoſing of the Kingdoms of men according to his pleaſure,</hi> Pſal. 75. 7. Dan. 4. 25.</p>
            <p>In p. 19. he ſaith, [There never was no Enmity between the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Serpent and the Perſon of the Woman: but the Enmity which lay between them was in the two Seeds.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Is not the Enmity as expeſsly placed by God between the Serpent and the Woman, as between their Seeds? <hi>I will put En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed,</hi> Gen. 3. 15.</p>
            <p>In p. 21. he ſaith, [So that now God himſelf is not capable to diſſolve himſelf into Seed or Nature, as he was before.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Is God changable? Is he one thing to day, and another thing tomorrow? and can he never be any more what he was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day? His god may be ſo: but the true God is not ſo. <hi>(I the Lord change not.)</hi> his Nature, his Seed, his Life, his Spirit, his Power is the ſame for ever.</p>
            <p>Further in p. 21. he ſaith, [Theſe two Seeds were thoſe two
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93409:3"/>
ſpiritual bodies which are called by the revelation of <hi>Moſes</hi> two Trees. Yet they were in forms of men, and was capable as they were ſpiritual bodies to diſſolve into Seed or Nature, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come capable to ſuffer the paine of death.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> O the depth of imagination from that Spirit, which giveth imaginations to them that will receive them! He that is taught of God never learned thus; but learneth much otherwiſe: and in the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe and experience knoweth the two Seeds, and is born of the one and ſeparated from the other from the very womb, I mean, from his birth of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, which is free (from the ſpirit of deceit and all its imaginary knowledge) which is the Mother of all that are born of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>In p. 22. he ſaith, [Knowledge proceedeth from life that hath wiſdom in it.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Living knowledge doth. But there is a knowledge which comes not from the true Wiſdom; nor doth convey Life but Death. And ſuch is the knowledge which he hath from his god, and holdeth forth to others: it poyſons and corrup<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the mind, and leads out of the capacity of receiving and obeying the Truth, as it is in Jeſus.</p>
            <p>In p. 27. he ſaith, [Reaſon can feed on nothing but what it can ſee with this viſible eye.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That is not Reaſons food only, which is ſeen with this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible eye: but Reaſon is in the mind, and feeds chiefly on thing which the mind gathers and comprehends inwardly.</p>
            <p>In p. 29. he ſaith, [I declare by revelation from the holy Spirit, that out of theſe two ſpiritual trees came forth theſe two Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, namely the Commiſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and the Commiſſion of Jeſus and the Apoſtles.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> He had ſaid before, p. 11. One of theſe trees was the tree of knowledge of good and evil (in the form of a man, p. 14.) that tempted <hi>Adam.</hi> Was that which tempted <hi>Adam,</hi> the tree out of which <hi>Moſes</hi> his Commiſſion came? Doth not he call this tree the Serpent? (p. 30.) Had <hi>Moſes</hi> his Commiſſion from the Serpent? Surely every one that is of God will ſay, no.</p>
            <p>In p. 30. he ſaith, [Theſe two Olive-trees and Candleſticks here ſpoken of, I declare are thoſe two Commiſſions which came forth of theſe two ſpiritual trees.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> One of theſe trees he ſaid was the very Perſon of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93409:3"/>
God himſelf, p. 10. That the other was the tree that tempted <hi>Adam:</hi> whereas the Tree did not tempt <hi>Adam,</hi> but the Serpent tempted <hi>Eve</hi> to eat of the Fruit of the Tree.</p>
            <p>Again p. 30. he ſaith, <hi>[Moſes</hi> acted as a God in the perſon of the Angel or Tree of knowledge of good and evil.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. Moſes</hi> was faithfull in all his houſe as a Servant. Nor did he act in the perſon of the Serpent; for the Serpent was the Devil, and was out of Truth long before <hi>Moſes</hi> time, and ſpake of his own: but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake and miniſtred from the pure holy Spirit of Life. Was not the Devil defiled, a corrupt tree, an Angel fallen from his habitation, before he tempted <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> to ſin and fall? And who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? or an holy Commiſſion out of the Devil?</p>
            <p>In p. 31. he ſaith, [The Law (ſpeaking of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law) which is juſt and good, doth enlighten Reaſon to do as he is done unto, not as he would be done unto.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> If Chriſt may be believed, he ſaith otherwiſe: for he ſaith, <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Matth. 7. 12. So that the Law and the Prophets did teach and require this, not only for a man to do as he is done unto, but as he would be done to.</p>
            <p>In p. 32. he ſaith, [The Law of Reaſon is called a law of ſin and death, it being given unto reaſon, becauſe reaſon is ſin; for there is nothing doth break the Law but Reaſon]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Thoſe that are delivered by the powerfull appearance of Chriſt from the law of ſin and death, knows it to be another Law then the Law of Reaſon, even a law contrary not only to the Life of Chriſt, but to the reaſon and underſtanding of a man, bringing him below the ſtate of Reaſon, even into bruitiſh captivity and ſenſuality. Doth Reaſon teach a man to mannage his body deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively and unreaſonably, as the corrupt and unreaſonable law of ſin and death teacheth many men? Reaſon is not ſin: but a devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from that from which Reaſon came, is ſin. God did not create man in ſin; or make a ſinful Creature: but he gave him Reaſon, and thereby made him reaſonable.</p>
            <p>In p. 34. he ſaith, [The Moon <hi>(Rev.</hi> 12.) did ſignifie the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which muſt now be trod underfoot by the Sun-ſhine Light of the Goſpel.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93409:4"/>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> No not ſo: the Law is not trod underfoot by the Light and Power of Life, when it appeareth; but its righteouſneſs is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled <hi>in them that walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 4. Chriſt did not teach men to tread <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Law under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot; but brings forth that Life and beſtows that Spirit, which leads through and beyond the Law, even to the righteouſneſs of Faith, (which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) they did not make the Law void by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. Therefore not trod underfoot through Faith in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>In p. 37. he ſaith, [There was none of the Prophets that were commiſſionated to write Scripture.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> They ſpake and wrot as they were moved by the holy Spirit, and is not that a ſufficient Commiſſion? In his Book called <hi>The neck of the Quakers broken,</hi> he had ſcoffingly caſt away the Writings of <hi>Solomon</hi> from being Scripture; and now he caſts away the Writings of all the Prophets too, as being written without Commiſſion?</p>
            <p>In p. 42. he argueth againſt Gods being an infinite, incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Spirit, ſaying, [Such a great vaſt Spirit doth not know it ſelf, neither can this vaſt Spirit tell where to find or ſee it ſelf: and if it cannot know or ſee it ſelf, how ſhould his Creature be able to know or ſee his Maker, when as he cannot know or ſee himſelf? Then alſo that would be a vain thing which is ſpoken of in holy writ, where it is ſaid, <hi>It is Life Eternal to know the true God.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Here is dark imaginations indeed. He that cannot read in the Spirit, let him read that place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 12. according to the plainneſs of the Letter, and ſee if God can be leſs then infinite and incomprehenſible. He that knoweth the Nature and Spirit of God, knoweth God, though he be not able to meaſure or diſcern the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of his Beeing, which who can? For he is a Sea of Life, a Sea of Love, a Sea of Purity and Righteouſneſs, a Sea of Power and Wiſdom, &amp;c. but in a meaſure of the ſame Life, received from him, we know him ſo to be; and worſhip him in the Spirit and Life which is of him; not making likeneſſes of him in our minds, but bowing to him and worſhipping him in his own appearances.</p>
            <p>In p. 77. he ſaith, [The holy Ghoſt ſate upon none like as of fire, but the Twelve Apoſtles; neither could any other ſpeak with tongues by inſpiration, but the Twelve Apoſtles.]</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93409:4"/>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> This is directly contrary to the Teſtimony held forth in Scripture. <hi>For,</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter, the holy Ghoſt fell on them, as on in at the beginning,</hi> Acts 11. 15. <hi>And they of the Circumciſion which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved were aſtoniſhed, becauſe that on the Gentiles alſo was poured out the gift of the holy Ghoſt. For they heard them ſpeak with tongues and magnifie God,</hi> Chap. 10. 45, 46.</p>
            <p>In p. 52. he ſaith, [Chriſt's Apoſtles could do no miracles, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they caſt out Devils until he was aſcended.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Did they not caſt out Devils and do miracles, while he was on Earth? Did not he give them power ſo to do? See <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
            <p>In p. 59. and 60. he ſpeaking of the wild Olive-tree, and the good Olive-tree. [The wild Olive-tree, he ſaith, is the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or reaſon, the Devil which is wild by nature. The good Olive-tree, he ſaith, was the very Perſon of Chriſt, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ingrafted into by Faith. But the Commiſſion of <hi>Miſes</hi> and the Prophets proceeded from the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, he acting his part in that Seed, &amp;c.] which he afore ſaid was the Serpent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Is the wild Olive-tree (the Devil which is wild by nature) one of Gods Witneſſes, or the head or root from whence any of the Commiſſions of Gods Spirit came? Did the Law of God, which was againſt Sin and the Devil, come from the Devil? Is not the Law holy, juſt and good? and did it come from an unholy root? What was the Olive-tree the Jews were broken off from? Read their ſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4, 5. and 11. 16, 17. Was this holy Root they were broken from a wild Olive-tree? What interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is here? Surely from a Spirit quite contrary to that which wrot it.</p>
            <p>In p. 63. he ſaith, [The great and high wall about the new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> was all that viſible and external worſhip, which was ſet up by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which did belong to that Tabernacle, &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Is this the defence about the glory of the new <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> is this the Wall and Bulwark?

            <p>In p 78. he ſaith, [The Commiſſion of the Apoſtles was not the Commiſſion of the Spirit.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv. Paul</hi> ſaith, they <hi>were made able Miniſters of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. What is to be deſired more then the new Covenant? wherein Life, Spirit and Power is received. Now the Apoſtles were made by God able Miniſters thereof: and the glory of this Covenant and Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remaineth, verſe 11.</p>
            <p>In p. 93. he ſaith, [Death being the Firſt-born of the Law, it went forth as a Conqueror of all Life both in God and man.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The Law is holy juſt and good, and bringeth forth only that which is holy. Sin is not of the Law, but againſt the Law; and the wages of ſin is death. Yet neither ſin nor death could ever conquer the Life of God, but the unconquerable Life and Power have ever reigned over them. Gods Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom, and his Dominion endureth throughout all Ages, which Sin, nor Death, nor Hell could ever conquer. That life which Chriſt did give up, none took from him as a Conqueror, but he laid it down freely, at the requiring of the Father, knowing his glorious Power was able to reſtore and raiſe it up again.</p>
            <p>In p. 105. he ſaith, [The body of man is that Tophet that was ordained of old, and the ſpirit of Reaſon is that King, which muſt abide in this Tophet.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The body of man was Gods Temple before it was defiled with ſin; and is Gods Temple again, when it is purified and purged from ſin. Now him that defileth this Temple of God, <hi>him will God deſtroy.</hi> And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Fear him who after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell,</hi> Luk. 12. 5. What is he able to caſt into Hell? why, <hi>both body and ſoul,</hi> Mat. 10. 28. Then the body of man is not the Tophet or Hell: but Tophet is that whereinto the ſouls and bodies of the wicked are to be caſt.</p>

               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Eternity did never become time, but is unchangable in its Nature, Spirit, Life and Beeing for evermore: but it brought forth natural and changable things in time, which time ſhall have an end.</p>

            <p>In p. 15. he ſaith, [Whoever is partaker of the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> may be ſaid to have the Spirit of Chriſt in them, and their ſpirits to be in him, that is Chriſt dwells in their hearts by Faith.]</p>

            <p>In p. 17. [He calls Reaſon the Devil, and p. 29. ſaith, This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſo much ſpoken of in Scripture, is no other but the ſpirit of Reaſon.]</p>

            <p>In p. 23. he ſaith, [To ſay that Chriſt according to the Fleſh was of <hi>Abraham</hi> is Blaſphemy.]</p>

            <p>In p. 25. he ſaith, [God hath made him the Judge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.]</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Again p. 25. he ſaith further, [We the Witneſſes of the Spirit do know more then <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets and Apoſtles did, things of more higher concernment.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The Apoſtles were not the leaſt in the Kingdom, but in the glory of the day (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.) in the Eternal Life, in him that was true (1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20.) and they had the whole Counſel of God, even a Miniſtry ſufficient to perfect the Work of God in the Saints <hi>(Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12.) that ſo they might preſent men perfect in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 28.

Again, <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> chap. 4. 6. In that day the woman was clothed with the Sun <hi>(for as many as are truly baptiſed into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 27.) had the Moon under her feet, and was crowned with a Crown of twelve Stars, and not only travelling to bring forth, but brought forth the Man-child which was to rule all Nations. They who are indeed in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93409:7"/>
the Spirit, know that the Light which is now broke forth, is but the Light of the ſame Day which ſhined then very gloriouſly in them, who were the glory of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. They had the Spirit of God plentifully poured upon them, which opened to them the myſteries of the Kingdom and the deep things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. And how highly ſoever he think or ſpeak of himſelf, yet this is known concerning him, that he hath a very great journey to travel, before he can come to that meaſure of Light that they were in, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that proportion of the true Spirit that they received: For he is yet quite out of it.</p>
            <p>In p. 29. he affirmeth, [That it was the very God-head Life that ſuffered death.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> If the God-head Life ſuffered death, what power was left to raiſe it up again? <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life,</hi> ſaid Chriſt; but he ſpake concerning that which raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which was of an immortal nature and could not die: not concerning the body; but the Life and Power of the Father, which dwelt in and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed through the body; which died not with the body, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alive to raiſe the body. What kind of doctrine is this, that the very God-head Life ſuffered death, and ſo to make the Creator mortal like the Creature?</p>
            <p>In p. 39. he ſaith, [God the King of Heaven is not in this World at all.]</p>
            <p>

Whether ſhall I go from thy Spirit? or whether ſhall I flee from thy Preſence?</hi> ſaid <hi>David</hi> (who had the Spirit of God) <hi>If I aſcend up into Heaven thou art there: if I make my bed in Hell, thou art there &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 139. 7, 8. <hi>And do not I fill Heaven and Earth ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 24. But <hi>L. M.</hi> hath affirmed contrary to theſe Teſtimonies, that God is not in this World at all.</p>
            <p>In p. 48. he ſaith, [I am the only and alone Judge what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of men and women after death; neither ſhall thoſe that are damned by me, ſee any other God or Judge but me, or that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which I have paſſed upon them.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Is he God? is he Chriſt? is he the only one? is there not another God another Judge? (Yes we know there is another, who judgeth otherwiſe then he hath judged: who judgeth that to death which he judgeth to life, and that to Life which he judgeth to death.) And in the Reſurrection of the juſt and the unjuſt, ſhall

not both the juſt and unjuſt ſee him who is the Judge? Read <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 31, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, p. 48. he ſaith, [No man upon the Earth can or ought to judge of the Doctrine of a Prophet, that hath a Commiſſion from God.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Cannot he judge, who hath the Anointing? Doth not he that is a Child of God receive his Spirit? and is not the Spirit of God able to judge in them that receive it? <hi>Judge not according to the appearance,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but judge righteous judgment,</hi> Joh. 7. 24. Did Chriſt abſolutely forbid men from judging concerning him, or his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and miracles, or did he not rather direct them how they might judge aright? <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 15. The Apoſtle had a Commiſſion from God, &amp; yet he did not barrmen from judging of his words, but bid them judge: and the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the others judge,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 29. Is the Spirit of God given to and received of the Believer, and ſhall he not therewith judge concerning Spirits and Doctrines and Commiſſions which pretend to be of him, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Angels, whether they be Angels of Light indeed, or only ſuch as would ſo appear? <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God,</hi> 1 John 4. 1. And they which are of God, love to come to the Light which tries and makes manifeſt; but they that are not of God refuſe to be tried by it. <hi>Thou haſt tried them that ſay they are Apoſtle and are not, and haſt found them Lyars,</hi> Rev. 2. 2. God giveth that Light, that Spirit, that Anointing to his which hath in it ability to try, and they ought to try therewith Doctrines, Spirits, Prophets, Apoſtles, and certainly find thereby that they are of him before they receive them, or elſe they may eaſily be deceived? <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not propheſyings,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 20. but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al though a man may not deſpiſe them, yet neither may he receive them without due trial: therefore the Apoſtle in the next words adds, <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good,</hi> verſe 21.</p>
            <p>Further p. 48. he ſaith, [Who do you blind Quakers think ſhould be judge of a Prophet that hath a Commiſſion from God?]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> What ſaith the Apoſtle? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>The Spirit ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> And again verſe 15. <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man diſcerneth</hi> (or judgeth) <hi>all things, yet he himſelf is diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:93409:8"/>
Yet again p. 48. he ſaith, [Is not a true Prophet the Law-giver? and ought not every one to ſubmit unto his Law?]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> There is but one Law-giver, but one King, but one Lord, but one Maſter. All Prophets and Miniſters from him, are but his Meſſengers and Servants, not Law-givers. The Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth from the King himſelf, from the great Prophet and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of the Soul, to every Lamb and Sheep in the Covenant, as it is written, <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord (and I will write my Law in their hearts)</hi> and ſo taught by this Prophet (in the new and Living Covenant) as that they ſhall need no other Teacher. This was once fulfilled before the Apoſtacy (as is faithfully teſtified, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. <hi>The Anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you; and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teacheth you of all thing &amp;c.)</hi> and it is again fulfilled after it, bleſſed be the Name of the holy one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But mind <hi>Reader,</hi> what is the reaſon that he reviles us above all others, calling us blind, and the darkeſt pieces to interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the curſedſt of all Sects, and the like; but becauſe we ſtand moſt in his way, becauſe we cannot receive him as a Law-giver, becauſe we have received the true Light, the true Spirit and Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, which diſcovereth and denieth him in his very root and ground.</p>
            <p>In p. 50. [He makes himſelf the Judge, and the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but a day of general Execution, wherein Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>Come you bleſſed and go you curſed.</hi> He ſaith there ſhall be no more pleading with God, but this will be all that God will ſay in the Reſurrection, <hi>Come you bleſſed and go you curſed.]</hi>

               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Yes, there will be more ſaid. There will be the reaſon given publickly why men are bleſſed or curſed, as was teſtified by Chriſt himſelf, while he was here on Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 35, &amp;c. And men ſhall have liberty to plead as is there expreſſed, verſe 44. So that Chriſt, the great Judge, is not ſo bound up, as he would bind him up: nor are perſons, to be judged by him, abſolutely bound up from conſidering of their Sentence and pleading their cauſe with him; but if they have any thing to ſay on their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfs, they ſhall be equally heard.</p>
            <p>In p. 60. he ſaith, [God doth not come down from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Earth to interpret Scriptures to men, but this was alwayes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93409:8"/>
Gods practiſe to commiſſionate particular men, and furniſh them with gifts for that purpoſe, and what interpretations of Scriptures they give, it is owned of God as if he had done it himſelf.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Every man is to ſtand or fall to his own Maſter,</hi> and bids <hi>every man be fully perſwaded or aſſured in his own mind,</hi> and affirms, that <hi>whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14. 4, 5. and verſe 23. Nor did Chriſt deal thus, with his Diſciples, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to receive what ever interpretation of Scripture he would give them, but he opened their underſtanding that they might underſtand the Scriptures themſelves, and ſaith <hi>the Spirit of Truth ſhould lead them into all truth.</hi> Nor did the Apoſtles thus deal with men, but they waited for Gods opening of the true capacity in others, and were not lords over mens Faith, but Demonſtrators of the Truth of God to mens Conſciences by his Spirit, and as in his ſight.</p>
            <p>Again he ſaith, [Chriſt doth not teach every particular man neither by his Spirit, nor by voice of words.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Every man that is truly begotten and new-born to God, is born of his Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 3. (There is not another begetter and bringer forth of Life in the heart.) And the Spirit of the Lord, in the new Covenant, teacheth all its children. It was written ſo of old, <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of God.</hi> How taught? Why, they <hi>ſhall hear and learn of the Father,</hi> John 6. 45. Thus the Scriptures ſpeak: and thus it is witneſſed, felt and known in the heart, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord. For the children of the Lord are anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the holy anointing, with the oyl of the ſame Spirit (the ſame oyl of gladneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 11. wherewith Chriſt was anointed; which maketh them alſo of quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord, and of deep inſight into the myſteries of his Kingdom, as they grow up in his life, and ſweet innocent holy nature.</p>
            <p>Yet again in that page he ſaith, [The true and right interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scriptures, it lieth in thoſe men that God hath choſen, anointed and ſealed for that purpoſe, and men cannot come to the knowledge of God, nor the true meaning of the Scriptures, no other way.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The Goſpel is a miniſtration of the Spirit and Power of the endleſs life: and it conſiſts not in receiving words, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93409:9"/>
the Spirit from which the good words and precious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge comes. And he that receives the Spirit and hath the Spirit, receiveth and hath that which openeth and giveth entrance, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into words concerning the Kingdom, but into the Kingdom it ſelf. And the Apoſtle who had a true Commiſſion from God, was not ſent to limit men to his interpretation of Scriptures; but to turn men to the Light and to the Power which gives to ſee the Scriptures and ſpiritual things, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. And the Church of <hi>Laodecea</hi> was counſelled not only to buy gold and raiment, but alſo eye-ſalve of Chriſt, that therewith they might be enabled to ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. They had words from thoſe that were ſent by God, and much knowledge (inſomuch as they ſeemed to themſelves to be rich and full) but yet they wanted the eye-ſalve, which they were to buy themſelves: for no man is to offer any thing, but at his own coſt.</p>
            <p>Yet again in p. 60. he ſaith, [The opening of the Scriptures belongs unto commiſſionated men, and not unto Chriſt himſelf.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> In the new Covenant God himſelf is the Shepherd, the King, the Prophet, the Teacher. (This is not known only from words left upon record by holy men of God; but alſo inwardly felt and witneſſed.) The Eternal Word is nigh; nigher then words from commiſſionated men; and teacheth more inwardly and fully, then words from men can. The ſame God who creates the heart anew, puts his Law into the mind and heart, yea his Spirit within. Now to this the Goſpel Miniſters formerly did (and ſtill do) direct and turn men; but did not limit them to words from themſelves, or to their interpretations of Scriptures, as was ſaid before. And as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law men were to hear <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſo under the Goſpel men are to hear Chriſt in all things; and he that doth not hear him is to be cut of, as <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 37.</p>
            <p>In p. 62. he ſaith, [Though the Prophets and Apoſtles were anointed and ſealed of God for that great Work, will it follow therefore that you Quakers, becauſe you read their Writings, that you are anointed and ſealed of God for the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry?]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Where was this ever affirmed by them? But this they certainly know and faithfully teſtifie, that they have received the very ſame Spirit in meaſure which the Prophets and the Apoſtles
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93409:9"/>
had, and miniſter in its Name and Authority and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have the true and living Seal of their Miniſtry in many hearts.</p>
            <p>In p. 17. he ſaith, [As for my mouth being full of curſing, that is my Commiſſion. And p. 18. God hath ordained me the chief Judge in the World at this day to give ſentence upon men and womens ſpiritual and eternal ſtate what will become of them after death. Full of this curſing I confeſs my mouth is, and I do rejoyce in it too &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> When Chriſt pronounced Judgment upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he did it weeping, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 37, 38. and <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41, &amp;c. And the true Apoſtle knew that thoſe that watched for the ſoul, when they gave up the account concerning ſuch as did not ſubmit to and obey the Truth, but rebelled againſt it and periſhed, they could not do it with joy, but with grief, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
            <p>In p. 69. [He teacheth his Diſciples to curſe men to eternity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpſing ſpirits he calls them, ſuch he means as do not own his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but know it not to be of God, and faithfully teſtifie againſt it.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Chriſt taught his Diſciples to bleſs, ſaying to them, <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you,</hi> Matth, 5. 44. And the Apoſtles ſaid, <hi>Bleſs and curſe not,</hi> Rom. 12. 14. And Chriſt is the ſame at this day, and teacheth his Diſciples ſo now. Yea I and many others can faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully witneſs it, that ſince we felt the ſeed of bleſſing in our hearts, we never learned of it to curſe any man, but rather to pity them and pray to the Lord for them, and direct them to the holy Light, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Power, whereby they might be turned from their iniquities and come into the bleſſing, as <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26. And though he pretends that thoſe whom he curſes, have ſinned the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, and are Devils; yet that is but the judgment of his ſpirit, not of Gods Spirit: for they are in that which keeps from griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Spirit; much more from ſinning the great and unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſin againſt it.</p>
            <p>In p. 63. he ſaith, [Neither do I curſe any, until he judge me firſt.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Feel, ye that have true ſenſe and underſtanding, what moves him to curſe.</p>
            <p>In p 73. he ſaith, [If the witneſs that informed me did not witneſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93409:10"/>
truth, then the Sentence which I have paſſed upon them ſhall be of no value.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> How often hath he affirmed his Judgment to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſuch as God himſelf could not reverſe? But here, it ſeems, it is ſuch as may be paſſed by hearſay, and depend upon the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes words: ſo that if the Witneſs that informed him ſpake truth it ſhall ſtand; but if the Witneſs did not ſpeak truth, then the Sentence which he hath paſſed ſhall be of no value. What, ſhall a man be commiſſionated and receive authority from God to judge irreverſibly, ſo as God himſelf cannot pardon that man he hath judgeth (as he affirmeth) and yet that man not receive true ſenſe, wiſdom and underſtanding from God to preſerve him from miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it but it may be a true Judgment or a falſe Judgement, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Witneſſes information was? Ah ceaſe deceit, and for ſhame be ſilent: thy covering is manifeſtly too narrow.</p>
            <p>In p. 66. he ſaith, (ſpeaking of the penalty or puniſhment of the Laws) [If my innocency nor money will not deliver me, I muſt and will ſuffer under it.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> He hath took ſcope enough to avoid the croſs or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by any Laws, which might lay hold on him for Conſcience sake. The Apoſtles never ſaved themſelves by money from their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for their Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>In p. 70. he ſaith, [Every man that reads the Scriptures doth think to find Eternal Life in them, as Chriſt ſaid to the Jews, and as you Quakers and others do now adayes.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Do the Quakers think to find Eternal Life in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? did they ever teach men ſo? have they not very often faithfully teſtified otherwiſe? Not in words concerning the thing, but in the thing it ſelf, in the Word which was in the beginning and from the beginning; do they look to find Eternal Life. Yea and there they have found it, and do live in the Life which is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the Life which is Eternal lives in them. This Teſtimony hath the living ſeal to it (whereby it may be known by thoſe that are truly living) and cannot be ſhaken. But he hath manifeſtly in this thing (as in ſeveral others alſo) diſcovered himſelf to be a falſe Witneſs: and a falſe Witneſs can never be a true Judge. Nay alas his judgment is of and like his ſpirit, which manifeſtly is not of God; and his knowledge which he holds forth leads not to God not to Life, but to the Chambers of Hell and Death.</p>

               <hi>Obſervations on ſome Paſſages in his Letter to</hi> Thomas Tayler.</head>
            <p>IN Page 5. he ſaith, [I marvel what ſatisfaction any man can have in his mind in believing in a Quakers God, to tell a man that God abides in himſelf and is what he is.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Doth not God ſay to <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning himſelf, <hi>I am that I am.</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to know how he ſhould anſwer the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they ſhould enquire who ſent him to them, God bid him tell them that <hi>I am had ſent him, Exod.</hi> 3. 14. How could the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> underſtand what God was by this? what ſatisfaction could they find in this anſwer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> would this ſpirit ſay? But God is not to be known by the deſcription of words of the earthly wiſdom, but in his own feeling Spirit and Life.</p>
            <p>In p. 11. he ſaith, concerning the Quakers, [That which puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies your hearts is the Law written in your ſeed or nature, even the ſame as was written in the Angel-ſerpents nature before his fall, which is no other but the nature of Reaſon.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> This is not a true Teſtimony: for the Light wherewith Chriſt enlightneth the Soul (to redeem and bring it back out of the Fall) is not of the nature of Reaſon, but confounds corrupt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and brings it into the duſt, begetting the Soul into the Divine Wiſdom and giving it to pertake of the Divine Nature. Yea that which we are born of and purified by (as we ſenſible feel and truly underſtand) is not the nature of the Serpents reaſon, but the immortal Word of Gods eternal Power, which doth that in us and for us, which the nature of reaſon never did nor can do in any.</p>
            <p>Again in p. 11. he ſaith very ſlightingly and as untruly concerning the Quakers, thus. [As for the ſins your hearts are clenſed from, they are no other but ſuch like as theſe, that is to ſay, to keep the hat on the head before a Magiſtrate, and to find fault with gold-lace and a piece of ribbon, a bandſtring and a gold button, and to rend and tear gold-lace, and other lace off their clothes and burn it, and to uſe the Language of thee and thou. He or ſhe that gets thee or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93409:11"/>
thou perfectly, is a very good Quaker, they are gotten half way to the Quakers Heaven. Theſe and ſuch like righteouſneſs is the Quakers perfection, and all the cleanſing of heart they have &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> O thou deſpiſer, reproacher and belyar of the Work of God in the hearts of his children. Nay, nay, there are thouſands, who in Gods Preſence can teſtifie againſt thee, that they have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for and received the inward clenſing from the filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, from the inward luſts and motions of ſin in the mind, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving felt the Ax of the Lord and the two-edged Sword, which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up ſin at the very roots. But thou art ſo far from having thy heart cleanſed, that thou art not yet clenſed from lying lips, but bringeſt forth thy falſe reproachfull, ſlanderous teſtimony againſt the Heritage of God in the ſight of the Sun.</p>
            <p>In p. 13. he ſaith further of the Quakers, [That they own no other death of Chriſt, but what is within them, what ever they pretend by uſing the words of Scripture &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> They ſincerely and in plainneſs of heart, own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the death of that Body which the Father prepared for his Son, in which he did the Fathers Will in his ſuffering without the Gate of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Therefore in this, he is a very falſe Witneſs, and therein hath groſly belyed the Quakers.</p>
            <p>In p. 15. he ſaith, [You Quakers are the darkeſt pieces to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture, of any other Opinions in the World, for you will name places of Scripture, but never interpret any &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> It is better to bring men to that, which opens the mind to underſtand the Scriptures, then to give men interpretations of words or things beyond their capacity. Yet the Spirit of the Lord, in and through many called Quakers, doth often open many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in clearneſs and demonſtration to others. (Read the Book, called <hi>Goſpel-Liberty or the Royal Law of Love,</hi> and ſee if many Scriptures be not therein opened to the loweſt capacity.) But the Lord hath given them the true skill and underſtanding, and they are not to open to and feed that in men, which the Lord hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be famiſhed. Yet if they did not open Scriptures, the Scriptures are plain to him that hath an underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Now for a cloſe, I ſhall add ſomewhat of the Teſtimony which is written in my heart, by the finger of Gods Spirit, concerning the People called Quakers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93409:11"/>
Indeed they have met with many reproaches, and ſore oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many wayes, ſince they were a People: but notwithſtanding all, their bow abides in ſtrength, and the hands of their arms have been made ſtrong againſt the wicked one, with all his devices in his ſeveral kinds of inſtruments: and their Light is ſtill the ſame and their God the ſame, who bleſſeth them from day to day, even in the midſt of all the revilings, ſlanders, perſecutions and curſes, which they have met with from men without, and in the midſt of all the temptations, inward trials and afflictions alſo, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten met with inwardly. Yea we know him to be our God and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but truſt him, having found him to be faithfull to us hitherto, and knowing his nature to be ſuch, that he cannot but continue his loving-kindneſs and faithfulneſs, to all who are gathered by him into his holy inward, ſpiritual Covenant of Life and Peace, and who dwells with him therein. And truly we are fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and at reſt in him, and cannot deſire another, then he who hath redeemed our Souls from death, given us Life, brought us out of the pit wherein was no water, into a large place, ſet our feet upon a rock (a rock indeed) and eſtabliſheth our goings in the path of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, working all our works in us and for us, by his Spirit and Power. Yea, we have the Witneſs in our hearts, even the Witneſs which never erred nor can deceive, which teſtifieth to and with our ſpirits our Sonſhip: ſo that we do not imagine our ſelves ſons from apprehenſions upon Scriptures, but we feel our ſelves ſons in the true ſenſibleneſs, and know who <hi>David</hi> is, and reap and inherit the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> daily, <hi>O bleſſed be our Father, O bleſſed for ever be the Father of Life, who feeds, who nouriſhes, who waters, who refreſhes (with the Bread of Life and with the pure living Water) his Lambs, his babes, his plants, his tender ones, of whom he is daily tender, and who are daily tender of his Name and Honour. And if any man preach another God, then he who creates anew in the true Light, and therein puts forth his arm of Salvation, death and deſtruction and the curſe are his portion from the hand of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, O people, any of you that reads this mans writings and admire them; what ſpirit are ye of! what is it in you that reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them? what do they feed in you? Not the true Birth, I am ſure: but that in you which muſt periſh, and come into death and deſtruction, if ever your Souls be ſaved. I ſpeak ſenſibly, and from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93409:12"/>
the true underſtanding and experience which God hath given me: yea I certainly know, that the knowledge and notions which he holds forth are not pure nor able to cleanſe the heart of any that receives them</p>
            <p>And all people, that truly love your Souls and deſire the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, O wait on God that ye may be enabled by him rightly to diſtinguiſh, between receiving notions concerning God and Chriſt, and feeling and receiving the Power which effectually redeems from ſin and death: for deceit may enter in at the one, but cannot at the other. The Enemy hath all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs, to paint as if it were righteouſneſs and appear in, and to enter and poſſeſs the mind by: but he is excluded the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power. He that feels that which renews his heart to God, and breaks the power and ſtrength of luſts and temptations in him, and brings him into ſubjection to the Truth, which from God lives in the hearts of thoſe that receive it in the vertue, life and power of it: here his devices and deceits are at an end, and here the elect Sheep feel the hand of the Father, which is ſtronger then all, which none can pluck out of. Here is the Fold, here is the ſafe dwelling place, whither the Lord leadeth and where he preſerveth his Lambs and Children, and there is not another.</p>
            <p>Now as for him (notwithſtanding all that he hath done againſt the Lord and againſt his dear people) ſo far am I from wiſhing any harm unto him, that I could wiſh with all my heart, that it were poſſible for him to come to a true ſenſe of the true Light of Gods holy Spirit, that by it he might examine, wherein he hath provoked and ſinned againſt the Lord, that the Lord ſhould thus leave him, not only to be deceived himſelf, but to become an head or root of deceit to others, and ſo to bring the blood of many Souls upon him, which will be his bitter burthen and miſery in the day of the Lord upon him, when the Lord ſhall rebuke him for blaſpheming his Name, his Light, his Spirit, and ſhall juſtifie (in the ſight of men and Angels) thoſe to be his Heritage and everlaſtingly dear unto him, whom he hath reproached, miſrepreſented and curſed unto eternity: but they are gathered by God into the bleſſed Seed (which he knoweth not, nor in this ſpirit nor by this Commiſſion ſhall ever know) where he cannot curſe, nor can his curſe reach or touch them, but they therein are bleſſed for evermore,</p>

            <p>MY Heart from my childhood, was pointed towards the Lord, whom I feared and longed after from my tender years; wherein I felt, that I could not be ſatisfied with (nor indeed ſeek after) the things of this periſhing World, which naturally paſs away; but I deſired true ſenſe of and unity with that which abideth for ever. There was ſomewhat indeed then ſtill with me (even the Seed of Eternity) which leavened and ballanced my ſpirit almoſt continually: but I knew it un<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>diſtinctly, ſo as to turn to it and give up to it, entirely and underſtandingly. In this temper of mind I earneſtly ſought after the Lord applying my ſelf to hear Sermons and read the beſt Books I could meet with, but eſpecially the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were very ſweet and ſavory to me: yea I very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired and preſſed after the knowledge of the Scriptures, but was much afraid of receiving mens interpretations of them, or of faſtning any interpretation upon them my ſelf; but waited much and prayed much, that from the Spirit of the Lord I might receive the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them and that he would chiefly endue me with that Knowledge, which I might feel ſanctifying and ſaving. And indeed I did ſenſibly receive of his Love, of his Mercy and of his Grace, which I felt ſtill freely to move towards me, and at ſeaſons when I was moſt filled with the ſenſe of my own unworthineſs, and had leaſt expectations of the manifeſtation of them. But I was exceedingly entangled about Election and Reprobation (having drunk in that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93409:13"/>
doctrine, according as it was then held forth by the ſtricteſt of thoſe that were termed Puritans, and as then ſeemed to me very manifeſt and poſitive from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. &amp;c.) fearing, leſt notwithſtanding all my deſires and ſeekings after the Lord, he might in his decree have paſſed me by: and I felt it would be bitter to me to bear his Wrath and be ſeparated from his Love for evermore; yet, if he had ſo decreed, it would be, and I ſhould (notwithſtanding theſe fair beginnings and hopes) fall away and periſh at the laſt. In this great trouble and grief (which was much added to by not finding the Spirit of God ſo in me and with me, as I had read and believed the former Chriſtians had it) and in mourning over and grapling with ſecret corruptions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, I ſpent many years, and fell into great weakneſs of body; and often caſting my ſelf upon my bed, did wring my hands and weep bitterly, begging earneſtly of the Lord, daily, that I might be pitied by him and helped againſt my enemies, and be made conformable to the image of his Son, by his own renewing Power. And indeed at laſt (when my nature was almoſt ſpent, and the pit of diſpair was even cloſing its mouth upon me) mercy ſprang and deliverance came, and the Lord my God owned me and ſealed his Love unto me, and light ſprang within me, which made not only the Scriptures, but the very outward creatures glorious in my eye, ſo that every thing was ſweet and pleaſant and lightſom round about me. But I ſoon felt, that this eſtate was too high and glorious for me, and I was not able to abide in it, it ſo overcame my natural ſpirits: wherefore, bleſſing the Name of the Lord for his great goodneſs to me, I prayed unto him to take that from me which I was not able to bear, and to give me ſuch a proportion of his light and preſence, as was ſutable to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, and might fit me for his ſervice. Whereupon this was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently removed from me, yet a ſavour remained with me, wherein I had ſweetneſs and comfort and refreſhment for a long ſeaſon. But my mind did not then know, how to turn to and dwell with that which gave me the ſavour, nor rightly to read what God did daily write in my heart, which ſufficiently manifeſted it ſelf to be of him, by its living vertue and pure opperation upon me: but I looked upon the Scriptures to be my rule, and ſo would weigh the inward appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God to me, by what was outwardly written, and durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing from God immediately, as it ſprang from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but only in that mediate way. Herein did I limit the holy One of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93409:13"/>
               <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and exceedingly hurt my own Soul, and I afterwards felt and came to underſtand. Yet the Lord was tender to me and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exceedingly, opening Scriptures to me freſhly every day, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructing, warming and comforting my heart thereby: and truly he did help me to pray, and to believe, and to love him and his appearances in any, yea to love all the ſons of men and all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with a true love. But that in me which knew not the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the Lord in my ſpirit, but would limit him to words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture formerly written, that proceeded yet further, and would be raiſing a fabrick of knowledge out of the Scriptures, and gathering a perfect rule (as I thought) concerning my heart, my words, my ways, my worſhip: and according to what I thus drank in (after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from the Scriptures) I practiſed, and with much ſeriouſneſs of ſpirit and prayer to God fell a helping to build up an <hi>Independent</hi> Congregation, wherein the ſavour of Life and the Preſence of God was freſh with me, as (I believe) there are yet ſome alive of that Congregation can teſtifie.</p>
            <p>This was my ſtate, when I was ſmitten, broken and diſtreſſed by the Lord, confounded in my worſhip, confounded in my knowledge, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all in one day, (which it is hard to utter) and was matter of amazement to all that beheld me. I lay open and naked to all that would enquire of me and ſtrive to ſearch out, what might be the cauſe the Lord ſhould deal ſo with me. They would at firſt be jealous that I had ſinned and provoked him ſo to do: but when they had ſcanned things throughly, and I had opened my heart nakedly to them, I do not remember any one that ever retained that ſence concerning me. My Soul remembreth the Woomwood and Gall, the exceeding bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of that ſtate, and is ſtill humbled in me in the remembrance of it before the Lord. O how did I wiſh with <hi>Job,</hi> that I might come before him and bowingly plead with him: for indeed I had no ſenſe of any guilt upon me, but was ſick of love towards him, and as one violently rent from the boſom of his Beloved! O how gladly would I have met with death! for I was weary all the day long and afraid of the night, and weary alſo of the night-ſeaſon and afraid of the enſuing day. I remember my grievous and bitter mournings to the Lord; how often did I ſay, <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou forſaken me? why haſt thou broken me to pieces? I had no delight but thee, no deſire after any but thee. My heart was bent wholly to ſerve thee, and thou hadſt even fitted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93409:14"/>
me</hi> (as appeared to my ſenſe) <hi>by many deep exerciſes and experiences, for thy ſervice, why doſt thou make me thus miſerable!</hi> Sometimes I would caſt mine eye upon a Scripture, and my heart would even mel<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me: at other times I would deſire to pray to my God, as I had formerly done; but I found I knew him not, and I could not tell how to pray or in any wiſe to come neer him, as I had formerly done. In this condition I wandered up and down from mountain to hill, from one ſort to another, with a cry in my ſpirit, <hi>Can ye tell news of my Beloved? where doth he dwell? where doth he appear?</hi> but their voices were ſtill ſtrange to me, and I ſhould retire ſad and oppreſſed and bowed down in ſpirit from them.</p>
            <p>Now ſurely all ſerious, ſober, ſenſible people will be ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how I came ſatisfyingly to know the Lord at length: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I do yet certainly know him, and am yet truly ſatisfied?</p>
            <p>Yes indeed, I am ſatisfied at my very heart. Truly my heart is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him whom I longed after, in an everlaſting Covenant of pure Life and Peace.</p>
            <p>Well then, how came this about? will ſome ſay.</p>
            <p>Why thus, The Lord opened my ſpirit, the Lord gave me the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſenſible feeling of the pure Seed, which had been with me from the beginning; the Lord cauſed his holy Power to fall upon me, and gave me ſuch an inward demonſtration and feeling of the Seed of Life, that I cried out in my ſpirit, <hi>This is he, This is he; there is not another, there never was another. He was always near me, though I knew him not</hi> (not ſo ſenſibly, not ſo diſtinctly, as now he was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in me and to me by the Father) <hi>O that I might now be joyned to him, and he alone might live in me.</hi> And ſo in the willingneſs, which God had wrought in me (in this day of his Power to my Soul) I gave up to be inſtructed, exerciſed and led by him, in the waiting for and feeling of his holy Seed, that all might be wrought out of me which could not live with the Seed, but would be hindring the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and reigning of the feed in me, while it remained and had power. And ſo I have gone through a fore travel, and fight of afflictions and temptations, of many kinds; wherein the Lord hath been merciful to me, in helping me and preſerving the ſpark of Life in me, in the midſt of many things which have befallen me, whoſe nature tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quench and extinguiſh it.</p>
            <p>Now thus having met with the true Way, and walked with the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93409:14"/>
Lord therein, wherein daily-certainty, yea and full aſſurance of Faith and of underſtanding is at length obtained; I cannot be ſilent (true Love and pure Life ſtirring in me and moving me) but am neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to teſtifie of it to others: and this is it, To retire inwardly and wait to feel ſomewhat of the Lord, ſomewhat of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Power, diſcovering and drawing from that which is contrary to him, and into his holy Nature and Heavenly Image. And then, as that mind is joyned to this, ſomewhat is received; ſome true Life, ſome true Light, ſome true Diſcerning; which the Creature not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding (but abiding in the meaſure of) is ſafe: but it is eaſie erring from this, but hard abiding with it and not going before its leadings But he that feels Life and begins in Life, doth he not begin ſafely? and he that waits, and fears, and goes on no further then his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain goes before him, doth he not proceed ſafely? yea very ſafely, even till he cometh to be ſo ſetled and eſtabliſhed in the Vertue, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration and Power of Truth, as nothing can prevail to make him. Now, bleſſed be the Lord, there are many at this day, who can truly and faithfully witneſs, that they have been brought by the Lord to this ſtate. And thus have we learned of the Lord, to wit, not by the high ſtriving, aſpiring mind: but by lying low and being content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a little. If but a crum of Bread (yet if bread) if but a drop of Water (yet if water) we have been contented with it, and alſo thankfull to the Lord for it. Nor by thoughtfulneſs, and wiſe ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deep conſidering with our own wiſdom and reaſon have we obtained but in the ſtill meek and humble waiting, have we found that brought into the death, which is not to know the myſteries of Gods Kingdom, and that which is to live, made alive and increaſe in Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore he that would truly know the Lord, let him take heed of his own reaſon and underſtanding I tried this way very far: for I conſidered moſt ſeriouſly and uprightly, I prayed, I read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I earneſtly deſired to underſtand and find out, whether that which this people (called Quakers) teſtified of, was the only Way and Truth of God (as they ſeemed to me but to pretend:) but for all this, prejudices multiplied upon me and ſtrong reaſonings againſt them, which appeared to me as unanſwerable. But when the Lord revealed his Seed in me and touched my heart therewith, which adminiſtred true Life and Vertue to me, I preſently felt them there the children of the Moſt High, and ſo grown up in his Life, Power
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93409:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and holy Dominion (as the inward eye being opened by the Lord, ſees) as drew forth from me great reverence of heart and praiſes to the Lord, who had ſo appeared among men in theſe latter dayes. And as God draweth, in any reſpect, O give up in faithfulneſs to him. Deſpiſe the Shame, take up the Croſs: for indeed it is a Way which is very croſs to man, and which his wiſdom will exceedingly be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of; but that muſt be denied and turned from, &amp; the ſecret ſenſible drawings of Gods Spirit waited for and given up to. Mind people; He that will come into the new Covenant, muſt come into the obedience of it. The Light of Life, which God hath hid in the Heart, is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and from this Covenant God doth not give knowledg to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the vaſt aſpiring, comprehending wiſdom of man; but living Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to feed that which is quickned by him: which Knowledge is given in the obedience, and is very ſweet and precious to the taſte of him, that knows how to feed upon it. Yea truly, this is a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, pure, precious nature, and a little of it weighs down that great, vaſt knowledge in the comprehending part, which the mans ſpirit and nature ſo much prizeth and preſſeth after. And truly, Friends, I witneſs at this day, a great difference between the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of comprehending the knowledge of things as expreſſed in the Scriptures (this I ſed much on formerly) and taſting the hidden Life, the hidden Manna in the heart (which is my food now, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever be the Lord my God and Saviour.) O that others had a true, certain, and ſenſible taſte of the Life, Vertue and Goodneſs of the Lord, as it is revealed there: ſurely it could not but kindle the true hunger and enflame the true thirſt, which can never be ſatisfied but by the True Bread and by Water from the Living Fountain. This the Lord (in the tenderneſs of his Love and in the Riches of his Grace and Mercy) hath brought us to, and this we earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and uprightly deſire and endeavour that others may be brought to alſo, that they may rightly (in the true ſilence of Fleſh, and in the pure ſtilneſs of Spirit) wait for, and in the Lords due time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that, which anſwers the deſire of the awakened Mind and Soul, and ſatisfies it with the true precious Subſtance for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
