            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A discourse of the victory obtained by my Lorde the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> Lieuetenant general ouer the Kings forces in Aniou, Tourin, Maine, Poctu, Berry, Blaisois, Vendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois, <hi>Dunois,</hi> high and nether <hi>Liuosin,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi> against the rebellious Leagers enemies to his Maiestie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> being come into the countrie of <hi>Poictu,</hi> with the Armie which he condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for the Kings seruice, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of a great number of Noble men and Infanterie, to the end he might purge this Prouince of the oppression and tirannie, which the rebellious Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers (enemies to his Maiestie) exercised on his subiects: to bring those places which they vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vsed into his Maiesties obedience, and freely to deliuer this Prouince: Being aduertised the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>de la Guierche</hi> had besieged <hi>Belac</hi> with two Cannons, one Coluering, and a Bastard peece of ordinance: resolued with himselfe to march right &amp; directly thither, to raise the siege of the said Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or bid him battel, if he durst tarrie his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. But his excellencie hauing attained so far as <hi>Lucac,</hi>, a very great dayes iourney, was giuen to vnderstand, that the Vicount himselfe had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn his siege, and according to the naturall vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, wher-withall the Leaguers are familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:752:4"/>
had betaken himselfe with his Cauallery to <hi>Chauuigny,</hi> leauing his Cannon and Infanterie at <hi>Mont Morillon.</hi> Which when my Lord the prince perceiued, and that he had lost the occasion of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a faire checke to the presumptuous Vicount (who by an extreame mischance saued himselfe from the sight of my Lord of <hi>Trimouile,</hi> he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a little before, and not able to be succoured by the prince, could not fight with him, but was constraind to leaue him to slight) concluded now with himselfe to fasten on the said Cittie of <hi>Mont-Morillon,</hi> which at the same time hee caused to be summoned: but they within being not willing to make any answer, his excellencie commanded to giue them certaine vollies with the cannon, after which he caused them to be summoned againe: but they stil continued in their resolution to keepe aloofe.</p>
            <p>On the morrowe (being the sixt day of <hi>Iune</hi>) at fiue of the clocke in the morning, his excellencie changed the batterie, which endured very furious till the tenth houre before midday, and then my Lord the prince commaunded to giue the assault, which was doone very couragiously on all sides, and continued the space of three long houres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But in the end, our men hauing taken the high town, compelled the enemy to retire into the low towne (separated by the Riuer which passeth thorow the middest) where they hid themselues within a Chappell, and there preuailed so well, as they did greatly endamage our men on the side toward the high towne. But the Prince seeing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:752:5"/>
into the danger, sent fiue or six charges fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cannon against the gate of the Chappell: which being immediatly broken, the enemie was constrained quickly to forsake it. This gaue our men occasion to pursue them so brauely &amp; chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that God (who euermore assisteth with his diuine bountie, such as in good zeale fight for his name, and in so iust a quarrell, and for the seruice of their King) fauored them so gratiously, that they conquered both the high and low Townes of the said <hi>Mont-morillon,</hi> hauing put to the sword more then fiue hundred footemen, and sixtie Cuirasses, two maisters of the field, and all the Captaines slaine, wounded, or taken prisoners, whereof my Lord the Prince caused manie to bee hanged, by example of that which the Leagers did at <hi>S. Sauin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This braue exploit was doone, without losse of aniemore on our side, then one soldiour, being of his Excellencies Guarde who was slaine, and one Gentleman, named the <hi>Seigneur</hi> of <hi>S. Martin.</hi> The Marshal of our companie of armed men, was hurt with an Harquebuze in the arme, and verie few of our soldiours beside were wounded. Three other places afterward were yelded, to wit, the Townes of <hi>Chauuigny, S. Sauin, le Blanke en Berry,</hi> with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>Bourg-Archambault, Plaisance, Bel-Arbre, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailles, Belauue, Angles,</hi> and <hi>Bisse,</hi> beside manie other that are as willing. So that more faire and fortunate effect hath not beene seene, then of this happy and signall victorie, wherin it pleased God to blesse my Lorde the Prince, as he hath euermore done in all his enterprises, returning still to the great aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:752:5"/>
of the Kings affaires and seruice, whereby his poore people shall receiue great comfort. Thus first was the siedge of <hi>Belac</hi> raised by the Vicount of <hi>Guierche,</hi> and onelie vppon apprehension of the comming of my Lorde the Prince: the Vicount with his cauallery in rout, posted away in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test disorder that could bee: <hi>Mont-morillon</hi> taken by assault: all the Leaguers Infanterie shamefully scattered: foure Cannons besides other munition, and seauen Ensignes taken: so many places like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise yeelded at the same time into the Kings obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance: and infinite other, who attend nothing else, but that his Excellencie will receiue them to their first and naturall dutie, which is to obeye his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, as all good &amp; true Frenchmen are bound to doe: to God therefore be all honour and glorie.</p>
            <p>The order of the assault, neither the names of the Captaines and heads of the contrary parte, is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this discourse: because it is but a letter or remembrance of the deed done and lately effected at the Campe at <hi>Mont-morillon.</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:752:6"/>
Apostolike and Romaine in this realme, had giuen in charge to proceed against one, naming himselfe the Nuntio of the pretended Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the xiiii. who contrary to the dignitie, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the said realme, and libertie of the French Church; published certaine Bulles in forme of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition against the king, princes of his blood, and other princes, prelates, ecclesiasticall, officers of the Crowne, and all other his faithfull subiects and seruants. An other agreement was made by the Court the xxx. of Ianuarie. 1590, vpon the kings letters pattents, bearing date the fift of that moneth and yeere, against a pretended Legate come into Fraunce: whereby the said Courte made defences and inhibitious to all Curates, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars, and other ecclesiasticall officers, as also to all persons, of whatsoeuer qualitie or condition they were: not to receiue any charge, neither acte or expedition proceeding from the said pretended Legate. And if any were found so hardie, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise or proceed to the publication and reading thereof: it was enioined to all such as found them with the deed, on paine of being declared guiltie of high treason, to seaze vpon their bodies, and to present them in iustice before the Iudge royall. An other declaration was published in the Courte the xviii. day of August, 1591. with a coppie of the said pretended Bull, sent from the aboue named <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> who calleth himselfe Pope, dated the first of March. 1590. Signed <hi>Vestrius Barbianus,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneth <hi>A De Alexiis,</hi> and on the outside <hi>Registrata apud Marcellum Secretarium:</hi> wherevpon the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:752:6"/>
generall to the king, and <hi>Thomas</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate generall proceeded in manner following.</p>
            <p>Among things naturall there is such an order, that one dependeth vpon an other, and to auoide confusion, the inferiour are subiects to the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Euen so among men, the diuine prouidence hath giuen a naturall inclination, to one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and to others to obey, in whom lieth the greatnes, quiet, and welfare of realmes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, where the Kings, Princes, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates ordained to be aboue, are markes and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues more then other, which maketh them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred &amp; inuiolable, as representing liuely the image of the diuinitie. Such therefore are we bound to obey, as the wisest in all times past haue with one voice witnessed, that the bonds which we hold or retaine one to another, of what estate soeuer they be: are not of such vertue and efficacie, as those whereby we are restrained and bound to regarde and honor our Kings: to expose our liues, goods, and all meanes else for their safetie, and for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their commaundements. But beyond this naturall inclination, there is nothing so much exprest in all the holy Scripture, &amp; which hath bin more religiously obserued in the church of God: then vsing praiers publike and particulerly, for the prosperitie of Kings and Emperours, albeit they were Pagans and Infidels. Such likewise ought to be the vowes and oraisons of the Prelats and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, for the life of their Princes, and prosperitie in their affaires, following therein the auncient councels and determinations of the good fathers,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:752:7"/>
and holy personages: and so well hath this order beene preserued, as thereby hath the catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion flourished, and realmes and great Seigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries filled with patience and charitie, with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall and free inuocation on the name of God. And principally might this be noted in this realme of Fraunce, the true prop or stay of religion, and refuge to the seat Apostolike in all hir afflictions: till now that certaine ambitious and vnthankefull men, beeing little contented with the excessiue good turnes they haue receiued from our Kings, and aspiring to their height of estate and life, haue filled this Realme with Sedition, Fellonie, Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme, and crueltie. And as this vnhappie and insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable ambition, hath made them forget all right and pietie, so well knowe these Rebellious coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that in all times religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath had a most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie puissance ouer men, and that vnder the shadow thereof, the Pagans themselues haue helde their Monarchies, estates, and authorities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen so vnder this pretence they lay downe the foundations of their pernicious purposes, and making trafike of the gifts and blessings of the holy spirit, haue with counting money bought the selling toongs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ecclesiasticall persons, made drunke with like ambition, and the great promises of the authors of this rebellion, and by blasphemie and hipocrisie, haue filled the house of God with all execrable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations, making the flesh to sound where the word of God ought to be preached, by burnings, murders, massacres, spoiles, and subtil practises, and by fearefull outrages haue deceiued and drawne
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:752:7"/>
to them the worst sort of people, the weakest and fanaticall spirits.</p>
            <p>Then haue they called to the partage and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of this flourishing Realme the Spaniards, auncient enemies to true Catholikes, and this French estate, without whose ayde, neuerthelesse the predecessours of their King had neuer obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the crowne of Spaine, and all the people yet liue in Arrianisme and Sothike heresie. And to heape impietie and wickednesse together, they caused to be doone that cruell, abhominable and detestable Paracide on the late most Christian King, a religious and catholike Prince, whom God absolue.</p>
            <p>Nowe seeing that the diuine prouidence hath miraculouslye preserued and raised King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, raigning at this present, (who in so iust a cause is assisted by all the Princes of his bloud, the Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and the better parte of good Prelats, the principall officers of the Crowne, and the Nobilitie beside, who all with one voice, demaund and breath for nothing else but the expiation of a deed so hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, the reestablishing of this estate, as also the religion Catholike, Apostolike, and Romaine, and the restitution of those great Signeuries, which vniustly they haue detained in his realme of <hi>Nauar</hi> since the time of his maiesties great graundfather, and to reproue the title which they by vsurpation pretend to this Realme:) these rebels opposing themselues against him, haue made, &amp; do make, by their accustomed practises, to run vnder hande di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:752:8"/>
scandalous libels against the honour of the king, the princes of his bloud, &amp; his good &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful subiects: to ouerthrow all order, to induce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forsake the yoke of obedience, &amp; wander from the seruice &amp; fidelitie, which they owe to his highnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the disposition of all right, diuine and humane. Notwithstanding, they shal not be shaken by such sinister deceites, the grace of God assisting, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; valour of the king, their loialty in defence of this Realmes dignitie, &amp; the perfect freedom of the French Church: following the examples of their predecessors who in like &amp; lesse case, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselues, &amp; brauely held head against all the Popes enterprises: who somtimes forgetting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against their benefactors, would insult vpon the preheminences, rightes, and authoritie of the French church, and this Realme, which stands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from al excommunications, &amp; interdictions: as the Popes, namely, the hottest, and most audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hath beene inforced to confesse, by many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenticall Buls; yea and in case of commination, or declaration of such censures, by great and graue deliberation of all orders, haue beene with vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie withstood, as well by substraction of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as of money and goods.</p>
            <p>Which examples of so waightie consequence, might and ought with-hold the pretended Pope, by name called <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 14. from enterprising in this Realme a matter so bolde and monstrous, as to sende and publish certaine infamous libelles, scandalous, and full of impietie, sedition, and heresie, vnder a masque of Religion, in forme
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:752:8"/>
of Bulles, by his pretended Nuntio M. Marcilius Laudrianus, authorised (as he saith) vnder his two Seales. But the rather is this done, in respect that the Pope Sixtus Quintus his predecessor, was in the beginning of his pontificacie left beguiled by the perturbers of this Realme, and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by certaine Princes and especiall Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed touching the trueth and estate therof, that all the principall Catholiques and men of woorth and the goods of all qualities, were (to the great disgrace and daunger of the catholique Religion) pursued by the Leaguers and rebels: chased from their houses, pietie and religion trod vnder foot, the Churches by them contuminate and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, the Priests and religious ransomed and slaine, and a million of such innocent soules as haue been cruelly massacred, continuallye crying to God for vengeance due to such misdeedes, and the taking of his holy name so wickedly in vaine: he would now by his fatherlye prouision safelye foresee, this scandale to christianitie, by abridging the course of his life so shamefullye practised, and by the Spanish faction hindred from any conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable remedye, which yet turned to the shame and confusion of the Leaguers and rebelles. Hereupon the Attourney generall calling for the sayd writing or Bull in forme of an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or interdict from the saide Pope Gregorie the xiiii. of that name, against the King raigning at this present, and all the good Catholiques of his Realme: for the obseruation of Iustice, ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:752:9"/>
that the saide Marcilius Laudrianus the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Nuntio, should as a common enemye and kindler of hatred, be pursued, taken and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended aliue or dead, to be deliuered to iustice if it might be possible. And if he happened not to be apprehended, he should within three dayes be summoned to the Town of Pontellarche, which was neerest to the Cittie of Rome, wherin he had published the said scandalous Libell, there to be proceeded against, according to the Lawes of the Realme. In meane while, it was most expressely forbidden to all the Kings subiects, of what estate or qualitie soeuer they were, not to acknowledge or vse any obeysaunce to the said Pope, nor to pay him directlye or indirectlye any right, vnder the name of first fruits or such like pretence. And not to pursue or receiue of him or any other, of what qualitie or condition soeuer they were, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices adherent, any collations, confirmations, or prouisions for benefices in this Prouince and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matie of Normandie, graces, dispensions, or other expeditions, neither to answere, beare or cause to be borne, by waye of banque or otherwise, golde or Siluer to the Court of Rome, likewise not to obey or pay any thing to the Archbishops, Bishops or other Prelates his adherentes, who had put in execution any of the pretended diffamatorie Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles, so scandalous in forme of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interdiction: on paine of confiscation of bodie and goods, as infringers and perturbers of the publique peace. And that the ecclesiasticall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:752:9"/>
persons should be admonished to assemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the Kings will contained in his letters, that they being spoyled by the ambition of the League, setting before their eyes the feare of God, the quiet of their consciences, the honor and dignitie of their charges, the conseruation of the catholique Religion, the vertue and successe of such as haue aduaunced the same: should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer suffer the libertie of the French Church to be in any sorte diminished. But being assisted by their Kings and their soueraign iustice, to oppose themselues against all the Popes enterprises: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were knowen in their greatest promotions, they that were enemie to the Crown of Fraunce, euer vsed some meanes and practises against them. As it happened by Pope Martin the fifth, in the cause of the Emperour Sigismund, when he declared against the King and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet they reestablished this fair French church in her former right, in purging it from the vices which slipt thereinto, by the violent passions of these disturbers, and such as they framed of their minde: which to effect, they held Counselles and Smodes, true and only remedies against scismes and heresies: moreouer, by that Court was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene and preuented the scandales that might arise by the exposing and reading of such Libelles and pretended admonitions.</p>
            <p>This Court and Chambers assembled, haue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned and doo ordaine, that these Letters shalbe published, heard and registred: requiring the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:752:10"/>
Generall to the King, who alreadye hath receiued them, openlye to declare and manifest them, how that the saide Bull giuen at Rome the first of March 1591. is abusiue, scandalous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious, tending to sedition and trouble of all the Christian estate: contrary to the woord of God, holy decrees and liberties of the French Church, proceeding from wrong and not from right, stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with errour, impietie &amp; deceit. It is ordeined that it shalbe torne and burned before the Pallace gate, by the Executioner of publique iustice. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all persons, of what estate, quality or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition soeuer, to keep, read, publish or commune therof, on the paine of confiscation both of bodie and goods. Likewise that all Colleges, Couents, Chapters, Communalties, bodies of Citties, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, Vicars and such like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall not assist or fauor such communications, publications or readings, on paine to be attainted &amp; conuicted of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and depriuation of all priueledges, preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and exemptions. Commaunding likewise al persons, that shall haue knowledge of such as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly keep it, read or talke therof: quicklye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale them to the Attorney generall, or his substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in the place, who haue in charge to make se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret search, and thereof to certifie the Courte, on the paines aforesaid.</p>
            <p>The Court also declareth, the said Pope Gregorye the xiiij. of that name, an enemye to the King and the estate of Fraunce, as also the peace of christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: a troubler of the religion catholique, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:752:10"/>
and Romain: a pertaker with the League and coniuration, doone aswell against the King now raigning, as also the late King Henrye the third of most happy memory, traiterously and cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>elly murdered by the meanes and procurement of the saide rebelles. Forbidding all persons of this prouince and primatie of Normandie, to send to Rome for obtaining of Buls, writings, collations, graces, dispensations, or other expeditions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to carry directly or indirectlye thither, golde or siluer, on paine of being declared an enemye to the estate and depriuation of their goods and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions. Moreouer, that the said Marcilius Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianus calling himselfe Nuntio to the sayd Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorye, shalbe apprehended aliue or dead, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to iustice, and if he cannot be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he shalbe summoned three daies in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique places in Pontellarche, being neerest to the Cittie of Roane: the first eight dayes hence, and the two other by three dayes and three dayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. This dooth the Court declare for good and avayleable, and that this present agrement shalbe sent into all the Baylywickes of this iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to the end that none may pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therof.</p>
            <p>Pronounced in iudgement at Caen in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the third day of August, 1591.</p>
