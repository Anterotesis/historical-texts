            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

beauty is of more extent than
any outward varnish. Thou hast reason,
O my Soule, to preserve that, which
solely makes thee gracefull to thy
Spouse. Conceipt nothing seemely,

thee. Thou art not made for a slavish
fancy; thou hast one <hi>sole-love,</hi> to cleave

no <hi>Tennis-Ball,</hi> for strucke into anothers
hazard, it is lost. One Sunne cannot

and reflect upon thy selfe. Let thine

Great sinnes require great sighs; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous

poore Soule, where thou art placed;
with what innumerable dangers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed;
againe, how those which were
given thee for defence, are most ready
to betray thee to thine enemy. Againe,
reflect upon the benignity of thy good
God; who, if he had beene as ready to

been to commit sinne, had long since
drenched thee downe into that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse
pit of eternall bitternesse.
Death had beene thy due; and Hell
thy Portion. And canst thou now
look upon thy selfe without loathing;
or consider thy wofull estate without
trembling? Was ever any one more
bound to his Maker; and lesse thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
More watered with the sweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb facs="tcp:19927:18"/>
of his grace; and lesse fruitfull?
In no place couldst thou promise to

thee; as neither <hi>feare</hi> could oppresse
thee at home, nor <hi>fury</hi> surprize thee
abroad. And this was His worke, who
hath so constantly lov'd thee, as Hee
would never leave thee. For whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou wandred, he recalled thee:
when ignorant, he taught thee: when
thougsinned, hee corrected thee: when
sad, hee comforted thee: when despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
he supported thee: when falne, he
raised thee: when standing, hee held
thee: when walking, he guided thee:
when returning, hee received thee:
when sleeping, hee kept thee: when
crying, hee heard thee. What wilt
thou render then, O my Soule, to <hi>Him,</hi>
who hath done such wonderfull things
for thee? Wilt thou stay in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place

<pb facs="tcp:19927:18"/>
thy selfe to no employment in thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?
Is it enough for thee to reteine
the style of a Christian, &amp; presuming
upon that style, to corrupt the state of
a Christian? Wilt thou make thy
whole life an Holy-day; and by thy
prophane conversation cloze it up
with a fearefull day? Wilt thou not yet
after so many sweet invitations, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
thee? So many sharpe commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to deterre thee? Such gentle
touches on thy right hand and on thy

and returne to that overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fountaine of divine compassions?
It is fearefull, thou knowst, to fall into
the hands of the Lord. For who is hee
in all the world, so just, that hee may
with confidence presume to be saved,
if Gods mercy (the sole Salve of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
misery) be from him removed?
Yea, know, O my Soule, that thy <hi>justice</hi>
consists in Gods <hi>indulgence,</hi> who hath
an <hi>Eare</hi> open for thee, if thou cry unto

him; an <hi>arme</hi> to embrace thee, if thou
fly unto him; an <hi>heart</hi> to receive thee,
if thou returne unto him; an <hi>hand</hi> to
succour thee, if thou come to him; a
<hi>wing</hi> to cover thee, if thou cleave to
him. And wilt thou still feed on the
husks of vanity, and despise those deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
cates of eternity? Shall one poore
moment of vading pleasure deprive
thee of those joyes which last for ever?
By enjoying thy <hi>Spouse,</hi> thou enjoyest
all things: his presence will be <hi>meat</hi> to

day in all thy Pilgrimage hath beene
so propitious, as it was not encounter'd
with some discontents! Hath not a
merry Evening made an heavy Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
Nor a glad going out, a sad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning?
Didst heare no report of a

as nothing miscarried? And admit
all this; how long did this Calme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue?
Had this forward Spring no

The Saints and Servants of God doe
in this world more feare prosperity
than adversity: for that, the height of
prosperity is in danger more to presse

the Divell be dead, then are persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
dead: but so long as our Adversary
lives, canst thou thinke that he will not
suggest to thee tentations? The enemy
ceaseth not, dyeth not, but in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead. Short is the

                  <p>Ever reflect on Him that made you:
and make devotion, your constant Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

                  <p>For my part, I did ever rather affect not

                  <p>My desire is, that you would bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect

were it very necessary to bee cautious
<pb facs="tcp:19927:31"/>
of the Society to whom wee direct our
