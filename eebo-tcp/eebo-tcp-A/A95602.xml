         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>For all in Authority upon the Earth, and in Special, thoſe now in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> to Read and Ponder.</head>
            <p>AGes, Times, Generations have paſſed over the world ſince the firſt Publication of the Goſpel of Truth by the Holy Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt; and in theſe times the deſtroying Anti-chriſt foretold by the Spirit (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. and throughout the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) to come, hath had his Raign. And in this Dark and Miſerable Time, the Glory of the Goſpel, and the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Everliving God and Saviour, hath been loſt from amongſt men, and conſequently the Spirit of Love, Meekneſs, Long-Suffering, Equity and Amity: Whereby it hath come to paſs, that inſtead of a ſweet ſmell, all Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Offerings have been of an evil Savour in the Noſtrills of a pure God; and inſtead of a Bleſſing, the Wrath and Indignation of the Almightie hath come upon men, by reaſon of the diſhonour done unto his Name, in the ſame Cloudy, Diſmal, and Dark Day. But now is the Lord God, the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful holy One (according to the words alſo ſpoken, and written by the ſaid Servants of God from the beginning) ariſen and made manifeſt by the Spirit of his Mouth to Conſume, and by the Brightneſs of his Coming, to deſtroy the ſame deſtroying Anti-chriſt, that Miſterie of Iniquitie out of the Earth, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. That the Creation of God may be cleanſed from its Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reſtored into its Primitive Libertie and Freedom to Worſhip God in Puritie, Spirit and Truth, as in the beginning; that ſo the offerings of all people may be holy to the Lord, and the Unity of the Spirit be kept in the Bond of Truth and Peace, by all that call upon his Name.</p>
            <p>And though the Seed of God hath been as a Captive and Stranger in a ſtrange Land, bowed under by reaſon of the ſaid Enemie: Yet now is the Lord ariſen in his glorious Majeſty, to bring his Seed back again from the Land of its Captivity, into the promiſed Land, the Land of Righteouſneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, the true Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the glory of all Lands, in which is the Beautiful and well-Fenced City, the Holy and New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (with her holy Worſhippers therein) ſeen, and into which no unclean thing can enter.</p>
            <p>So Awake, and Ariſe all people into the holy Underſtanding, to know what God is doing this day in earth, that your Souls may live, and not die: For the Darkneſs is paſſing away, and the true Light now again ſhineth forth, even the true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. Yea, be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, and be Learned, and truly underſtanding all ye that Rule, Judge, and give Lawes in the Earth, and know what the Lord God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of you. Take not Counſel one at another, leaning to your own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to do your own wills, but all take Counſel at his good Spirit, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying how to do his Will, for they onely that do Gods Will, endure for ever. Many people and ſtrong Nations have been ſeen to have had great power for a time, and flouriſhing for a little moment, but they could not alwaies endure, becauſe they took not Counſel at God, neither were doers of his Will, but their own.</p>
            <p>So, be wiſe now therefore, all ye that are up in Power and Authority in the Earth this day, and be Warned, and with the Wiſdom which is from above be Armed, and let the fear of God, which is the beginning thereof, enter into your hearts, and take place there, and dwell there for ever; for that only is able to direct you into the way of the good Underſtanding in all things; for a good underſtanding have all they that do thereafter: Strive not to ſet up your ſelves in the Earth; ſeek not your own revenges, but ſeek how you may be ſerviceable to God, his dear Children, yea, and to all that walk Innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie towards one another in the Earth: Seek not the honour which comes from men of this world, but ſeek that Honour which comes from God onely; and ſuch as Honour him by doing his Will, them will God honour and none elſe. So, conſider well, for what end Power and Authoritie is in your hands; Is it not to try you? and is it not for the puniſhment of them that do Evil? to wit, ſuch as walk contrary to the manifeſt Truth, the Light of God, his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Law in all Conſciences, and for the praiſe of them that do well; to wit, ſuch as walk according to that Righteous Law of God, the manifeſt Truth, the Light in all Conſciences, which ſaith, <hi>As ye would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do ye unto them;</hi> And teacheth all that obey it, to do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo to fulfil the Royal Law of Love, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> And theſe being doers of the Law of the Juſt God, may of Right, expect the benefit and good of your Lawes; for, for this cauſe do we pay Tribute, even that we may live peaceably, in all Honeſty and Godlineſs under the Powers that are.</p>
            <p>You are not to hearken to men of corrupt minds, who are in the ſtrife about Words, and wranglings about Opinions, who ſerve not Chriſt the Prince of Peace, but their own Bellies, affecting worldly Titles of Honour, and would put you on to lay your Law upon all, and Perſecute all that will not bow to their Image, and feed their inſatiable avarice: For theſe are they that have ſtirred up Nations and People one againſt another, ever ſince the woful and miſerable Apoſtacy before mentioned; to the imbruing of whole Countries in Blood, under a pretence of Religion, (for their own evil ends) even to the deſtruction of all pure Religion, Amity, and Concord from amongſt men. But now is the Lord diſcovering the skirts of that great Whore, that neither Kings, Princes, nor Rulers, may love her any more, nor ever help her to carry on or accompliſh her evil deſigns in the earth; but that all people may know God alone to be their Teacher, as in the beginning when the morning Stars Sung for Joy, and all the Sons of God rejoyced together as Members of one Body, not envying or hurting one another, nor ſerving themſelves one of another; but all ſerving one another in love, and ſo fulfilling the Royal and everlaſting Law of Chriſt, to the Glory of God, and Father over all, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever.</p>
            <p>And in particular, let not the good Cauſe of Libertie for Tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (declared for by the King) now fall in <hi>England;</hi> but let the Parliament, &amp; all in Authority under Him, ſtudy &amp; ſtrive how to aſſiſt Him in it, and to Promote ſo good a Cauſe; for is it not fitting, O all people, that men of truly tender and pure Conſcience, and peaceably Principled and Living, ſhould have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to exerciſe their pure Conſciences in goodneſs towards God and men; and that the Law ſhould be laid onely upon the Lawleſs, who are not tender, but manifeſtly depraved in Conſcience, and hard, and careleſs of heart what they do, both reſpecting God and man? For, for the reſtraint and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch, was God's Righteous Law given, and not at all againſt the Righteous man. And let not the Biſhops ſay, That Libertie to tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, will be any diſparagement to Religion, or diſadvantage to the Nation; but let them judge according as the Truth is, that Libertie to tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is the onely thing, that will be good for all things: And as the King hath rightly declared an onely Way to ſtop the mouths (if not overcome the hearts) of all that (either onely ſeem, or indeed do) hate Him: For ſuch love will break the hearts of many. And what can ſtand before it? And O that the Powers now in <hi>England,</hi> might be an example this day, in ſo good a work to all the Earth, that Pope, Turk, and all others might be provoked thereby to do the like; that ſo the dear Seed of God, that groans in many Lands under the ſore Oppreſſion of forcing of Conſcience, might be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to run the waies of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs to the ends of time (to the glory of God) without fear.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that Proteſtant Religion engageth you to take Scripture for your Rule, doth it not ſay, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. That in matters of Gods Worſhip, every man ought to be fully perſwaded in his own mind of the goodneſs of what he doth, becauſe whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin? But now, if Liberty for the Tender and good Conſcience be not granted, but a compulſory power be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed towards all, for bringing them into the forme of ſome mens appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, then the poſſibility of every mans being fully perſwaded by Gods Spirit, in his own mind in what he doth, is taken away, and the Antient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that was amongſt the firſt Chriſtians, loſt; as in that ſaid 14. chapter of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> at large appeareth, where it's evident, that the glory of the true Church, ſtands not in the oneneſs of outward Form or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but in this, to wit, That every man do what he doth in the holy Fear, Faith, and power of Chriſts Spirit; for the Apoſtle well knew, that the Kingdom of God ſtood not in Meats, Drinks, Dayes, or the like; but in Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; and he that ſerves God in theſe things, ſaith he, <hi>is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</hi> And thus ought it alſo now to be amongſt ſuch as profeſs Chriſt throughout the Earth, until all be grown up to a perfect man in Chriſt. And O that yours, and all peoples eyes, were fully open, to ſee and underſtand the neceſſity of ſuch things as theſe, that ſo much concern both the Temporal and Eternal good of all.</p>
