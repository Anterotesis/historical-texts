            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THrise noble King the wonder of our daies,</l>
            <l>Giue leaue my Muse may speake thy vertues praise;</l>
            <l>A Souldiers hand made rough with Iron warre:</l>
            <l>Not smoothly can with Poets lines conferre.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Aonian</hi> bankes he doeth not vse to tread,</l>
            <l>But march where <hi>Mars</hi> a warlike step doth lead:</l>
            <l>If roughly then into his verse he breakes:</l>
            <l>A Cannons mouth, a boystrons languish speakes.</l>
            <l>Thence doth he learne: for muskets, pikes, and swords,</l>
            <l>Doe teach a Souldier: no great choice of words.</l>
            <l>Yet in the hope of his Dread Soueraignes loue:</l>
            <l>A Poets skill he thus desires to prooue.</l>
            <l>Geeat pearlesse Prince I need not to deriue,</l>
            <l>The line all race which doth our hopes reuiue.</l>
            <l>Thy kingdome England: knowes thy true dissent,</l>

            <l>That in our farre renounde Elizaes stead,</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:25585:4"/>With peace to reste vnder her princely winge.</l>

            <l>Leauing the Oracles of Gods eternall will,</l>

            <l>Seeking to race Christ Iesus kingdome downe,</l>

            <l>Then God in mercy to his children sent,</l>

            <l>

            <l>Brought traytors to the slead, the rope, the knife.</l>
            <l>In spight of deuill and hell and men made diuels,</l>
            <l>God kept her safe from all sinister euils.</l>

            <l>Her people so were hallowed for her sake.</l>
            <l>As that in warre there Pikes did passage make.</l>

            <l>By Englands handes there honor first did grow.</l>
            <l>And Spaine hath seene through cloudes of smoake and fire</l>

            <l>More could I speake, but this I breefly tell,</l>

            <l>Vnto them all my God thy loue expresse,</l>
            <l>Protect them safely, increase their happinesse.</l>
            <l>And in thy mercie let not Englands sinne,</l>
            <l>Blast the fresh flowers of our glorious spring:</l>
            <l>Vnite two lands that but by name stands parted,</l>
            <l>Their people blesse, and make them single harted.</l>
            <l>England and Scotland, let all their Lords agree,</l>
            <l>And serue their King in loues best puritie:</l>
            <l>Then Irelands rebels full soone there is no doubt,</l>
            <l>From doing harme will all be raced out.</l>
            <l>These Kingdomes God in peace together knit,</l>
            <l>That on his throne King <hi>Iames</hi> may safely sit.</l>
            <l>

So in their hopes those minds shall quickly quaile,</l>
            <l>That thought ere this the Pope should most preuaile:</l>
            <l>The selfe same law which Christ himselfe did teach</l>
            <l>The selfe same law, shall Englands pastors preach:</l>
            <l>And all Gods children shall reioyce with ioy,</l>
            <l>To see their King, the beast of Rome destroy:</l>
            <l>Thus England now prouide thy triumphs games,</l>
            <l>In honour of thy mightie prince King <hi>Iames.</hi>
