         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is my ambition to let the world
know upon what ſcore it is that I do
eſpecially honour men. It is not Sir!
as they are high born Heirs of the
great Potentates, for which moſt
honour them (and upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I alſo ſhall not deny them their
due) but as they excell in honeſty,
and are friends to Art. That poor Philoſophers ſhould
take no delight in riches, and rich men ſhould take great
delight in Philoſophy, is to me an argument, that there
<pb facs="tcp:54827:3"/>
is more delight, honor, and ſatisfaction in the one then in
the enjoyment of the other. I once read of a Noble mans
Porter that let in all that were rich apparelled, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a poor Philoſopher: but I ſhould, if I had been in
his place, have rather let in the Philoſopher without the
gay cloathes, then the gay cloathes without the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
As long as I have ſenſe or reaſon, I ſhall improve
them to the honour of Art, eſpecially that of Alchymie.
In the perfection thereof there are riches, honour, health,
and length of dayes: by it <hi>Arteſius</hi> lived 1000. years,
<hi>Flammell</hi> built 28 Hoſpitalls with large revenues to them,
beſides Churches and Chappels; for it; both they and
divers more were accounted Philoſophers, and wiſe men,
which ſounds more honourable in my eares then all the
ratling and empty titles of honour whatſoever beſides.
In the perfection of this Art, I mean the accompliſhing
of the Elixir, is the Sulphur of Philoſophers ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which gratifies the releaſers thereof with three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<hi>viz.</hi> Vegetable, Animall, and Minerall, and what
cannot they do, and how honourable are they, that have
the command of theſe? They may command Lead into
Gold, dying plants into fruitfulneſſe, the ſick into
health, old age into youth, darkneſſe into light, and what
not? A month would fail to give you an account of their
power and dominations. Now for the effecting of this I
ſhall beſides what I have adviſed in the Epiſtle to the
Reader, ſay only this; Court the Mother, and you winne
the Daughter, prevail with Nature, and the fair <hi>Diana</hi> of
the Philoſophers is at your ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Now if you cannot prevaile with Nature for the faireſt
of her daughters, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mercury of Philoſophers, yet
ſhe hath other Daughters of wonderfull beauty alſo, as
<pb facs="tcp:54827:3"/>
are the Eſſences and Magiſteries of Philoſophers, which
alſo are endowed with riches, honour, and health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and any
of theſe you may more eaſily prevail with their mother
Nature for. This Art of Alchymie is that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is more noble then all the other ſix Arts, and
Sciences, and if it did once throughly ſhine forth out
of the clouds whereby it is eclipſed, would darken all the
reſt, (as the Sun doth the other ſix planets) or at leaſt
ſwallow up their light. This is that true naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
which moſt accurately anatomizeth Nature and
naturall things, and ocularly demonſtrates the principles
and operations of them. That empty naturall philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
which is read in the Univerſities, is ſcarce the
meaneſt hand-maid to this Queen of Arts. It is pity
there is ſuch great encouragement for many empty and
unprofitable Arts, and none for this, and ſuch like
ingenuities, which if promoted would render an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
far more flouriſhing then the former. I once read
or heard of a famous Univerſity beyond Sea, that was
faln into decay, through what cauſe I know not: but
there was a generall councell held by the learned, how to
reſtore it to its primitive glory. The <hi>Medium</hi> at laſt agreed
upon was the promoting of Alchymie, and encouraging
the Artiſts themſelves. But I never expect to ſee ſuch rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
actings in this Nation, till ſhadows vaniſh, ſubſtances
flouriſh, and truth prevail: which time I hope is at hand
and deſired by all true Artiſts, and to my knowledge,
eſpecially by your ſelf, upon which account I truly
honour you. Now to your ſelfe therefore I crave
leave to adumbrate ſomething of that Art which I
know you will be willing for the publick good to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.
I dedicate this Treatiſe to you, not that it is
<pb facs="tcp:54827:4"/>
worthy your acceptance, but that it may receive worth

not to be miſtaken as if I did deny <hi>Galen</hi> his due, or <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
what is his right, for indeed they wrote excellently in
many things, and deſerved well thereby; That which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
allow of in them is their ſtrict obſervation of the quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of humours (which in the ſchoole of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and
writings of <hi>Helmont,</hi> where the Anatomy of humours hath
been moſt rationally and fully diſcuſſed, hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
confuted) and their confining themſelves to ſuch crude
medicines, which are more fit to be put into Spagyricall
veſsels for a further digeſtion, then into mens bodies to be
fermented therein. Certainly if men were leſſe ignorant they
would preferre cordiall eſſences before crude juices, balſami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Elixirs before flegmatick waters, the Mercury of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
before common quickſilver. But many men have ſo
little inſight in this Art, that they ſcarce believe any thing
in it beyond the Diſtilling of Waters and Oils, and extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Salts; nay many that pretend to Philoſophy, and would
<pb facs="tcp:54827:5"/>
be accounted Philoſophers, are ſo unbeleeving, that, as ſaith
<hi>Sandivogius,</hi> although he would have intimated the true
Art to them word by word, yet they would by no meanes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
or beleeve that there was any water in the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
ſea. And as he in this caſe, ſo I in another know divers
that will not beleeve that common quickſilver can of it ſelfe
be turned wholy into a tranſparent water, or that glaſſe can
be reduced into ſand and ſalt of which it was made, ſaying
that <hi>fuſio vitrificatoria eſt ultima fuſio;</hi> or that an hearb
may be made to grow in two hours, and the Idea of a plant
to appear in a glaſſe, as if the very plant it ſelfe were there,
and this from the eſſence thereof, and ſuch like preparations
as theſe: the two former whereof may be done in half an
hour, but the latter requires a longer time, but yet posſible.
And for the poſſibility of the Elixir, you ſhall aſſoon perſwade
them to beleeve they know nothing (which is very hard, nay
an impoſſible thing to do) then to beleeve the poſſibility
thereof. If there be any ſuch thing (ſay they) why are not the
poſſeſsors thereof infinitely rich, famous, do many miracles
and cures, and live long? Theſe Objections, eſpecially ſome
of them, ſcarce deſerve an anſwer; yet I ſhall to ſhew the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of them make ſome reply thereunto. Did not <hi>Arteſius</hi>
by the help of this medicine live 1000. yeares? Did not
<hi>Flammell</hi> build fourteen Hoſpitals in <hi>Paris</hi> beſides as many

I have, ſaith he, incurred more dangers, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
by diſcovering my ſelf to have this ſecret, then ever
I had profit by it, and whenſoever I would diſcover my ſelfe
to the great Ones, it alwayes redounded to my prejudice, and
danger. Can a man that carrieth alwaies about him 10000.

<pb facs="tcp:54827:6"/>
downe, ſafe, and not be robbed? Have not many rich money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers
been tortured into a confeſſion where their money
was concealed? Did you never heare of a vapouring fellow
in <hi>London,</hi> that portending to the knowledge of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
was on a ſuddaine caught aſide by money-thirſters, and
by them tormented with tortures little leſse then thoſe of
hell, being forced thereby (if he had knowne it) into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of it? To ſay nothing of being in danger of being
ſubjected, and enſlaved to the pleaſure of Princes, and of
becoming inſtrumentall to their luxury, and tyranny, as alſo
being deprived of all liberty, as once <hi>Raimundus Lullius.</hi>
The truth is, the greateſt matter that Philoſophers aime at,
is the enjoyment of themſelves, for which cauſe they have
ſequestred themſelves from the world, and become <hi>Hermites:</hi>
Well therefore and like a Philoſopher ſpake <hi>Sandivogius,</hi>
when he ſaid, Beleeve me, if I were not a man of that ſtate
and condition that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m of, nothing would be more pleaſant
to me then a ſolatary life, or with <hi>Diogenes</hi> to live hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a tub; for I ſee all things in this world to be but vanity,
and that deceit, and covetouſneſſe prevail much, that all
things are vendible, and that vice doth excel vertue. I ſee
the better things of the life to come before mine eyes, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in theſe: Now I do not wonder, as before I did, why
Philoſophers when they have attained this medicine, have
not cared to have their daies ſhortned, (although by the
vertue of their medicine they could have prolonged them)
for every Philoſopher hath the life to come ſo cleerly ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes, as thy face is ſeen in a glaſſe. Thus much by
way of reply to the frivolous objections of thoſe that beleeve
not the verity of this Art, and not onely ſo, but will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it. If you ſhould diſcover to them the proceſſe of the
Philoſophers ſtone, they would laugh at your ſimplicity, and
I will warrant you never make uſe of it. Nay if you ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:54827:6"/>
make projection before them, they would think that even in
that there were a fallacy, ſo unbeleeving are they: ſo I finde
them, and ſo I leave them, and ſhall for ever finde them the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of men by whom this Art hath been
much ſcandalized, and they indeed have brought a great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
upon it by carrying about, and vending their whites,
and reds, their ſophiſticated oils, and ſalts, their dangerous
and ill prepared <hi>Turbithes,</hi> and <hi>Aurum vitae</hi>'s. And indeed
it were worth while, and I might do good ſervice for the
Nation, to diſcover their cheats, as their ſophiſticating of
Chymicall oils with ſpirit of Turpentine, and ſalts with ſalt
extracted out of any wood-aſhes and ſuch like, but here is not
place for ſo large a diſcourſe as this would amount to. I ſhall
only at this time relate to you how <hi>Penotus</hi> was cheated with
a ſophiſticated Oil of gold: for, ſaith he, I gave 24. duckets for
the proceſſe of an <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> which was much cryed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p
and magnified at <hi>Prague,</hi> but at laſt it proved to be nothing
but a mixture of oil of Camphire, Cloves, Fennel-ſeed, and
of Vitriall tinged with the leaves of Gold. I know I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
the diſpleaſure of ſome, but they are ſophisticating,
cheating mounteba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cks, who indeed deſerve to be bound to the
peace, becauſe many men, I dare ſwear, through their means
go in danger of their lives. Better it is that their kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſhould be detected, then a noble Art through their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
be clouded, and aſperſed.</p>
                  <p>Now we muſt conſider that there are degrees in this Art;
for there is the accompliſhing of the Elixir it ſelf, and there
is the diſcovering of many excellent eſſences, magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and ſpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which abundantly recompenſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers
thereof with profit, health, and delight. Is not
<hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Ludus</hi> that diſſolves the ſtone, and all tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous
matter in the body into a liquor, worth finding out?
<pb facs="tcp:54827:7"/>
Is not his <hi>Tinea Scatura</hi> a moſt noble medicine, that
extinguiſheth all preternaturall heat in the body in a
moment: Is not his <hi>Altaheſt</hi> a famous diſſolvent, that
can in an inſtant diſſolve all things into their first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and withall is a ſpecificum againſt all diſtempers of
the liver? who would not take paines to make the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence
of honey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Philoſophicall ſpirit of Wine,
which are cordiall and balſamicall even to admiration?
A whole day would fail to reckon up all the excellent,
admirable rar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ties that by this ſpagyricall Art might be
brought to light, in the ſearching out of which, why may
not the Elixir it ſelfe at laſt be attained unto? Is it not
poſſible for them that paſſe through many Philoſophicall
preparations to unfold at laſt the riddles, and Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks
of the Philoſophers? or were they all meer Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmes?
Is there no <hi>fundamentum in re</hi> for this ſecret?
Is there no ſperme in gold? Is it not poſſible to exalt it
for multiplication? Is there no univerſall ſpirit in the
world? Is it not poſſible to finde that collected in one
thing, which is diſperſed in all things? What is that
which makes gold incorruptible? What induced the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
to examine gold for the matter of their medicine?
Was not all gold once living? Is there none of this living
gold, the matter of Philoſophres, to be had? Did <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divogius</hi>
the laſt of knowne Philoſophers ſpend it all?
Surely there is matter enough for Philoſophers, and alſo
ſome Philoſophers at this day for the matter, although
they are unknowne to us. There are, ſaith <hi>Sandivogius,</hi>
without doubt many men of a good conſcience both
of high and low degree (I ſpeak knowingly) that have
this medicine, and keep it ſecretly. If ſo, let no man be
diſcouraged in the proſecution of it, eſpecially if he take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him the five Keyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which <hi>Nollius</hi> ſets down,
<pb facs="tcp:54827:7"/>
which indeed all Philoſophers with one conſent enjoyne the
uſe and obſervation of.</p>
                  <p>1. Seeing it is a thing divine, and celeſtiall, it muſt be
ſought for from above, and that not without a full reſolution
for a pious, and charitable improvement of it.</p>
                  <p>2. Before thou betakeſt thy ſelfe to the worke, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to thy ſelfe what thou ſeekeſt for, and enter not upon
the practicke till thou art firſt well verſed in the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
for it is much better to learn with thy braines, and
imagination, then with thy hands, and coſts, and eſpecially
ſtudy nature well; and ſee if thy propoſals be agreeable to the
poſſibility thereof.</p>
                  <p>3. Diligently read the ſayings of true Philoſophers,
read them over again and again, and meditate on them,
and take heed thou doeſt not read the writings of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſters
in ſtead of the Books of the true Philoſophers.
Compare their ſayings with the poſſibility of Nature, and
obſcure places with cleare, and where Philoſophers ſay
they have erred doe thou beware, and conſider well
the generall axioms of Philoſophers, and read ſo long till
thou ſeeſt a ſweet Harmony, and conſent in the ſayings of
them.</p>
                  <p>4. Imagine not high things, but in all things imitate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> in matter; in removing what is Heterogeneous; in
weight; in colour; in fire; in working; in ſlowneſſe of working;
and let not thy operations be vulgar, neither thy veſſels;
work diligently and conſtantly.</p>
                  <p>5. If it be poſſible, acquaint thy ſelf throughly with ſome
true Philoſophers. Although they will not directly diſcover
themſelves that they have this ſecret, yet by one circumſtance
or another it may be concluded how neer they are to it. Would
not any rationall man that had been converſant with
<hi>Bacon,</hi> and ſeeing him doe ſuch miraculous things,
<pb facs="tcp:54827:8"/>
or with <hi>Sandivogius</hi> who did intimate the Art to ſome word
by word, have concluded that they were not ignorant of it?
There have been Philoſophers, and perhaps ſtill are, that
although they will not diſcover how it is made, yet may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
you, to the ſaving of a great deal of coſt, pains, and
time, how it is not made: and to be convinced of an
errour is a great ſtep to the truth. If <hi>Ripley</hi> had been
by any Tutor convinced of thoſe many errours before
he had bought his knowledge at ſo deare a rate, he
had long before, with leſſe charges attained to his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
deſire.</p>
                  <p>And as a friendly Tutor in this, ſo in all ſpagyricall
preparations whatſoever, is of all things moſt neceſſary.
A faithfull well experienced maſter will teach thee more
in the myſteries of Alchymy in a quarter of a year, then by
thine owne ſtudies and chargeable operations thou ſhalt learn
in ſeven yeares. In the firſt place therefore, and above all
things apply thy ſelfe to an expert, faithfull, and comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
Artiſt, and account it a great gain, if thou canſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
his favour, though with a good gratuity, to lead
thee through the manuall practice of the chiefeſt, and
choiſeſt preparations. I ſaid apply thy ſelf to an Artiſt,
for there is ſcarce any proceſſe in all Chymiſtry ſo eaſie that
he that never ſaw it done will be to ſeek, and commit ſome
errours in the doing of it. I ſaid expert, that he may be able
to inſtruct thee aright; faithful, that as he is able, ſo may
faithfully performe what he promiſeth; and communicative,
that he may be free in diſcovering himſelfe and his Art to
thee. The truth is, moſt Artiſts reſerve that to themſelves,
which they know, either out of a deſire to be admired the
more for their undiſcovered ſecrets, or out of envie to others
knowledge. But how far this humour is approvable in them,
I leave it to others to judge; and as for my part I have here
<pb facs="tcp:54827:8"/>
communicated upon the account of a bare acceptance onely
what I have with many years paines, much reading, and
great coſts known. There is but one thing which I deſire to
be ſilent in as touching the proceſſe thereof; as for the
thing it ſelfe to be prepared, what it is I have elſewhere in
this Treatiſe expreſsed; and the preparing of that is indeed
a thing worthy of any ones knowing, and which perhaps
hereafter I may make known to ſome. I am of the ſame
mind with <hi>Sandivogius,</hi> that that fourth Monarchy which is
Northerne, is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ning, in which (as the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
did divine) all Arts and Sciences ſhall flouriſh, and
greater and more things ſhall be diſcovered then in the three
former. Theſe Monarchies the Philoſophers reckon not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the more potent, but according to the corners of
the world, whereof the Northerne is the laſt, and indeed is
no other then the golden age, in which all tyranny, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
envie, and covetouſneſſe ſhall ceaſe, when there ſhall be
one prince and one people abounding with love and
mercy, and flouriſhing in peace: which day I earneſtly
expect.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time if what <hi>I</hi> know may adde to thy experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
thou haſt it freely. And if <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſee that this Treatiſe
of Diſtillation paſſe with acceptance umongſt the Artiſts of
this Nation, <hi>I</hi> ſhall hereafter gratifie them for their good
will with two other parts of Chymiſtrie, <hi>viz.</hi> Sublimaton,
and Calcination; and <hi>I</hi> hope this will be an occaſion to ſet the
more expert Artiſts on work, for the communicating their
experiences to the world. One thing (courteous Reader) let
me deſire thee to take notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> whereas every proceſſe
is ſet down plain, yet all of them muſt be proceeded
in <hi>ſecundum Artem Alchymiſtae,</hi> (which Art indeed
is obtained by experience) and therefore many that work
according to the bare proceſſe effect not what they intend;
<pb facs="tcp:54827:9"/>
and the reaſon is, becauſe there was ſome art of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt
wanting. To conclude, if thou knoweſt more or
better things then theſe, be candid, and impart them;
(conſidering that I wrote theſe for them that know
them not) if not, accept of the endeavours of thy

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not ſtand here to ſhew whence the
Art of Diſtillation had its originall, as
being a thing not eaſily to be proved,
and if known, yet little conducing to
our enſuing diſcourſe. But let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what Diſtillation is, of which
there are three principall and chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
or deſcriptions.</p>
                  <p>1 Diſtillation is a certain Art of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
the Liquor, or the humid part of things by vertue of
heat (as the matter ſhall require) being firſt reſolved into a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
and then condenſed again by cold.</p>
                  <p>2. Diſtillation is the art of extracting the ſpirituall and
eſſential humidity from the flegmatick, or of the flegmatick, from
the ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>3 Diſtillation is the changing of groſſe thick bodies into a
thinner and liquid ſubſtance, or ſeparation of the pure liquor
from the impure feces.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall treat of Diſtillation according to all theſe three accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and no otherwiſe; hence I ſhall exclude Sublimation, and
Calcination, which are of dry ſubſtances, unleſſe I ſhall by the
way make uſe of either in relation to the perfecting of any kind
of Diſtillation.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe all, or moſt of theſe diſtillations are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by heat, it will be neceſſary to underſtand how many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54827:10"/>
degrees of heat there are, and which are convenient for every
operation, and they are principally four.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is only a warmth, as is that of horſe dung, of the
Sun, of warm water, and the vapour thereof, which kind of
heat ſerves for putrefaction, and digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>2 The ſecond is of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ething water, and the vapour thereof,
as alſo of aſhes, and ſerves to diſtill thoſe things which
are ſubtile, and moiſt, as alſo for the rectifying of any ſpirit
or oil.</p>
                  <p>3 The third is of ſand and filings of iron, which ſerves to
diſtill things ſubtle, and dry, or groſſe and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>4 The fourth is of a naked fire, cloſe, open, or with a blaſt,
which ſerves to diſtill Metalls and Minerals, and hard gummie
things, as Amber, &amp;c. I do not ſay ſerves only to diſtill theſe,
for many of the former diſtillations are performed by this heat,
as the diſtilling of Spirits and Oils, &amp;c. in a copper ſtill over a
naked fire; but theſe may be diſtilled by the two former degrees
of heat; but Mineralls and ſuch like cannot but by this fourth
degree alone.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Of the matter and form of Furnaces.</head>
                     <p>THe matter of Furnaces is various, for they may be made
either of brick and clay, or clay alone with whites of
Egges, hair, and filings of Iron, (and of theſe if the clay be fat
are made the beſt, and moſt durable Furnaces) or of Iron, or
Copper, caſt or forged. The forms alſo of Furnaces are various.</p>
                     <p>The fitteſt form for Diſtillation is round; for ſo the heat of
the fire being carryed up equally diffuſeth it ſelf every way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which happens not in a Furnace of another figure, as four ſquare

the fire. Their magnitude muſt be ſuch as ſhal be fit for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the veſſel; their thickneſſe ſo great as neceſſity ſhall ſeem
to require; only thus much obſerve, that if they be made of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
iron or copper, they muſt be coated within ſide, eſpecially if
you intend to uſe them for a ſtrong fire. They muſt be madewith
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54827:10"/>
two bottomes, diſtinguiſht as it were, into two forges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one
below which may receive the aſhes, the other above to contain
the fire. The bottom of this upper muſt either be an iron grate, or
elſe an Iron plate perforated with many holes, that ſo the aſhes
may the more eaſily fall down into the bottome, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as the Furnace for Reverberation, and the Regiſter Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.
In the firſt and loweſt the aſhes are received, in the ſecond
the fire is put, and in the third of the Furnace for Reverberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the matter which is to be reverberated. This third ought to
have a ſemi-circular cover, that ſo the heat may be reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the contained matter. The bottome of the third and upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
partition of the Regiſter Furnace muſt be either a plate of
iron, or a ſmooth ſtone perforated with holes, having ſtopples
of ſtone fitted thereunto, which you may take out or put in, as
you would have the heat increaſed or decreaſed. In the top or
upper part of all theſe Furnaces where it ſhal ſeem moſt fit, there
muſt be two or three holes made, that by them the ſmoak may
more freely paſs out, and the air let in to make the fire burn the
ſtronger if need require, or elſe which are to be ſhut with ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
made fit to them. The mouths of the fore-mentioned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
muſt have ſhutters, juſt like an Ovens mouth, with which

that remain in the bottome of the Still, and the water that is

                     <p>You muſt ſet them in the Sun in glaſſes well ſtopped, and half
filled, being ſet in ſand to the third part of their eight that the
water waxing hot by the heat of the Sun may ſeparate it ſelf
from the flegm mixed therewith, which will be performed in
in twelve or fifteen days. There is another better way to doe
this, which is to diſtill them again in <hi>Balneo</hi> with a gentle fire,
or if you wil put them into a retort furniſhed with its receiver,
and ſet them upon cryſtal or iron bowls, or in an iron mortar
directly oppoſite to the beams of the Sun, as you may learn by
theſe enſuing ſigns.</p>

                     <head>How to rectifie all ſtinking, thick black Oils that are made by a Retort,
and to take away their ſtink.</head>
                     <p>Take oyl of Amber, or any ſuch ſtinking oil, put it into a
glaſs Retort, the fourth part only being full, pour on it drop by
drop the ſpirit of Salt, (or any other acid ſpirit) and they will
boil together; and when ſo much of the ſpirit is poured on that
it boileth no more, then ceaſe and diſtill it. Firſt cometh over
a ſtinking water, then a clear white well ſmelling oyl, and after
that a yellow oyl which is indifferent good: but the ſpirit of
Salt hath loſt its ſharpneſs: the volatile ſalt of the oyl remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
coagulated with the ſpirit of Salt, and is black, and taſteth
like ſalt Armoniack, and hath no ſmell being ſublimed from it.
Now the reaſon of all this is, becauſe the volatile ſalt of the oyl
which is the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe of the ſtink thereof, is fixed by the acid ſpirit
of the Salt: for acid Spirits, and volatile Salts, are contrary the
one to the other; and ſpirit of Urine or any volatile Salt, will
precipitate any metall as well as ſalt of Tartar.</p>
                     <p>Theſe oyls will remain clear, and have far more vertue, then
the ordinary ſort of oyls have.</p>
                     <p>As for common ordinary diſtilled oyls, they need not, if they
be well ſeparated from the water with which they were diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
any rectifying at all: and if you goe about to rectifie them,
you will loſe good part of them, and make that which remains
not at all the better. But if there be any better then another for
rectifying of them it is by digeſtion, by which means there will
be a ſeparation of what is flegmatick which you may ſeparate
afterwards, and by this means you ſhall loſe none of the oyls.</p>

four or five thinner are layed, which may be ſtirred when the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace

                     <p>Thus far the firſt of the figures is explained, by which you
may ſee how ſublimation and diſtillation is made at one time,
<hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe things which will yeeld both flowers, and ſpirits,
(the flowers ſticking in the three upper Recipients, and the
ſpirits dropping down into the lower.)</p>
                     <p>Now follows the explanation of the ſecond figure, which is
the ſame with the former in reſpect of the Furnace it ſelf, but
differing in reſpect of the Recipients, which ſerve for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the ſpirits and oyls of ſuch things as yeeld no flowers.
Therefore I ſhall begin with the explanation of the Receivers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54827:51"/>
                        <hi>G,</hi> The firſt crooked pipe as it is fitted to the pipe that comes out of the
Furnace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>H,</hi> The-Recipient with its cover, in which is one hole for one crooked
pipe to goe through, as you may ſee in the firſt <hi>H,</hi> and two holes for
two pipes to goe through, as you may ſee in the ſecond <hi>H,</hi> and
in <hi>H H.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note that theſe pipes may either be faſtned to the cover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of one piece, or they muſt be wel luted, that no vapours
may paſs through. Now you muſt conceive that in the lower
Receivers the vapour that goeth out of the firſt pipe goeth
firſt into the Receiver, then out of that into the next pipe, and
ſo forward till it cometh into the laſt Receiver, by which means
it is much cooled (for indeed ſuch vapours that come out of
the Furnace, eſpecially when ſome materials are diſtilled, if
there were not ſome ſuch art to cool them, would break all
Recipients.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I,</hi> A tub of water, wherein the Recipient ſtands, to cool the vapours
and condenſe them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>K,</hi> The firſt crooked pipe as it goeth into the Recipient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>L,</hi> The ſecond crooked pipe, whereof one end goeth into one Receiver,
and another end into another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M,</hi> The laſt crooked pipe to which you muſt annex a Receiver.</p>
                     <p>Now the manner of diſtilling is thus; Let the Furnace be
full of coals wel kindled, then caſt on your matter, and ſtop
your Furnace cloſe: This Furnace needs no Retort, or other
veſſels to ſet into it, neither can you doe any hurt by too much
or too little fire, and you may finiſh your operation when you
pleaſe, and in one hour try divers experiments. It ſaveth very
much time and coſt, and in one hour will doe as much as can be
done in another Furnace in 24. In one hour you may make a
pound of ſpirit of Salt with four or five pound of coals, and as
much flower of Antimony in a like ſpace of time, and with as
few coals.</p>
                     <p>If your materials be vegetables, or horn, or bones, cut them
ſmall; If hard Minerals, let them be powdered very ſmall; if
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54827:52"/>
ſalts, let them firſt be diſſolved in water, which water muſt be
imbibed with red hot coals until all the liquor be imbibed: then
caſt in thoſe coals into the Furnace.</p>
                     <p>If you would by this means procure the ſpirit of hard Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
as of Antimony, &amp;c. you muſt take them as they come from
the Mine before they have paſſed the fire.</p>
                     <p>By this Furnace you may make the ſpirits of ſuch things
which will not yeeld them in any other way.</p>
                     <p>Note that ſuch oyls and ſpirits as are drawne by this
Furnace muſt be rectified in ſpirit of Salt, as I have above
ſhewed.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ater ſeems to be a body ſo very Homogeneall,
as if neither Nature or Art could diſcover any
Heterogeneity in the parts thereof: thus indeed
it ſeems to the eye of the vulgar, but to that of
a Philoſopher far otherwiſe, as I ſhall endeavor
to make credible by preſenting to your conſideration a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
proceſs of the diſcovering the diſſimilary parts thereof;
whereof the one is naturall only, and the other artificiall; But
before I ſpeak of either, it muſt be premiſed, that in the element
of Water there is great plenty of the ſpirit of the World,
which is more predominant in it then in any other element,
for the uſe and benefit of univerſall nature; and that this
ſpirit hath three diſtinct ſubſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> Salt, Sulphur, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54827:62"/>
Mercury. Now by ſalt we muſt underſtand a ſubſtance very
dry, vitall, and radicall, having in it the beginning of corpori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſication,
as I may ſo call it: by Sulphur, a ſubſtance ful of light
and vital heat, or vivifying fire, containing in it ſelf the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of motion: by Mercury, a ſubſtance abounding
with radical moiſture, with which the Sulphur of life, or
vital fire, is cheriſhed and preſerved. Now theſe ſubſtances
which are in the Spirit of the World make all Fountaines,
and Waters, but with ſome difference, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
of either. This ſeveral predominancy therefore
is the ground of the variety of productions; I ſay, of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
becauſe all things are produced out of Water: for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is both the Sperme, and the Menſtruum of the World;
the former, becauſe it includes the ſeed of every thing; the
latter, becauſe the Sperme of Nature is put refied in it, that
the ſeed included in it ſhould be actuated, and take upon it
the divers Formes of things; and becauſe by it the ſeed it ſelf,
and all things produced of ſeed grow, and are encreaſed: Now
this being premiſed, I ſhall ſhew you what the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
is, which I ſhal make plain by inſtancing in three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
productions, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ſpawn of Frogs, of Stones, and
of Vegetables.</p>
                     <p>The Spawne of Frogs is produced after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Sulphur which is in the Water, being by the heat of the
Sun reſolved, and diſſolved, is greedily, and with delight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Element of Water, even as the Sperme of a Male
is by the Matrix of the Female, and that upon this account.
The Water wants ſiccity, which the Sulphur hath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
exceedingly deſiring it, doth greedily attract it to it
ſelf: Sulphur alſo wants humidity, and therefore attracts
the humidity of the Water: Moreover the humidity of the
Water hath the humidity of the Salt laid up occultly in it:
alſo the Sulphur cheriſheth the humidity of the fire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
nothing more then the humidity of the Salt, that is in
the Water. Sulphur alſo contains the ſiccity of the Salt, whence
it is that Salt requires a ſiccity from the Sulphur. And thus
do theſe attractive vertues mutually act upon each others ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54827:62"/>
Now by this means there is a conception made in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which now begins to be turgid, puffed up, and troubled,
as alſo to be groſſer, and more ſlimie, until out of the
ſpermatick veſſels the ſpermes be caſt upward, in which
ſpermes after a while appeare black ſpecks, which are the
ſeed of the Frogs, and by the heat of the Sun, are in a ſhort time
turned into the ſame; by which it appears there are diſſimilary
parts in Water.</p>
                     <p>2 Stones are produced out of Water that hath a Mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Mercury, which the Salt, with which it alſo abounds,
fixeth into Stones. This you may ſee cleared by putting ſtones
into the water, for they wil after a time contract a mucilaginous
ſlimy matter, which being taken out of the water and ſet in the
Sun, becomes to be of a ſtony nature. And whence come thoſe
ſtones, gravel, and ſand which we ſee in Springs? they are not
waſhed down out of the Mountains and Hils (as ſome think)
from whence the waters ſpring, neither were they in the earth
before the Springs brake forth, (as ſome imagine) and now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by waſhing away of the earth from them; for if you dig
round about the ſprings, even beyond the heads of them, you
ſhal find no ſtones at all in the earth, only in the veins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
through which the water runs; Now the reaſon of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of theſe ſtones, is the continual motion of the water,
which hinders them from being united into a continued big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
I ſhall make a further confirmation of this in the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
proceſſe of manifeſting the Heterogeneity of Water. I ſhal
here only adde the aſſertion of <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ont,</hi> ſaying that with his
Altaheſt all ſtones, and indeed all things may be turned into
Water? If ſo, then you know what the Maxime is, <hi>viz.</hi> All
things may be reſolved into that from whence they had their
beginning.</p>
                     <p>3 Vegetables are produced out of Water, as you may
clearly ſee by the Waters ſending forth Plants that have no
roots fixed in the bottome; of which ſort is the Heart called
Duck-weed, which putteth forth a little ſtring into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is as it were the root thereof. For the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this, that this Heart may be produced out of meer
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54827:63"/>
Water, there is a Gentleman at this time in the City, of no
ſmall worth, that ſaith he had fair water ſtanding in a glaſs
divers yeares, and at laſt a Plant ſprang out of it. Alſo if
you put ſome Plants, as Water-mint, &amp;c. into a glaſs of fair
water, it wil germinate, and ſhoot out into a great length,
and alſo take root in the Water, which root will in a ſhort
time be ſo encreaſed, and extended, as to fill up the glaſs:
but you muſt remember that you put freſh water into the
glaſſe once in two or three dayes. Hereunto alſo may be
added the experiment of <hi>Helmont,</hi> concerning the growth of a
tree; For (ſaith he) I took two hundred pound weight of
earth dryed in an oven, and put it into a veſſel, in which I
ſet a Willow tree which weighed five pound, which by the
addition of water to the earth, did in five yeares time grow
to ſuch a bigneſſe, as that it weighed one hundred ſixty nine
pound; at which time I alſo dryed and weighed the earth, and
within two ounces it retained its former weight. Beſides, the
ancients have obſerved that ſome Hearbs have grown out of
ſnow being putrefied: and do not we ſee that all Vegetables are
nouriſhed, and increaſed with an inſipid water, for what elſe
is their juice? If you cut a Vine in the month of <hi>March,</hi> it wil
drop divers gallons of inſipid water, which water if it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the trunk of the Vine, would in a little time have
been digeſted into leaves, ſtalks, and grapes, which grapes alſo
by a further maturation would have yeelded a Wine, out of
which you might have extracted a burning ſpirit; Now I
ſay although this inſipid water be by the ſpecificall Sulphur
and Salt of the Vine fixed into the ſtalks, leaves, and grapes
of the vine, yet theſe give it not a corporificative matter,
for that it had before, and an aptitude and potentiality to
become what afterwards it proves to be: for indeed ſtalks,
leaves, and grapes were potentially in it before, all which
now it becomes to be actually, by vertue of the Sun, and of
the aforeſaid Sulphur and Salt, whereof the two latter were
originally in the ſmal ſeed, and therefore as I ſaid could not
adde any bulk to them.</p>
                     <p>Moreover doe not we ſee that when things are burnt and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54827:63"/>
putrefied, they aſcend up into the air by way of vapour, and
fume, and then deſcend by way of inſipid dew, or rain? Now
what do all theſe ſignifie but that from water are all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and in it are diſſimilary parts?</p>
                     <p>2 The artificiall proceſſe is this: take of what water you
pleaſe, whether Well water, Fountaine, River, or Raine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as much as you pleaſe, let it ſettle three or four houres,
untill the ſlime thereof ſeparates it ſelfe: then digeſt it the
ſpace of a month; after which time evaporate the fourth
part, by a very gentle heat, and caſt it away being but the flegm,
then diſtil off the remainder of the water till the feces only be
left, which feces will be a ſlimy ſaltiſh ſubſtance: this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſubſtance diſtill again as before, caſting away every time
the fourth part, as flegme, and keeping the feces by themſelves
for a further uſe; and this doe ſeven times. Note that after
the fourth or fifth diſtillation the water will diſtil over like
milke, colouring the head of your Still ſo that it can hardly
be waſhed or ſcoured off. This pure water after the ſeventh
diſtillation will leave no feces behind: and if you digeſt it
three months it will be coagulated into Stones and Cryſtals,
which ſome magnifie very much for the cure of inward,
and outward putrefactions, out of which alſo may be made
a diſſolving ſpirit. Note that as this water ſtands in dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
you may ſee divers curious colours. Now as for the
feces which I ſpake of (which indeed all waters even the
ſweeteſt leave at the bottome) being as I ſaid a ſaltiſh ſlime,
and in taſte as it were a Medium betwixt Salt, and Nitre;
take them and diſtill them in a Retort in ſand, and there
will firſt come forth a white fume, which being condenſed
deſcendeth in a ſtraight line to the bottome, next will come
over a red Oyl of great efficacy, exceeding the vertues of the
ſpirit of Salt or Nitre. For confirmation of part of this
proceſſe, take <hi>May</hi> dew gathered in a morning (when it hath
not rained the night before) and put it into a glaſs veſſel,
covered with a parchment pricked full of holes, and ſet it in
the heat of the Sun for the ſpace of four months, and there
will ſtore of green feces fall to the bottome, the reſidue of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54827:64"/>
the water being white and clear. Now by all this you may
conclude what manner of diſſimilarity there is in the parts of
water. I ſhall adde but one obſervation more, and ſo conclude
this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Take a ſlint out of River water, and put it into a gourd
glaſſe, poure upon it as much River Water as will fill
the glaſſe, evaporate this water till the flint be drye, then
poure on more freſh water, doe this ſo long till the flint will
fill up the glaſs, (for in a little time it will fill it up, and
become to be of the forme or figure of the glaſſe) for it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
to it ſelfe the mucilaginouſneſſe of the water, which
indeed is a ſlimy ſaltiſh matter, and the true matter of Stones.
And thus thou ſhalt have that done by Art in few dayes,
which Nature would have been perfecting many yeares, and
indeed juſt ſuch a flint as is produced in the Rivers. Any one
that ſhould ſee this flint in the glaſſe would wonder how it
ſhould come in there. You may break your glaſſe and take
out the flint.</p>
                     <p>There are divers ſuch proceſſes which may be uſed, but in
effect they demonſtrate but little more concerning the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Heterogeneity of water, and therefore to avoid tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
I ſhall here end with the Anatomy of Water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which if any one can make a further illuſtration, let
him be candid and impart it, and I ſhall be glad to learn of
him, and in the meane time let him accept of theſe my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>

                     <p>1 The ſpirit is that hot, ſubtle, pure, clear, cordiall, and
balſamicall ſubſtance, which ariſeth with a ſmall heat after four
or five diſtillations, being indeed but the twentieth part of the
Wine. This ſpirit is not that inebriating ſubſtance of the
Wine as moſt think, for a man may drink the ſpirit that is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
out of ten pints of Wine without diſtempering of his br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a pint or two of the Wine.</p>
                     <p>Now this ſpirit contains in it a ſubtle Armoniack, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
Sulphur inſeparably conjoined, which indeed are the
life of the ſpirit, and may be ſeparated from the Mercuriall or
watery part thereof, which after ſeparation of them remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpid,
but yet of wonderfull ſubtility. They may be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thus: Firſt rectifie the ſpirit as high as you can the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way: then rectifie it once or twice in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <figure/>
Note that if there be any flegm remaining in the ſpirit, it wil
go no further then the middle Receiver, eſpecially the ſecond
time. By this means thou ſhalt have ſo ſubtle a ſpirit, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be kept in a veſſell cloſe ſtopt, it will flye away in the air.
Then take of this ſpirit two ounces, and poure it upon ſix

them well together; then diſtill it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and there will

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54827:65"/>
then put on a like quantity of the ſaid ſpirit, as before, and
diſtil it off, and thus do ſo long til the water that comes over is
not inſipid, but the ſpirit comes over again hot as it was poured
on: for by this time the fixed matter is glutted with the ſalt
Armoniack, and Sulphur of the ſpirit. Then put this dryed
matter into a glaſſe ſublimatory, and put fire to it, and there
will ſublime a Salt from thence even as Camphire is ſublimed.
This ſalt is the true eſſence of Wine indeed, and its vertues are
wonderful, for there is no diſeaſe whether inward or outward
that can withſtand it. This is that eſſence of Wine of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
which is ſo penetrating, ſo wonderful cordial and
balſamical, which if thou doeſt once obtain, thou ſhalt need but
few other medicines.</p>
                     <p>Now this ſpirit or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> is in all Vegetables, as you may
ſee in Malt, and Vegetables that are put refied before they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled,
which then yeeld a burning ſpirit; yet it is in Wine
more then in any other Liquors: I ſay Liquors, for if you
take eight gallons of Sack, and as much Wheat, which is a ſolid
body, the Wheat being malted, will yeeld more <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> then
the Sack.</p>
                     <p>2 The flegm is that which remains after the ſpirit is diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off, and is a putrid, inſipid, cold, narcotick, and inebriating
Liquor, debilitating the ſtomach and offending the head. A few
ſpoonfuls of this will preſently make a man drunk, nay the
flegm of half a pint of Wine will make a man drunk, when as
two pints of Wine it ſelfe would hardly doe it: whence you
may collect what a great corrector of Malignant ſpirits, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
the ſpirit of Wine is; which, whileſt it is mixed with the
flegm before diſtillation, doth temper and correct this inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
quality thereof, and as it doth thus, ſo alſo being given (I
mean the pure deflegmated ſpirit) to them that are already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebriated,
doth much allay their diſtemper. This flegm therefore
being of ſo narcotick a quality is the cauſe of Palſies, and ſuch
like diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is to be obſerved that when this flegm is to be
diſtilled off, there remains at the bottom a viſcous corroſive
matter, which by reaſon of its viſcoſity is the cauſe of obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and by reaſon of its corroſiveneſſe the cauſe of the gout,
colick, ſtone, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:54827:66"/>
3 This feces being diſtilled yeelds a ſharp ſpirit, and fetid
oyl, which leave behind them a ſaltiſh ſubſtance, out of which
when the ſalt is extracted, there remains an inſipid earth.</p>
                     <p>Now if any ſhall object againſt what I have aſſerted, and ſay
that <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or ſpirit of Wine are inebriating, the cauſes of
Palfie, ſtone, gout, colick, weak ſtomachs, and ſuch like: as we
ſee by dayly experience in thoſe that are given to the drinking
of theſe Liquors: to which I anſwer it is true: but then I muſt
diſtinguiſh of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and ſpirit of Wine, for there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and ſpirit of Wine, of which alſo they make
Aniſeed water by putting a few Aniſeeds thereunto, and other
ſuch like waters, as Clove, Angelica, Lemmon, &amp;c. With which
this Nation is moſt abominably cheated, and their health im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.
But theſe are not rectified throughly, but three parts
of four of them are an inſipid Narcotick flegm, containing in
it the feces I ſpake of, all which I can in a day ſeparate from the
true pure ſpirit, which ſpirit rather prevents then cauſes ſuch
diſtempers: And the truth is, all the goodneſſe of the Wine is
from this pure ſpirit.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt we muſt underſtand that there are three acceptions of

                     <p>1 <hi>Homunculus</hi> is a ſuperſtitious image made in the place or
name of any one, that it may contain an Aſtrall and inviſible
man; wherefore it was made for a ſuperſtitious uſe.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Homunculus</hi> is taken for an artificiall man, made of <hi>Sperm<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a

nouriſhed and encreaſed with the eſſence of mans bloud; and
this is not repugnant to the poſſibility of Nature and Art. But
is one of the greateſt wonders of God which he ever did ſuffer
mortall man to know. I ſhall not here ſet down the full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
becauſe I think it unfit to be done, at leaſt to be divulged:

                              <desc>•</desc>

extracted by the ſpagyricall Art, from the chiefeſt ſtaffe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54827:66"/>
of the naturall life in man, and according to this acception I
ſhall here ſpeak of it: But before I ſhew you the proceſſe I ſhall
give you an account why this Medicament is called <hi>Homunculus;</hi>
and it is this.</p>
                     <p>No wiſe man will deny that the ſtaffe of life is the nutriment
thereof, and that the chiefeſt nutriment is Bread and Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ordained by God and Nature above all other things for the
ſuſtentation thereof. Beſides <hi>Paracelſus</hi> preferred this nutriment
for the generation of the bloud and ſpirits, and the forming
thence the Sperm of this <hi>Homunculus.</hi> Now by a ſutable alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the nutriment is taken for the life of man, and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is tranſmuted into life: and again the life is taken for the
man, for unleſſe a man be alive he is not a man, but the carcaſſe
only of a man, and the baſeſt part thereof, which cannot perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be taken for the whole man, as the nobleſt part may. In as
much therefore as the nutriment, or aliment of life may be
called the life of man, and the life of man be called man; this
nutriment extracted out of Bread and Wine, and being by dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
exalted into the higheſt purity of a nutritive ſubſtance,
and conſequently becoming the life of man, being ſo potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
may Metaphorically be called <hi>Homunculus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The proceſſe, which in part ſhall be ſet down allegorically is
thus: Take the beſt Wheat and the beſt Wine, of each a like
quantity, put them into a glaſſe, which you muſt hermetically
cloſe: then let them putrefie in horſe dung three days, or until
the Wheat begin to germinate, or to ſprout forth, which then
muſt be taken forth and bruiſed in a Mortar, and be preſſed
through a linnen cloth, and there will come forth a white juice
like milk; you muſt caſt away the feces: Let this juice be put
into a glaſſe, which muſt not be above half full; ſtop it cloſe and
ſet it in horſe dung as before, for the ſpace of fifty days. If the
heat be temperate, and not exceeding the naturall heat of a man,
the matter will be turned into a ſpagyricall bloud, and fleſh,
like an Embryo. This is the principal, and next matter, out of
which is generated a twofold ſperm, <hi>viz.</hi> of the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
generating the <hi>Homunculus,</hi> without which there can be
made no generation, whether humane, or animall.</p>
                     <p>From the bloud, and fleſh of this Embryo let the water be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54827:67"/>
ſeparated in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and the air in aſhes, and both be kept by
themſelves. Then to the feces of the latter diſtillation let the
water of the former diſtillation be added, both which muſt (the
glaſſe being cloſe ſtopt) putrefie in <hi>Balneo</hi> the ſpace of ten days,
after this diſtill the water the ſecond time, (which is then the
vehiculum of the firſt) together with the fire, in aſhes, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill
off this water in a gentle <hi>Balneo,</hi> and in the bottom remains
the fire which muſt be diſtilled in aſhes. Keep both theſe a part.
And thus you have the four Elements ſeparated from the Chaos
of the Embryo.</p>
                     <p>The feculent earth is to be reverberated in a cloſe veſſel for
the ſpace of four dayes: In the interim diſtil off the fourth part
of the firſt diſtillation in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and caſt it away; the other
three parts diſtill in aſhes, and pour it upon the reverberated
earth, and diſtill it in a ſtrong fire; cohobate it four times, and
ſo you ſhall have a very clear water, which you muſt keep by it
ſelf: Then pour the air on the ſame earth, and diſtil it in a
ſtrong fire, and there will come over a clear, ſplendid, odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
water, which muſt be kept apart: After this pour the fire
upon the firſt water, and putrefie them together in <hi>Balneo</hi> the
ſpace of three days, then put them into a Retort and diſtil them
in ſand, and there will come over a water taſting of the fire: let
this water be diſtilled in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and what diſtils off keep by it
ſelf, as alſo what remains in the bottome, which is the fire, keep
by it ſelf. This laſt diſtilled water pour again upon its earth,
and let them be macerated together in <hi>Balneo</hi> for the ſpace of
three dayes, and then let all the water be diſtilled in ſand, and
let what will ariſe be ſeparated in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and the reſidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in the bottome be reſerved with the former reſidence.
Let the water be again poured upon the earth, be abſtracted, and
ſeparated as before, untill nothing remain in the bottom, which
is not ſeparated in <hi>Balneo.</hi> This being done, let the water which
was laſt ſeparated be mixed with the reſidue of its fire, and be
macerated in <hi>Balneo</hi> three or four dayes, and all be diſtilled in
<hi>Balneo,</hi> that can aſcend with that heat, and let what remains be
diſtilled in aſhes from the fire, and what ſhall be elevated is aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
and what remains in the bottome is fiery. Theſe two laſt
Liquors are aſcribed to the two firſt principles, the former to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54827:67"/>
Mercury, and the latter to Sulphur, and are accounted by <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus,</hi>
not as Elements, but their vitall parts, being as it were
the natural ſpirits and ſoul, which are in them by nature. Now
both are to be rectified, and reflected into their center with a
circular motion, that this Mercury may be prepared with its
water being kept clear, and odoriferous in the upper place, but
the Sulphur by it ſelf. Now it remains that we look into the
third principle: let the reverberated earth being ground upon
a marble imbibe its owne water, which did above remain after
the laſt ſeparation of the Liquors made in <hi>Balneo,</hi> ſo that this be
the fourth part of the weight of its earth, and be congealed by
the heat of aſhes into its earth, and let this be done ſo oft, the
proportion being obſerved, untill the earth hath drunk up all
its water. And laſtly let this earth be ſublimed into a white
powder, as white as ſnow, the feces being caſt away. This earth
being ſublimed and freed from its obſcurity is the true Chaos
of the Elements, for it contains thoſe things occult, ſeeing it
is the ſalt of nature, in which they lye hid, being as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
in their center. This is the third principle of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi>
and the ſalt, which is the matrix, in which the two former
ſperms, <hi>viz.</hi> of the man and woman, the parents of the <hi>Homun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,
viz.</hi> of Mercury and Sulphur, are to be put, and to be
cloſed up together in a glazen womb ſealed with <hi>Hermes</hi> ſeals
for the true generation of the <hi>Homunculus</hi> produced from the
ſpagyricall Embryo: and this is the <hi>Homunculus</hi> or great Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
otherwiſe called the nutritive Medicament of <hi>Paracelſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Homunculus</hi> or nutritive Medicament, is of ſuch vertue
that preſently after it is taken into the body, it is turned into
bloud, and ſpirits. If then diſeaſes prove mortall becauſe they
deſtroy the ſpirits, what mortal diſeaſe can withſtand ſuch a
medicine, that doth ſo ſoon repair, and ſo ſtrongly fortifie the
ſpirits as this <hi>Homunculus</hi> being as the oyl to the flame, into
which it is immediately turned, thereby renewing the ſame? By
this Medicament therefore, as diſeaſes are overcome, and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

this impregnation from the ſun, and what the air hath in it ſelf
that proceedeth not from the ſun and ſtars.</p>
                     <p>2. Put this liquor in a cold cellar, or in a moiſt air, and you
ſhall find that it increaſeth not in weight, as it doth in the ſun,
or in the fire (which hath in this reſpect ſome analogie with the

the Spirit may only vapour away, then weigh this metalline
Calx, and ſet it in a crucible over the fire, but melt it not, only
let it darkly glow, let it ſtand ſo 3, or 4, weeks, then take it off,
and weigh it again, and you ſhall find it heavier then before.</p>
                     <p>4. Set any ſulphurous metall, as Iron, or Copper, with ſixteen
or eighteen parts of Lead on a teſt made with aſhes of wood, or
bones in a probatory furnace: firſt weigh the teſt, copper and
lead before you put them into the furnace, let the iron or cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fly away with the lead, yet not with too ſtrong a heat, then
take the teſt out, and weigh it, and you ſhall finde it (though
the metals are gone) when it is cold to be heavier then it was
when it was put into the furnace with the metals. The queſtion
is now whence this heavineſſe of all the aforeſaid Minerals and
metals proceeded, if that the heat of the fun, and fire through the
help of the Mineralls and metals be not fixed into a palpable
Minerall, and Metalline body?</p>
                     <p>5. Set a teſt with lead, or copper in the ſun, and with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
glaſſe unite the beames of the ſun, and let them fall on the
center of the metall, hold the concave glaſſe in your hand, and
let your teſt never be cold, and this will be as well done in the

ſun, as in the fire. But this concave muſt be two foot in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
and not too hollow or deep, but about the eighteenth or
twentieth part of the circle, that it may the better caſt its beams
forth, and it muſt be very well poliſhed.</p>
                     <p>6. Calcine Antimony with a burning glaſſe, and you ſhall
ſee it ſmoak, and fume, and be made dryer then before, yet weigh
it and it will be heavier then before.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall take in, for the confirmation of all this, a relation of
Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby</hi> concerning the precipitating of the ſun beams.
I remember (ſaith he) a rare experiment that a Noble man of
much ſincerity, and a ſingular friend of mine, told me he had
ſeen, w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> was, that by means of glaſſes made in a very particular
manner, and artificially placed one by another, he had ſeen the
ſun beames gathered together, and precipitated down into
a browniſh, or purpliſh red powder. There (ſaith he) could be
no fallacy in this operation. For nothing whatſoever, was in
the glaſſe, when they were placed, and diſpoſed for this intent;
and it muſt be in the hot time of the yeare, elſe the effect would
not follow. And of this magiſtery he could gather ſome dayes
neer 2. ounces in a day, and it was of a ſtrong volatile vertue, and
would impreſſe it ſpirituall quality into gold it ſelfe (the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt
and moſt fixed body we converſe withall) in a very ſhort
time.</p>
                     <p>I leave it now to the reader to judge whether the beames of the

                     <p>Now the manner of the uſing them in this: you muſt firſt
heat them very hot, then put the noſes thereof (which muſt have
a very ſmall hole in them, no bigger then that a pins head may
go in) into a veſſell of cold water, and they will preſently
ſuck in the water, of which then being full turne the noſes
thereof towards the candle or fire w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you would have blown.

hanging out an inch from the face, which mouth (the whole

water, and it will ſuck in water as the noſes of the former did.
This then you muſt hold-cloſe to the fire that it may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

                     <head>An artificiall hot Bath, from the ſame principles as
the naturall Bath is.</head>
                     <p>Before I ſet down the proceſſe of making an artificiall hot
Bath, I ſhall premiſe ſome things concerning the true nature
and originall of a hot Bath. Now the cleareſt and beſt account
that I ever heard or read, of the cauſe of the heat in Bathes is that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54827:86"/>
which is given by <hi>Mounſier de Rochas,</hi> and that in a demonſtrative
way; His words are theſe. As I was (ſaith he) with ſome of my
companions wandring in <hi>Savoy,</hi> I found in the valley of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerne</hi>
betwixt the Alps a hot ſpring; I began to conſider the
cauſe of this heat, and whereas the vulgar opinion is, that the
heat of fountains is from mountains fired within, I ſaw reaſon
to think the contrary, becauſe I ſaw ſnow upon a mountaine
from whence this hot ſpring came, unmelted, which could not
poſſibly but have been diſſolved by the hot fumes of the
mountains, had they been fired. Whereupon being unſatisfied
I with my companions and other labourers (whom I could ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hardly perſwade to undertake ſuch a buſineſſe by reaſon they
were affraid that fire would thereupon breake forth out of the
ground and conſume us) got tools and ſet upon digging to
find out the true cauſe of the heat of this fountain. After we
had digged 15. dayes (having before perceived the water to be
hotter and hotter by degrees as we came neerer to the ſource)
we came to the originall of the heat, where was a great ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
In three houres more we digged beyond this place of
ebullition and perceived the water to be cold, yet in the ſame
continued ſtream with the other that was hot: upon this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wonder much at the reaſon of theſe things. Then I
carryed to my lodging ſome of this hot water (which was both
ſaltiſh and acid) and evaporated it, and of forty ounces I
had in the bottome five drams of ſaltiſh matter, which I then
yet farther purified, and extracted thence three drams of pure
nitrous Hermetick ſalt; the other two ounces being a ſlimie ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous
ſubſtance. Yet with this I was not ſatisfied, but with
my labourers went again to the place, and digged twelve days
more, and then we came to a water which was inſipid as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
fountain Water, yet ſtill in a continued ſtream with the
ſaltiſh and hot water. At this I wondered much, whereupon I
digged up ſome of the earth where the cold, and ſaltiſh ſtream
runned, &amp; carried it home with me, and our of a hundred weight
thereof, I extracted a good quantity of nitrous ſalt, which was
almoſt fluxile. When I had extracted as much as I could, I laid
the earth aſide, and in 24. houres it was all covered over
with ſalt, which I extracted, and out of a hundred weight of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54827:87"/>
this earth which I call virgin earth, I had four pound of this
kind of ſalt which is contracted in the aforeſaid 24. houres:
and ſo it would doe conſtantly. Now this ſatisfied me concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
one doubt: for before I was unſatisfied how there could
be a conſtant ſupply of that ſalt which made the water ſaltiſh,
ſeeing there was but a little diſtance betwixt the inſipid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and the hot water, and the conſtant ſtream of water waſhed
away the ſalt which was in that little ſpace: for I perceived
that this kind of earth attracts this univerſall ſalt of the world
partly from the aire in the cavities of the earth, and partly
from the vapours that conſtantly paſſe through the earth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this I tooke ſome of that earth where the ebullition was,
and carried it home, and proved it, and I perceived it to be a
ſulphur mine, into which the former acid ſaltiſh water pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
cauſed an ebullition, as doe ſalt of Tartar, and Spirit
of Vitriall being mixed together, and alſo water poured on
unſlaked lime. After this I began to queſtion how it was
that this ſulphur mine was not conſumed, ſeeing ſo much
matter paſſeth from it daily: but when I began to underſtand
how all things in the earth did aſſimilate to themſelves what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
was of any kind of affinity to them, as Mines convert the
tooles of miners into their owne ſubſtance in a little time,
and ſuch like experiments of that nature, I was ſatisfied. And
after all this I underſtood how this univerſall ſalt of the
world was to be had, and I could at any time mix it with water,
and pour that water upon ſulphur, and ſo make an artificiall
hot bath as good as any naturall bath whatſoever. Note that
no ſalt in the world but this nitrous ſalt will do it, as I
often tryed: And this ſalt is to be found in all hot bathes,
and to be prepared artificially. Thus farre <hi>Mounſeur de
Rochas.</hi> Something like unto this <hi>Helmont</hi> ſeems to hold forth,
ſaying that there is a <hi>Primum ens ſalium,</hi> or <hi>ſemina ſalium,</hi> which
are all ſeated in waters and vapours and give them an acidity,
but as yet have no ſaline taſt, untill they meet with ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and be received into certain matrixes in the earth which
may make them put forth this potentiall ſaltneſſe into act:
and according to this diverſity of places that this water or
vapours, being impregnated with thoſe ſeeds of ſalt, goe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54827:87"/>
through, ariſeth the diverſity of ſalts, as Alum, ſea-ſalt, Nitre,
&amp;c. Then upon this account the earth through which the cold,
acid, ſaltiſh water aboveſaid run through, did ſpecificate that
potentiall ſalt which was both in the water, and vapours, into a
nitrous ſalt, (by which meanes was that kind of ſalt in that
place) but whether this <hi>primum ens ſalium</hi> be ſo unſpecificated, or
<hi>quid Hermaphroditicum</hi> as he aſſerts, or no, it matters not much
to my purpoſe; it ſufficeth if that earth through which that
acid nitrous water runs, attracts and multiplies an acid nitrous
ſalt, with which the water being impregnated, and running
through a ſulphurous mine cauſeth an ebullition. All this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
premiſed, I ſhall now endeavor to illuſtrate how nature may
in this be imitated, as that an artificiall hot bath may be made
by ſuch like principles, as the naturall hot bath conſiſts of, being
artificially prepared.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe principles are the ſulphur mine, and the acid ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
ſalt; the former requires no further preparation (as ſaith
<hi>Mounſeur de Rochas,</hi>) if it be pure: the latter is to be prepared
two manner of wayes: for either it is to be extracted, as ſaith
the aforeſaid author, out of the waters of the bath by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
them away, or by condenſing the nitrous aire (for
indeed as many judicious philoſophers are of opinion, the air
is wholly nitrous, as it appears by the condenſation of it in cold
places into Nitre) which his virgins earth did doe, into a ſalt,
which was acid, and almoſt fluxil. Now when I ſay that
the nitrous ſalt is to be thus prepared, I do not ſay that this
is the full preparation thereof, for indeed it is yet further to be
prepared, and that is by giving it a greater acidity. I queſtion
much whether or no the ſalt being prepared after the aforeſaid
wayes do retaine that acidity which is required for that ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
I ſpake of, and which the nitrous acid water had before it
came to the Mine of Sulphur. For indeed the aforeſaid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
when he affirmed that he could at any time make an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
hot bath, did not ſay he uſed the ſalt prepared only after
the 2. former wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> by extracting it out of the waters of
the bath, and making it with his virgin earth which did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and condenſe the nitrouſneſſe of the aire, but withall
by making it ſo acid that it might cauſe an ebullition when it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54827:88"/>
came to be joyned with a ſulphur Mine. Now then how to
give this Nitre a ſufficient acidity is the great queſtion. For
the better effecting of this we muſt conſider whence that ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
water (above mentioned) in the earth had the greateſt
part of its acidity. As to that, it muſt be remembred that the
virgin earth through which the acid nitrous water did run, did
condenſe the nitrous air or vapours into a nitrous ſalt, and
withall it is to be conſidered that before this nitrous aire or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
before it be condenſed, even when it is neer unto condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is acid, and part of it before condenſation is mixed with the
water, and ſo renders it acid. Now that waters have great
part of their acidity from the acid vapours of acid Mineralls
both <hi>Henricus ab Heers,</hi> and <hi>Jordan</hi> upon Minerall waters affirme:
and that ſalts unbodied, are far more acid then when they have
aſſumed a body, is clearly manifeſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſpirits of
ſalts, which I call ſalts unbodied becauſe they have loſt their
body, are become very acid becauſe unbodied; if ſo in Spirits
that have loſt their bodies, why not after ſome proportion in
thoſe that have not yet aſſumed a body, as vapours of Nitre, or
nitrous air being neer to congelation, and bodying, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnant
with Spirits of Nitre?</p>
                     <p>Now I ſay that nitrous vapours, or nitrous air being a ſalt
unbodied, are not ſo acid as Spirits of Nitre, becauſe they are
more phlegmatick and crude, which flegme they loſe by being
congealed into a ſalt: yet for all this, they are far more acid then
the body of ſalt: and this is that which <hi>Helmont</hi> underſtands,
when he ſaith that the eſurine ſalt being incorporificated is far
more active, in giving taſt and odour then when it hath received
its body by becoming a ſpecificated ſalt. Furthermore how
Nitre ſhall become ſufficiently acid for the aforeſaid operation
is the great matter to be required into. We muſt therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which way we may unbody Nitre (ſeeing it is ſcarſe poſſible
to get it before it hath received its body) and that is done two
wayes, either by forcing of it into a moſt ſharp Spirit, which is
too acid for our intenſion, or by digeſting the whole ſubſtance
of Nitre into a Liquor moderately acid, which indeed ſerves for
our purpoſe, and the proceſſe is this.</p>
                     <p>Take the pureſt Nitre you can get, diſſolve it in rain water
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54827:88"/>
ſo as that the water imbibe as much of it as it can. Then put
this nitrous water into a common earthen veſſell unglazed,
which you muſt ſet in a cellar. You ſhall ſee this veſſell in a ſhort
time to be white all over on the outſide as with a hoar froſt,
which whiteneſſe is partly the flowers of the Nitre being the
pureſt part thereof penetrating the veſſell, and partly the nitrous
aire condenſed into Nitre by the coldneſſe of the veſſell, as alſo
aſſimilated to the Nitre that penetrated the veſſell. I ſaid by the
coldneſſe of the veſſel, becauſe ſuch is the coldneſſe of an earthen
veſſell wherein is Nitre, diſſolved in water, that it will being ſet
in ſnow by the fire ſide forthwith be freezed. This Nitre you
muſt ſtrike off with a feather, and when you have a ſufficient
quantity thereof, as three or four pound, put this, or the nitrous
ſalt extracted from bath-waters into a bolt head of glaſſe, (a
pound in each bolt head) that two parts of three be empty, nip
it up, and ſet it in aſhes, and give it a reaſonable ſtrong fire, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the upper part of the boul of the bolt head be as hot, as that
you can but well ſuffer your hand upon it, and you ſhall ſee that
the Nitre will be diſſolved every day a little, and in 2. or 3.
moneths time be wholly diſſolved, and become acid, but not ſo
acid as the Spirit thereof; then put it into a glaſſe gourd with
a head, and diſtill it off, and in the bottome you ſhall find an
acid nitrous ſalt almoſt fluxil, not unlike the ſalt which <hi>Mounſeur
de Rochas</hi> found in the evaporating of this water. Then pour the
diſtilled Nitre water upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid ſalt, &amp; then it is for your uſe.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of theſe principles or ingredients is this, <hi>viz.</hi> make
fountaine water ſufficiently acid with this nitrous Liquor, then
pour it upon a ſufficient quantity of the beſt Sulphur Mine, or
Sulphur vivum in a large wooden veſſell where the patient is
to be bathed, and you will ſee the water preſently heated ſo
hot as the patient is able to beare.</p>
                     <p>The inward uſe of theſe bath-waters is by reaſon of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
in them, to diſſolve groſſe humours, open obſtructions,
cleanſe the kidneys and bladder, and by reaſon of the ſulphur
to dry, mollifie, diſcuſſe, and glutinate, and to help all uterine
effects proceeding from cold and windy humours.</p>
                     <p>Note that they muſt be drunk warme, and in a good quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or elſe they will do more hurt then good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54827:89"/>
The outward uſe of this is for ſuch ill effects as are in the
habit of the body, and out of the veines, as of palſies, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
rheumes, cold humors, affects of the skin and aches, for
they reſolve, diſcuſſe, cleanſe, mollifie, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now for the manner of bathing I ſhall not preſcribe any
thing, but leave this to the diſcretion of the phyſitian, who is
to give order and directions for all the circumſtances about it:
for indeed every one is not to bath when, and how he pleaſeth,
but muſt apply himſelfe to an able phyſitian, and ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to his judgement and experience, or elſe may receive either
prejudice, or no benefit thereby.</p>

                  <div type="recipe">
                     <head>An artificiall Tunbridge, and Epſa me Water.</head>
                     <p>It is granted by all, that Tunbridge Water proceeds from an
iron mine, but how it attracts that acidity and that ironiſh
and vitriolated taſt and odour, ſeeing upon evaporation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there remains little or no vitriall or ſalt of iron at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
is the great queſtion; Now for the ſolution of this, we
muſt conſider how many wayes a ſubterraneall minerall, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
may communicate its acidity to waters, and that ſaith
<hi>Henricus ab Heers,</hi> upon Spaw-waters, it doth three wayes: one,
when the water paſſing through the mines, carryeth along with
it ſome of the diſſoluble parts of the mine, to which is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
the ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle: Such are waters, as is the nature of thoſe
Mines through which they paſſe,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Galen</hi> when he ſaith, that
<hi>pure water paſſing through Minerall Mines carry with them ſome of the
ſubstance of the Mines.</hi> The ſecond way is when the vapours ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from ſermented Mineralls and Metalls, are mixed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Now that vapours retain the odour, and taſt of thoſe
things, from whence they are raiſed, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his fourth Book
<hi>Sublimium</hi> affirms, and alſo <hi>Helmont</hi> when he ſaith <hi>that ſome parts of
the iron Mines being by fermentation turned into a vapour retain the odor
and taſt of the Mine by vertue of the acid eſurine ſalt, and are not preſently
reduced into a body, and alſo artificiall vapours of the iron Mines have
more vertue, &amp; activity, (I mean thoſe parts that are raiſed by a ſtrong fire
in a furnace from the Mine of iron) then iron it ſelfe when it is melted.</hi>
The third is, when a great quantity of vapours ariſing from the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54827:89"/>
aforeſaid fermented Mines is elevated, and by the coldneſſe of
the ambient earth is turned into an acid water, which as it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
through the earth meeteth with ſome ſprings of water, and
mixing with them gives them a pleaſant acidity. And this is
the beſt of all acid wtaers being clear and very pure.</p>
                     <p>This being premiſed I ſhall now proceed to the proceſſe of

                     <p>Take of the Mine, or ore of iron, beat it very ſmal, and put it
into the furnace expreſſed page 83. and there will come forth an
acid Spirit, and flowers, which you muſt mix together till the

the clear liquor which will have a ſtrong taſt and ſmel of iron.</p>
                     <p>A few drops of this Liquor put into a glaſſe full of fountaine
water give it the odour and taſt of Tunbridge water, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates

                     <p>It openeth all obſtructions, purgeth by urine, cleanſeth the
kidneys, and bladder, helpeth the piſſing of bloud, the ſtopping
of the urine, and difficulty of making water, it allayeth all ſharp
humors, cureth inward ulcers, and impoſtumes, cleanſeth and
ſtrengtheneth the ſtomach, and liver &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Note that fountaine water being made moderately acid with
this acid ironiſh Liquor may be taken from a pint to ſix pints,
but by degrees, and after the taking of it moderate exerciſe is to

expreſſed page 83. and there will diſtill over a certain acid
alluminiſh water, which muſt be mixed with a double quantity
of Niter water (the preparation whereof is ſet down in the
proceſſe of making the artificiall hot bath). Now you muſt
know that Epſome water hath a certain kind of acid taſt which
is partly alluminous and partly nitrous; which procedeth from
nitrous air, and vapours ariſing from the fermentation of allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
Mines, being firſt mixed together, and then mixed with
the fountaines paſſing through the earth.</p>
                     <p>If you put a few drops of this Liquor into a glaſſe full of

fountaine water it will give it the odour, and taſt of Epſome

                     <p>This water is purgative, and indeed purgeth eſpecially all
ſharp burning humours, cools an inflamed, and opens an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall firſt endeavour to ſhew whence Gold had its
originall, and what the matter thereof is. As
Nature (ſaith <hi>Sandivogius</hi>) is in the will of God,
and God created her: ſo nature made for her ſelfe
a ſeed, (<hi>i.</hi>) her will in the elements. Now ſhe
indeed is one, yet ſhe brings forth divers things; but ſhe
operates nothing without a Sperme: whatſoever the Sperme
will, nature operates, for ſhe is as it were the inſtrument of
any artificers. The Sperme therefore of every thing is
better, and more profitable then nature her ſelf: for thou
ſhalt from nature without a Sperme, doe as much as a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith
without fire, or a husband without grain or ſeed.
Now the Sperme of any thing is the Elixir, the balſame of
ſulphur, and the ſame as <hi>Humidum Radicale</hi> is in metalls: but to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54827:93"/>
proceed to what concernes our purpoſe. Four elements gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
a Sperme, by the will of God, and imagination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
For as the Sperme of a man hath its center, or the
veſſell of its ſeed in the kidneys: ſo the foure elements by their
indeſinent motion (every one according to its quality) caſt
forth a Sperme into the center of the earth, where it is dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and by motion is ſent abroad. Now the center of the
earth is a certaine empty place, where nothing can reſt: and
the four elements ſend forth their qualities into the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the center. As a male ſends forth his ſeed into the
womb of the female, which after it hath received a due porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
caſts out the reſt, ſo it happens in the center of the earth,
that the magnetick powder of a part of any place attracts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
convenient to it ſelfe for the bringing forth of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and the reſt is caſt forth into ſtones and other excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For every thing hath its originall from this fountain,
and there is nothing in the world produced but by this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
as for example, ſet upon an even table a veſſell of water,
which may be placed in the middle thereof, and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it ſet divers things, and divers colours, alſo ſalt, &amp;c. eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing by it ſelfe: then poure the water into the middle; and
you ſhall ſee the water to run every way, and when any ſtreame
toucheth the red colour, it will be made red by it, if the
ſalt, it will contract the taſt of ſalt from it, and ſo of the reſt;
Now the water doth not change the places, but the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of places changeth the water. In like manner the ſeed
or ſperme being caſt forth by the foure elements from the
center of the earth unto the ſuperficies thereof paſſeth through
various places, and according to the nature of the place is any
thing produced: if it come to a pure place of earth, and water,
a pure thing is made.</p>
                     <p>The ſeed, and ſperme of all things is but one, and yet
it generates divers things, as it appears by the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The ſperme whileſt it is in the center is indifferent to
all forms, but when it is come into any determinate place,
it changeth no more its forme. The ſperme whileſt it is in the
center can as eaſily produce a tree, as a metall, and an hearb as a
ſtone, and one more precious then another according to the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54827:93"/>
purity of the place. Now this ſperme is produced of elements
thus. Theſe foure elements are never quiet but by reaſon of
their contrariety mutually act one upon another; and every
one of its ſelfe ſends forth its own ſubtilty, and they agree in
the center. Now in this center is the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> the ſervant of
nature, which mixing thoſe ſpermes together ſends them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and by diſtillation ſublimes them by the heat of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
motion unto the ſuperficies of the earth: For the earth
is porous, and this vapour (or wind, as the philoſophers call
it) is by diſtilling through the pores of the earth reſolved into
water, of which all things are produced. Let therefore as I ſaid
before, all ſons of Art know that the ſperme of metals is not
different from the ſperme of all things being, <hi>viz.</hi> a humid va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.
Therefore in vain do Artiſts endeavour the reduction of
metals into their firſt matter, which is only a vapour. Now ſaith
<hi>Bernard Treviſan</hi> when philoſophers ſpeak of a firſt matter they
did not meane this vapour, but the ſecond matter which is an
unctuous water, which to us is the firſt, becauſe we never find the
former. Now the ſpecification of this vapour into diſtinct metals
is thus. This vapour paſſeth in its diſtillation through the
earth, through places either cold, or hot; if through hot, and
pure where the fatneſſe of ſulphur ſticks to the ſides thereof,
then that vapour (which philoſophers call the Mercury of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers)
mixeth, and joyneth it ſelf unto that fatneſſe, which
afterward it ſublimes with it ſelfe, and then it becomes, leaving
the name of a vapour, and unctuoſity, which afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by ſublimation into other places, which the antecedent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
did purge, where the earth is ſubtle, pure, and humid, fils
the pores thereof, and is joyned to it; and ſo it becomes gold:
and where it is hot, and ſomething impure, ſilver. But if
that fatneſſe come to impure places, which are cold, it is made
lead: and if that place be pure and mixed with ſulphur, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
copper: for by how much the more pure and warm
the place is, ſo much the more excellent doth it make the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls.</p>
                     <p>Now this firſt matter of metals is a humid, viſcous, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible,
ſubtle ſubſtance, incorporated with an earthy ſubtilty,
being equally, and ſtrongly mixed <hi>per minima</hi> in the caverns of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54827:94"/>
the earth. But as in many things there is a twofold unctuoſity
(whereof one is as it were internall, retained in the center of
the thing leſt it ſhould be deſtroyed by fire, which cannot be
without the deſtruction of the ſubſtance it ſelfe wherein it is:
the other as it were externall, feculent and combuſtible) ſo in
all metalls except gold, there is a twofold unctuoſity: the one
which is externall, ſulphurous, and inflamable, which is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to it by accident, and doth not belong to the totall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the terreſtrial parts of the thing: the other is internall,
and very ſubtle, incombuſtible, becauſe it is of the ſubſtantiall
compoſition of <hi>Argent vive,</hi> and therefore cannot be deſtroyed
by fire, unleſſe with the deſtruction of the whole ſubſtance,
whence it appeares what the cauſe is that metalls are more or
leſſe durable in the fire: For thoſe which abound with that
internall unctuoſity are leſſe conſumed, as it appears in ſilver,
and eſpecially in gold. Hence <hi>Roſarius</hi> ſaith, the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
could never by any meanes find out any thing that could
endure the fire; but that unctuous humidity only which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and incombuſtible. <hi>Geber</hi> alſo aſſerts the ſame, when he
ſaith that imperfect bodies have ſuperfluous humidities, and
ſulphureity generating a combuſtible blackneſſe in them, and
corrupting them; they have alſo an impure, feculent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
tereſtriety ſo groſſe, as that it hinders ingreſſion, and
fuſion: but a perfect metall, as gold, hath neither this ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
or terreſtriall impurity; I mean when it is fully matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and melted, for whileſt it is in concoction it hath both
joyned to it, as you may ſee in the golden Ore, but when they
doe not adhere to it ſo, but that it may be purified from
them, which other metalls cannot, but are both deſtroyed
together if you attempt to ſeparate the one from the other:
Beſides gold hath ſo little of theſe corruptible principles mixed
with it, that the inward ſulphur or metalline ſpirit doth
ſometimes and in ſome places overcome them of it ſelfe, as we
may ſee in the gold which is found very pure ſometimes in
the ſuperficies of the earth, and in the ſea ſands, and is many
times as pure as any refined gold.</p>
                     <p>Now this gold which is found in ſands and rivers, is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
there, as ſaith <hi>Gregorius Agricola</hi> in his third book <hi>de
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54827:94"/>
Re Metallica,</hi> but is waſhed down from the mountains with
fountaines that run from thence. There is alſo a flaming gold
found (as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith) in the tops of mountaines, which is
indeed ſeparated of it ſelfe from all impurities, and is as pure
as any refined gold whatſoever. So that you ſee, that gold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it had an extrinſecall ſulphur and earth mixed with it,
yet it is ſometimes ſeparated from it of it ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> by that fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpirit that is in it. Now this pure gold (as ſaith <hi>Sandivogius</hi>)
nature would have perfected into an elixir but was hindred
by the crude air, which crude air is indeed nothing elſe but
that extrinſecall ſulphur which it meets with and is joyned to
in the earth, and which fills with its violence the pores
thereof, and hinders the activity of the Spirit thereof;
and this is that priſon which the ſulphur (as ſaith the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
author) is locked up in, ſo that it cannot act upon its
body, <hi>viz.</hi> Mercury, and concoct it into the ſeed of gold; as
otherwiſe it would doe: and this is that darke body (as faith
<hi>Penotus</hi>) that is interpoſed betwixt the philoſophicall Sunne
and Moone, and keeps off the influences of the one from the
other. Now if any skilfull philoſopher could wittily ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
this adventitious impurity from gold whileſt it is yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
he would ſet ſulphur at liberty, and for this his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he would be gratified with three kingdomes, <hi>viz.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,
Animall, and Minerall, I mean he could remove that
great obſtruction which hinders gold from being digeſted into
the Elixir. For, as ſaith <hi>Sandivogius,</hi> the Elixir, or Tincture of
philoſophers, is nothing elſe but gold digeſted into the higheſt
degree: for the gold of the vulgar is as an hearb without ſeed,
but when gold (<hi>i.</hi>) living gold (for common gold never can by
reaſon that the Spirits are bound up, and indeed as good as
dead and not poſſibly to be reduced to that activity which is
required for the producing of the ſperme of gold) is ripened it
gives a ſeed, which multiplies even <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this barrenneſſe of gold that it produceth not a ſeed is
the aforeſaid crude aire, <hi>viz.</hi> impurities: You may ſee this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated
by this example.</p>
                     <p>We ſee that Orenge-trees in <hi>Polonia</hi> doe grow like other
trees, alſo in <hi>Italy,</hi> and elſewhere, where their native ſoyle
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54827:95"/>
is, and yeeld fruit, becauſe they have ſufficient heat, but in
theſe colder colder countreys they are barren and never yeeld
any fruit, becauſe they are oppreſſed with cold: but if at any
time nature be wittily and ſweetly helped, then Art can perfect
what nature could not. After the ſame manner it is in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls;
for gold would yeeld fruit, and ſeed in which it might
multiply it ſelfe, if it were helped by the induſtry of the
skilfull artiſt, who knew how to promote nature, (<hi>i.</hi>) to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
theſe ſulphurous and earthly impurities from gold.
For there is a ſufficient heat in living gold, which if it were
ſtirred up by extrinſecall heat, to digeſt it into a ſeed. By ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
heat I doe not mean the heat of the celeſtiall Sun,
but that heat which is in the earth and ſtirres up the ſeed,
(<hi>i.</hi>) the living ſpirit that is in all ſubteraneall ſperms to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply,
and indeed makes gold become gold. Now this is a heat
of putrefaction occaſioned by acid ſpirits fermenting in the
earth, as you may ſee by this example related by <hi>Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
but to which the reaſon was given by <hi>Sandivogius.</hi> There
was ſaith the former author, certaine graines of gold found
betwixt the teeth of a dead man in the grave: wherefore he
conceived there was a power in the body of man to make
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ixe gold: but the reaſon is farre otherwiſe, as ſaith
the latter authour: for ſaith he, <hi>Argent vive</hi> was by ſome phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
conveyed into the body of this man when he was alive, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by unction, or by turbith, or ſome ſuch way, as the cuſtome
was; and it is the nature of Mercury to aſcend to the mouth
of the patient, and through the excoriation of the mouth to
be avoided with the flegme. Now then if in ſuch a cure the
ſickman dyed, that Mercury not having paſſage out remained
betwixt the teeth in the mouth, and that carcaſſe became the
naturall veſſell of Mercury, and ſo for a long time being ſhut
up was congealed by its proper ſulphur into gold by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
heat of putrefaction, being purified by the corroſive flegme
of the carkaſſe, but if the minerall Mercury had not been
brought in thither, gold had never been produced there: And
this is a moſt true example that as mercury is by the proper ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
that is in it ſelfe, being ſtirred up and helped by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
heat, coagulated into gold, unleſſe it be hindred by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54827:95"/>
any accident, or have not a requiſite extrinſecall heat, or
convenient place, ſo alſo that nature doth in the bowels of
the earth produce of Mercury only gold and ſilver, and other
metalls according to the diſpoſition of the place, and matrix;
which aſſertion is further cleared by the rule of reduction, for
if it be true that all things conſiſt of that which they may be
reduced into, then gold conſiſts of Mercury, becauſe (as moſt
grant, <hi>Paracelſus</hi> affirmes, and many at this day profeſſe they
can doe) it may be reduced into it. There is a way by which
the tincture of gold which is the ſoule thereof, and fixeth it,
may be ſo fully extracted that the remaining ſubſtance will
be ſublimed like Arſenick, and may be as eaſily reduced into
Mercury as Sublimate. If ſo, and if all Mercury may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into a tranſparent water, as it may (according to the
proceſſe ſet down page 75. and as I know how another better
and eaſier way to turn a pound of Mercury of it ſelf into a clear
water in halfe an houre, which is one of the greateſt ſecrets
I know, or care to know, together with what may be produced
thence, and ſhall crave leave to be ſilent in) why may not that
water in ſome ſenſe, if it be well rectified, be called a kinde
of living gold out of which you may perhaps make a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and a menſtruum unfit for the vulgar to know. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
now from what is premiſed that the immediate matter
of gold is probably Mercury, and not certaine ſalts and I know
not what as many dream of, and that the extrinſecall heat is
from within the earth, and not the heat of the ſun, as ſome
imagine (becauſe in the hotteſt countreys there is all, or almoſt
all gold generated) who if they conſidered that in cold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
alſo are, and as in <hi>Scotland</hi> were gold mines in King <hi>James</hi>
his time, would be of another mind then to think that the
celeſtiall ſun could penetrate, ſo as to heat the earth ſo deep as
moſt gold lies.</p>
                     <p>I now having in ſome meaſure diſcovered what the intrinſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
and extrinſecall heat, and the matter of gold is, I ſhall next
endeavour to explaine what thoſe three principles are, <hi>viz.</hi>
Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, of which <hi>Argent vive,</hi> and gold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt:
Know therefore that after Nature had received from the moſt
High God the priviledge of all things upon the Monarchy
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54827:96"/>
of this wourld, ſhe began to diſtribute places, and provinces to
every thing, according to its dignity; and in the firſt place did
conſtitute the foure elements to be the princes of the world,
and that the will of the moſt High (in whoſe will Nature is
placed) might be fulfilled, ordained that they ſhould act upon
one another inceſſantly. The fire therefore began to act upon
the aire, and produced ſulphur: The air alſo began to act upon
the water, and produced Mercury: the water alſo began to act
upon the earth, and produced ſalt. Now the earth not having
whereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to act produced nothing, but became the ſubject of what
was produced. So then there were produced three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but our ancient philoſophers not ſo ſtrictly conſidering the
matter deſcribed only two acts of the elements, and ſo named
but two principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Sulphur and Mercury: or elſe they
were willing to be ſilent in the other, ſpeaking only to the
ſon of Art.</p>
                     <p>The Sulphur therefore of philoſophers, (which indeed is
the ſulphur of metalls, and of all things) is not, as many
think, that common combuſtible ſulphur which is ſold in
ſhops, but is another thing farre differing from that, and is
incombuſtible, not burning, nor heating, but preſerving, and
reſtoring all things which it is in, and it is the <hi>Calidum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum</hi>
of every thing, the fire of nature, the created light, and
of the nature of the fun, and is called the Sun; ſo that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in any thing is fiery, and airy, is ſulphur, not that any
thing is wholly ſulphureous, but what in it is moſt thin, and
ſubtle, having the eſſence of the naturall fire, and the nature of
the created light, which indeed is that ſulphur which wiſe
philoſophers have in all ages with great diligence endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to extract, and with its proper Mercury to fix, and ſo to
perfect the great Magiſtery of nature. Now of all things in the
world there is nothing hath more of this ſulphur in it then
gold and ſilver, but eſpecially gold, inſomuch that oftentimes
it is called ſulphur, (<hi>i.</hi>) becauſe ſulphur is the moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and excellent principle in it, and being in it more then in
all things beſides.</p>
                     <p>Mercury is not here taken for common <hi>Argent vive;</hi> but
it is the <hi>Humidum Radicale</hi> of every thing, that pure aqueous,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54827:96"/>
unctuous, and viſcous humidity of the matter, and it is of the
nature of the Moon, and it is called the Moone, and that for
this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is humid, as alſo becauſe it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving the influence and light of the Sun, <hi>viz.</hi>
ſulphur.</p>
                     <p>Salt is that fixt permanent earth which is in the center of
every thing that is incorruptible, and inalterable, and it is
the ſupporter and nourſe of the <hi>Humidum Radicale,</hi> with which
it is ſtrongly mixt. Now this ſalt hath in it a ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> its
<hi>Calidum Innatum,</hi> which is <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and its <hi>Humidum Radicale</hi>
which is <hi>Mercury;</hi> and yet theſe three are not diſtinct or to
be ſeparated, but are one homogeneall thing, having upon a
different account divers names: for in reſpect of its heat, and
fiery ſubſtance it is called Sulphur, in reſpect of its humidity,
it is called Mercury, and in reſpect of its terreſtriall ſiccity
it is called ſalt, all which are in gold perfectly united, depura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and fixed.</p>
                     <p>Gold therefore is moſt noble, and ſolid of all metalls, of a
yellow colour, compacted of principles digeſted to the utmoſt
hight, and therefore fixed.</p>
                     <p>Silver is in the next place of dignity to Gold, and differs from
it in digeſtion chiefly, I ſaid chiefly, becauſe there is ſome ſmall
impurity beſides, adhering to ſilver.</p>
                     <p>Now having given ſome ſmall account of the originall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
firſt, and ſecond, and manner of the growth of gold, I ſhall
in the next place ſet downe ſome curioſities therein, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
thereof. The preparations are chiefly three, <hi>viz. Aurum
potabile,</hi> which is the mixtion thereof with other Liquors: Oil
of gold, which is gold liquid by it ſelfe without the mixture of
any other Liquor: and the tincture, which is the extraction
of the colour thereof.</p>
                     <div type="recipe">
                        <head>Dr. Anthony's famous Aurum potabile, and Oil of gold.</head>
                        <p>Diſſolve pure fine gold in <hi>Aqua regis</hi> according to art (the
<hi>Aqua regis</hi> being made of a pound of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and foure ounces
of ſalt Armo niack diſtilled together by Retort in ſand)
which clear folution put into a large glaſſe of a wide neck,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54827:97"/>
and upon it pour drop by drop Oil of Tartar made <hi>per deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
untill the <hi>Aqua regis</hi> which before was yellow become clear,
and white, for that is a ſigne that all calx of gold is ſetled to
the bottome: then let it ſtand all night, and in the morning
pour off the clear Liquor, and waſh the calx four or five times
with common ſpring water, being warmed, and dry it with a
moſt gentle heat.</p>
                        <p>Note, and that wel, that if the heat be too great, the calx takes
fire preſently like Gun-powder and flies away to thy danger
and loſſe, therefore it is beſt to dry it in the ſun, or on a ſtone,
ſtirring it diligently with a wooden ſpatle. To this calx adde
halfe a part of the powder of ſulphur, mix them together and in
an open crucible let the ſulphur burne away in the fire, putting
a gentle fire to it at the firſt, and in the end a moſt ſtrong fire for
the ſpace of an houre, that the calx may in ſome manner be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated,
and become moſt ſubtle, which keep in a viall cloſe
ſtopt for your uſe.</p>
                        <p>Then make a Spirit of urine after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Take
the urine of a healthy man drinking Wine moderately, put
it into a gourd, which you muſt ſtop cloſe, and ſet in horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung
for the ſpace of forty dayes, then diſtill it by Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick
in ſand into a large receiver, untill all the humidity be
diſtilled off. Rectifie this Spirit by cohobation three times, that
the Spirit only may riſe. Then diſtill it in ſand by a glaſſe
with a long neck, having a large receiver annexed, and cloſed
very well to it, and the Spirit will be elevated into the top of
the veſſell like cryſtall without any aqueous humidity accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
of it. Let this diſtillation be continued, untill all the
Spirits be riſen. Theſe cryſtalls muſt be diſſolved in diſtilled
rain-water, and be diſtilled as before, this muſt be done ſix times,
and every time you muſt take freſh rain-water diſtilled. Then
put theſe cryſtalls into a glaſſe bolthead, which cloſe Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,
and ſet in the moderate heat of a Balneum for the ſpace
of fifteen dayes, that they may be reduced into a moſt clear
Liquor. To this Liquor adde an equall weight of Spirit of
Wine, very well rectified, and let them be digeſted in <hi>Balneo</hi>
the ſpace of twelve dayes, in which time they will be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:54827:97"/>
Then take the calx of gold aboveſaid, and poure upon it
of theſe united Spirits as much as will cover them three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
breadth, and digeſt them in a gentle heat, untill the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
be tinged as red as bloud; decant off the tincture, and
put on more of the aforeſaid Spirits, and do as before till
all the tincture be extracted, then put all the tincted Spirits
together, and digeſt them ten or twelve dayes, after which
time abſtract the Spirit with a gentle heat, and cohobate it once;
and then the calx will remain in the bottome like an Oil
as red as bloud, and of a pleaſant odour, and which will be
diſſolved in any Liquor. Whereof this Oil may be the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneum</hi>
of true gold. If you diſtill the ſame ſolution by
Retort in ſand there will come over after the firſt part of the
menſtruum, the tincture with the other part thereof; as red as
bloud, the earth which is left in the bottome of the veſſell
being black, dry, ſpongious and light. The menſtruum muſt be
vapoured away, and the Oil of gold will remain by it ſelf, which
muſt be kept as a great treaſure: and this is Dr. <hi>Anthony's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

                        <p>There is found a certaine ſtone in Bononia, which ſome call a
golden Marcaſite, ſome a ſolarie Magnes, that receives light
from the ſun in the day time, and gives it forth in the dark.
About this there have been much reaſoning amongſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
as whether light be really a body, or any kinde of
ſubſtance, or any accident only, and whether this ſtone had
any gold in it or no, and what it did conſiſt of. Hee that firſt
diſcovered it thought that he had found a thing that would
tranſmute metals into gold, (by which it appears that there
ſeemed to be ſomething of gold in it or ſomething more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then gold) but his hopes were fruſtrated by a fruitleſſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54827:100"/>
notwithſtanding which I conceive there might be ſome
immature or crude gold in it; for crude gold is a ſubject (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is ſome life in it) that is moſt fit to receive the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the ſun according to the unanimous conſent of all
Philoſophers, and therefore is by them not only called Solary
but Sol (<hi>i.</hi>) the Sun it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>It is prepared for the receiving of light thus, it is calcined
two wayes, firſt it is brought into a moſt ſubtle powder with a
very ſtrong fire in a crucible; ſecondly, being thus brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a powder, is made up into cakes as big as a doller, or a piece
of eight, either with common water alone, or with the white
of an egge, put thoſe cakes being dryed by themſelves into a
Winde Furnace <hi>S S S,</hi> with coales, and calcine them in a moſt
ſtrong fire for the ſpace of foure or five houres. When the
furnace is cold take them out, and if they be not ſufficiently
calcined the firſt time, (which is known by their giving but
little light,) then reiterate the calcination after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as before, which is ſometimes to be done thrice. That
is the beſt which is made with the choiſeſt ſtones that are clean,
pure, and diaphanous, and gives the beſt light. With this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
powdered you may make the formes of divers animalls
of what ſhapes you pleaſe, which you muſt keep in boxes, and
they will receive light from the ſun in the day time, give
light in the night, or in a darke place, which light will vaniſh
by degrees.</p>
