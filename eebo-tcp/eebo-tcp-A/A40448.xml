         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is my ambition to let the world
know upon what ≈øcore it is that I do
e≈øpecially honour men. It is not Sir!
as they are high born Heirs of the
great Potentates, for which mo≈øt
honour them (and upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I al≈øo ≈øhall not deny them their
due) but as they excell in hone≈øty,
and are friends to Art. That poor Philo≈øophers ≈øhould
take no delight in riches, and rich men ≈øhould take great
delight in Philo≈øophy, is to me an argument, that there
<pb facs="tcp:54827:3"/>
is more delight, honor, and ≈øatisfaction in the one then in
the enjoyment of the other. I once read of a Noble mans
Porter that let in all that were rich apparelled, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a poor Philo≈øopher: but I ≈øhould, if I had been in
his place, have rather let in the Philo≈øopher without the
gay cloathes, then the gay cloathes without the Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
As long as I have ≈øen≈øe or rea≈øon, I ≈øhall improve
them to the honour of Art, e≈øpecially that of Alchymie.
In the perfection thereof there are riches, honour, health,
and length of dayes: by it <hi>Arte≈øius</hi> lived 1000. years,
<hi>Flammell</hi> built 28 Ho≈øpitalls with large revenues to them,
be≈øides Churches and Chappels; for it; both they and
divers more were accounted Philo≈øophers, and wi≈øe men,
which ≈øounds more honourable in my eares then all the
ratling and empty titles of honour what≈øoever be≈øides.
In the perfection of this Art, I mean the accompli≈øhing
of the Elixir, is the Sulphur of Philo≈øophers ≈øet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which gratifies the relea≈øers thereof with three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<hi>viz.</hi> Vegetable, Animall, and Minerall, and what
cannot they do, and how honourable are they, that have
the command of the≈øe? They may command Lead into
Gold, dying plants into fruitfulne≈ø≈øe, the ≈øick into
health, old age into youth, darkne≈ø≈øe into light, and what
not? A month would fail to give you an account of their
power and dominations. Now for the effecting of this I
≈øhall be≈øides what I have advi≈øed in the Epi≈øtle to the
Reader, ≈øay only this; Court the Mother, and you winne
the Daughter, prevail with Nature, and the fair <hi>Diana</hi> of
the Philo≈øophers is at your ≈øervice.</p>
                  <p>Now if you cannot prevaile with Nature for the faire≈øt
of her daughters, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mercury of Philo≈øophers, yet
≈øhe hath other Daughters of wonderfull beauty al≈øo, as
<pb facs="tcp:54827:3"/>
are the E≈ø≈øences and Magi≈øteries of Philo≈øophers, which
al≈øo are endowed with riches, honour, and health<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and any
of the≈øe you may more ea≈øily prevail with their mother
Nature for. This Art of Alchymie is that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lary</hi> Art,
which is more noble then all the other ≈øix Arts, and
Sciences, and if it did once throughly ≈øhine forth out
of the clouds whereby it is eclip≈øed, would darken all the
re≈øt, (as the Sun doth the other ≈øix planets) or at lea≈øt
≈øwallow up their light. This is that true naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophy
which mo≈øt accurately anatomizeth Nature and
naturall things, and ocularly demon≈øtrates the principles
and operations of them. That empty naturall philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophy
which is read in the Univer≈øities, is ≈øcarce the
meane≈øt hand-maid to this Queen of Arts. It is pity
there is ≈øuch great encouragement for many empty and
unprofitable Arts, and none for this, and ≈øuch like
ingenuities, which if promoted would render an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity
far more flouri≈øhing then the former. I once read
or heard of a famous Univer≈øity beyond Sea, that was
faln into decay, through what cau≈øe I know not: but
there was a generall councell held by the learned, how to
re≈øtore it to its primitive glory. The <hi>Medium</hi> at la≈øt agreed
upon was the promoting of Alchymie, and encouraging
the Arti≈øts them≈øelves. But I never expect to ≈øee ≈øuch rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
actings in this Nation, till ≈øhadows vani≈øh, ≈øub≈øtances
flouri≈øh, and truth prevail: which time I hope is at hand
and de≈øired by all true Arti≈øts, and to my knowledge,
e≈øpecially by your ≈øelf, upon which account I truly
honour you. Now to your ≈øelfe therefore I crave
leave to adumbrate ≈øomething of that Art which I

I dedicate this Treati≈øe to you, not that it is

worthy your acceptance, but that it may receive worth

would preferre cordiall e≈ø≈øences before crude juices, bal≈øami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Elixirs before flegmatick waters, the Mercury of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophers
before common quick≈øilver. But many men have ≈øo
little in≈øight in this Art, that they ≈øcarce believe any thing
in it beyond the Di≈øtilling of Waters and Oils, and extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Salts; nay many that pretend to Philo≈øophy, and would
<pb facs="tcp:54827:5"/>
be accounted Philo≈øophers, are ≈øo unbeleeving, that, as ≈øaith
<hi>Sandivogius,</hi> although he would have intimated the true
Art to them word by word, yet they would by no meanes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand
or beleeve that there was any water in the Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
≈øea. And as he in this ca≈øe, ≈øo I in another know divers
that will not beleeve that common quick≈øilver can of it ≈øelfe
be turned wholy into a tran≈øparent water, or that gla≈ø≈øe can
be reduced into ≈øand and ≈øalt of which it was made, ≈øaying
that <hi>fu≈øio vitrificatoria e≈øt ultima fu≈øio;</hi> or that an hearb
may be made to grow in two hours, and the Idea of a plant
to appear in a gla≈ø≈øe, as if the very plant it ≈øelfe were there,
and this from the e≈ø≈øence thereof, and ≈øuch like preparations
as the≈øe: the two former whereof may be done in half an
hour, but the latter requires a longer time, but yet pos≈øible.
And for the po≈ø≈øibility of the Elixir, you ≈øhall a≈ø≈øoon per≈øwade
them to beleeve they know nothing (which is very hard, nay
an impo≈ø≈øible thing to do) then to beleeve the po≈ø≈øibility
thereof. If there be any ≈øuch thing (≈øay they) why are not the
po≈ø≈øe≈øsors thereof infinitely rich, famous, do many miracles

The truth is, the greate≈øt matter that Philo≈øophers aime at,

to me then a ≈øolatary life, or with <hi>Diogenes</hi> to live hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and that deceit, and covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe prevail much, that all
things are vendible, and that vice doth excel vertue. I ≈øee
the better things of the life to come before mine eyes, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in the≈øe: Now I do not wonder, as before I did, why
Philo≈øophers when they have attained this medicine, have
not cared to have their daies ≈øhortned, (although by the
vertue of their medicine they could have prolonged them)
for every Philo≈øopher hath the life to come ≈øo cleerly ≈øet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

way of reply to the frivolous objections of tho≈øe that beleeve
not the verity of this Art, and not onely ≈øo, but will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it. If you ≈øhould di≈øcover to them the proce≈ø≈øe of the

I will warrant you never make u≈øe of it. Nay if you ≈øhould

make projection before them, they would think that even in
that there were a fallacy, ≈øo unbeleeving are they: ≈øo I finde
them, and ≈øo I leave them, and ≈øhall for ever finde them the

                  <p>There is another ≈øort of men by whom this Art hath been
much ≈øcandalized, and they indeed have brought a great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
upon it by carrying about, and vending their whites,
and reds, their ≈øophi≈øticated oils, and ≈øalts, their dangerous
and ill prepared <hi>Turbithes,</hi> and <hi>Aurum vitae</hi>'s. And indeed
it were worth while, and I might do good ≈øervice for the
Nation, to di≈øcover their cheats, as their ≈øophi≈øticating of
Chymicall oils with ≈øpirit of Turpentine, and ≈øalts with ≈øalt
extracted out of any wood-a≈øhes and ≈øuch like, but here is not
place for ≈øo large a di≈øcour≈øe as this would amount to. I ≈øhall
only at this time relate to you how <hi>Penotus</hi> was cheated with
a ≈øophi≈øticated Oil of gold: for, ≈øaith he, I gave 24. duckets for
the proce≈ø≈øe of an <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> which was much cryed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and magnified at <hi>Prague,</hi> but at la≈øt it proved to be nothing
but a mixture of oil of Camphire, Cloves, Fennel-≈øeed, and
of Vitriall tinged with the leaves of Gold. I know I ≈øhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
the di≈øplea≈øure of ≈øome, but they are ≈øophisticating,
cheating mounteba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cks, who indeed de≈øerve to be bound to the
peace, becau≈øe many men, I dare ≈øwear, through their means
go in danger of their lives. Better it is that their kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
≈øhould be detected, then a noble Art through their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
be clouded, and a≈øper≈øed.</p>
                  <p>Now we mu≈øt con≈øider that there are degrees in this Art;
for there is the accompli≈øhing of the Elixir it ≈øelf, and there
is the di≈øcovering of many excellent e≈ø≈øences, magi≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and ≈øpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which abundantly recompen≈øe the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers
thereof with profit, health, and delight. Is not

Is not his <hi>Tinea Scatura</hi> a mo≈øt noble medicine, that

brought to light, in the ≈øearching out of which, why may
not the Elixir it ≈øelfe at la≈øt be attained unto? Is it not
po≈ø≈øible for them that pa≈ø≈øe through many Philo≈øophicall
preparations to unfold at la≈øt the riddles, and Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks
of the Philo≈øophers? or were they all meer Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta≈ømes?
Is there no <hi>fundamentum in re</hi> for this ≈øecret?
Is there no ≈øperme in gold? Is it not po≈ø≈øible to exalt it
for multiplication? Is there no univer≈øall ≈øpirit in the
world? Is it not po≈ø≈øible to finde that collected in one
thing, which is di≈øper≈øed in all things? What is that
which makes gold incorruptible? What induced the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophers
to examine gold for the matter of their medicine?
Was not all gold once living? Is there none of this living
gold, the matter of Philo≈øophres, to be had? Did <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divogius</hi>
the la≈øt of knowne Philo≈øophers ≈øpend it all?
Surely there is matter enough for Philo≈øophers, and al≈øo
≈øome Philo≈øophers at this day for the matter, although
they are unknowne to us. There are, ≈øaith <hi>Sandivogius,</hi>
without doubt many men of a good con≈øcience both
of high and low degree (I ≈øpeak knowingly) that have
this medicine, and keep it ≈øecretly. If ≈øo, let no man be
di≈øcouraged in the pro≈øecution of it, e≈øpecially if he take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him the five Keyes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> which <hi>Nollius</hi> ≈øets down,
<pb facs="tcp:54827:7"/>
which indeed all Philo≈øophers with one con≈øent enjoyne the
u≈øe and ob≈øervation of.</p>
                  <p>1. Seeing it is a thing divine, and cele≈øtiall, it mu≈øt be
≈øought for from above, and that not without a full re≈øolution
for a pious, and charitable improvement of it.</p>
                  <p>2. Before thou betake≈øt thy ≈øelfe to the worke, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to thy ≈øelfe what thou ≈øeeke≈øt for, and enter not upon
the practicke till thou art fir≈øt well ver≈øed in the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
for it is much better to learn with thy braines, and
imagination, then with thy hands, and co≈øts, and e≈øpecially
≈øtudy nature well; and ≈øee if thy propo≈øals be agreeable to the
po≈ø≈øibility thereof.</p>
                  <p>3. Diligently read the ≈øayings of true Philo≈øophers,
read them over again and again, and meditate on them,
and take heed thou doe≈øt not read the writings of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øters
in ≈øtead of the Books of the true Philo≈øophers.
Compare their ≈øayings with the po≈ø≈øibility of Nature, and
ob≈øcure places with cleare, and where Philo≈øophers ≈øay
they have erred doe thou beware, and con≈øider well
the generall axioms of Philo≈øophers, and read ≈øo long till
thou ≈øee≈øt a ≈øweet Harmony, and con≈øent in the ≈øayings of
them.</p>
                  <p>4. Imagine not high things, but in all things imitate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> in matter; in removing what is Heterogeneous; in
weight; in colour; in fire; in working; in ≈ølowne≈ø≈øe of working;
and let not thy operations be vulgar, neither thy ve≈ø≈øels;
work diligently and con≈øtantly.</p>
                  <p>5. If it be po≈ø≈øible, acquaint thy ≈øelf throughly with ≈øome
true Philo≈øophers. Although they will not directly di≈øcover
them≈øelves that they have this ≈øecret, yet by one circum≈øtance
or another it may be concluded how neer they are to it. Would
not any rationall man that had been conver≈øant with
<hi>Bacon,</hi> and ≈øeeing him doe ≈øuch miraculous things,
<pb facs="tcp:54827:8"/>
or with <hi>Sandivogius</hi> who did intimate the Art to ≈øome word
by word, have concluded that they were not ignorant of it?
There have been Philo≈øophers, and perhaps ≈øtill are, that
although they will not di≈øcover how it is made, yet may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
you, to the ≈øaving of a great deal of co≈øt, pains, and
time, how it is not made: and to be convinced of an
errour is a great ≈øtep to the truth. If <hi>Ripley</hi> had been
by any Tutor convinced of tho≈øe many errours before
he had bought his knowledge at ≈øo deare a rate, he
had long before, with le≈ø≈øe charges attained to his ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed
de≈øire.</p>
                  <p>And as a friendly Tutor in this, ≈øo in all ≈øpagyricall
preparations what≈øoever, is of all things mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary.
A faithfull well experienced ma≈øter will teach thee more

his favour, though with a good gratuity, to lead
thee through the manuall practice of the chiefe≈øt, and
choi≈øe≈øt preparations. I ≈øaid apply thy ≈øelf to an Arti≈øt,
for there is ≈øcarce any proce≈ø≈øe in all Chymi≈øtry ≈øo ea≈øie that
he that never ≈øaw it done will be to ≈øeek, and commit ≈øome
errours in the doing of it. I ≈øaid expert, that he may be able
to in≈øtruct thee aright; faithful, that as he is able, ≈øo may
faithfully performe what he promi≈øeth; and communicative,
that he may be free in di≈øcovering him≈øelfe and his Art to
thee. The truth is, mo≈øt Arti≈øts re≈øerve that to them≈øelves,
which they know, either out of a de≈øire to be admired the
more for their undi≈øcovered ≈øecrets, or out of envie to others
knowledge. But how far this humour is approvable in them,
I leave it to others to judge; and as for my part I have here

communicated upon the account of a bare acceptance onely
what I have with many years paines, much reading, and
great co≈øts known. There is but one thing which I de≈øire to

thing it ≈øelfe to be prepared, what it is I have el≈øewhere in
this Treati≈øe expre≈øsed; and the preparing of that is indeed
a thing worthy of any ones knowing, and which perhaps

and Calcination; and <hi>I</hi> hope this will be an occa≈øion to ≈øet the

is ≈øet down plain, yet all of them mu≈øt be proceeded

Art of Di≈øtillation had its originall, as
being a thing not ea≈øily to be proved,
and if known, yet little conducing to
our en≈øuing di≈øcour≈øe. But let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand
what Di≈øtillation is, of which
there are three principall and chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
or de≈øcriptions.</p>
                  <p>1 Di≈øtillation is a certain Art of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
the Liquor, or the humid part of things by vertue of
heat (as the matter ≈øhall require) being fir≈øt re≈øolved into a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
and then conden≈øed again by cold.</p>
                  <p>2. Di≈øtillation is the art of extracting the ≈øpirituall and
e≈ø≈øential humidity from the flegmatick, or of the flegmatick, from
the ≈øpirituall.</p>
                  <p>3 Di≈øtillation is the changing of gro≈ø≈øe thick bodies into a
thinner and liquid ≈øub≈øtance, or ≈øeparation of the pure liquor
from the impure feces.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall treat of Di≈øtillation according to all the≈øe three accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and no otherwi≈øe; hence I ≈øhall exclude Sublimation, and
Calcination, which are of dry ≈øub≈øtances, unle≈ø≈øe I ≈øhall by the
way make u≈øe of either in relation to the perfecting of any kind
of Di≈øtillation.</p>
                  <p>Now becau≈øe all, or mo≈øt of the≈øe di≈øtillations are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by heat, it will be nece≈ø≈øary to under≈øtand how many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54827:10"/>
degrees of heat there are, and which are convenient for every
operation, and they are principally four.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt is only a warmth, as is that of hor≈øe dung, of the
Sun, of warm water, and the vapour thereof, which kind of
heat ≈øerves for putrefaction, and dige≈øtion.</p>

In the fir≈øt and lowe≈øt the a≈øhes are received, in the ≈øecond

you would have the heat increa≈øed or decrea≈øed. In the top or

mu≈øt be two or three holes made, that by them the ≈ømoak may

it boileth no more, then cea≈øe and di≈øtill it. Fir≈øt cometh over
a ≈øtinking water, then a clear white well ≈ømelling oyl, and after

Salt hath lo≈øt its ≈øharpne≈øs: the volatile ≈øalt of the oyl remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
coagulated with the ≈øpirit of Salt, and is black, and ta≈øteth
like ≈øalt Armoniack, and hath no ≈ømell being ≈øublimed from it.

or too little fire, and you may fini≈øh your operation when you
plea≈øe, and in one hour try divers experiments. It ≈øaveth very
much time and co≈øt, and in one hour will doe as much as can be
done in another Furnace in 24. In one hour you may make a
pound of ≈øpirit of Salt with four or five pound of coals, and as
much flower of Antimony in a like ≈øpace of time, and with as
few coals.</p>
                     <p>If your materials be vegetables, or horn, or bones, cut them
≈ømall; If hard Minerals, let them be powdered very ≈ømall; if
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54827:52"/>
≈øalts, let them fir≈øt be di≈ø≈øolved in water, which water mu≈øt be

                     <p>By this Furnace you may make the ≈øpirits of ≈øuch things

as if neither Nature or Art could di≈øcover any
Heterogeneity in the parts thereof: thus indeed
it ≈øeems to the eye of the vulgar, but to that of
a Philo≈øopher far otherwi≈øe, as I ≈øhall endeavor
to make credible by pre≈øenting to your con≈øideration a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
proce≈øs of the di≈øcovering the di≈ø≈øimilary parts thereof;
whereof the one is naturall only, and the other artificiall; But
before I ≈øpeak of either, it mu≈øt be premi≈øed, that in the element
of Water there is great plenty of the ≈øpirit of the World,
which is more predominant in it then in any other element,
for the u≈øe and benefit of univer≈øall nature; and that this
≈øpirit hath three di≈øtinct ≈øub≈øtances, <hi>viz.</hi> Salt, Sulphur, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54827:62"/>
Mercury. Now by ≈øalt we mu≈øt under≈øtand a ≈øub≈øtance very
dry, vitall, and radicall, having in it the beginning of corpori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øication,
as I may ≈øo call it: by Sulphur, a ≈øub≈øtance ful of light
and vital heat, or vivifying fire, containing in it ≈øelf the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of motion: by Mercury, a ≈øub≈øtance abounding
with radical moi≈øture, with which the Sulphur of life, or
vital fire, is cheri≈øhed and pre≈øerved. Now the≈øe ≈øub≈øtances
which are in the Spirit of the World make all Fountaines,
and Waters, but with ≈øome difference, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
of either. This ≈øeveral predominancy therefore
is the ground of the variety of productions; I ≈øay, of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
becau≈øe all things are produced out of Water: for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is both the Sperme, and the Men≈øtruum of the World;
the former, becau≈øe it includes the ≈øeed of every thing; the
latter, becau≈øe the Sperme of Nature is put refied in it, that
the ≈øeed included in it ≈øhould be actuated, and take upon it
the divers Formes of things; and becau≈øe by it the ≈øeed it ≈øelf,
and all things produced of ≈øeed grow, and are encrea≈øed: Now
this being premi≈øed, I ≈øhall ≈øhew you what the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øe
is, which I ≈øhal make plain by in≈øtancing in three ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
productions, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ≈øpawn of Frogs, of Stones, and
of Vegetables.</p>
                     <p>The Spawne of Frogs is produced after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Sulphur which is in the Water, being by the heat of the
Sun re≈øolved, and di≈ø≈øolved, is greedily, and with delight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Element of Water, even as the Sperme of a Male
is by the Matrix of the Female, and that upon this account.
The Water wants ≈øiccity, which the Sulphur hath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
exceedingly de≈øiring it, doth greedily attract it to it
≈øelf: Sulphur al≈øo wants humidity, and therefore attracts
the humidity of the Water: Moreover the humidity of the
Water hath the humidity of the Salt laid up occultly in it:
al≈øo the Sulphur cheri≈øheth the humidity of the fire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires
nothing more then the humidity of the Salt, that is in
the Water. Sulphur al≈øo contains the ≈øiccity of the Salt, whence
it is that Salt requires a ≈øiccity from the Sulphur. And thus
do the≈øe attractive vertues mutually act upon each others ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54827:62"/>
Now by this means there is a conception made in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which now begins to be turgid, puffed up, and troubled,
as al≈øo to be gro≈ø≈øer, and more ≈ølimie, until out of the
≈øpermatick ve≈ø≈øels the ≈øpermes be ca≈øt upward, in which
≈øpermes after a while appeare black ≈øpecks, which are the
≈øeed of the Frogs, and by the heat of the Sun, are in a ≈øhort time
turned into the ≈øame; by which it appears there are di≈ø≈øimilary
parts in Water.</p>
                     <p>2 Stones are produced out of Water that hath a Mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Mercury, which the Salt, with which it al≈øo abounds,
fixeth into Stones. This you may ≈øee cleared by putting ≈øtones
into the water, for they wil after a time contract a mucilaginous
≈ølimy matter, which being taken out of the water and ≈øet in the
Sun, becomes to be of a ≈øtony nature. And whence come tho≈øe
≈øtones, gravel, and ≈øand which we ≈øee in Springs? they are not
wa≈øhed down out of the Mountains and Hils (as ≈øome think)
from whence the waters ≈øpring, neither were they in the earth
before the Springs brake forth, (as ≈øome imagine) and now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by wa≈øhing away of the earth from them; for if you dig
round about the ≈øprings, even beyond the heads of them, you
≈øhal find no ≈øtones at all in the earth, only in the veins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
through which the water runs; Now the rea≈øon of the ≈ømal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe
of the≈øe ≈øtones, is the continual motion of the water,
which hinders them from being united into a continued big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.
I ≈øhall make a further confirmation of this in the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
proce≈ø≈øe of manife≈øting the Heterogeneity of Water. I ≈øhal
here only adde the a≈ø≈øertion of <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Water, there is a Gentleman at this time in the City, of no
≈ømall worth, that ≈øaith he had fair water ≈øtanding in a gla≈øs
divers yeares, and at la≈øt a Plant ≈øprang out of it. Al≈øo if
you put ≈øome Plants, as Water-mint, &amp;c. into a gla≈øs of fair
water, it wil germinate, and ≈øhoot out into a great length,
and al≈øo take root in the Water, which root will in a ≈øhort
time be ≈øo encrea≈øed, and extended, as to fill up the gla≈øs:
but you mu≈øt remember that you put fre≈øh water into the
gla≈ø≈øe once in two or three dayes. Hereunto al≈øo may be
added the experiment of <hi>Helmont,</hi> concerning the growth of a
tree; For (≈øaith he) I took two hundred pound weight of
earth dryed in an oven, and put it into a ve≈ø≈øel, in which I
≈øet a Willow tree which weighed five pound, which by the
addition of water to the earth, did in five yeares time grow
to ≈øuch a bigne≈ø≈øe, as that it weighed one hundred ≈øixty nine
pound; at which time I al≈øo dryed and weighed the earth, and
within two ounces it retained its former weight. Be≈øides, the
ancients have ob≈øerved that ≈øome Hearbs have grown out of
≈ønow being putrefied: and do not we ≈øee that all Vegetables are
nouri≈øhed, and increa≈øed with an in≈øipid water, for what el≈øe
is their juice? If you cut a Vine in the month of <hi>March,</hi> it wil
drop divers gallons of in≈øipid water, which water if it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the trunk of the Vine, would in a little time have
been dige≈øted into leaves, ≈øtalks, and grapes, which grapes al≈øo
by a further maturation would have yeelded a Wine, out of
which you might have extracted a burning ≈øpirit; Now I
≈øay although this in≈øipid water be by the ≈øpecificall Sulphur
and Salt of the Vine fixed into the ≈øtalks, leaves, and grapes
of the vine, yet the≈øe give it not a corporificative matter,
for that it had before, and an aptitude and potentiality to
become what afterwards it proves to be: for indeed ≈øtalks,
leaves, and grapes were potentially in it before, all which
now it becomes to be actually, by vertue of the Sun, and of
the afore≈øaid Sulphur and Salt, whereof the two latter were
originally in the ≈ømal ≈øeed, and therefore as I ≈øaid could not
adde any bulk to them.</p>
                     <p>Moreover doe not we ≈øee that when things are burnt and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54827:63"/>
putrefied, they a≈øcend up into the air by way of vapour, and
fume, and then de≈øcend by way of in≈øipid dew, or rain? Now
what do all the≈øe ≈øignifie but that from water are all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and in it are di≈ø≈øimilary parts?</p>
                     <p>2 The artificiall proce≈ø≈øe is this: take of what water you
plea≈øe, whether Well water, Fountaine, River, or Raine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as much as you plea≈øe, let it ≈øettle three or four houres,
untill the ≈ølime thereof ≈øeparates it ≈øelfe: then dige≈øt it the
≈øpace of a month; after which time evaporate the fourth
part, by a very gentle heat, and ca≈øt it away being but the flegm,
then di≈øtil off the remainder of the water till the feces only be
left, which feces will be a ≈ølimy ≈øalti≈øh ≈øub≈øtance: this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
≈øub≈øtance di≈øtill again as before, ca≈øting away every time
the fourth part, as flegme, and keeping the feces by them≈øelves
for a further u≈øe; and this doe ≈øeven times. Note that after
the fourth or fifth di≈øtillation the water will di≈øtil over like
milke, colouring the head of your Still ≈øo that it can hardly
be wa≈øhed or ≈øcoured off. This pure water after the ≈øeventh
di≈øtillation will leave no feces behind: and if you dige≈øt it
three months it will be coagulated into Stones and Cry≈øtals,
which ≈øome magnifie very much for the cure of inward,
and outward putrefactions, out of which al≈øo may be made
a di≈ø≈øolving ≈øpirit. Note that as this water ≈øtands in dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion
you may ≈øee divers curious colours. Now as for the
feces which I ≈øpake of (which indeed all waters even the
≈øweete≈øt leave at the bottome) being as I ≈øaid a ≈øalti≈øh ≈ølime,
and in ta≈øte as it were a Medium betwixt Salt, and Nitre;
take them and di≈øtill them in a Retort in ≈øand, and there
will fir≈øt come forth a white fume, which being conden≈øed
de≈øcendeth in a ≈øtraight line to the bottome, next will come
over a red Oyl of great efficacy, exceeding the vertues of the
≈øpirit of Salt or Nitre. For confirmation of part of this
proce≈ø≈øe, take <hi>May</hi> dew gathered in a morning (when it hath
not rained the night before) and put it into a gla≈øs ve≈ø≈øel,
covered with a parchment pricked full of holes, and ≈øet it in
the heat of the Sun for the ≈øpace of four months, and there
will ≈øtore of green feces fall to the bottome, the re≈øidue of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54827:64"/>
the water being white and clear. Now by all this you may
conclude what manner of di≈ø≈øimilarity there is in the parts of
water. I ≈øhall adde but one ob≈øervation more, and ≈øo conclude
this ≈øubject.</p>
                     <p>Take a ≈ølint out of River water, and put it into a gourd
gla≈ø≈øe, poure upon it as much River Water as will fill
the gla≈ø≈øe, evaporate this water till the flint be drye, then
poure on more fre≈øh water, doe this ≈øo long till the flint will
fill up the gla≈øs, (for in a little time it will fill it up, and
become to be of the forme or figure of the gla≈ø≈øe) for it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
to it ≈øelfe the mucilaginou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the water, which
indeed is a ≈ølimy ≈øalti≈øh matter, and the true matter of Stones.
And thus thou ≈øhalt have that done by Art in few dayes,
which Nature would have been perfecting many yeares, and
indeed ju≈øt ≈øuch a flint as is produced in the Rivers. Any one
that ≈øhould ≈øee this flint in the gla≈ø≈øe would wonder how it
≈øhould come in there. You may break your gla≈ø≈øe and take

                     <head>The Spagyricall Anatomy of Wine.</head>
                     <p>I Shall not ≈øpeak here of the juice of grapes as being natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divided into Wine, Tartar, and Lees, but of Wine as arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
divided into pure Spirit, Flegm, and Feces.</p>
                     <p>1 The ≈øpirit is that hot, ≈øubtle, pure, clear, cordiall, and
bal≈øamicall ≈øub≈øtance, which ari≈øeth with a ≈ømall heat after four
or five di≈øtillations, being indeed but the twentieth part of the
Wine. This ≈øpirit is not that inebriating ≈øub≈øtance of the
Wine as mo≈øt think, for a man may drink the ≈øpirit that is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
out of ten pints of Wine without di≈øtempering of his br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at all, when as perhaps he would be di≈øtempered with drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a pint or two of the Wine.</p>
                     <p>Now this ≈øpirit contains in it a ≈øubtle Armoniack, and e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentiall
Sulphur in≈øeparably conjoined, which indeed are the
life of the ≈øpirit, and may be ≈øeparated from the Mercuriall or
watery part thereof, which after ≈øeparation of them remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpid,
but yet of wonderfull ≈øubtility. They may be ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thus: Fir≈øt rectifie the ≈øpirit as high as you can the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way: then rectifie it once or twice in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <figure/>
Note that if there be any flegm remaining in the ≈øpirit, it wil
go no further then the middle Receiver, e≈øpecially the ≈øecond
time. By this means thou ≈øhalt have ≈øo ≈øubtle a ≈øpirit, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs
it be kept in a ve≈ø≈øell clo≈øe ≈øtopt, it will flye away in the air.
Then take of this ≈øpirit two ounces, and poure it upon ≈øix
ounces of calcined Tartar before the ≈øalt be extracted, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
them well together; then di≈øtill it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and there will

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54827:65"/>
then put on a like quantity of the ≈øaid ≈øpirit, as before, and
di≈øtil it off, and thus do ≈øo long til the water that comes over is
not in≈øipid, but the ≈øpirit comes over again hot as it was poured
on: for by this time the fixed matter is glutted with the ≈øalt
Armoniack, and Sulphur of the ≈øpirit. Then put this dryed
matter into a gla≈ø≈øe ≈øublimatory, and put fire to it, and there
will ≈øublime a Salt from thence even as Camphire is ≈øublimed.
This ≈øalt is the true e≈ø≈øence of Wine indeed, and its vertues are
wonderful, for there is no di≈øea≈øe whether inward or outward
that can with≈øtand it. This is that e≈ø≈øence of Wine of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers,
which is ≈øo penetrating, ≈øo wonderful cordial and
bal≈øamical, which if thou doe≈øt once obtain, thou ≈øhalt need but
few other medicines.</p>
                     <p>Now this ≈øpirit or <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> is in all Vegetables, as you may
≈øee in Malt, and Vegetables that are put refied before they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtilled,
which then yeeld a burning ≈øpirit; yet it is in Wine
more then in any other Liquors: I ≈øay Liquors, for if you
take eight gallons of Sack, and as much Wheat, which is a ≈øolid
body, the Wheat being malted, will yeeld more <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> then
the Sack.</p>
                     <p>2 The flegm is that which remains after the ≈øpirit is di≈øtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off, and is a putrid, in≈øipid, cold, narcotick, and inebriating
Liquor, debilitating the ≈øtomach and offending the head. A few
≈øpoonfuls of this will pre≈øently make a man drunk, nay the
flegm of half a pint of Wine will make a man drunk, when as
two pints of Wine it ≈øelfe would hardly doe it: whence you
may collect what a great corrector of Malignant ≈øpirits, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
the ≈øpirit of Wine is; which, while≈øt it is mixed with the
flegm before di≈øtillation, doth temper and correct this inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
quality thereof, and as it doth thus, ≈øo al≈øo being given (I
mean the pure deflegmated ≈øpirit) to them that are already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebriated,
doth much allay their di≈øtemper. This flegm therefore
being of ≈øo narcotick a quality is the cau≈øe of Pal≈øies, and ≈øuch
like di≈øtempers.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is to be ob≈øerved that when this flegm is to be
di≈øtilled off, there remains at the bottom a vi≈øcous corro≈øive
matter, which by rea≈øon of its vi≈øco≈øity is the cau≈øe of ob≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and by rea≈øon of its corro≈øivene≈ø≈øe the cau≈øe of the gout,
colick, ≈øtone, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:54827:66"/>
3 This feces being di≈øtilled yeelds a ≈øharp ≈øpirit, and fetid
oyl, which leave behind them a ≈øalti≈øh ≈øub≈øtance, out of which
when the ≈øalt is extracted, there remains an in≈øipid earth.</p>
                     <p>Now if any ≈øhall object again≈øt what I have a≈ø≈øerted, and ≈øay
that <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or ≈øpirit of Wine are inebriating, the cau≈øes of
Palfie, ≈øtone, gout, colick, weak ≈øtomachs, and ≈øuch like: as we
≈øee by dayly experience in tho≈øe that are given to the drinking
of the≈øe Liquors: to which I an≈øwer it is true: but then I mu≈øt
di≈øtingui≈øh of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and ≈øpirit of Wine, for there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and ≈øpirit of Wine, of which al≈øo they make
Ani≈øeed water by putting a few Ani≈øeeds thereunto, and other
≈øuch like waters, as Clove, Angelica, Lemmon, &amp;c. With which
this Nation is mo≈øt abominably cheated, and their health im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.
But the≈øe are not rectified throughly, but three parts
of four of them are an in≈øipid Narcotick flegm, containing in
it the feces I ≈øpake of, all which I can in a day ≈øeparate from the
true pure ≈øpirit, which ≈øpirit rather prevents then cau≈øes ≈øuch
di≈øtempers: And the truth is, all the goodne≈ø≈øe of the Wine is
from this pure ≈øpirit.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54827:66"/>
of the naturall life in man, and according to this acception I
≈øhall here ≈øpeak of it: But before I ≈øhew you the proce≈ø≈øe I ≈øhall
give you an account why this Medicament is called <hi>Homunculus;</hi>
and it is this.</p>
                     <p>No wi≈øe man will deny that the ≈øtaffe of life is the nutriment
thereof, and that the chiefe≈øt nutriment is Bread and Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ordained by God and Nature above all other things for the
≈øu≈øtentation thereof. Be≈øides <hi>Paracel≈øus</hi> preferred this nutriment
for the generation of the bloud and ≈øpirits, and the forming
thence the Sperm of this <hi>Homunculus.</hi> Now by a ≈øutable allu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the nutriment is taken for the life of man, and e≈øpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
it is tran≈ømuted into life: and again the life is taken for the
man, for unle≈ø≈øe a man be alive he is not a man, but the carca≈ø≈øe
only of a man, and the ba≈øe≈øt part thereof, which cannot perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be taken for the whole man, as the noble≈øt part may. In as
much therefore as the nutriment, or aliment of life may be
called the life of man, and the life of man be called man; this
nutriment extracted out of Bread and Wine, and being by dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion
exalted into the highe≈øt purity of a nutritive ≈øub≈øtance,
and con≈øequently becoming the life of man, being ≈øo potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
may Metaphorically be called <hi>Homunculus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The proce≈ø≈øe, which in part ≈øhall be ≈øet down allegorically is
thus: Take the be≈øt Wheat and the be≈øt Wine, of each a like
quantity, put them into a gla≈ø≈øe, which you mu≈øt hermetically
clo≈øe: then let them putrefie in hor≈øe dung three days, or until
the Wheat begin to germinate, or to ≈øprout forth, which then
mu≈øt be taken forth and brui≈øed in a Mortar, and be pre≈ø≈øed
through a linnen cloth, and there will come forth a white juice
like milk; you mu≈øt ca≈øt away the feces: Let this juice be put
into a gla≈ø≈øe, which mu≈øt not be above half full; ≈øtop it clo≈øe and
≈øet it in hor≈øe dung as before, for the ≈øpace of fifty days. If the
heat be temperate, and not exceeding the naturall heat of a man,
the matter will be turned into a ≈øpagyricall bloud, and fle≈øh,
like an Embryo. This is the principal, and next matter, out of
which is generated a twofold ≈øperm, <hi>viz.</hi> of the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
generating the <hi>Homunculus,</hi> without which there can be
made no generation, whether humane, or animall.</p>
                     <p>From the bloud, and fle≈øh of this Embryo let the water be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54827:67"/>
≈øeparated in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and the air in a≈øhes, and both be kept by
them≈øelves. Then to the feces of the latter di≈øtillation let the
water of the former di≈øtillation be added, both which mu≈øt (the
gla≈ø≈øe being clo≈øe ≈øtopt) putrefie in <hi>Balneo</hi> the ≈øpace of ten days,
after this di≈øtill the water the ≈øecond time, (which is then the
vehiculum of the fir≈øt) together with the fire, in a≈øhes, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtill
off this water in a gentle <hi>Balneo,</hi> and in the bottom remains
the fire which mu≈øt be di≈øtilled in a≈øhes. Keep both the≈øe a part.
And thus you have the four Elements ≈øeparated from the Chaos
of the Embryo.</p>
                     <p>The feculent earth is to be reverberated in a clo≈øe ve≈ø≈øel for
the ≈øpace of four dayes: In the interim di≈øtil off the fourth part
of the fir≈øt di≈øtillation in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and ca≈øt it away; the other
three parts di≈øtill in a≈øhes, and pour it upon the reverberated
earth, and di≈øtill it in a ≈øtrong fire; cohobate it four times, and
≈øo you ≈øhall have a very clear water, which you mu≈øt keep by it
≈øelf: Then pour the air on the ≈øame earth, and di≈øtil it in a
≈øtrong fire, and there will come over a clear, ≈øplendid, odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
water, which mu≈øt be kept apart: After this pour the fire
upon the fir≈øt water, and putrefie them together in <hi>Balneo</hi> the
≈øpace of three days, then put them into a Retort and di≈øtil them
in ≈øand, and there will come over a water ta≈øting of the fire: let
this water be di≈øtilled in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and what di≈øtils off keep by it
≈øelf, as al≈øo what remains in the bottome, which is the fire, keep
by it ≈øelf. This la≈øt di≈øtilled water pour again upon its earth,
and let them be macerated together in <hi>Balneo</hi> for the ≈øpace of
three dayes, and then let all the water be di≈øtilled in ≈øand, and
let what will ari≈øe be ≈øeparated in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and the re≈øidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in the bottome be re≈øerved with the former re≈øidence.
Let the water be again poured upon the earth, be ab≈øtracted, and
≈øeparated as before, untill nothing remain in the bottom, which
is not ≈øeparated in <hi>Balneo.</hi> This being done, let the water which
was la≈øt ≈øeparated be mixed with the re≈øidue of its fire, and be
macerated in <hi>Balneo</hi> three or four dayes, and all be di≈øtilled in
<hi>Balneo,</hi> that can a≈øcend with that heat, and let what remains be
di≈øtilled in a≈øhes from the fire, and what ≈øhall be elevated is aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
and what remains in the bottome is fiery. The≈øe two la≈øt
Liquors are a≈øcribed to the two fir≈øt principles, the former to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54827:67"/>
Mercury, and the latter to Sulphur, and are accounted by <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel≈øus,</hi>
not as Elements, but their vitall parts, being as it were
the natural ≈øpirits and ≈øoul, which are in them by nature. Now
both are to be rectified, and reflected into their center with a
circular motion, that this Mercury may be prepared with its
water being kept clear, and odoriferous in the upper place, but
the Sulphur by it ≈øelf. Now it remains that we look into the
third principle: let the reverberated earth being ground upon
a marble imbibe its owne water, which did above remain after
the la≈øt ≈øeparation of the Liquors made in <hi>Balneo,</hi> ≈øo that this be
the fourth part of the weight of its earth, and be congealed by
the heat of a≈øhes into its earth, and let this be done ≈øo oft, the
proportion being ob≈øerved, untill the earth hath drunk up all
its water. And la≈øtly let this earth be ≈øublimed into a white
powder, as white as ≈ønow, the feces being ca≈øt away. This earth
being ≈øublimed and freed from its ob≈øcurity is the true Chaos
of the Elements, for it contains tho≈øe things occult, ≈øeeing it
is the ≈øalt of nature, in which they lye hid, being as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
in their center. This is the third principle of <hi>Paracel≈øus,</hi>
and the ≈øalt, which is the matrix, in which the two former
≈øperms, <hi>viz.</hi> of the man and woman, the parents of the <hi>Homun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,
viz.</hi> of Mercury and Sulphur, are to be put, and to be
clo≈øed up together in a glazen womb ≈øealed with <hi>Hermes</hi> ≈øeals
for the true generation of the <hi>Homunculus</hi> produced from the
≈øpagyricall Embryo: and this is the <hi>Homunculus</hi> or great Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
otherwi≈øe called the nutritive Medicament of <hi>Paracel≈øus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Homunculus</hi> or nutritive Medicament, is of ≈øuch vertue
that pre≈øently after it is taken into the body, it is turned into
bloud, and ≈øpirits. If then di≈øea≈øes prove mortall becau≈øe they

adde weight to Minerall, and Metalline bodies.</head>
                     <p>1. Take any Minerall Liquor and ≈øet it in an open ve≈ø≈øell in
the ≈øun for a good ≈øpace, and it will be augmented in quantity,
and weight. But ≈øome will ≈øay that this proceedeth from the
air: to the which I an≈øwer and demand, whether the air had not
this impregnation from the ≈øun, and what the air hath in it ≈øelf
that proceedeth not from the ≈øun and ≈øtars.</p>
                     <p>2. Put this liquor in a cold cellar, or in a moi≈øt air, and you
≈øhall find that it increa≈øeth not in weight, as it doth in the ≈øun,
or in the fire (which hath in this re≈øpect ≈øome analogie with the
≈øun) I do not ≈øay but haply it might attract ≈øome little moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture
which is ≈øoon exhaled by any ≈ømall heat:</p>
                     <p>3. Di≈ø≈øolve any ≈øulphurous, and imperfect metall, as Iron, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or Zinke, in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or any other acid ≈øpirit, then ab≈øtract
the Spirit from it, make it glowing hot, yet not too hot, that
the Spirit may only vapour away, then weigh this metalline
Calx, and ≈øet it in a crucible over the fire, but melt it not, only
let it darkly glow, let it ≈øtand ≈øo 3, or 4, weeks, then take it off,
and weigh it again, and you ≈øhall find it heavier then before.</p>
                     <p>4. Set any ≈øulphurous metall, as Iron, or Copper, with ≈øixteen
or eighteen parts of Lead on a te≈øt made with a≈øhes of wood, or
bones in a probatory furnace: fir≈øt weigh the te≈øt, copper and
lead before you put them into the furnace, let the iron or cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fly away with the lead, yet not with too ≈øtrong a heat, then
take the te≈øt out, and weigh it, and you ≈øhall finde it (though
the metals are gone) when it is cold to be heavier then it was
when it was put into the furnace with the metals. The que≈øtion
is now whence this heavine≈ø≈øe of all the afore≈øaid Minerals and
metals proceeded, if that the heat of the fun, and fire through the
help of the Mineralls and metals be not fixed into a palpable
Minerall, and Metalline body?</p>
                     <p>5. Set a te≈øt with lead, or copper in the ≈øun, and with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
gla≈ø≈øe unite the beames of the ≈øun, and let them fall on the
center of the metall, hold the concave gla≈ø≈øe in your hand, and
let your te≈øt never be cold, and this will be as well done in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54827:77"/>
≈øun, as in the fire. But this concave mu≈øt be two foot in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
and not too hollow or deep, but about the eighteenth or
twentieth part of the circle, that it may the better ca≈øt its beams
forth, and it mu≈øt be very well poli≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>6. Calcine Antimony with a burning gla≈ø≈øe, and you ≈øhall
≈øee it ≈ømoak, and fume, and be made dryer then before, yet weigh
it and it will be heavier then before.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øhall take in, for the confirmation of all this, a relation of
Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby</hi> concerning the precipitating of the ≈øun beams.
I remember (≈øaith he) a rare experiment that a Noble man of
much ≈øincerity, and a ≈øingular friend of mine, told me he had
≈øeen, w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> was, that by means of gla≈ø≈øes made in a very particular
manner, and artificially placed one by another, he had ≈øeen the
≈øun beames gathered together, and precipitated down into
a browni≈øh, or purpli≈øh red powder. There (≈øaith he) could be
no fallacy in this operation. For nothing what≈øoever, was in
the gla≈ø≈øe, when they were placed, and di≈øpo≈øed for this intent;
and it mu≈øt be in the hot time of the yeare, el≈øe the effect would
not follow. And of this magi≈øtery he could gather ≈øome dayes
neer 2. ounces in a day, and it was of a ≈øtrong volatile vertue, and
would impre≈ø≈øe it ≈øpirituall quality into gold it ≈øelfe (the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie≈øt
and mo≈øt fixed body we conver≈øe withall) in a very ≈øhort
time.</p>
                     <p>I leave it now to the reader to judge whether the beames of the
≈øun, and heat of the fire adde weight to Minerals, and Metals.</p>

                     <head>An artificiall hot Bath, from the ≈øame principles as
the naturall Bath is.</head>
                     <p>Before I ≈øet down the proce≈ø≈øe of making an artificiall hot
Bath, I ≈øhall premi≈øe ≈øome things concerning the true nature
and originall of a hot Bath. Now the cleare≈øt and be≈øt account
that I ever heard or read, of the cau≈øe of the heat in Bathes is that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54827:86"/>
which is given by <hi>Moun≈øier de Rochas,</hi> and that in a demon≈øtrative
way; His words are the≈øe. As I was (≈øaith he) with ≈øome of my
companions wandring in <hi>Savoy,</hi> I found in the valley of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerne</hi>
betwixt the Alps a hot ≈øpring; I began to con≈øider the
cau≈øe of this heat, and whereas the vulgar opinion is, that the
heat of fountains is from mountains fired within, I ≈øaw rea≈øon
to think the contrary, becau≈øe I ≈øaw ≈ønow upon a mountaine
from whence this hot ≈øpring came, unmelted, which could not
po≈ø≈øibly but have been di≈ø≈øolved by the hot fumes of the
mountains, had they been fired. Whereupon being un≈øatisfied
I with my companions and other labourers (whom I could ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hardly per≈øwade to undertake ≈øuch a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe by rea≈øon they
were affraid that fire would thereupon breake forth out of the
ground and con≈øume us) got tools and ≈øet upon digging to
find out the true cau≈øe of the heat of this fountain. After we
had digged 15. dayes (having before perceived the water to be
hotter and hotter by degrees as we came neerer to the ≈øource)
we came to the originall of the heat, where was a great ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
In three houres more we digged beyond this place of
ebullition and perceived the water to be cold, yet in the ≈øame
continued ≈øtream with the other that was hot: upon this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wonder much at the rea≈øon of the≈øe things. Then I
carryed to my lodging ≈øome of this hot water (which was both
≈øalti≈øh and acid) and evaporated it, and of forty ounces I
had in the bottome five drams of ≈øalti≈øh matter, which I then
yet farther purified, and extracted thence three drams of pure
nitrous Hermetick ≈øalt; the other two ounces being a ≈ølimie ≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous
≈øub≈øtance. Yet with this I was not ≈øatisfied, but with
my labourers went again to the place, and digged twelve days
more, and then we came to a water which was in≈øipid as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
fountain Water, yet ≈øtill in a continued ≈øtream with the
≈øalti≈øh and hot water. At this I wondered much, whereupon I
digged up ≈øome of the earth where the cold, and ≈øalti≈øh ≈øtream
runned, &amp; carried it home with me, and our of a hundred weight
thereof, I extracted a good quantity of nitrous ≈øalt, which was
almo≈øt fluxile. When I had extracted as much as I could, I laid
the earth a≈øide, and in 24. houres it was all covered over
with ≈øalt, which I extracted, and out of a hundred weight of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54827:87"/>
this earth which I call virgin earth, I had four pound of this
kind of ≈øalt which is contracted in the afore≈øaid 24. houres:
and ≈øo it would doe con≈øtantly. Now this ≈øatisfied me concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
one doubt: for before I was un≈øatisfied how there could
be a con≈øtant ≈øupply of that ≈øalt which made the water ≈øalti≈øh,
≈øeeing there was but a little di≈øtance betwixt the in≈øipid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and the hot water, and the con≈øtant ≈øtream of water wa≈øhed
away the ≈øalt which was in that little ≈øpace: for I perceived
that this kind of earth attracts this univer≈øall ≈øalt of the world
partly from the aire in the cavities of the earth, and partly
from the vapours that con≈øtantly pa≈ø≈øe through the earth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this I tooke ≈øome of that earth where the ebullition was,
and carried it home, and proved it, and I perceived it to be a
≈øulphur mine, into which the former acid ≈øalti≈øh water pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
cau≈øed an ebullition, as doe ≈øalt of Tartar, and Spirit
of Vitriall being mixed together, and al≈øo water poured on
un≈ølaked lime. After this I began to que≈øtion how it was
that this ≈øulphur mine was not con≈øumed, ≈øeeing ≈øo much
matter pa≈ø≈øeth from it daily: but when I began to under≈øtand
how all things in the earth did a≈ø≈øimilate to them≈øelves what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever
was of any kind of affinity to them, as Mines convert the
tooles of miners into their owne ≈øub≈øtance in a little time,
and ≈øuch like experiments of that nature, I was ≈øatisfied. And
after all this I under≈øtood how this univer≈øall ≈øalt of the
world was to be had, and I could at any time mix it with water,
and pour that water upon ≈øulphur, and ≈øo make an artificiall
hot bath as good as any naturall bath what≈øoever. Note that
no ≈øalt in the world but this nitrous ≈øalt will do it, as I
often tryed: And this ≈øalt is to be found in all hot bathes,
and to be prepared artificially. Thus farre <hi>Moun≈øeur de
Rochas.</hi> Something like unto this <hi>Helmont</hi> ≈øeems to hold forth,
≈øaying that there is a <hi>Primum ens ≈øalium,</hi> or <hi>≈øemina ≈øalium,</hi> which
are all ≈øeated in waters and vapours and give them an acidity,
but as yet have no ≈øaline ta≈øt, untill they meet with ≈øuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and be received into certain matrixes in the earth which
may make them put forth this potentiall ≈øaltne≈ø≈øe into act:
and according to this diver≈øity of places that this water or
vapours, being impregnated with tho≈øe ≈øeeds of ≈øalt, goe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54827:87"/>
through, ari≈øeth the diver≈øity of ≈øalts, as Alum, ≈øea-≈øalt, Nitre,
&amp;c. Then upon this account the earth through which the cold,
acid, ≈øalti≈øh water above≈øaid run through, did ≈øpecificate that
potentiall ≈øalt which was both in the water, and vapours, into a
nitrous ≈øalt, (by which meanes was that kind of ≈øalt in that
place) but whether this <hi>primum ens ≈øalium</hi> be ≈øo un≈øpecificated, or
<hi>quid Hermaphroditicum</hi> as he a≈ø≈øerts, or no, it matters not much
to my purpo≈øe; it ≈øufficeth if that earth through which that
acid nitrous water runs, attracts and multiplies an acid nitrous
≈øalt, with which the water being impregnated, and running
through a ≈øulphurous mine cau≈øeth an ebullition. All this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
premi≈øed, I ≈øhall now endeavor to illu≈øtrate how nature may
in this be imitated, as that an artificiall hot bath may be made
by ≈øuch like principles, as the naturall hot bath con≈øi≈øts of, being
artificially prepared.</p>
                     <p>Now the≈øe principles are the ≈øulphur mine, and the acid ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
≈øalt; the former requires no further preparation (as ≈øaith
<hi>Moun≈øeur de Rochas,</hi>) if it be pure: the latter is to be prepared
two manner of wayes: for either it is to be extracted, as ≈øaith
the afore≈øaid author, out of the waters of the bath by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
them away, or by conden≈øing the nitrous aire (for
indeed as many judicious philo≈øophers are of opinion, the air
is wholly nitrous, as it appears by the conden≈øation of it in cold
places into Nitre) which his virgins earth did doe, into a ≈øalt,
which was acid, and almo≈øt fluxil. Now when I ≈øay that
the nitrous ≈øalt is to be thus prepared, I do not ≈øay that this
is the full preparation thereof, for indeed it is yet further to be
prepared, and that is by giving it a greater acidity. I que≈øtion
much whether or no the ≈øalt being prepared after the afore≈øaid
wayes do retaine that acidity which is required for that ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
I ≈øpake of, and which the nitrous acid water had before it
came to the Mine of Sulphur. For indeed the afore≈øaid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
when he affirmed that he could at any time make an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
hot bath, did not ≈øay he u≈øed the ≈øalt prepared only after
the 2. former wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> by extracting it out of the waters of
the bath, and making it with his virgin earth which did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and conden≈øe the nitrou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the aire, but withall
by making it ≈øo acid that it might cau≈øe an ebullition when it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54827:88"/>
came to be joyned with a ≈øulphur Mine. Now then how to
give this Nitre a ≈øufficient acidity is the great que≈øtion. For
the better effecting of this we mu≈øt con≈øider whence that ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
water (above mentioned) in the earth had the greate≈øt
part of its acidity. As to that, it mu≈øt be remembred that the
virgin earth through which the acid nitrous water did run, did
conden≈øe the nitrous air or vapours into a nitrous ≈øalt, and
withall it is to be con≈øidered that before this nitrous aire or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
before it be conden≈øed, even when it is neer unto conden≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is acid, and part of it before conden≈øation is mixed with the
water, and ≈øo renders it acid. Now that waters have great
part of their acidity from the acid vapours of acid Mineralls
both <hi>Henricus ab Heers,</hi> and <hi>Jordan</hi> upon Minerall waters affirme:
and that ≈øalts unbodied, are far more acid then when they have
a≈ø≈øumed a body, is clearly manife≈øt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that ≈øpirits of
≈øalts, which I call ≈øalts unbodied becau≈øe they have lo≈øt their
body, are become very acid becau≈øe unbodied; if ≈øo in Spirits
that have lo≈øt their bodies, why not after ≈øome proportion in
tho≈øe that have not yet a≈ø≈øumed a body, as vapours of Nitre, or
nitrous air being neer to congelation, and bodying, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnant
with Spirits of Nitre?</p>
                     <p>Now I ≈øay that nitrous vapours, or nitrous air being a ≈øalt
unbodied, are not ≈øo acid as Spirits of Nitre, becau≈øe they are
more phlegmatick and crude, which flegme they lo≈øe by being
congealed into a ≈øalt: yet for all this, they are far more acid then
the body of ≈øalt: and this is that which <hi>Helmont</hi> under≈øtands,
when he ≈øaith that the e≈øurine ≈øalt being incorporificated is far
more active, in giving ta≈øt and odour then when it hath received
its body by becoming a ≈øpecificated ≈øalt. Furthermore how
Nitre ≈øhall become ≈øufficiently acid for the afore≈øaid operation
is the great matter to be required into. We mu≈øt therefore con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which way we may unbody Nitre (≈øeeing it is ≈øcar≈øe po≈ø≈øible
to get it before it hath received its body) and that is done two
wayes, either by forcing of it into a mo≈øt ≈øharp Spirit, which is
too acid for our inten≈øion, or by dige≈øting the whole ≈øub≈øtance
of Nitre into a Liquor moderately acid, which indeed ≈øerves for
our purpo≈øe, and the proce≈ø≈øe is this.</p>
                     <p>Take the pure≈øt Nitre you can get, di≈ø≈øolve it in rain water
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54827:88"/>
≈øo as that the water imbibe as much of it as it can. Then put
this nitrous water into a common earthen ve≈ø≈øell unglazed,
which you mu≈øt ≈øet in a cellar. You ≈øhall ≈øee this ve≈ø≈øell in a ≈øhort
time to be white all over on the out≈øide as with a hoar fro≈øt,
which whitene≈ø≈øe is partly the flowers of the Nitre being the
pure≈øt part thereof penetrating the ve≈ø≈øell, and partly the nitrous
aire conden≈øed into Nitre by the coldne≈ø≈øe of the ve≈ø≈øell, as al≈øo
a≈ø≈øimilated to the Nitre that penetrated the ve≈ø≈øell. I ≈øaid by the
coldne≈ø≈øe of the ve≈ø≈øel, becau≈øe ≈øuch is the coldne≈ø≈øe of an earthen
ve≈ø≈øell wherein is Nitre, di≈ø≈øolved in water, that it will being ≈øet
in ≈ønow by the fire ≈øide forthwith be freezed. This Nitre you
mu≈øt ≈øtrike off with a feather, and when you have a ≈øufficient
quantity thereof, as three or four pound, put this, or the nitrous
≈øalt extracted from bath-waters into a bolt head of gla≈ø≈øe, (a
pound in each bolt head) that two parts of three be empty, nip
it up, and ≈øet it in a≈øhes, and give it a rea≈øonable ≈øtrong fire, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the upper part of the boul of the bolt head be as hot, as that
you can but well ≈øuffer your hand upon it, and you ≈øhall ≈øee that
the Nitre will be di≈ø≈øolved every day a little, and in 2. or 3.
moneths time be wholly di≈ø≈øolved, and become acid, but not ≈øo
acid as the Spirit thereof; then put it into a gla≈ø≈øe gourd with
a head, and di≈øtill it off, and in the bottome you ≈øhall find an
acid nitrous ≈øalt almo≈øt fluxil, not unlike the ≈øalt which <hi>Moun≈øeur
de Rochas</hi> found in the evaporating of this water. Then pour the
di≈øtilled Nitre water upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the ≈øaid ≈øalt, &amp; then it is for your u≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The u≈øe of the≈øe principles or ingredients is this, <hi>viz.</hi> make
fountaine water ≈øufficiently acid with this nitrous Liquor, then
pour it upon a ≈øufficient quantity of the be≈øt Sulphur Mine, or
Sulphur vivum in a large wooden ve≈ø≈øell where the patient is
to be bathed, and you will ≈øee the water pre≈øently heated ≈øo
hot as the patient is able to beare.</p>
                     <p>The inward u≈øe of the≈øe bath-waters is by rea≈øon of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
in them, to di≈ø≈øolve gro≈ø≈øe humours, open ob≈øtructions,
clean≈øe the kidneys and bladder, and by rea≈øon of the ≈øulphur
to dry, mollifie, di≈øcu≈ø≈øe, and glutinate, and to help all uterine
effects proceeding from cold and windy humours.</p>
                     <p>Note that they mu≈øt be drunk warme, and in a good quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or el≈øe they will do more hurt then good.</p>

                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54827:89"/>
The outward u≈øe of this is for ≈øuch ill effects as are in the

to give order and directions for all the circum≈øtances about it:

                     <p>It is granted by all, that Tunbridge Water proceeds from an

and vitriolated ta≈øt and odour, ≈øeeing upon evaporation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there remains little or no vitriall or ≈øalt of iron at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
is the great que≈øtion; Now for the ≈øolution of this, we
mu≈øt con≈øider how many wayes a ≈øubterraneall minerall, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
may communicate its acidity to waters, and that ≈øaith
<hi>Henricus ab Heers,</hi> upon Spaw-waters, it doth three wayes: one,
when the water pa≈ø≈øing through the mines, carryeth along with
it ≈øome of the di≈ø≈øoluble parts of the mine, to which is con≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
the ≈øaying of <hi>Ari≈øtotle: Such are waters, as is the nature of tho≈øe
Mines through which they pa≈ø≈øe,</hi> as al≈øo of <hi>Galen</hi> when he ≈øaith, that
<hi>pure water pa≈ø≈øing through Minerall Mines carry with them ≈øome of the
≈øubstance of the Mines.</hi> The ≈øecond way is when the vapours ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing
from ≈øermented Mineralls and Metalls, are mixed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Now that vapours retain the odour, and ta≈øt of tho≈øe
things, from whence they are rai≈øed, <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> in his fourth Book
<hi>Sublimium</hi> affirms, and al≈øo <hi>Helmont</hi> when he ≈øaith <hi>that ≈øome parts of
the iron Mines being by fermentation turned into a vapour retain the odor
and ta≈øt of the Mine by vertue of the acid e≈øurine ≈øalt, and are not pre≈øently
reduced into a body, and al≈øo artificiall vapours of the iron Mines have
more vertue, &amp; activity, (I mean tho≈øe parts that are rai≈øed by a ≈øtrong fire
in a furnace from the Mine of iron) then iron it ≈øelfe when it is melted.</hi>
The third is, when a great quantity of vapours ari≈øing from the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54827:89"/>
afore≈øaid fermented Mines is elevated, and by the coldne≈ø≈øe of
the ambient earth is turned into an acid water, which as it pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth
through the earth meeteth with ≈øome ≈øprings of water, and
mixing with them gives them a plea≈øant acidity. And this is
the be≈øt of all acid wtaers being clear and very pure.</p>
                     <p>This being premi≈øed I ≈øhall now proceed to the proce≈ø≈øe of

of the former <hi>viz. Tunbridge</hi> thus;</p>
                     <p>Take of the Mine, or ore of iron, beat it very ≈ømal, and put it
into the furnace expre≈ø≈øed page 83. and there will come forth an
acid Spirit, and flowers, which you mu≈øt mix together till the
acid Spirit extracts the ≈øalt out of the flowers, then decant off
the clear liquor which will have a ≈øtrong ta≈øt and ≈ømel of iron.</p>
                     <p>A few drops of this Liquor put into a gla≈ø≈øe full of fountaine

                     <p>It openeth all ob≈øtructions, purgeth by urine, clean≈øeth the

of the urine, and difficulty of making water, it allayeth all ≈øharp

≈øtrengtheneth the ≈øtomach, and liver &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Note that fountaine water being made moderately acid with

but by degrees, and after the taking of it moderate exerci≈øe is to

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall fir≈øt endeavour to ≈øhew whence Gold had its
originall, and what the matter thereof is. As
Nature (≈øaith <hi>Sandivogius</hi>) is in the will of God,
and God created her: ≈øo nature made for her ≈øelfe
a ≈øeed, (<hi>i.</hi>) her will in the elements. Now ≈øhe
indeed is one, yet ≈øhe brings forth divers things; but ≈øhe
operates nothing without a Sperme: what≈øoever the Sperme
will, nature operates, for ≈øhe is as it were the in≈øtrument of
any artificers. The Sperme therefore of every thing is
better, and more profitable then nature her ≈øelf: for thou
≈øhalt from nature without a Sperme, doe as much as a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ømith
without fire, or a husband without grain or ≈øeed.
Now the Sperme of any thing is the Elixir, the bal≈øame of
≈øulphur, and the ≈øame as <hi>Humidum Radicale</hi> is in metalls: but to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54827:93"/>
proceed to what concernes our purpo≈øe. Four elements gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
a Sperme, by the will of God, and imagination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
For as the Sperme of a man hath its center, or the
ve≈ø≈øell of its ≈øeed in the kidneys: ≈øo the foure elements by their
inde≈øinent motion (every one according to its quality) ca≈øt
forth a Sperme into the center of the earth, where it is dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted,
and by motion is ≈øent abroad. Now the center of the
earth is a certaine empty place, where nothing can re≈øt: and
the four elements ≈øend forth their qualities into the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the center. As a male ≈øends forth his ≈øeed into the
womb of the female, which after it hath received a due porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ca≈øts out the re≈øt, ≈øo it happens in the center of the earth,
that the magnetick powder of a part of any place attracts ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
convenient to it ≈øelfe for the bringing forth of ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and the re≈øt is ca≈øt forth into ≈øtones and other excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For every thing hath its originall from this fountain,
and there is nothing in the world produced but by this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
as for example, ≈øet upon an even table a ve≈ø≈øell of water,
which may be placed in the middle thereof, and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it ≈øet divers things, and divers colours, al≈øo ≈øalt, &amp;c. eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing by it ≈øelfe: then poure the water into the middle; and
you ≈øhall ≈øee the water to run every way, and when any ≈øtreame
toucheth the red colour, it will be made red by it, if the
≈øalt, it will contract the ta≈øt of ≈øalt from it, and ≈øo of the re≈øt;
Now the water doth not change the places, but the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity
of places changeth the water. In like manner the ≈øeed
or ≈øperme being ca≈øt forth by the foure elements from the
center of the earth unto the ≈øuperficies thereof pa≈ø≈øeth through
various places, and according to the nature of the place is any
thing produced: if it come to a pure place of earth, and water,
a pure thing is made.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øeed, and ≈øperme of all things is but one, and yet
it generates divers things, as it appears by the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The ≈øperme while≈øt it is in the center is indifferent to
all forms, but when it is come into any determinate place,
it changeth no more its forme. The ≈øperme while≈øt it is in the
center can as ea≈øily produce a tree, as a metall, and an hearb as a
≈øtone, and one more precious then another according to the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54827:93"/>
purity of the place. Now this ≈øperme is produced of elements
thus. The≈øe foure elements are never quiet but by rea≈øon of
their contrariety mutually act one upon another; and every
one of its ≈øelfe ≈øends forth its own ≈øubtilty, and they agree in
the center. Now in this center is the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> the ≈øervant of
nature, which mixing tho≈øe ≈øpermes together ≈øends them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and by di≈øtillation ≈øublimes them by the heat of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
motion unto the ≈øuperficies of the earth: For the earth
is porous, and this vapour (or wind, as the philo≈øophers call
it) is by di≈øtilling through the pores of the earth re≈øolved into
water, of which all things are produced. Let therefore as I ≈øaid
before, all ≈øons of Art know that the ≈øperme of metals is not
different from the ≈øperme of all things being, <hi>viz.</hi> a humid va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.
Therefore in vain do Arti≈øts endeavour the reduction of
metals into their fir≈øt matter, which is only a vapour. Now ≈øaith
<hi>Bernard Trevi≈øan</hi> when philo≈øophers ≈øpeak of a fir≈øt matter they
did not meane this vapour, but the ≈øecond matter which is an
unctuous water, which to us is the fir≈øt, becau≈øe we never find the
former. Now the ≈øpecification of this vapour into di≈øtinct metals
is thus. This vapour pa≈ø≈øeth in its di≈øtillation through the
earth, through places either cold, or hot; if through hot, and
pure where the fatne≈ø≈øe of ≈øulphur ≈øticks to the ≈øides thereof,
then that vapour (which philo≈øophers call the Mercury of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers)
mixeth, and joyneth it ≈øelf unto that fatne≈ø≈øe, which
afterward it ≈øublimes with it ≈øelfe, and then it becomes, leaving
the name of a vapour, and unctuo≈øity, which afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by ≈øublimation into other places, which the antecedent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
did purge, where the earth is ≈øubtle, pure, and humid, fils
the pores thereof, and is joyned to it; and ≈øo it becomes gold:
and where it is hot, and ≈øomething impure, ≈øilver. But if
that fatne≈ø≈øe come to impure places, which are cold, it is made
lead: and if that place be pure and mixed with ≈øulphur, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
copper: for by how much the more pure and warm
the place is, ≈øo much the more excellent doth it make the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls.</p>
                     <p>Now this fir≈øt matter of metals is a humid, vi≈øcous, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øtible,
≈øubtle ≈øub≈øtance, incorporated with an earthy ≈øubtilty,
being equally, and ≈øtrongly mixed <hi>per minima</hi> in the caverns of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54827:94"/>
the earth. But as in many things there is a twofold unctuo≈øity
(whereof one is as it were internall, retained in the center of
the thing le≈øt it ≈øhould be de≈øtroyed by fire, which cannot be
without the de≈øtruction of the ≈øub≈øtance it ≈øelfe wherein it is:
the other as it were externall, feculent and combu≈øtible) ≈øo in
all metalls except gold, there is a twofold unctuo≈øity: the one
which is externall, ≈øulphurous, and inflamable, which is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to it by accident, and doth not belong to the totall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the terre≈øtrial parts of the thing: the other is internall,
and very ≈øubtle, incombu≈øtible, becau≈øe it is of the ≈øub≈øtantiall
compo≈øition of <hi>Argent vive,</hi> and therefore cannot be de≈øtroyed
by fire, unle≈ø≈øe with the de≈øtruction of the whole ≈øub≈øtance,
whence it appeares what the cau≈øe is that metalls are more or
le≈ø≈øe durable in the fire: For tho≈øe which abound with that
internall unctuo≈øity are le≈ø≈øe con≈øumed, as it appears in ≈øilver,
and e≈øpecially in gold. Hence <hi>Ro≈øarius</hi> ≈øaith, the philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
could never by any meanes find out any thing that could
endure the fire; but that unctuous humidity only which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and incombu≈øtible. <hi>Geber</hi> al≈øo a≈ø≈øerts the ≈øame, when he
≈øaith that imperfect bodies have ≈øuperfluous humidities, and
≈øulphureity generating a combu≈øtible blackne≈ø≈øe in them, and
corrupting them; they have al≈øo an impure, feculent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øtible
tere≈øtriety ≈øo gro≈ø≈øe, as that it hinders ingre≈ø≈øion, and
fu≈øion: but a perfect metall, as gold, hath neither this ≈øulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
or terre≈øtriall impurity; I mean when it is fully matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and melted, for while≈øt it is in concoction it hath both
joyned to it, as you may ≈øee in the golden Ore, but when they
doe not adhere to it ≈øo, but that it may be purified from
them, which other metalls cannot, but are both de≈øtroyed
together if you attempt to ≈øeparate the one from the other:
Be≈øides gold hath ≈øo little of the≈øe corruptible principles mixed
with it, that the inward ≈øulphur or metalline ≈øpirit doth
≈øometimes and in ≈øome places overcome them of it ≈øelfe, as we
may ≈øee in the gold which is found very pure ≈øometimes in
the ≈øuperficies of the earth, and in the ≈øea ≈øands, and is many
times as pure as any refined gold.</p>
                     <p>Now this gold which is found in ≈øands and rivers, is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
there, as ≈øaith <hi>Gregorius Agricola</hi> in his third book <hi>de
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54827:94"/>
Re Metallica,</hi> but is wa≈øhed down from the mountains with
fountaines that run from thence. There is al≈øo a flaming gold
found (as <hi>Paracel≈øus</hi> ≈øaith) in the tops of mountaines, which is
indeed ≈øeparated of it ≈øelfe from all impurities, and is as pure
as any refined gold what≈øoever. So that you ≈øee, that gold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it had an extrin≈øecall ≈øulphur and earth mixed with it,
yet it is ≈øometimes ≈øeparated from it of it ≈øelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> by that fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
≈øpirit that is in it. Now this pure gold (as ≈øaith <hi>Sandivogius</hi>)
nature would have perfected into an elixir but was hindred
by the crude air, which crude air is indeed nothing el≈øe but
that extrin≈øecall ≈øulphur which it meets with and is joyned to
in the earth, and which fills with its violence the pores
thereof, and hinders the activity of the Spirit thereof;
and this is that pri≈øon which the ≈øulphur (as ≈øaith the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore≈øaid
author) is locked up in, ≈øo that it cannot act upon its
body, <hi>viz.</hi> Mercury, and concoct it into the ≈øeed of gold; as
otherwi≈øe it would doe: and this is that darke body (as faith
<hi>Penotus</hi>) that is interpo≈øed betwixt the philo≈øophicall Sunne
and Moone, and keeps off the influences of the one from the
other. Now if any skilfull philo≈øopher could wittily ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
this adventitious impurity from gold while≈øt it is yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
he would ≈øet ≈øulphur at liberty, and for this his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he would be gratified with three kingdomes, <hi>viz.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,
Animall, and Minerall, I mean he could remove that
great ob≈øtruction which hinders gold from being dige≈øted into
the Elixir. For, as ≈øaith <hi>Sandivogius,</hi> the Elixir, or Tincture of
philo≈øophers, is nothing el≈øe but gold dige≈øted into the highe≈øt
degree: for the gold of the vulgar is as an hearb without ≈øeed,
but when gold (<hi>i.</hi>) living gold (for common gold never can by
rea≈øon that the Spirits are bound up, and indeed as good as
dead and not po≈ø≈øibly to be reduced to that activity which is
required for the producing of the ≈øperme of gold) is ripened it
gives a ≈øeed, which multiplies even <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
of this barrenne≈ø≈øe of gold that it produceth not a ≈øeed is
the afore≈øaid crude aire, <hi>viz.</hi> impurities: You may ≈øee this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øtrated
by this example.</p>
                     <p>We ≈øee that Orenge-trees in <hi>Polonia</hi> doe grow like other

any fruit, becau≈øe they are oppre≈ø≈øed with cold: but if at any
time nature be wittily and ≈øweetly helped, then Art can perfect
what nature could not. After the ≈øame manner it is in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls;
for gold would yeeld fruit, and ≈øeed in which it might
multiply it ≈øelfe, if it were helped by the indu≈øtry of the
skilfull arti≈øt, who knew how to promote nature, (<hi>i.</hi>) to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the≈øe ≈øulphurous and earthly impurities from gold.
For there is a ≈øufficient heat in living gold, which if it were
≈øtirred up by extrin≈øecall heat, to dige≈øt it into a ≈øeed. By ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin≈øecall
heat I doe not mean the heat of the cele≈øtiall Sun,
but that heat which is in the earth and ≈øtirres up the ≈øeed,
(<hi>i.</hi>) the living ≈øpirit that is in all ≈øubteraneall ≈øperms to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply,
and indeed makes gold become gold. Now this is a heat
of putrefaction occa≈øioned by acid ≈øpirits fermenting in the
earth, as you may ≈øee by this example related by <hi>Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
but to which the rea≈øon was given by <hi>Sandivogius.</hi> There
was ≈øaith the former author, certaine graines of gold found
betwixt the teeth of a dead man in the grave: wherefore he
conceived there was a power in the body of man to make

the latter authour: for ≈øaith he, <hi>Argent vive</hi> was by ≈øome phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitian
conveyed into the body of this man when he was alive, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by unction, or by turbith, or ≈øome ≈øuch way, as the cu≈øtome
was; and it is the nature of Mercury to a≈øcend to the mouth
of the patient, and through the excoriation of the mouth to
be avoided with the flegme. Now then if in ≈øuch a cure the
≈øickman dyed, that Mercury not having pa≈ø≈øage out remained
betwixt the teeth in the mouth, and that carca≈ø≈øe became the
naturall ve≈ø≈øell of Mercury, and ≈øo for a long time being ≈øhut
up was congealed by its proper ≈øulphur into gold by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
heat of putrefaction, being purified by the corro≈øive flegme
of the carka≈ø≈øe, but if the minerall Mercury had not been
brought in thither, gold had never been produced there: And
this is a mo≈øt true example that as mercury is by the proper ≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
that is in it ≈øelfe, being ≈øtirred up and helped by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin≈øecall
heat, coagulated into gold, unle≈ø≈øe it be hindred by

any accident, or have not a requi≈øite extrin≈øecall heat, or
convenient place, ≈øo al≈øo that nature doth in the bowels of
the earth produce of Mercury only gold and ≈øilver, and other
metalls according to the di≈øpo≈øition of the place, and matrix;
which a≈ø≈øertion is further cleared by the rule of reduction, for
if it be true that all things con≈øi≈øt of that which they may be
reduced into, then gold con≈øi≈øts of Mercury, becau≈øe (as mo≈øt
grant, <hi>Paracel≈øus</hi> affirmes, and many at this day profe≈ø≈øe they
can doe) it may be reduced into it. There is a way by which
the tincture of gold which is the ≈øoule thereof, and fixeth it,
may be ≈øo fully extracted that the remaining ≈øub≈øtance will
be ≈øublimed like Ar≈øenick, and may be as ea≈øily reduced into
Mercury as Sublimate. If ≈øo, and if all Mercury may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into a tran≈øparent water, as it may (according to the
proce≈ø≈øe ≈øet down page 75. and as I know how another better

I know, or care to know, together with what may be produced
thence, and ≈øhall crave leave to be ≈øilent in) why may not that
water in ≈øome ≈øen≈øe, if it be well rectified, be called a kinde
of living gold out of which you may perhaps make a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,

now from what is premi≈øed that the immediate matter
of gold is probably Mercury, and not certaine ≈øalts and I know
not what as many dream of, and that the extrin≈øecall heat is
from within the earth, and not the heat of the ≈øun, as ≈øome

and extrin≈øecall heat, and the matter of gold is, I ≈øhall next
endeavour to explaine what tho≈øe three principles are, <hi>viz.</hi>
Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, of which <hi>Argent vive,</hi> and gold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt:
Know therefore that after Nature had received from the mo≈øt
High God the priviledge of all things upon the Monarchy
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54827:96"/>
of this wourld, ≈øhe began to di≈øtribute places, and provinces to
every thing, according to its dignity; and in the fir≈øt place did
con≈øtitute the foure elements to be the princes of the world,
and that the will of the mo≈øt High (in who≈øe will Nature is
placed) might be fulfilled, ordained that they ≈øhould act upon
one another ince≈ø≈øantly. The fire therefore began to act upon
the aire, and produced ≈øulphur: The air al≈øo began to act upon
the water, and produced Mercury: the water al≈øo began to act
upon the earth, and produced ≈øalt. Now the earth not having
whereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to act produced nothing, but became the ≈øubject of what
was produced. So then there were produced three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but our ancient philo≈øophers not ≈øo ≈øtrictly con≈øidering the
matter de≈øcribed only two acts of the elements, and ≈øo named
but two principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Sulphur and Mercury: or el≈øe they
were willing to be ≈øilent in the other, ≈øpeaking only to the
≈øon of Art.</p>
                     <p>The Sulphur therefore of philo≈øophers, (which indeed is
the ≈øulphur of metalls, and of all things) is not, as many
think, that common combu≈øtible ≈øulphur which is ≈øold in
≈øhops, but is another thing farre differing from that, and is
incombu≈øtible, not burning, nor heating, but pre≈øerving, and
re≈øtoring all things which it is in, and it is the <hi>Calidum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum</hi>
of every thing, the fire of nature, the created light, and
of the nature of the fun, and is called the Sun; ≈øo that what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in any thing is fiery, and airy, is ≈øulphur, not that any
thing is wholly ≈øulphureous, but what in it is mo≈øt thin, and
≈øubtle, having the e≈ø≈øence of the naturall fire, and the nature of
the created light, which indeed is that ≈øulphur which wi≈øe
philo≈øophers have in all ages with great diligence endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to extract, and with its proper Mercury to fix, and ≈øo to
perfect the great Magi≈øtery of nature. Now of all things in the
world there is nothing hath more of this ≈øulphur in it then
gold and ≈øilver, but e≈øpecially gold, in≈øomuch that oftentimes
it is called ≈øulphur, (<hi>i.</hi>) becau≈øe ≈øulphur is the mo≈øt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and excellent principle in it, and being in it more then in
all things be≈øides.</p>
                     <p>Mercury is not here taken for common <hi>Argent vive;</hi> but
it is the <hi>Humidum Radicale</hi> of every thing, that pure aqueous,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54827:96"/>
unctuous, and vi≈øcous humidity of the matter, and it is of the
nature of the Moon, and it is called the Moone, and that for
this rea≈øon, <hi>viz.</hi> becau≈øe it is humid, as al≈øo becau≈øe it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving the influence and light of the Sun, <hi>viz.</hi>
≈øulphur.</p>
                     <p>Salt is that fixt permanent earth which is in the center of
every thing that is incorruptible, and inalterable, and it is
the ≈øupporter and nour≈øe of the <hi>Humidum Radicale,</hi> with which
it is ≈øtrongly mixt. Now this ≈øalt hath in it a ≈øeed, <hi>viz.</hi> its
<hi>Calidum Innatum,</hi> which is <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and its <hi>Humidum Radicale</hi>
which is <hi>Mercury;</hi> and yet the≈øe three are not di≈øtinct or to
be ≈øeparated, but are one homogeneall thing, having upon a
different account divers names: for in re≈øpect of its heat, and
fiery ≈øub≈øtance it is called Sulphur, in re≈øpect of its humidity,
it is called Mercury, and in re≈øpect of its terre≈øtriall ≈øiccity
it is called ≈øalt, all which are in gold perfectly united, depura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and fixed.</p>
                     <p>Gold therefore is mo≈øt noble, and ≈øolid of all metalls, of a
yellow colour, compacted of principles dige≈øted to the utmo≈øt
hight, and therefore fixed.</p>
                     <p>Silver is in the next place of dignity to Gold, and differs from
it in dige≈øtion chiefly, I ≈øaid chiefly, becau≈øe there is ≈øome ≈ømall
impurity be≈øides, adhering to ≈øilver.</p>
                     <p>Now having given ≈øome ≈ømall account of the originall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
fir≈øt, and ≈øecond, and manner of the growth of gold, I ≈øhall
in the next place ≈øet downe ≈øome curio≈øities therein, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

potabile,</hi> which is the mixtion thereof with other Liquors: Oil
of gold, which is gold liquid by it ≈øelfe without the mixture of
any other Liquor: and the tincture, which is the extraction
of the colour thereof.</p>
                     <div type="recipe">
                        <head>Dr. Anthony's famous Aurum potabile, and Oil of gold.</head>
                        <p>Di≈ø≈øolve pure fine gold in <hi>Aqua regis</hi> according to art (the

of ≈øalt Armo niack di≈øtilled together by Retort in ≈øand)
which clear folution put into a large gla≈ø≈øe of a wide neck,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54827:97"/>
and upon it pour drop by drop Oil of Tartar made <hi>per deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
untill the <hi>Aqua regis</hi> which before was yellow become clear,
and white, for that is a ≈øigne that all calx of gold is ≈øetled to
the bottome: then let it ≈øtand all night, and in the morning
pour off the clear Liquor, and wa≈øh the calx four or five times
with common ≈øpring water, being warmed, and dry it with a
mo≈øt gentle heat.</p>
                        <p>Note, and that wel, that if the heat be too great, the calx takes
fire pre≈øently like Gun-powder and flies away to thy danger
and lo≈ø≈øe, therefore it is be≈øt to dry it in the ≈øun, or on a ≈øtone,
≈øtirring it diligently with a wooden ≈øpatle. To this calx adde
halfe a part of the powder of ≈øulphur, mix them together and in
an open crucible let the ≈øulphur burne away in the fire, putting
a gentle fire to it at the fir≈øt, and in the end a mo≈øt ≈øtrong fire for
the ≈øpace of an houre, that the calx may in ≈øome manner be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated,
and become mo≈øt ≈øubtle, which keep in a viall clo≈øe
≈øtopt for your u≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Then make a Spirit of urine after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Take
the urine of a healthy man drinking Wine moderately, put
it into a gourd, which you mu≈øt ≈øtop clo≈øe, and ≈øet in hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung
for the ≈øpace of forty dayes, then di≈øtill it by Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick

the Spirit only may ri≈øe. Then di≈øtill it in ≈øand by a gla≈ø≈øe

very well to it, and the Spirit will be elevated into the top of
the ve≈ø≈øell like cry≈øtall without any aqueous humidity accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying

Spirits be ri≈øen. The≈øe cry≈øtalls mu≈øt be di≈ø≈øolved in di≈øtilled

and every time you mu≈øt take fre≈øh rain-water di≈øtilled. Then
put the≈øe cry≈øtalls into a gla≈ø≈øe bolthead, which clo≈øe Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,
and ≈øet in the moderate heat of a Balneum for the ≈øpace
of fifteen dayes, that they may be reduced into a mo≈øt clear

Then take the calx of gold above≈øaid, and poure upon it
of the≈øe united Spirits as much as will cover them three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

be tinged as red as bloud; decant off the tincture, and
put on more of the afore≈øaid Spirits, and do as before till
all the tincture be extracted, then put all the tincted Spirits
together, and dige≈øt them ten or twelve dayes, after which
time ab≈øtract the Spirit with a gentle heat, and cohobate it once;
and then the calx will remain in the bottome like an Oil
as red as bloud, and of a plea≈øant odour, and which will be
di≈ø≈øolved in any Liquor. Whereof this Oil may be the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneum</hi>

                        <p>There is found a certaine ≈øtone in Bononia, which ≈øome call a

from the ≈øun in the day time, and gives it forth in the dark.
About this there have been much rea≈øoning among≈øt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophers,
as whether light be really a body, or any kinde of
≈øub≈øtance, or any accident only, and whether this ≈øtone had
any gold in it or no, and what it did con≈øi≈øt of. Hee that fir≈øt
di≈øcovered it thought that he had found a thing that would
tran≈ømute metals into gold, (by which it appears that there
≈øeemed to be ≈øomething of gold in it or ≈øomething more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then gold) but his hopes were fru≈øtrated by a fruitle≈ø≈øe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54827:100"/>
notwith≈øtanding which I conceive there might be ≈øome

but Sol (<hi>i.</hi>) the Sun it ≈øelfe.</p>
                        <p>It is prepared for the receiving of light thus, it is calcined
two wayes, fir≈øt it is brought into a mo≈øt ≈øubtle powder with a
