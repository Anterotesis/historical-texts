            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This daye is it good for weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be obedient &amp; to ſubmytte them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues <note place="margin">ye we men o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beye youre huſbandes.</note> vnto theyr huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des as vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the Lorde. For the huſbande is the wyues heade, euen as Chriſte alſo is the heade of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatyon, and he is the ſauioure of his body. Eph. v. Therfore as the congregacyon is in ſubieccyon to Chriſt, ſo lykewyſe let the wyues be in ſubieccyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to theyr huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des in al thynges, as it is comly in the Lorde: Col. iii. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euen they whiche beleue not the worde, maye with out the worde be wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſacyon of the wyues, whan they ſe theyr good lyuynge, i.

            <p>This daye it is good for men to loue their wiues, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Chriſt <note place="margin">ye men loue your wiues</note> loued the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, and gaue hym ſelfe for it, to ſanctifie it. and clenſed it in the fountayne of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde, to make it to hymſelfe a glorious congregation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge no ſpotte nor wrincle, nor any ſoche thyng, but that it ſhould be holy and without blame.

            <p>This daye is it good for chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to honoure theyr fathers and mothers, and to obeye them in all thynges, for that is well pleaſyng vnto the Lorde. Ephe. vi. Coll. iii. yee the Lord wyll haue the father honoured of the chyldren: &amp; loke what a mother commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth her chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do, he wyll haue it kept Eccl. iii. who ſo honoureth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

his ſynnes ſhalbe forgeuen hym, and he that honoureth his mother, is like one that gathereth treaſure together, who ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his father ſhall haue ioye of his owne chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and whan he ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth his prayer, he ſhalbe herde. He that honoureth his father, ſhal haue a longe lyfe: and he that is o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bedient for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes ſake, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall haue ioye of hym: He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feareth the Lord, honoureth his father and mother, and doth them ſeruice euen as it were vnto the Lorde hymſelfe. Honoure thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therfore in dede, in worde, &amp; in all pacyence, that thou mayſte haue his bleſſinge: for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge of the father buyldeth vp the houſes of the chyldren, but the mothers curſe roteth out the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>For the worſhipe of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s father is his owne worſhippe, and wher the father is without honoure, it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſhoneſty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſone.
