            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Lord might bee fulfilled in thoſe Heathen

Chriſtians formerly ſaying,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 25. 26.</note> 
               <hi>I will call them my people
which were not my people, and her beloved, which was
not beloved, and it ſhall be in the place where it was ſaid
unto them, yee are not my people, that there they ſhall be
called the children of the living God.</hi> Neither is it to be
doubted, but that there are divers yet remaining,
which retaine the like Chriſtian reſolution, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19680:3"/>
want of true knowledge of a plantation (that may
proove profitable to the Church of God &amp; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves)
cauſeth ſuch to live heere like plants,
which many times prove leſſe fruitfull in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ſoile, then when they are removed to places
better liking them, for which cauſe I have thought
good at this preſent, to diſcover briefly (to all ſuch
as are wel affected) the knowledge of a moſt hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
plantation newly undertaken by the right
honorable the Earle of <hi>Barkeſhire</hi> (Knight of the
moſt noble order of the Garter) and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
for that famous river of the <hi>Amazones</hi> in
<hi>America,</hi> as by that which followeth may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>But before I proceede further herein, I thinke it
not amiſſe to ſpeake ſomewhat of the lawfullneſſe
of plantations in forraine countries, whereby ſuch
as make doubt thereof, may be beetter ſatisfied
herewith.</p>
            <p>Now in plantations there are theſe two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palls
to be conſidered: firſt, whether it be lawfull
to remove from one place or countrey to another,
ſecondly, whether it be lawfull to poſſeſſe a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
already inhabited by others: touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
it hath theſe two ſeverall heads, namely, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and extraordinary; extraordinary is that
when God ſhall pleaſe immediately to cauſe any
man to depart from one country to another, as hee
cauſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to depart from <hi>Haran</hi> to <hi>Canaan</hi>
and <hi>Iacob</hi> to returne from <hi>Padan Aram</hi> to the land
of his fathers,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 1, 4, 5, 31. 3. 18.</note> but no man may now expect any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19680:3"/>
ſuch removall and calling as theſe formerly
had.</p>
            <p>The latter of theſe which I call ordinary, is that
when men ſhall be either moved themſelves, or by
others to leave their ancient habitation, and goe
and inhabite ſome other place: and this I take to be
warrantable from that place of the Kings, where the
children of the Prophets ſaid unto <hi>Eliſha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> ☞ <hi>Behold
now, the place where wee dwell with thee is too narrow
for us, Let us goe now to Iordan that wee may take thence
every man a beame, and make us a place to dwell in; and
hee anſwered goe, and one ſaid, vouchſafe I pray thee to
goe with thy ſervants, and hee ſaid I will, goe ſo he went
with them, and when they came to Iordan they cut downe
wood.</hi> Which worke of theirs (without queſtion)
was no other to them then a new plantation, for
they ſeing the inconvenience that was like to enſue
by ſtaying longer in their ancient habitation, did
thereupon remove to a place more ſpacious, and
commodious for them. ☞ In which progreſſe of
theirs, wee may learne not to conceale any thing to
our ſelves, which may as well prove profittable
to others, but diſcover the ſame for their good, as
doubtleſſe the Children of the Prophets heere
did.</p>
            <p>From hence then wee may gather, th<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
men may lawfully remoove with their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes
from one place to another, and that for
divers cauſes; as here the Children of the
Prophets did, by reaſon of the ſtraitneſſe of the
land wherein they dwelt: and it is to be feared that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19680:4"/>
many alſo among us have as great cauſe to doe the
like, by reaſon of the daily increaſing of all ſorts of
people, whereby cittyes townes and countries, are
ſo thronged, that men can hardly live well one by
another, appeareth by the generall complaint of
many in theſe times.</p>
            <p>Neither hath the ſayd ſtraitneſſe alone,<note place="margin">2 Kings 8. 1, 2.</note> cauſed
a removall from one place or Country to another,<note place="margin">Ruth. 4. 1. 2.</note>
but alſo <hi>famine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chro. 10. 7.</note> 
               <hi>ſword,</hi> and <hi>other alterations,</hi> happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the world:<note place="margin">Ier. 14. 18.</note> And to ſpeake truely, if that ſome
in all ages had not departed into other countries
with their families (as God was pleaſed to moove
them by his divine providence) the world aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had not beene ſo much inhabited abroad as now
it is,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 37, 38.</note> and men had beene more burthened at home,
then now they are: therefore ſuch men deſerve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be commended, then condemned by any, ☞
&amp; that becauſe they do nothing herein, but what
God hath commanded, to be done, as appeareth
<hi>Gen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 1.</note> 1. 28. <hi>Bring forth fruit and multiply and fill the
earth:</hi> and this againe is ratified, to <hi>Noah</hi> and his
ſons, ſaying, <hi>bring forth fruite and multiply and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the earth,</hi> which places, being no way contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in all the ſcriptures (as I coulde ever perceive)
are ſufficient to proove the Lawfulneſſe of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in all ages. And the rather, when Kings ſhal
bee likewiſe pleaſed to allow the ſame freedome
to their naturall ſubiects, and that not onely to the
poore, but alſo to the rich, who have the like privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of removal, as appeareth by the places before
mentioned,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 2, 5, 6, 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and by that of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> who
departed one from the other, becauſe the Land
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19680:4"/>
wherein they dwelt were ſo ſtrait that it could not
beare them, by reaſon their ſubſtance was ſo great.</p>
            <p>So then wee ſee all men have a like liberty of
removing from one place to another, excepting
ſuch onely,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 7.</note> which for the time being have any <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
or ſhall bee <hi>married,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 5.</note> in which caſe men ought
not to depart from their wives without conſent,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7.</note>
nor <hi>children</hi> from their parents without their liking,<note place="margin">Colo. 5. 20. 22.</note>
nor <hi>ſervants</hi> from their Maſters without their
leave.</p>
            <p>It remayneth in the next place, that I ſhew the
lawfulneſſe of poſſeſſing a countrey already inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by others, which is our ſecond queſtion:</p>
            <p>True it is, that all men through Adams fall were
deprived of the glory of God, and worlds good,
until by Chriſt the uſe of the creatures was againe
reſtored to all beleevers, therfore the right of that
which we poſſeſſe, commeth now to us by Chriſt,
for which cauſe, the heathen have no right to that
which they deeme theirs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 16.</note> notwithſtanding, the
Lord hath beene pleaſed to ſuffer ſuch to live on
earth with his,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 32.</note> and not to be rooted out from the
place of their habitations untill the day of harveſt,<note place="margin">Iſay. 27. 13.</note>
during which time the Land wherein ſuch have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

our nation ſhould inhabit that goodly and ſpatious
country with them (as appeareth more fully in
Mr. <hi>Harcourts</hi> relation of <hi>Guiana</hi> dedicated to the
Kings moſt excellent Majeſtie, 1626) Therefore
without all queſtion, the plantations there made of

the next place to ſpeake ſomewhat of the nature of
the river, qualitie of the land, climate, and people
of <hi>Guiana,</hi> with the proviſion for mans ſuſtenance,
and commodities therein growing, whereby ſuch

            <p>As touching that great and famous River of the
<hi>Amazones</hi> in <hi>America,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Harcort.</note> it is called for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
thereof, (by <hi>Ioſepus A coſta)</hi> the Empreſſe
and Queene of all Flouds, and for the large extent
of the ſame, it is called by others the ſweet Sea,
ſuppoſed to bee the greateſt River (not onely of
all <hi>India,</hi> but alſo) of the whole world; it is ſaid
to ſlow from the Mountaines of <hi>Peru,</hi> and runneth
with many windings and turnings for the ſpace of
1500 leagues, containing at the mouth thereof
neare ſixtie leagues in breadth; in it are many I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
divers of which are inhabited by the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
it doth ebbe and flow neare three hundred
leagues, and hath in it greate ſtore of excellent fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
for the uſe of man: of which more ſhall bee
ſaid hereafter, when wee ſhall come to ſpeake of
the proviſions of the country for mans ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>The quality of the land is of divers kindes; as
low, middle, and mountainous, (as here with us)
it aboundeth in woods of divers ſorts, having
plaines in ſome parts thereof, with plentie of graſſe,
beſides pleaſant ſtreames of freſh waters, all which
are very needfull and fitting for a plantation.</p>
            <p>The earth in thoſe parts is of ſundry mixtures,
as blacke mould, clay, roſſey, and ſuch like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
ſtone for building if occaſion ſerve.</p>
            <p>The ſeaſons there differ much from ours, for the
dry weather which wee call there ſummer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
about <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the raines and windes,
which we account there winter, begin about <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:19680:6"/>
which latter ſeaſon is termed by us their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by reaſon of the raines then falling extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
and not by reaſon of the coldneſſe of the
weather; for there are no froſtes or ſnowes, as
with us here, ☞ but a continuall ſpring and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſeaſon: for no ſooner doe the leaves wither
and fall away, but preſently it beginnes to ſpring
againe, as here with us ſome yeares it ſeemeth the
like; for when our autumme proves ſomewhat
warme, then commonly appeareth a ſecond ſpring,
which yet never commeth to perfection, and that
by reaſon of the ſuns declining from our horizon,
and the cold winters preſent approaching, which
cauſeth alwayes our latter ſpring to keepe backe,
untill the time of our ſummer ſeaſon: ☞ which in
<hi>Guiana</hi> is not ſo, for there is little difference of
heat and cold throughout the yeare, but a moſt
pleaſant growing weather, which commonly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
thoſe parts to bee much more fruitfull then
many other parts of the world.</p>
            <p>☞ The day and night are there alwaies equall, the
Sunne riſing at ſix of the clocke in the morning,
and ſetting at ſix in the evening or neare therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the yeare throughout.</p>
            <p>The proviſions for diet are many, as firſt, the
roote called Caſſavie, of which the <hi>Guianians</hi>
make their bread; there is likewiſe a kinde of great
wheat called Maix, it yeeldeth great increaſe, and
maketh excellent meale, or flower for bread: of
the aforeſaid Caſſavie, and this wheat, is made a
ſort of drinke called Paranaw, much like the beſt
march beare here with us; other ſorts alſo they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19680:6"/>
have, which for brevity ſake I omit here to ſpeake
of.</p>
            <p>There are Deere of divers ſorts, wilde Swine,
Hares and Conies in great plenty, beſides which
there is a great beaſt called Maipnry which in taſte
is like beefe, and will take ſalt; there is alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creature which uſually commeth into the freſh
waters, and feedeth upon the graſſe and weedes in
the marſhes, (and is called by us the ſea-Cow) be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
in taſt like beefe, and will alſo take ſalt, as the
former; of theſe there are great ſtore in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
they wil ſerve wel for the victualling of ſhips
homeward bound, as of late hath beene proved.</p>
            <p>Of fowles there be divers kindes, namely, wild-duckes,
wilde-geeſe, hennes, herons, cranes, ſtorkes,
pheaſants, partridges, pigeons, ſtockdoves, parrats
of ſundry ſorts, beſides ravenous fowles, and
hawkes, with divers other ſorts not knowne in
theſe parts.</p>
            <p>The variety of fiſh is great, as firſt, mullet, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breame,
ſoale, ſcate, thornebacke, ſwordfiſh, ſeale,
a fiſh like a ſammon, but differing in coulour,
ſhrimpes, lobſters, and oyſters, other ſorts there
are, beſides freſhwater fiſh of many kindes, which
in theſe parts of <hi>Europe</hi> are not knowne to us.</p>
            <p>The fruites there growing are the Pina, Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
Medler, Plumbes and Nuts of divers kindes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
ſtore of Potatoes, as for the Pina, it exceedeth
all other fruites in thoſe parts, being in taſte much
like ripe ſtraberries with clarret wine and ſugar; the
Plantana taſteth like an old pippin, the medlers
exceede ours in greatneſſe, and the nuts in ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>

Having thus briefly touched the ſeverall ſorts of
proviſions neceſſary for mans ſuſtenance, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
I ſhew the varietie of commodities therein
growing for the trade of Merchandiſe, which in
ſhort-time (by Gods aſſiſting our endeavours) may
bee brought to returne great profit to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers.</p>
            <p>The firſt commodity of eſtimation there grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are ſugar-canes, whereof in ſome parts there
are ſtore, which by orderly planting and erecting
of convenient workes, for boyling and making of
ſugars, may (through Gods bleſſing) bee returned
yearely great profit to the adventurers, ☞ as the
plantation of ſugarcanes made hertofore in <hi>Barbary</hi>
by the <hi>Moores,</hi> and ſince that in <hi>Braſſeile</hi> by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi>
may witneſſe.</p>
            <p>There is alſo cotton wooll growing of the fineſt
ſort, it is a profitable commodity, for making of
ſuſtians, callicoes and candle-wicke.</p>
            <p>There is a naturall hempe, or flax, of great uſe,
it is much like raw ſilke, and is called of ſome ſilke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſe.</p>

               </gap> for

which dieth a perfect oringe-tawny in ſilke, and a
yallow in cloath, of which there may bee gotten
good ſtore every ſeaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for my ſelfe with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

the neatherlands, other dyes there are (beſides
hope of Cutcheneale) which at this preſent I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
briefly to paſſe over.</p>
            <p>There are likewiſe found of late, ſtore of Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs
growing, with their Mace, ſome of which
I have recevied upon returne of my foreſaid adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which noe man (I ſuppoſe) but my ſelfe can
ſhew the like, excepting ſome gentlemen, which
upon requeſt have received ſome of mee, which
no doubt may in ſhort time bee brought to a more
fuller perfection, by either cropping the old trees
and dreaning the waters from them, or by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
the young trees, as by experience is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſeene, how that nature is much helped by
art and induſtry.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe Gumma, Lemina, Barrata,

            <p>As for mineralls, or mynes of mettals, it is very

            <p>Now as touching the nature of theſe people they
are generally held harmeleſſe, tractable, truſty,

differ much from all other Americans, and which

            <p>Now ſeeing that the hope of worldly gaine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
moſt men to adventure in one kinde or other,
and that the gaine conceived of this plantation may
prove very profitable both to the Church of God
and all adventurers, it may therefore the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
&amp; ſtirre up men of all ſorts, to become ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
herein, ☞ and chiefly ſuch as have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the Lord both grace, and ability, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſetting forth of his glory.</p>
            <p>And although it cannot bee denied but that our
nation of late yeares, hath beene very forward in
ſetling of divers plantations beyond the ſeas,
yet have they not all thereby ſo much glorified
God, as could be wiſhed, nor dealt ſo faithfully
with ſome adventurers, as was expected, which
thing no doubt being conſidered by many, hath
beene the onely cauſe of keeping them backe from
being adventurers; and no marvell, if when wee
conſider the perſons commonly ſent (I ſpeake not
of all, but of ſuch onely) whoſe lives being baſe
and idle here at home, can hardly bee expected to
be much better abroade in forraigne plantations,
which to ſpeake truely, have beene no other (for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19680:9"/>
the moſt part formerly) then common ſinkes,
wherein too many grieved fathers have caſt forth
their deſperate ofſpring, and the commonwealth
her moſt lawleſſe inhabitants, ſuch as by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
cauſe the good name whereby they are
called,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 12.</note> to be rather <hi>evil ſpoken of amongſt the Gentiles,</hi>
then otherwiſe: by meanes whereof it hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that the heathen have deemed that God as evil
as their owne, whoſe ſervants were worſe then
themſelves, doth not God and nature teach, that
<hi>whatſoever a man ſoweth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note>

               <hi>nor figgs of thiſtles</hi> can men expect.
And now, though plantes of grace (like fruitfull
trees) are chiefeſt to be wiſhed for in al plantations,
yet no doubt may civill men be ſent in caſe of want,
as natures flowers for ornament: I wiſh therefore
that care were had, ☞ to ſend thoſe plants, and
leave the bad.</p>
            <p>As for the temper of the climate it exceedeth not
ſo in heate as ſome men have thought of it, for
though the ſcituation be in part under the equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial,
yet is it habitable, as appeareth by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of our countrimen, which have lived in thoſe
parts, and found it both healthfull, and pleaſant; for
God in wiſdome hath ſo ordered the heavens in
their horizon, as that by meanes of a brieze (or
freſh gale of winde) blowing in the day time, it
quallifieth the heate, ☞ and maketh the climate
much more temperate, as with us is often felt the
like in heate of ſummer.</p>
            <p>Beſides the dewes there falling commonly in the
night, addeth much to the cooling of that climate,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19680:9"/>
and which is to bee noted, the continuall abſence
of the Sunne from the horizon, for the ſpace of
twelve houres every day, cannot but cauſe the
temper of that clymate to be moderate, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a perfect mixture of heat and cold, each qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifing
the other in the ſpace of twentie foure hours
by an equall diviſion of day and night, as before
hath beene ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Their houſes are built (moſt commonly) in
length, like our barnes here with us, ſome of which
are ſo large, as that they containe in them above an
hundred perſons, having therein hanging beds, (in
which they lie) called hamackoes, made of cotten
woll very artificially, their veſſels for uſe are
made ſome of clay, of which ſort ſome are ſo great
as that they will containe more then one hogſhead
of water.</p>
            <p>They will worke a month or more for an axe of
eighteene or twentie pence price; for which they
will fell your timber, cleare your ground, plant
your ſugar-canes, Anotto, and Cotten trees, and
build your houſe after their faſhion: ☞ which in
other plantations is not ſo, for in all other our
plantations, the adventurers are enforced to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
men over to doe their worke for them, leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
they bee driven to worke themſelves, as
Virginia, St. Chriſtophers, and new England;
with others can witneſſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides which, in moſt former plantations except
new England, men have adventured onely upon
hope of one commoditie (as namely Tobacco) but
here are many more commodities then one, (as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19680:10"/>
hath beene ſhewed) ☞ therefore is this plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more hopefull then all others: the foundation
of which being already laid, may give men better
incouragment to become ioynt adventurers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
eſpecially being thereupon preſently intreſſed
in the ſhipping ſtocke, and profits of the ſaid plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
for the preſervation whereof, wee have
not onely ſent divers honeſt and able men (mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and other) but alſo ſome peeces of great ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
with amunition, and other materials very
uſefull towards building of a fort, for the better
ſecuring of our planters perſons from the danger
of an enemy; having moreover cauſed a pinnace
to bee ſent to abide with the Colony in the river,
for their better ſafetie and trade in the country;
☞ intending likewiſe this ſummer (if God ſhall
bee pleaſed) to ſett out a new ſupply of more men
(as artificers and others) beſides women, as alſo
more ordnance, amunition, and other materials,
fitting for the defence of the plantation, beſides
another ſhipp, greater then the former, to ſtay and
abide there together with the Colony in the river,
for their better defence and trade in the country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid:
in which ſupply I alſo purpoſe (God
willing) to goe with my wife and friends, to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
ſome part of that ſpacious and goodly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
            <p>But here ſome may obiect feare of the enemy.<note place="margin">Object.</note>

               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it is no other then what hath bin uſualy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the firſt ſetting forth of al our plantations for

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19680:10"/>
ſuppoſed) men would not aſſuredly have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
ſo freely; but this plantation here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
is farre from the Spaniards habitation, and
therefore leſſe cauſe to be feared.</p>
            <p>But yet it may bee further obiected,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that though
the Spanyard bee ſomewhat farre diſtant, yet the
Portugals in Braſill (being neare vnto it) may
prove as ill neighbours as the other.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Anſwer, if
wee conſider the ſpatiouſnes of the country (being
ſuppoſed to bee more then twenty times greater
then this kingdome of England) wee have no ſuch
great cauſe to feare them; for if wee like not their
neighbourhood, (there being roome enough,
and divers goodly rivers beſides in the country)
wee may (if we pleaſe) goe further out of their
reach, where no doubt (through Gods aſſiſting
of our indeavours) wee may come to returne as
great profit (by meanes of ſugar canes and ſuch
like commodities growing in thoſe partes) as in the
river aforeſaid: for to ſpeake truly, it were great
weakneſſe in any to preſume to ſit neare an enemy,
and have not ſufficient ſtrength to oppoſe him, or
having roome enough to go out of his reach, will
notwithſtanding abide neare him; yet I deny not,
but that a Colony may bee able to ſubſiſt neare an
enemy by meanes of fortification, and eſpecially
when they are ſuch as feare God, being provided
with amunition, victuall, and all other things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the defence of the ſame: for to raiſe a fort
for the reliefe of a Colony, and not to victuall it,
(as ſome haue careleſly neglected through indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
were to make it (with ſuch) our peoples
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19680:11"/>
grave, and not their preſervation: and if an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of our nation, or thereabout (having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fort, nor artillery for defence,) were able (not
long ſince) by meanes of the natives, to cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
eighteene hundred of the enemy to retrayte,
and abandon the river, with loſſe of many of their
lives; how much more then being fortified, and
fitted with all things needfull for the defence of the
ſame, may wee bee better able, (through the helpe
of the almighty) to repell and beat backe a more
potent power.</p>
            <p>Now as the raiſing of forts for the defence
of Colonies, and neglect of ſtoring them with
victuall, and other things needfull for preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſame, ſheweth the great indiſcretion of
ſome ſort of people: ☞ So in like manner, is
their folly as great, who looking after preſent
profit, neglect planting proviſions needfull for
the preſervation of their lives: which wee taking
into conſideration, have given expreſſe charge,
that firſt of all they take care to plant proviſions
needfull for ſuſtentation, whereby they may bee
able in ſhort time to ſubſiſt of themſelves, without
helpe of the natives, which uſually furniſh our
Engliſh plantations with ſtore of proviſions for
diet, at marvelous low rates; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wee have ſent thither ſome few cattell for

or ſhall make doubt of any thing, they may pleaſe
to repaire to the place of meeting (hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
and there receive further ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Now as touching the manner of the adventure,
it is as followeth.</p>
            <p>Every one that ſhall be admitted into the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or company of the Right Honourable the Earle
of <hi>Barkſheire</hi> for his plantation in <hi>Guiana,</hi> is to be
admitted one of theſe three wayes, that is to ſay;
either in perſon and purſe, or in purſe, or in perſon
onely. The firſt are called perſonall adventurers,
the ſecond, purſe adventurers, and the latter are
ſervants to the Collony.</p>
            <p>Concerning the former, they are ſuch as not
onely adventure their perſons, but alſo their
purſes; of which ſort none may bee admitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
fifty pounds at leaſt, put into the ioynt ſtocke
(being a ſingle ſhare) in conſideration whereof, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſuch adventurer is to have for his perſonal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
(over and above the profits of his ſtocke
of adventure) his tranſportation and diet free,
(both in the paſſage and country,) beſides a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſtipend or yearly allowance (as others) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the maintenance of his apparrell &amp; bedding,
and alſo aleventh part of a twelfth, of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
that ſhall ariſe by the induſtry and labours of
the Collony beyond ſea; and laſtly, a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of land over and beſides his ſtocke of adventure
of fifty poundes, or more as every one pleaſeth to
put in, ☞ whoſe reſpect in the Collony, is held
fitting to be meaſured according to the greatneſſe
of every mans adventure, worth and qualitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19680:12"/>
As for thoſe which are called purſe adventurers,
they are ſuch which adventure their monies but not
their perſons, ☞ whoſe names, and ſummes adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
are not onely regiſtred, but alſo acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by indenture under ſeale, by Authority from
the ſaid Earle, (for their better ſecurity, and more
aſſurance of faithfull dealing) to become ioynt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
with the ſaid Earle and company, for his
plantation aforeſaid, and that at every returne, (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the terme of five yeares) after the firſt returne
from the plantation, every adventurer, his heyres,
executours, adminiſtratours or aſſignes, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the profits of his ſtocke of adventure, and ſhal
the firſt returne from the plantation (after five
yeares ſhall be expired) receive out the iuſt reſidue
and remainder of his ſtocke of adventure, &amp; profits
therof, or may if he pleaſe, continue the ſame lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the ioynt ſtocke then the terme aforeſaid,
for his further benefit: and ſhall have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
ſet forth for his uſe a proportion of lande cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſpondent
to his ſaid ſtocke of adventure: and to
the ende that every adventurer, his heires, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
adminiſtrators and aſſignes may clearely ſee,
that they have the due proportion of the profits of
their adventure, it is covenanted in the ſaid inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the heires, executors, adminiſtrators &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal upon every ſetting forth &amp; return,
ſee the full ſumme of all the diſburſements, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
from time to time, paid and received, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the proceede of the ſaid ioynt ſtocke, and
plantation: which in like manner, every adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
as well perſonall, ſervant, as other, hath the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19680:12"/>
like indenture for their better ſatisfaction, and more
aſſurance of faithfull dealing, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the latter, which are ſervants
to the collony, they are ſuch, which adventuring
onely their perſons, are bounde by indenture to
ſerve the ſaid Earle and company in the plantation
five yeares, in conſideration whereof, the ſaid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes,
(as well wives, maides, as men) are to have
their tranſportation thither free, as alſo their diet,
lodging, apparrell, and all other materialls needfull,
provided for them, at the charge of the ioynt ſtock,
for the terme aforeſaid (apparrelling themſelves
here for the firſt yeare) and to receive moreover,
(for their beter incouragement) a twelfth part of
all the profits that ſhall ariſe by their labours and
induſtry, and the women a fifteenth (as of ſugars,
nutmeggs, mace, cotton wools, Anottoes, honey,
wax, tobacco, mineralls, and all other ſuch like
commodities, as ſhall be gotten in the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in manner aforeſaid) as alſo at the end and
terme of five yeares, every man ſervant to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and ſeaſon of thirty, and ſome forty acres of
land, and women twenty, which ſaid landes are to
be ſet forth for their uſe, by the governour, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and councell then being.</p>
            <p>And to the end that every one may know what
profits are due unto them by reaſon of their ſervice,
it ſhall be free for them to make choyſe of any two
or three amongſt themſelves, which ſhall once in
the yeare, or thereabout (upon reaſonable requeſt
made to the governour, or governours then being)
ſee the accompts, and what is due unto them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19680:13"/>
the foote of the ſame, ☞ for their better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and avoyding of ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>And furthermore all ſuch ſervants, as ſhall bee
artificers. As Suger-cane, and Vine planters: Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
bakers, Druggiſts, Dyers, Lapidaries, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallmen,
Refiners, Founders, Potaſhe makers, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſurgeons,
Ingeners, Gunners, Survayers, Ship-wrightes,
Mill-wrightes, Carpenters, Ioyners,
Coopers, Turners, Wheelers, Sawyers, Oare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Blacke-ſmiths, Locke-ſmiths, Gunn-ſmiths,
Pike-makers, Armorers, Cutlers, Edge-toole-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Ropers, Sayle-makers, Mariners, Net-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Fiſhermen, Bakers, Butchers, Brewers, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillers
of hot-waters, felt-makers, Spinſters, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Taylers, Tanners, Curriers, Tawyers of
Furres, Fellmongers, Girdlers, Glovers, Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
Potters, Maſons, Bricke-makers, Bricke-layers,
Basket-makers, Thatchers, and ſuch like;
are to receive a ninth part of a twelfth (more then
others, which are no artificers, of all the profits
that ſhall ariſe by their labours, and induſtry) as a
recompence of their ſeverall arts for their further
incouragement.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, it ſhall and may bee free for every
ſervent appertaining to the colony, to put into the
ioynt ſtocke ſuch ſummes of mony, as they ſhall
be able from under fifty pounds to five (as already
ſome have done) the receit of which ſummes being
acknowledged by indenture, ſhall be as ſufficient
a warrant for them to receive the iuſt profits of the
ſame, correſpondent to their ſeverall ſtockes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
as to any other before mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:19680:13"/>
And now to conclude, ſeeing that workes of this
nature require ſome time for preparation of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and all other things needfull for tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that the ſummer ſeaſon is moſt convenient
for the performance of the ſame: it is therefore
thought fitting to give notice to all ſuch, as ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
willing adventurours with the ſaid Earle and
company, to bring in their ſtockes of adventure,
(ſo ſoone as conveniently they may, and the ſooner
the better, for the reaſons aforeſaid) to the place
of meeting appointed to be kept (for the receiving
in of adventurers, and ſervants to the company) at
the houſe of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> the Kings Pikemaker in
Phillip lane neare Cripplegate: London: which
firſt meeting is appointed on thurſday the firſt of
March (at two of the clocke in the afternoone) and
ſo to continue every thurſday after, untill ſuch time
as the ioynt ſtocke, number of adventurers, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
ſhall be full.</p>
            <p>Thus having briefly ſhewed the hopefulneſſe of
this plantation, above others, whereby ſuch as
are faithfull (having ability) might become chiefly
adventurers herein, and that ſuch as are outwardly
poore (yet rich in faith) might likewiſe adventure
their prayers with them,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 5.</note> for the proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of this new plantation, that it may bee as a
Vineyard which the right hand of the Lord hath
planted, and may growe up before him in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
(being filled with the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which are by Ieſus Chriſt, unto the glory and
praiſe of God) amongſt the Heathen, who ſeeing
our pure converſation may bee wonne thereby to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19680:14"/>
the knowledge and love of God our Father, and
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: which that they may ſo do,
grant O moſt gracious God, that as thou waſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to love us, when we were enemies as theſe, ſo
likewiſe bee pleaſed to love theſe with us, that we
and they may both agree to worſhip thee in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
