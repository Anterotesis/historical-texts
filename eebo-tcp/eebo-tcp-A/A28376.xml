         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE
HISTORY
OF
A Child Anatomized:
Which remained Twenty five
Years in his Mothers Belly.</head>
            <p>MArgaret Mathews, the
Wife of <hi>John Pughet,</hi>
Clothworker at <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi>
after having happily
brought forth into the
World Ten Children in the
latter part of the year 1652,
found her ſelf with child of
the Eleventh; and at the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50594:7"/>
expiration of the Accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Time, ſhe felt the
Pangs of Travel; the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of which forced her
to betake her ſelf to Bed:
A Chirurgeon who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to Deliver Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
was fetched; who
having viſited her, told her
and aſſured her, that there
was no diſpoſition or likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of being Delivered at
that time: Nevertheleſs the
Pains continued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and cruelly tormented
her for the ſpace of Two
Months: In the mean time
two of the moſt Renowned
Doctors there, were adviſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50594:7"/>
with it; who opening and
preſcribing Medicines, and
acting what might be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
done, could produce
no other Effects, then ſome
Clodders of Blood, forced
out of the Matrix.</p>
            <p>After this firſt time, ſhe
went near hand Three
Months more with theſe
troubleſome, yet now more
tollerable Pains, than the
former, though notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they were ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
evacuation of a ſilthy,
mattery Stuff. From that
time ſhe increaſed in her
ſtrength, and nothing more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50594:8"/>
did come forth from the
Matrix; but ſhe was, if ſhe
would enjoy any eaſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
continually to lie
upon her Back; for when
ſhe turned her ſelf any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
her Burden cauſed her
great Pains: In ſo much that
ſhe could, as it were, feel the
Child remove it ſelf. She
continued in this condition
Eighteen or Nineteen years,
during which time, after the
intermiſſion of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
ſhe under-went ſuch
ſtrong and extraordinary
Pains, that oftentimes ſhe
earneſtly intreats the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
to open her Belly, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50594:8"/>
ſo take away that which was
the Cauſe of her ſo great
and miſerable Pains.</p>
            <p>Since the aforeſaid firſt
years, unto the year 1675,
that ſame Burthen (which by
its weight and greatneſs had
ſo long tormented her) grew
more tolerable and leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome;
being then grown
faſt and without any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Finally, The Seventeenth
of <hi>June</hi> 1675, ſhe was taken
with a Fevor, which ended
the Two and ſixtieth year of
her Age and her Miſery, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Next day the Body
being opened, there was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50594:9"/>
found on the whole Bottom
of the Matrix, a Body or
Subſtance as hard as Stone;
each ſide of this Subſtance,
towards the Bottom, being
hollow about the length of
four Fingers, covering an
Ulcer, Boil, or Sore of the
ſame bigneſs; as may be
ſeen by Figure 1: Excepting
the Sore, the reſt of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix
was in its natural Form;
as alſo all the lower parts of
the Belly, the Cawl only
excepted; which had acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
about the thickneſs of
two Fingers breadth a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and a little fleſhineſs:
Theſe things conſidered, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50594:9"/>
Cawl was laid upon the
dead Corps, and then was
eſpied a Deformed Lump,
faſt under the Cawl, which
being ſeperated, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Figure <hi>N.</hi> 2: The
out-ſide of it was nothing
but a Cruſt, a large inch
thick, and in ſome places
more; this Cruſt was near as
hard as a Griſtle, of Colour
a pale Yellow, excepting on
that ſide of its joyning to the
Cawl; where it was harder
and ſomething redder. Some
Perſons out of Curioſity,
laid the ſame againſt the
Fire, being of opinion that
it would melt like Suet or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50594:10"/>
Tallow; and ſo after the
melting there would remain
a kind of a Film or Skin,
with ſome Knobs, which
appeared in divers places of
the ſaid ſubſtance: In the
mean time, in this turning
it about, there were ſeen
ſome Signs of a Child,
which was looſened and cut
from it as dexterouſly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly;
and at length a Child
was diſcovered, and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a Man Child; the
Yard being found between
the Film or Skin of the
Groin: It was laid with its
Head to the bottom of the
Matrix, his right Hand in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50594:10"/>
the form of a Cloſed Fiſt,
placed againſt the upper part
of the Crown of his Head;
his Breaſt againſt the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
of the Mother; his
Back was on the ſide of the
Cawl; the Feet were bowed
upwards, ſo that they in
part incompaſſed the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the Naval, as
alſo ſome part of the left ſide
of the neather part of the
Belly: Some Harr was found
upon the Eye-lids, the Eyes
ſunk in, the Film of the ſame
wrinkled, the Noſe flattiſh,
the Lips grown over with a
a Subſtance harder than that
wherewith he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50594:11"/>
and after the
Gums were cut, there was
there-under found Teeth
near as great as of a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
Child; under its
right Arm, and by the right
Ear, a ſmall Lock, of yellow
but very ſhort Hair: The
Nails of the Hands and Feet
long, hard and raw the Fleſh
of the Neck, Groin, and the
parts thereabouts, coloured
with Blood; the Skull Bones
ſeparated from one another,
and the Brains ſunk down
and almoſt of the Colour of
Conſerve of Roſes; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts of the Breaſt and
Belly were dried up and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50594:11"/>
blackiſh; the Muſcles and
Sinews of the lower parts
had loſt very little of their
greatneſs, or of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
force, otherwiſe then
that the fleſhy parts were
White, Yellow, and a Dark
Pale; the Knees a little part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from one another; the
left Foot a little bended,
hiding the right Foot under
it; the left Hand ſhut and
preſſed againſt the Chin and
Knee of the ſame Side: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
All the Limbs, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the right Arm, were
placed as they are in other
Children in the Mothers
Womb; which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50594:12"/>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS
UPON THE
Principal Circumſtances
OF THIS
HISTORY.</head>
            <p>NOT to digreſs too far
from the Subject here
mentioned, I ſhall not ſtand
to inquire, What the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cauſes and Motives of
Child-bearing are; Poſſibly
my Fortune may be, to
meet with a Better Way,
and more Conſonant, to
the Explication; I muſt then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50594:13"/>
only propoſe that theſe Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
had determined, this our
Child to come forth of the
Womb; being brought to
its due time, and the Labour
being very near, upon the
ordinary manner: This then
being eſtabliſhed, the firſt
Difficulty which doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it ſelf to be diſcuſſed, is,
To know the Cauſe or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Why the Inward Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Mouth of the Matrix;
reſiſted the powerful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
both of Mother and
Child? That is, Why did
not the Matrix ſufficiently
open it ſelf for the paſſage;
or at leaſt for the drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50594:14"/>
of this Child? It being
certain, That as often as
Women come in Travel, the
Matrix always opens and
enlarges its ſelf; in whatever
manner the Children appear;
and all that <hi>Margaret</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this, doth ſufficiently
evidence, that this part in her
was naturally well conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
In the mean while it is
not very troubleſome, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
this Queſtion, It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that a Part or Member
may ſuffer and have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
at one time,
which it never had or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before; and alſo that the
Inward Opening of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50594:14"/>
is ſubject to Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
Hardneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,
and in general,
Diſeaſes which are common
to all fleſhy and membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
parts; the which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hinders or ſpoils the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the ſaid parts,
and one of theſe two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
might occaſion
that Condition in which
<hi>Margaret</hi> found her ſelf,
in time of her Labour.
The whole City of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi>
being at that time amazed
and afraid, by reaſon of an
already begun Infection,
and conſider, That in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the Matrix is made
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50594:15"/>
ſenſible of every ſtrong and
extraordinary Motion of the
Mind.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Inwardeſt
Mouth of the Matrix could
not be opened ſufficiently,
could not the Child remain
in the Matrix, as others
have before done, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
after the due time?
And how could it come
out of the Matrix, and caſt
its ſelf into the Vacuity of
the Belly? This is another
Subject to be wondered
at, and yet may have Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Cauſes: It's proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this Child pitched firſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50594:15"/>
with his Head downwards,
it being found in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
the Water could not
on this ſide form or bring
it ſelf to any Head Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with uncomparable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance:
In the mean time
the Pangs of Travel were
extream hard; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the harder they are, the
more that moiſture which
incompaſſeth the Child, is
moved and put forth the
Adherent Membranes in
the form of a Point, to
force its ſelf a Paſſage;
which is called a Formed,
or Full-grown Water: We
may then already judge,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50594:16"/>
that the Moiſture, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Pang, preſt towards
the Inward Mouth of the
Matrix; and it is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be believed, That
the Water, as it were by a
rebound, turned to the
contrary Parts, and ſo
brought forth the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
<hi>Margaret</hi> having du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that time laid in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Forms and Manners,
and that probably, ſome
manner or other, the
height of this Opening
might be equal with that
of the Matrix: Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the Chirurgeons
who are accuſtomed to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50594:16"/>
Women, and alſo the
Midwives daily obſerve,
To lift up the hinder parts
of thoſe who are in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
upon the Bed, to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate
the paſſage of the
Child.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, That
the Water doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſuch a Form as I
have deſcribed, before it is
forward and in the Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Mouth of the Matrix;
and that therefore, to form
it ſelf on the other ſide, it
muſt of neeeſſity meet with
the Circumference of ſome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50594:17"/>
Space; that is to ſay, the
ſeparating or parting ofth
whole: For <hi>Margaret</hi> had
no Ulceration in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of her Matrix; not
having had extraordinary
pains before her Labour;
and the divers Refluctions
of the Water, nor the
Members of the Child,
could make a ſufficient
Wound to give him a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage;
the whole Space or
Vacancy of that Bottom is
naturally covered with the
After-birth: And if in caſe
it had been ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
or parted, then
<hi>Margaret</hi> muſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50594:17"/>
during her Labour,
evacuated Blood; which
here was not ſo: But the
ſituation of the Trunks or
Pipes of the Matrix (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
annexed to the Bottom
thereof) teacheth us, that
their Mouths could not
well be covered by the
After-birth, which occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
but the Middle; and
Experience learneth that
they can retch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
for ſometimes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are generated in them;
which have been known to
live and grow there until
the Fourth or Fifth Month:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50594:18"/>
But if any will object, That
the Quantity of Mans Seed
neceſſary for Generation,
can inſinuate it ſelf; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having the Entrances
to be naturally very wide,
or capable of retching of it
ſelf in the Copulation: I
anſwer, That this, nor
all the Reaſons that may
be alledged, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to with-ſtand Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
The Hiſtory I am
about rehearſing, doth
undeniably prove that the
aforeſaid Mouths can ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well endure as large a
ſtretching as the Inwardeſt
Mouth of the Matrix.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50594:18"/>
This 30th of <hi>April</hi> 1676,
I was ſent for by the much
Renowned Midwife Mrs.
<hi>Langlois,</hi> to deliver a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Woman, the Wife of
a maimed Souldier, whoſe
Name was <hi>Bourguignon,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the <hi>Back-ſtreet;</hi>
and when I came, I found
the Head of the Child far
advanced in its paſſage;
but the Pains ceaſing for
Twenty four hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Signs of her
otherwiſe approaching
Death, ſhew'd us the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of Drawing out
the Child; which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50594:19"/>
with Succeſs, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the After-birth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ordinary
Courſe; but yet ſhe felt
ſome Pains, when feeling
about the Circuit of her
Navel, a little to the ſide
of the Liver, I found a
moving Hardneſs, much
like a Childs Head; which
I alſo demonſtrated to the
Midwife; whereby we
judged the Woman was
not wholly delivered: ſo
I put my Hand again into
the Womb, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſearching the whole
Concavity of the Matrix,
I felt the Entrance of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50594:19"/>
right a little opened, into
which I preſently got my
Fore-finger, afterwards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and then my whole
Hand; with which I took
out of the ſame more than
two pounds of Congealed,
and in ſome meaſure har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
Blood; and then the
aforeſaid round Hardneſs
was no more felt.</p>
            <p>This Experience then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
That the Entrance
of this Trunk or Pipe of the
Matrix, can ſuffer a great
ſtretch. But here are two
difficulties yet remaining to
be reſolved; The firſt is,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50594:20"/>
That if this part had been
open in that moment when
our Child paſſed, then it
would not have occaſioned
the Ulceration which was
found in the Matrix. The
Second is, That this Ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
covered the whole
Circumference of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of this part, and that
the Entrance of which we
have already ſpoke) is in
the ſide of the ſaid Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
            <p>The Solution of theſe
two Points is eaſie, The
Chyrurgeons who are uſed
to Deliver Women, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50594:20"/>
the Midwives, know, That
in all Common and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Deliveries, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
always come forth,
before that the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Inward Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Matrix be as
big as their Head, and
that the ſame paſſage doth
inlarge it ſelf at the ſame
time they paſs through it.
It may then be, that our
Child ſticking faſt in the
Pipe or Trunk (of the
which I have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
before the impreſſing
of the Water, cauſed a
greater Opening; and that
ſo in its paſſage made a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50594:21"/>
partition in the whole;
which poſſibly gave the
firſt occaſion of the Ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereof we have
treated; and that this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
moſt likely, was
made upon the ſide (before
the After-birth was joyned
faſt to the Matrix) rather
then any where elſe, by
reaſon that is always moiſt;
and therefore it followeth
by reaſon, to be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
in this place then any
other.</p>
            <p>I will not make any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
in Explaining the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of that Stony Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50594:21"/>
or Subſtance found in
the bottom of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,
it is evident by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that in the Ulcers
which are not well Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and Purified, the Matter
and Filth which remaineth
upon the Sides, from time
to time, produceth by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
a ſtrong hardneſs;
but every one might
doubt how the Legs of our
Infant (which in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
were firſt born)
ſhould have placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſuch order, that
they followed the motion
of the Water; and ſo at
the ſame time are come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50594:22"/>
the Trunks or Pipes,
ſeeing they are not Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Crooked, and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Matrix: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
That under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Motions of this Child,
it was ſo, as by chance,
placed in order; the Knees
which ordinarily are cloſe
joyned together, may be
firſt paſſed thorow; ſo that
the Legs lying cloſe about
the Buttocks, could not
poſſibly ſtop the reſt of the
Body: However it is, it is
apparent, the Head came
laſt; becauſe it reſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the bottom of the
Matrix, and the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50594:22"/>
in which the right Arm
was found, doth declare,
that it ſerved for a form,
to hinder the Head from
being ſtopped in its Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage;
which according to
many Authors is a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Circumſtance in
thoſe Deliveries where the
Children come forth with
their Feet firſt. See here
then the Paſſage of this
Child out of the Matrix
ſufficiently explained, ſo
that what happened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
is now to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
Concerning the Time
it ſtayed in its Mothers Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and principally how
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50594:23"/>
it was Conſerved there:</p>
            <p>Therefore, Firſt, We
muſt take this for certain,
That the Bodies of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are preſerved from
Corruption, either by Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
which maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Life, or by ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Effect which hinders
the Diſſolution after Death.</p>
            <p>And it may well be that
both theſe Cauſes did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in Conſervation of our
Child; for there is nothing
to hinder our believing,
That for ſome time it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
receiving the Blood
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50594:23"/>
thorow the Veſſels of the
Navel for its Nouriſhment,
ſeeing we experience every
day that in ſome Womens
Labours the After-birth
ſticks faſt to the Matrix,
ſo that they are forced to
ſeparate it with Fingers;
and ſometimes pull it out
by Piece-meals: This is an
Obſervation that cannot
truly be alledged againſt,
If this Lump can remain
faſt annexed to the Matrix
after the Child is brought
forth into the World, then
it is clear enough, that it
was ſo in the Caſe of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi>
becauſe her Child
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50594:24"/>
continued enjoying its firſt
Nouriſhment; for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Air could not touch
the String, and therefore
cauſe no hindrance in the
motion of the Blood,
wherewith it was full; and
it is undoubtable, that the
Child was preſerved ſome
time by this means; by
reaſon <hi>Margaret</hi> voided no
Blood at that time when
the Child paſſed thorow
the Matrix into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity
of the Belly; but
to the contrary, ſome
Weeks after, when ſhe was
given Opening and Force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Medicines, ſhe voided
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50594:24"/>
ſome Lumps or Clodders
of Blood, which moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
cauſed ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
in ſome part of the
After-birth. By that which
already hath been ſaid, we
may ſuggeſt that our Child
might be nouriſhed about
Two Months, without the
Matrix, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as when he was in the
ſame: And it is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
that, that ſame
wherewith it was covered,
was that which preſerved
it from Corruption after
its Death; ſheltring it from
the piercing Air, Moiſtures,
and other Beginnings of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50594:25"/>
Corruption. Here alſo may
ariſe a Doubt whether it
ceaſed to live by reaſon of
the want of that motion of
the Blood, which it drew
to him by the String, or
that it continued receiving
Nouriſhment ſome other
way; but as the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
upon this Doubt are
very dubious, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf to ſhew the
Reaſons, upon theſe two
Circumſtances, and leave
the Reader to ſide with
which he pleaſeth. And
firſt, foraſmuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
the Generation of
the Cruſt, it is not certain
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50594:25"/>
that it had ſufficient thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to nouriſh our Child
before the After-birth was
ſeparated. But we may
ſay that therein was no
impoſſibility, becauſe the
Water flowing forth in
her Labour, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-birth
remaining in the
Matrix, that which was
found fleſhy in the Cruſt,
could be no other thing
then the Trunk or Pipe,
in the which our Child had
placed it ſelf. And this
place or part was thick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to with-ſtand the
Breathings which iſſued
from the Child as it expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50594:26"/>
And although many
Witneſſes have aſſerted,
That our Child did natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſtir until the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
year, they muſt
confeſs that it was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then as <hi>Margaret</hi>
turned her ſelf from one
ſide to the other; which
doth evidence, that it was
nothing but that motion;
the which might be ſeen in
the <hi>Molae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, and
very truly, that <hi>Margaret</hi>
every Nine Months felt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Travel Pangs; but
that doth not prove, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50594:26"/>
theſe Pains were the Effect
of thoſe Endeavours which
the Child did to be brought
forth. It is found out to be
no otherwiſe cauſed than
by the moiſture caſt up by
the Mother; and that was
ſufficient to moiſten theſe
parts at all times: ſo that
the Child might fall to the
bottom of the Matrix, and
ſo cauſe the Pains.</p>
            <p>Finally, It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
That the Child
could not live without
ſuſtenance from the Navel
Strings: Firſt, Becauſe the
ſame being annexed unto
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50594:27"/>
the After-birth, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no Nouriſhment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then in the ſame
manner as the <hi>Molae.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
The Skin and Fleſh
being tinctured with Blood;
it is credible that their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
were anatomized with
the Cawl. Thirdly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at that time a part and
member of the Mother,
needed no other Reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then from its ſelf.
Fourthly, Being extream
hard and great, it may be
judged that it ſupplied the
place of the After-birth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50594:27"/>
But all theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
have others, which
contradict them: Our Child
was not ſo perfectly faſt to
the Cawl as the <hi>Molae</hi> is to
the Matrix; there being a
thick Cruſt between them,
the Anatomy was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
obſerved by all that
opened the Body of <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret:</hi>
The Child which doth
not reſpire while it is in the
Matrix, muſt of neceſſity
tranſpire through the Heart
Veins of the Mother; and
it is evident that the Blood
thorow theſe Veſſels did
not circum-ambulate in our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50594:28"/>
Child, becauſe it did not
waxe accordingly. And it
is well enough known,
That thoſe Humours which
have loſt their Natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being gathered or
congealed in any part of
the Body, of neceſſity muſt
generate an extraordinary
motion, which either ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
them, or they ſtay in
the ſame form; which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
a hardneſs.</p>
            <p>But howſoever it is, If
our Child did live after the
Ulceration of the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth,
then the manner and
caſe in which we found the
Child, demonſtrates that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50594:28"/>
the Child had been a long
time dead, and that its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation proceeded from
nothing elſe but the Cruſt
wherewith it was covered:
I ſpeak nothing of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Nails, for it is
known they grow after
Death; and paſſing by all
ſuperfluous Circumſtances,
The firſt Conſideration
which may in this Caſe
be made, is that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Cut is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
as ſome new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
do affirm, ſeeing
there may be falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
and Children
themselves generated in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50594:29"/>
Trunks or Pipes of the
Matrix, as well as thoſe
conceived in the Matrix,
can caſt them out.</p>
            <p>The Second Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That if in due time
this Operation had been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
the Child might have
been pulled, out, and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi>
not have ſuffered and
under-gone ſo many pains,
which ſhe ſuffered ſo many
years.</p>
            <p>The Third is, That if
the Matrix had been cut
(which in this Caſe is moſt
dangerous.) there ought to
have been a certainty that
the Child was in the Trunks
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50594:29"/>
or Pipes of the Matrix.</p>
            <p>Finally, The Fourth is,
Then when after a certain
being with-child, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
or Labour and Pains ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
do come; yet
then you ſhall find the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Opening cloſed and
ſhut, and the Child either
upon the right or left ſide,
higher than before; with a
Falling Motion, which then
you may be aſſured, is in
one of the Pipes of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,
and then the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Cut is very neceſſary.</p>
