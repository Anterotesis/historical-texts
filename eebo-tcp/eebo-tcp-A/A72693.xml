            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was neuer any thing by the wie of man ſo well deuiſed, or ſo ſurely eſtabliſhed, which (in continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time) hath not been corrupted: as (emong other thinges) it may plainly appere by the common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Churche, commonly called diuine ſeruice: the firſte originall and grounde whereof, if a manne woulde ſearche out by the auncient fathers, he ſhall finde that theſame was not ordeyned, but of a good purpoſe, and for a great aduauncement of godlines: For they ſo ordred the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greateſt parte thereof) ſhould be read ouer once in the yeare, intendyng thereby, that the Cleargie, and ſpecially ſuche as were Miniſters of the congregacion, ſhould (by often readyng and meditacion of Gods worde) be ſtirred vp to godlines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfes, and be more able alſo to exhorte other by wholſome doctrine, and to confute them that were aduerſaries to the trueth. And further, that the people (by daily hearyng of holy ſcripture read in the Churche) ſhould continuallye profite more and more in the knowlege of God, and bee the more inflamed with the loue of his true religion. But theſe many yeares paſſed, this Godly and decent ordre of the auncient fathers, hath bee ſo altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in vncertein ſtories, Lege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, Reſpondes, Verſes, vaine repeticions, Commemoracions and Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles, that commonly when any boke of the Bible was begon: before three or foure Chapiters were read out, all the reſt were vnread. And in this ſorte, the boke of Eſaie was begon in Aduent, and the booke of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis in Septuageſima: but they were onely begon, and neuer read tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. After a like ſorte wer other bokes of holy ſcripture vſed. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, whereas ſ. Paule would haue ſuche language ſpoken to the people in the churche, as they mighte vnderſtande and haue profite by hearyng theſame: the ſeruice in this Church of England (theſe many yeares) hath been read in Latin to the people, whiche they vnderſtoode not, ſo that they haue heard with theyr cares onely: &amp; their hartes, ſpirite and minde, haue not been edified thereby. And furthermore, notwithſtandyng that the auncient fathers had deuided the pſalmes into ſeuen porcions: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euery one was called a nocturne: now of late tyme a fewe of them haue been dailye ſayed (and ofte repeated) and the reſt vtterly omitted. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre &amp; hardnes of the rules called the pie, and the manifolde chaunginges of the ſeruice, was the cauſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to turne the boke onlye, was ſo hard and intricate a matter, that many times, there was more buſines to fynd out what ſhould be read, then to read it when it was founde out.</p>
            <p>Theſe inconueniences therfore conſidered: here is ſet furth ſuche an ordre, whereby theſame ſhalbe redreſſed. And for a readines in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, here is drawen out a kalendar for that purpoſe, whiche is plaine and eaſy to be vnderſtanded, wherin (ſo muche as maie be) the readyng of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture is ſo ſet furthe, that all thynges ſhall bee doen in ordre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breakyng one piece therof from another. For this cauſe be cut of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themes, Reſpondes, Inuitatories, and ſuche like thynges, as did breake
<pb facs="tcp:150678:3"/>
the continuall courſe of the readyng of the ſcripture. Yet becauſe there is no remedy, but that of neceſſitie there muſt be ſome rules: therfore certein rules are here ſet furth, whiche as they be fewe in no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre: ſo they be plain and eaſy to be vnderſtanded. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> here you haue an ordre for praier (as touchyng the readyng of holy ſcripture) muche agreable to the mynde &amp; purpoſe of the olde fathers, and a greate deale more profitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, then that whiche of late was vſed. It is more profitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here are left out many thynges, whereof ſome be vntrue, ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certein, ſome vain and ſuperſticious: and is ordeyned nothyng to be read, but the very pure worde of God, the holy ſcriptures, or that whiche is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently grounded vpon the ſame: and that in ſuche a language &amp; ordre, as is moſte eaſy &amp; plain for the vnderſtandyng, bothe of the readers and hearers. It is alſo more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious, bothe for the ſhortnes thereof, &amp; for the plaines of the ordre, &amp; for that the rules be fewe &amp; eaſy. Furthermore, by this ordre, the curates ſhal nede none other bookes for their publique ſeruice, but this boke &amp; the Bible: by the meanes wherof, the people ſhall not be at ſo great charge for bookes, as in tyme paſt they haue been.</p>
            <p>And where heretofore, there hath been great diuerſitie in ſaying and ſynging in churches within this realme: ſome folowyng Salſbury vſe, ſome Herford vſe, ſome the vſe of Bangor, ſome of Yorke, &amp; ſome of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne: Now from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cefurth, all the whole realme ſhall haue but one vſe.</p>
            <p>And if any would iudge this waye more painfull, becauſe that all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges muſt be read vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the boke, where as before, by the reaſon of ſo often repeticion, they could ſaye many thinges by heart: if thoſe men will waye their labor, with the profite in knowlege, whiche dayely they ſhal obtein by readyng vpon the boke, they will not refuſe the payn, in conſideracion of the greate profite that ſhall enſue therof.</p>
            <p>And forſomuche as nothyng can, almoſte, be ſo plainly ſet furth, but doubtes maie riſe in the vſe &amp; practiſyng of the ſame: to appeaſe all ſuche diuerſitie (if any ariſe) and for the reſolucion of all doubtes, concernyng the maner how to vnderſtande, do, and execute the thynges conteygned in this booke: the parties that ſo doubt, or diuerſly take any thyng, ſhall alwaye reſorte to the Biſhop of the Dioceſe, who by his diſcrecion ſhall take ordre for the quietyng and appeaſyng of the ſame: ſo that the ſame ordre be not contrary to any thyng conteigned in this boke.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>Though it be appointed in the afore written preface, that al thinges ſhalbe read and ſonge in the churche, in the Engliſhe tongue, to thende that the congregacion maie be therby edified: yet it is not meante, but when men ſaye Matins and Euenſong priuately, they maye ſaie the ſame in any language that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>And becauſe Ianuary and Marche hath one daye, aboue the ſayed nombre, and February whiche is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely .xxviii. daies, February ſhall borowe of either of the Monethes of Ianuary and Marche one daye, and ſo the Pſalter whiche ſhalbe red in Februarye, muſte bee begon the laſte daye of Ianuary, and ended the firſt daye of Marche.</p>
               <p>And whereas Maie, Iuly, Auguſt, October, and December, haue .xxxi. dayes a piece, it is ordred that theſame Pſalmes ſhall bee redde the laſt daye of the ſaied Monethes, whiche were red the daye before: ſo that the Pſalter maye bee begon agayne the firſt daye of the next Monethes enſuing.</p>
               <p>Now to know what Pſalmes ſhalbe red euery daye, looke in the Kalendar the nombre that is appointed for the Pſalmes, and then finde theſame noum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre in this Table, and vpon that noumbre ſhall you ſe, what Pſalmes ſhalbee ſayd at Matyns, and Euenſong.</p>
               <p>And where the .C.xix. Pſalme is deuided into .xxii. porcions, and is ouer long to bee red at one tyme: it is ſo ordred that at one tyme ſhall not bee red a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue .iiii. or .v. of the ſaied porcions, as you ſhall perceiue to bee noted in this Table.</p>
               <p>And here is alſo to be noted, that in this Table, and in al other partes of the ſeruice, where any Pſalmes are appoincted, the nombre is expreſſed after the greate Engliſhe Bible, whiche from the .ix.

               <p>And the Catholike fayth is this: that we wurſhippe one God in Trinitie, and Trinitie in vnitie.</p>
               <p>Neyther confoundyng the perſones: nor deuydyng the ſubſtaunce.</p>
               <p>For there is one perſon of the father, another of the ſonne: and an other of the holy goſt.</p>
               <p>But the Godhead of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy goſt, is all one: the glory equall, the maieſtie coeternal.</p>
               <p>Suche as the father is, ſuche is the ſonne: and ſuche is the holy goſt.</p>
               <p>The father vncreate, the ſonne vncreate: and the holy goſt vncreate.</p>
               <p>The father incomprehenſible, the ſonne incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: and the holy goſt incomprehenſible.</p>

               <p>And yet they are not three eternalles: but one eternall.</p>
               <p>As alſo there be not three incomprehenſibles, nor three vncreated: but one vncreated, and one incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>So lykewyſe, the father is almightie: the ſonne almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the holy goſt almightie.</p>
               <p>And yet are they not three almighties: but one almighty.</p>
               <p>So the father is God, the ſonne God: and the holy goſt God.</p>
               <p>And yet are they not three Gods: but one God.</p>
               <p>So lykewyſe the father is Lorde, the ſonne Lorde: and the holy goſt Lord.</p>
               <p>And yet not three Lordes: but one Lorde.</p>
               <p>For like as we be compelled by the chriſtian veritie: to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge euery perſon by himſelfe to be God and Lorde:</p>
               <p>So are we forbidden by the Catholike religion: to ſaye there be three Gods, or thee Lordes.</p>
               <p>The father is made of none: neither created nor begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The ſonne is of the father alone: not made nor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

but begotten.</p>
               <p>The holy goſt is of the father and of the ſonne: neyther made nor created, nor begotten, but proceding.</p>
               <p>So there is one father, not three fathers: one ſonne, not three ſonnes: one holy goſt, not three holy goſtes.</p>
               <p>And in this trinitie, none is afore nor after other: none is greater nor leſſe then other.</p>
               <p>But the whole three perſons: be coeternall together and coequall.</p>
               <p>So that in all thinges, as it is afore ſayed: the vnitie in trinitie, and the trinitie in vnitie, is to be wurſhipped.</p>
               <p>He therfore that will be ſaued: muſt thus thinke of the trinitie.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it is neceſſarye to euerlaſtyng ſaluacion: that he alſo beleue rightly in the incarnacion of our Lorde Ieſu Chriſte.</p>
               <p>For the right fayth is that we beleue &amp; confeſſe: that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, the ſonne of God, is God and manne.</p>
               <p>God of the ſubſtaunce of the father, begotten before the worldes: and manne of the ſubſtaunce of his mother, borne in the worlde.</p>
               <p>Perfecte God and perfecte manne: of a reaſonable ſoule, and humayne fleſhe ſubſiſting.</p>
               <p>Equall to the father as touchyng his Godhead: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the father touchyng his manhode.</p>
               <p>Who although he be God and manne: yet he is not two, but one Chriſte.</p>
               <p>One, not by conuerſion of the Godhead into fleſhe: but by takyng of the manhode into God.</p>
               <p>One altogether, not by confuſion of ſubſtaunce: but by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of perſon.</p>
               <p>For as the reſonable ſoule and fleſhe is one manne: So God and man is one Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Who ſuffered for our ſaluacion: deſcended into hell, roſe agayne the thirde daye from the dead.</p>
               <p>He aſcended into heauen, he ſitteth on the righthande of the father, God almightie: from whence he ſhall come to iudge the quicke and dead.</p>
               <p>At whoſe comming all men ſhall ryſe againe with theyr bodyes: and ſhall geue accompte of theyr owne workes.</p>

Thys oyntment myght haue been well ſolde, and geuen to the poore. When Ieſus vnderſtode that, he ſaid vnto them: why trouble ye the woman? for ſhe hath wroughte a good worke vpon me.

Then Iudas (which had betrayed hym) ſeeing that he was condemned, repented himſelfe, and brought againe the .xxx. plates of ſiluer to the chiefe prieſtes and elders, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I haue ſinned, betraying the innocente bloud. And they ſayde: what is that to vs? See thou to that: And he caſt downe the ſiluer plates in the temple, and departed, &amp; went and hanged hymſelfe. And the chiefe prieſtes toke the ſyluer plates, and ſayde: It is not lawfull for to put them into the treaſure, becauſe it is the price of bloude. And they tooke counſel, &amp; bought with them a potters fielde to burye ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in. Wherfore the fielde is called Haceldama, that is, the fielde of bloud, vntil this daye. Then was fulfilled that whiche was ſpoken by Ieremie the Prophete, ſaying: and they toke .xxx. ſyluer plates, the pryce of hym that was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued whome they bought of the children of Iſrael, and gaue them for the potters fielde, as the Lorde appointed me. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſtode before the deputie, and the deputie aſked hym, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Art thou the kyng of the Iewes? Ieſus ſaid vnto him: thou ſaieſt: And when he was accuſed of the chiefe prieſtes and elders, he aunſwered nothyng. Then ſaid Pilate vnto him: heareſt thou not how many witneſſes they lay againſt thee? And he aunſwered hym to neuer a worde: inſomuche that the deputie marueiled greatly. At that feaſt, the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was wont to deliuer vnto the people a priſoner, whome they woulde deſyre. He had then a notable priſoner called
<pb facs="tcp:150678:47"/>
Barrabas. Therfore, when they were gathered together, Pilate ſaid: whether wil ye that I geue loce vnto you, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas, or Ieſus which is called Chriſt? For he knewe that for enuy they had deliuered him. When he was ſet down to geue iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, his wife ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto him, ſaying: haue thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to doe with that iuſt man: For I haue ſuffered many thinges this day in my ſlepe, becauſe of hym. But the chiefe prieſtes and elders perſwaded the people that they ſhoulde aſke Barrabas, &amp; deſtroye Ieſus. The deputie anſwered &amp; ſaid vnto them: whether of the twaine wil ye that I let loce vnto you? They ſayde: Barrabas. Pylate ſayd vnto them: what ſhall I doe then with Ieſus, whyche is called Chriſt? They all ſayd vnto him: let hym be crucifyed. The deputie ſayd: what euill hath he done? But they cryed the more, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: let hym be crucifyed. When Pylate ſawe that he coulde preuayle nothing, but that more buſines was made, he toke water &amp; waſhed hys handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloude of this iuſt perſone, ye ſhal ſee. Then anſwered al the people &amp; ſaide: hys bloud be on vs &amp; on our children. Then let he Barrabas loce vnto them, &amp; ſcourged Ieſus, &amp; deliuered hym to be crucifyed. Then the ſouldiers of the deputie toke Ieſus into the common hall, &amp; gathered vnto him al the company: &amp; they ſtripped him, &amp; put on him a purple robe, &amp; platted a croune of thornes, and put it vpon his head, &amp; a reede in his righte hande, &amp; bowed the knee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym, &amp; mocked hym, ſaying: hayle kyng of the Iewes: &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had ſpit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, they toke the reede &amp; ſmote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they toke the robe of him agayn, &amp; put his owne raiment on him, &amp; led him away to crucifye him. And as they came out, they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a manne of Cirene (named Simon) hym they compelled to beare hys croſſe. And they came vnto the place whyche is called Golgotha, (that is to ſay, a place of dead mens ſculs) &amp; gaue him vineger to drincke mingled with gal. And when he had taſted therof he wolde not drynke. When they had crucified hym, they parted his garmentes, &amp; did caſt lottes: that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the prophet: They parted my garmentes among them, &amp; vpon my veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did thei caſt lottes. And they ſate &amp; watched him there, &amp; ſet vp ouer his head the cauſe of his death written: This

They that paſſed by, reuyled hym, waggyng theyr heades, &amp; ſaying: thou that deſtroyedſt the temple of God, &amp; didſt build it in thre daies, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou be the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, come downe from the croſſe. Lykewiſe alſo the high Prieſtes mocking him, with the Scrybes &amp; elders, ſayde: he ſaued other, himſelfe he cannot ſaue. If he be the kyng of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell let him now come down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, &amp; we will beleue hym. He truſted in God, let him deliuer him nowe, if he will haue him, for he ſaid: I am the ſonne of god. The theues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo which were crucified with him, caſt the ſame in his teeth. From the ſixt houre was there darckenes ouer all the land, vntyl the ninth houre. And about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ninth houre, Ieſus cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a loud voice, ſaying: Ely, Ely, lamaſabathany? that is to ſay: my god, my god, why haſt thou forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me? Some of them that ſtode there, when they heard that, ſayd: This man calleth for Helias. And ſtreight way one of them ran &amp; toke a ſpounge, &amp; when he had filled it ful of vineger, he put it on a reede, &amp; gaue him to drinke. Other ſayd: let be, let vs ſee whether Helias wil come &amp; deliuer hym. Ieſus, when he had cryed agayne with a loude voyce, yelded vp the ghoſte. And beholde, the vayle of the temple dyd rente into two partes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top to the botome, and the yearth did quake, and the ſtones rent, and graues did open, and many bodies of ſainctes, whiche ſlept, aroſe and wente out of the graues after hys reſurreccion, and came into the holy cytie and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto manye. When the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Ieſus, ſawe the yearthquake, and thoſe thinges which happened, they feared greatly, ſaying: Truely, this was the ſonne of God.

and he left hys linnen garment and fled from them naked. And they led Ieſus awaye to the hygheſt Prieſt of all, and with him came all the hye prieſtes, and the Elders, and the Scribes. And Peter folowed hym a great waye of (euen til he was come into the palace of the hye Prieſt) and he ſate with the ſeruauntes, and warmed hymſelfe at the fyre.

Then the hye prieſte rente hys clothes, and ſayde: what nede we any further of witneſſes? ye haue heard blaſphemy, what think ye? And they all condemned hym to be worthye of death. And ſome began to ſpytte at hym, and to couer his face, and to beate hym with fiſtes, &amp; to ſay vnto hym: Areade, and the ſeruauntes buffeted hym on the face. And as Peter was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the palace, there came one of the we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches of the hieſt prieſt, and when ſhe ſaw Peter warming himſelfe, ſhe loked on him, and ſayde: waſt not thou alſo with Ieſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth? And he denied, ſaying: I knowe him not, neither wote I what thou ſayeſte. And he went out into the porche, and the cocke krewe.

And when the ſixt houre was come, darkenes aroſe ouer all the earth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ninth houre.

And he ſayde vnto them: the kinges of nacions reigne ouer them, &amp; they that haue authoritie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, are called gracious Lordes: but ye ſhall not be ſo.

But he that is greateſt among you, ſhalbe as the yonger, and he that is chiefe, ſhalbe as he that doth miniſter. For whether is greater he that ſitteth at meate, or he that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth? Is not he that ſitteth at meate? But I am among you, as he that miniſtreth, Ye are they which haue bydden with me in my temptacions. And I appointed vnto you a kyngdome, as my father hath appointed to me, that ye may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and ſit on ſeates, iudgeyng the .xii. tribes of Iſrael. And the Lorde ſayd: Simon, Simon behold, Sathan hath deſired to ſift you, as it were wheat: But I haue prayed for thee, that thy fayth fayle not. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art conuerted, ſtrength thy brethren. And he ſayd vnto hym: Lorde I am ready to go with thee into prieſon, and to death. And he ſayd: I tell thee Peter, the Cocke ſhall not krowe this daye, tyll thou haue thriſe denied that thou knoweſt me. And he ſayde vnto them: when I ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you without wallet, and ſcrip, and ſhoes, lacked ye any thing? And they ſayd, no. Then ſayd he vnto them: but now he that hath a wallet, let hym take it vp, and likewiſe his ſcrip. And he that hath no ſweord, let hym ſell his coate and bye one. For I ſay vnto you, that yet theſame which is written, muſt be perfourmed in me: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen among the wicked was he reputed: For thoſe thynges whiche are written of me haue an ende. And they ſayed: Lord, behold, here are .ii. ſwordes: and he ſayd vnto them: it is ynough. And he came out, and we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as he was wont) to Mount Oliuete. And the diſciples folowed hym. And when he came to the place, he ſayde vnto them: pray, leſte ye fall into temptacion. And he gate hymſelfe from them about a ſtones caſt, and kneled downe and prayed, ſaying: Father, yf thou wilt, remoue this cup from me: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, not my will, but thyne be fulfilled. And there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Aungel vnto him from heauen, coumfortyng hym. And he was in an agony and prayed the longer: and hys ſweate was lyke droppes of bloud, tricklyng downe to the ground. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he aroſe from prayer, and was come to his diſciples, he founde them ſlepyng for heauineſſe, and he ſayed vnto them: why ſlepe ye? Ryſe and praye, leſte ye fall into temptacion. Whyle he yet ſpake, behold, there came a companye, and he that was called Iudas, one of the .xii.
<pb n="xliij" facs="tcp:150678:53"/>
went before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and preaſed nye vnto Ieſus, to kiſſe hym. But Ieſus ſayd vnto him: Iudas, betrayeſt thou the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of man with a kiſſe? When they whiche were about hym ſawe what would folow, they ſayde vnto him: Lord, ſhall we ſmyte with the ſweorde? And one of them ſmote a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of the hye prieſt, and ſtroke of his ryght eare. Ieſus aunſwered and ſayd: ſuffre ye thus farre forth. And when he touched his eare, he healed hym. Then Ieſus ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hye prieſtes, and rulers of the temple, and the elders, whiche were come to him: Ye be come out as vnto a thefe, weth ſwordes and ſtaues. When I was dayly with you in the temple, ye ſtretched forth no handes againſte me: but this is euen your very houre, and the power of darkenes. Then toke they hym &amp; led hym, &amp; brought him to the hye prieſtes houſe. But Peter folowed a farre of. And when they had kindled a fyer in the middes of the palace, and were ſette downe together: Peter alſo ſate downe among them. But when one of the wenches behelde hym, as he ſate by the fyer (and loked vpon him) ſhe ſayed: this ſame felow was alſo with him. And he denied him, ſaying: wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I knowe hym not. And after a lytle whyle, another ſaw him, and ſayd: thou art alſo of them. And Peter ſayd: man, I am not. And about the ſpace of an houre after, an other affirmed, ſaying: verely, this felowe was with hym alſo, for he is of Galile. And Peter ſayed: man, I wot not what thou ſayeſt. And immediately whyle he yet ſpake, the Cocke krewe. And the Lorde turned backe and loked vpon Peter. And Peter remembred the worde of the Lord, howe he had ſayed vnto him: before the Cocke krowe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe: and Peter went out and wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And the men that tooke Ieſus mocked hym, and ſmote hym: and when they had blindfolded him, they ſtroke hym on the face, and aſked hym, ſaying: Areade, who is it that ſmote thee? And many other thynges deſpitefully ſayde they agaynſt hym. And aſſone as it was daye, the Elders of the people, and the hye prieſtes and Scribes, came together, and led hym into theyr counſell, ſaying: Art thou very Chriſte? tell vs. And he ſayed vnto them: yf I tell you ye will not beleue me, and yf I aſke you, you will not aunſwere me, nor let me goe: hereafter ſhall the ſonne of man ſit on the right hande of the power of God.
<pb facs="tcp:150678:54"/>
Then ſayed they all: Art thou then the ſonne of God? he ſayde: Ye ſaye that I am. And they ſayed: what nede we of any further witnes? for we oure ſelues haue heard of his owne mouth.</p>

And they cryed with loude voyces, requiring that he myght be crucified. And the voyces of them and of the hye prieſtes preuayled.

And there were two euill doers led with him to be ſlaine. And after that thei were come to the place (whiche is called Caluarie) there they crucified hym and the euill doers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.

And the rulers mocked hym with them, ſaying: he ſaued other men, lette hym ſaue himſelfe yf he be very Chriſte the choſen of God.

Ieſus aunſwered hym: If I haue euil ſpoken, beare witneſſe of the euill: But if I haue well ſpoken, why ſmiteſt thou me? And Annas ſente hym bounde vnto Cayphas the hye prieſt. Symon Peter ſtode and warmed himſelf. Then ſayd they vnto him: Art not thou alſo one of his diſciples? He denyed it, &amp; ſayde: I am not. One of the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the hye prieſtes (his coſin whoſe eare Peter ſmote of) ſayed vnto him: did not I ſee thee in the garden with him? Peter therfore denied again: and immediatly the Cocke crewe. Then ledde they Ieſus from Cayphas into the hall of iudgemente. It was in the morninge, &amp; they themſelfes wente not into the iudgemente hall, leſte they ſhoulde be defiled, but that they myghte eate the Paſſeouer. Pilate then went out to them, &amp; ſayd: what accuſacion bringe you againſte this man? They anſwered and ſayd vnto hym: If he were not an euil doer, we would not haue deliuered him vnto thee. Then ſayd Pylate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: take ye him and iudge him after your owne lawe. The Iewes therfore ſayed vnto him: It is not lawfull for vs to put any manne to deathe: that the woordes of Ieſus myght be fulfilled, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhoulde dye. Then Pylate entred into the iudgemente hall againe, &amp; called Ieſus, and ſayed vnto him: Art thou the king of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: ſayeſte thou that of thy ſelfe, or did other tel it thee of me? Pylate anſwered: am I a Iewe? Thine owne nacion, &amp; hye prieſtes haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered thee vnto me: what haſt thou done? Ieſus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: my kyngdome is not of this worlde: yf my kyngdome were of this worlde, then would my miniſters ſurely fight, that I ſhoulde not be deliuered to the Iewes: but nowe is my kingdome not from hence. Pylate therefore ſayed
<pb facs="tcp:150678:59"/>
vnto him: Art thou a kynge then? Ieſus anſwered: thou ſaieſt that I am a king. For this cauſe was I borne, &amp; for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto the trueth. And all that are of the truethe, heare my voyce. Pylate ſayde vnto hym: what thyng is truethe? And when he had ſayd this, he wente out againe vnto the Iewes, &amp; ſayeth vnto them: I finde in him no cauſe at all. Ye haue a cuſtome that I ſhoulde deliuer you one loce at Eaſter: wil ye that I loce vnto you the king of the Iewes? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cried they al again, ſaying: Not him, but Barrabas: theſame Barrabas was a murtherer.<note place="margin">John. xix.</note> Then Pilate toke Ieſus therfore, &amp; ſcourged him. And the ſouldiers wounde a croune of thornes, &amp; put it on his head. And they dyd on him a purple garmente, &amp; came vnto him and ſayed: hayle king of the Iewes: and they ſmote him on the face. Pylate went furth againe, and ſayd vnto them: beholde, I brynge him furth to you, that ye may know that I finde no faulte in him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came Ieſus furth, wearing a crou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of thorne, and a robe of purple. And he ſayth vnto them: beholde the man. When the hye prieſtes therefore and miniſters ſawe hym, they cryed, ſayinge: crucifie hym, crucifie hym. Pylate ſayth vnto them: take ye hym &amp; crucifie him, for I finde no cauſe in him. The Iewes au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered him: we haue a lawe, and by our lawe, he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelfe the ſonne of God. When Pilate heard that ſaying, he was the more afrayed, &amp; went againe into the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hall, &amp; ſayeth vnto Ieſus: whence art thou? But Ieſus gaue him none anſwere. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayd Pilate vnto him: Speakeſte thou not vnto me? knoweſte thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to looce thee? Ieſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: Thou couldeſt haue power at all agaynſte me, excepte it were geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue: Therfore he that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered me vnto thee, hath the more ſinne: And from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furth ſought Pilate meanes to looce him: but the Iewes cryed, ſayinge: yf thou let hym goe, thou arte not Ceſars frende: for whoſoeuer maketh himſelfe a kynge, is againſte Ceſar. When Pilate heard that ſaying, he broughte Ieſus furth, and ſate downe to geue ſentence in a place that is called the Pauement, but in the Hebrue tong Gabbatha. It was the preparinge day of Eaſter, about the. vi. houre. And he ſayeth vnto the Iewes: beholde youre king.
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:150678:59"/>
They cryed, ſaying: away with hym, awaye with hym: crucyfy hym. Pylate ſayeth vnto them: ſhall I crucyfy your kyng? The hye prieſtes aunſwered: we haue no king but Ceſar. Then deliuered he him vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be crucyfied. And they toke Ieſus and ledde hym awaye. And he bare his croſſe, and wente furthe into a place whiche is called the place of dead mennes ſculles: but in Hebrue golgotha: where they crucyfyed hym, and two other with hym: on either ſide one, and Ieſus in the middeſt. And Pilate wrot a title and put it on the croſſe. The writing was, Ieſus of Nazareth kyng of the Iewes. This title read many of the Iewes: for the place where Ieſus was crucified, was nie to the citie. And it was written in Hebrue, Greke, and Latin. Then ſayd the hye prieſtes of the Iewes to Pilate: write not kyng of the Iewes, but that he ſayd: I am kyng of the Iewes. Pilate aunſwered: what I haue wrytten, that haue I written. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſouldiers, when thei had crucified Ieſus, toke his garmentes and made .iiii. partes, to euery ſouldier a parte, and alſo his coate. The coate was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeme, wrought vpon throughout. They ſayed therfore among themſelues: let vs not deuide it, but caſt lottes for it, who ſhall haue it. That the ſcripture might be fulfylled ſaying: They haue parted my rayment among them, and for my coat dyd they caſte lottes. And the ſouldiours dyd ſuche thinges in dede. There ſtode by the croſſe of Ieſus his mother and his mothers ſyſter, Mary the wyfe of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Ieſus therefore ſawe his mother, and the diſciple ſtandynge, whome he loued, he ſaieth vnto his mother: woman, behode thy ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. Then ſayd he to the diſciple: beholde thy mother. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that houre the diſciple toke her for his owne.</p>
                     <p>After theſe thinges, Ieſus knowing that all thynges were now performed, that the ſcripture might be fulfilled, he ſaieth: I thriſt. So there ſtode a veſſel by full of vineger: therfore they filled a ſponge with vineger, and wounde it about with Iſope, and putte it to his mouth. Aſſone as Ieſus then receyued of the vineger, he ſayed: It is finiſhed, and bowed his head and gaue vp the goſte. The Iewes therefore, becauſe it was the preparing of the Sabbothe that the bodyes ſhoulde not remayne vpon the Croſſe on the Sabboth day (for that Sabboth day, was an hie daye)
<pb facs="tcp:150678:60"/>
beſought Pilate, that their legges might be broken, and that they might be taken downe. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came the ſouldiours and brake the legges of the firſte, and of the other whiche was crucified wyth hym. But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe that he was deade already, they brake not his legges: but one of the ſouldiours with a ſpeare thruſt him into the ſide, &amp; forth with came there out bloud and water. And he that ſawe it bare recorde, and his recorde is true. And he knoweth that he ſayeth true, that ye myght beleue alſo. For theſe thinges were done that the ſcripture ſhould be fulfilled: ye ſhall not breake a bone of him.</p>
                     <p>And againe an other ſcripture ſaieth: they ſhall loke vpon him, whom they haue pearced. After this, Ioſeph of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathia (whiche was a diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecretly for feare of the Iewes) beſoughte Pylate that he might take downe the bodye of Ieſus. And Pylate gaue him lycence: He came therfore and tooke the bodye of Ieſus. And there came alſo Nicodemus (whiche at the beginning came to Ieſus by nyght) and brought of myrre and Aloes mingled together, about an hundreth pounde weight. Then tooke they the body of Ieſu, and wounde it in linnen clothes with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burye. And in the place where he was crucified, there was a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and in the garden a newe Sepulchre, wherin was neuer man layd: There layd they Ieſus therefore, becauſe of the preparynge of the Sabbothe of the Iewes, for the Sepulchre was nye at hande.</p>

               <p>¶Secondly, for aſmuche as confirmacion is miniſtred to them that be Baptiſed, that by impoſicion of handes, and prayer, they may receyue ſtrength and defence agaynſt all temptacions to ſinne, and the aſſautes of the worlde, and the deuill: it is moſte mete to be miniſtred, when children come to that age, that partly by the frayltie of their owne fleſhe, partly by the aſſautes of the worlde and the deuill, they begyn to be in daungier to fall into ſynne.</p>
               <p>¶Thirdely, for that it is agreable with the vſage of the churche in tymes paſt, wherby it was ordeined that confirmacion ſhoulde be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to them that were of perfecte age, that they beynge inſtructed in Chriſtes religion, ſhoulde openly profeſſe their owne fayth, and promyſe to be obedyent vnto the wyl of God.</p>
               <p>¶And that no manne ſhall thynke that anye detrymente ſhall come to children by differryng of theyr confirmacion: he ſhal knowe for trueth, that it is certayn by goddes worde, that chyldren beeyng Baptyſed (yf they departe out of thys lyfe in theyr infancye) are vndoubtedly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſte is riſen from the dead, and become the firſte fruites of them that ſlepte. For by a manne came death, and by a manne came the reſurreccion of the dead. For as by Adam all dye: euen ſo by Chriſte ſhall all be made alyue: but euery manne in his owne ordre. The firſte is Chriſte, then they that are Chriſtes at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng. Then commeth the ende, when he hath delyuered vp the kyngdome to God the father, when he hath put downe all rule and all authoritie and power. For he muſt reygne till he haue putte all his enemyes vnder his feete. The laſte enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is death. For he hath put all thinges vnder his feete. But when he ſayeth all thinges are put vnder him, it is manifeſt that he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, whiche did put all thinges vnder hym. When all thynges are ſubdued vnto hym, then ſhall the ſonne alſo hymſelfe be ſubiecte vnto hym that put all thynges vnder him, that God may be all in all. Els what doe they, which are baptized ouer the dead, if the dead ryſe not at all? Why are they then baptized ouer them? Yea, and why ſtand we alwaye then in ieoperdie? By our reioyſing, which I haue in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord, I dye dayly. That I haue fought with beaſtes at Epheſus after the maner of men, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntageth it me, if the dead ryſe not againe? Let vs eate, and drynke, for to morowe we ſhall dye. Be not ye decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: euill wordes corrupt good maners. Awake truely out of ſlepe, and ſinne not. For ſome haue not the knowledge of God. I ſpeake this to youre ſhame. But ſome manne will ſay: howe aryſe the dead? with what body ſhall they come? Thou foole, that whiche thou ſoweſt, is not quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned excepte it dye. And what ſoweſt thou? Thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhalbe: but bare corne, as of weate, or of ſome other: but God geueth it a body at his pleaſure, to euery ſeede his owne body. All fleſhe is not one maner of fleſhe: but there is one maner of fleſhe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, an other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fleſhe of beaſtes, an other of fiſhes, and an other of birdes. There are alſo celeſtiall bodyes, and there are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes terreſtriall. But the glory of the celeſtiall is one, and the glory of the terreſtrial is an other. There is one maner
<pb n="cxlix" facs="tcp:150678:159"/>
glory of the ſunne, and an other glory of the moone, and an other glory of the ſtarres. For one ſtarre differeth from an other in glory. So is the reſurreccion of the deade. It is ſowen in corrupcion, it riſeth agayne in incorrupcion. It is ſowen in diſhonoure, it ryſeth agayne in honoure. It is ſowen in weakenes; it riſeth againe in power. It is ſowen a naturall body, it ryſeth agayne a ſpirituall bodie. There is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body: as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo written: the firſt man Adam was made a lyuing ſoule, and the laſt Adam was made a quicknyng ſpirite. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that is not fyrſt which is ſpirituall: but that whiche is naturall, and then that which is ſpirituall. The firſt man is of the earth, earthy: The ſeconde manne is the Lorde from heauen (heauenly.) As is the earthy, ſuche are they that are earthy. And as is the heauenly, ſuch are they that are heauenly. And as we haue borne the image of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſo ſhal we beare the ymage of the heauenly. This ſaie I brethren, that fleſhe and bloud can not enherite the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: Neither doth corrupcion inherite vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Beholde, I ſhewe you a miſtery. We ſhal not al ſlepe, but we ſhall al be chaunged, and that in a momente, in the twynkelyng of an iye by the laſte trumpe. For the trumpe ſhal blowe, &amp; the dead ſhal riſe incorruptible, and we ſhalbe chaunged. For this corruptible muſt put on incorrupcion:&amp; this mortal muſt put on immortalitie. When this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hath put on incorrupcion, &amp; this mortal hath put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie: then ſhal be brought to paſſe the ſaying that is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Death is ſwalowed vp in victory: Death where is thy ſting?

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F ſuche Ceremonies as be vſed in the Churche, and haue had their beginnyng by thinſtitucion of man: Some at the firſt were of godly intent and purpoſe deuiſed, and yet at length turned to vanitie and ſuperſticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Some entred into the Church by vndiſcrete deuocion, and ſuche a zele as was without knowleage: and forbecauſe they were winked at in the beginning, they grewe dayly to more and more abuſes, whiche not onely for their vnprofitableneſſe, but alſo becauſe they haue muche blynded the people, and obſcured the glory of God, are worthy to be cut away, and cleane reiected. Other there be, whiche although they haue been deuiſed by man: yet it is thought good to reſerue them ſtill, aſwell for a decent ordre in the Churche (for the whiche they were firſt deuiſed) as becauſe they pertaine to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: Wherunto all thynges doen in the Churche (as the Apoſtle teacheth) ought to be referred. And although the kepyng or omittyng of a ceremonie (in it ſelfe conſidered) is but a ſmall thing: Yet the wilful and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and breaking of a common ordre, and diſcipline, is no ſmal offence before God. Let al thinges bee done emong you (ſayeth Saincte Paule) in a ſemely and due ordre. The appointeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te of the which ordre, pertaineth not to priuate menne: Therfore no manne ought to take in hande, nor preſume to appointe or alter any publike or common ordre in Chriſtes Churche, excepte he be lawfully called and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torized therunto. And whereas in this our tyme, the myndes of menne bee ſo diuerſe, that ſome thynke it a greate matter of conſcience to departe from a peece of the leaſte of theyr Ceremonies (they bee ſo addicted to theyr olde cuſtomes) and agayne on the other ſyde, ſome bee ſo newe fangle that they woulde innouate all thyng, and ſo doe deſpyſe the olde that nothyng canne lyke them, but that is newe: It was thought expediente not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:150678:167"/>
muche to haue reſpecte howe to pleaſe and ſatiſfye eyther of theſe parties, as howe to pleaſe God, and profite them bothe. And yet leſte any manne ſhould bee offended (whom good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might ſatiſfie) here be certaine cauſes rendered, why ſome of the accuſtomed Ceremonies be put awaye, and ſome be retained and kept ſtill.</p>
            <p>Some are put awaye, becauſe the great exceſſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them hathe ſo encreaſed in theſe latter daies, that the burthen of them was intollerable: wherof ſaincte Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine in his tyme complained, that they were growen to ſuche a noumbre: that the ſtate of chriſtian people was in wurſe caſe (concerning that matter) then were the Iewes. And he counſayled that ſuche yocke and burthen ſhoulde be taken awaye, as tyme woulde ſerue quietely to doe it. But what woulde ſaincte Auguſtine haue ſayed yf he hadde ſeen the Ceremonies of late dayes vſed among vs? wherunto the multitude vſed in his tyme was not to bee compared. This our exceſſiue multitude of Ceremonies, was ſo great, and many of them ſo darke: that they dyd more confounde, and darken, then declare and ſetteforth Chriſtes benefites vnto vs. And beſides this, Chriſtes Goſpell is not a Ceremoniall lawe (as muche of Moſes lawe was,) but it is a religion to ſerue God, not in bondage of the figure or ſhadowe: but in the freedome of ſpirite, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng contente onelye with thoſe ceremonies whiche doe ſerue to a decente ordre and godlye diſcipline, and ſuche as bee apte to ſtirre vppe the dulle mynde of manne, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of his duetie to God, by ſome notable and ſpeciall ſignificacion, whereby he might bee edified.</p>
            <p>¶Furthermore, the moſt weightie cauſe of the aboliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certaine Ceremonies was, that they were ſo farre abuſed, partely by the ſuperſticious blindenes of the rude and vnlearned, and partelye by the vnſaciable auarice of ſuche as ſoughte more theyr owne lucre then the glorie of God: that the abuſes coulde not well bee taken awaye, the thing remayning ſtyll. But nowe as concerning thoſe perſones, whiche peraduenture will bee offended for that ſome of the olde Ceremonies are retained ſtill: Yf they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyder, that wythoute ſome Ceremonies it is not poſſible to kepe anye ordre or quite diſcipline in the church: they ſhall
<pb n="clvii" facs="tcp:150678:167"/>
eaſilye perceiue iuſte cauſe to refourme theyr iudgementes. And yf they thinke muche that anye of the olde dooe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and woulde rather haue all deuiſed a newe: then ſuche menne (grauntyng ſome Ceremonies conueniente to bee hadde) ſurelye where the olde maye bee well vſed: there they cannot reaſonablye reproue the olde (onelye for their age) withoute bewraying of theyr owne folye. For in ſuch a caſe they oughte rather to haue reuerence vnto them for theyr antiquitie, yf they wyll declare themſelues to bee more ſtudious of vnitie and concorde, then of innouacions and newe fangleneſſe, whiche (as muche as maye bee with the trewe ſetting foorthe of Chriſtes religion) is alwayes to bee eſchewed. Furthermore, ſuche ſhall haue no iuſte cauſe with the Ceremonies reſerued, to bee offended: for as thoſe bee taken awaye whiche were moſte abuſed, &amp; dydde burden mennes conſciences withoute any cauſe: So the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that remaine are retained for a diſcipline, and ordre, whiche (vpon iuſt cauſes) may be altered and chaunged, and therfore are not to be eſtemed egual with goddes lawe. And moreouer they be neyther darke nor dumme ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but are ſo ſet forth that euery man may vnderſtande what they dooe meane, and to what vſe they do ſerue. So that it is not like that they, in time to come, ſhoulde be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed as the other haue been. And in theſe all our dooyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wee condemne no other nacions, nor preſcribe anye thing, but to oure owne people onelye. For we thinke it conueniente that euery countreye ſhould vſe ſuche ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as they ſhall thynke beſte to the ſetting foorth of goddes honour &amp; glorye: and to the reducyng of the people to a moſte perfecte and Godly lyuing, without errour or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticion: and that they ſhoulde putte awaye other thinges, whiche from time to time they perceyue to be moſte abuſed, as in mennes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces it often chaunceth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſlye in diuerſe countreyes. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>
