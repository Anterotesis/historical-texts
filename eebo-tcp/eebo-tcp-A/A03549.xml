         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Although the eternall and incomprehensible maiestie of God, the Lorde of heauen and earth, <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> whose seate is heauen, &amp; the earth his footestole, can not be inclosed in temples or houses made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6498:3"/>
with mans hande, as in dwelling places able to receaue or conteyne his maiestie, accordyng as is euidently declared by the prophete Esaias, and by the doctrine of saint Steuen, and saint Paul <note place="margin">Esai. 16. Act. 7. 17,</note> in the Actes of the Apostles. And where kyng Salomon (who builded vnto the Lorde the most glorious temple that euer was made) sayth, Who shalbe able to buylde a meete or worthye house for hym? if heauen, and the heauen aboue all heauens can not contayne hym: howe muche lesse can that whiche I haue builded? And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confesseth: What am I, that I shoulde be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to buylde thee an house O Lord? But yet for <note place="margin">3. Reg. 8. 2. Par. 2, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> this purpose only it is made, that thou mayest regarde the prayer of thy seruaunt and his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble supplication. Muche lesse then be our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches meete dwellyng places to receaue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible maiestie of God. And in deede, the cheefe and speciall temples of God, wherein he hath greatest pleasure, and moste delyghteth to dwell and continue in, are the bodyes and myndes of true Christians, and the chosen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD, accordyng to the doctrine of the holye scripture, declared in the firste Epistle to the Corinthians. Knowe ye not (sayth Saint Paul) that ye be the temple of God, and that the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> spirite of God dwelleth in you? If any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyle the temple of God, hym wyll God destroye. For the temple of God is holy, which ye are. And agayne in the same Epistle: Knowe ye not that <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6,</note> your body is the temple of the holye ghost dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng in you, whom ye haue geuen you of God, and that ye be not your owne? for ye are dearely
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6498:4"/>
bought. Glorifie ye nowe therefore God in your body, and in your spirite, whiche are Gods. And therefore as our sauiour Christe teacheth in the Gospell of saint John, they that worshyp God <note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> the father in spirite and trueth, in what place so euer they do it, worshyp hym a ryght: for suche worshyppers doth God the father looke for. For God is a spirite, &amp; those that worshyp hym, must worship him in spirit and trueth, sayth our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christe. Yet all this notwithstandyng, the material Church or temple is a place appoynted aswell by the vsage and continuall examples ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the olde Testament, as in the newe, for the people of God to resort together vnto, there to heare Gods holy worde, to call vpon his holy name, to geue hym thankes for his innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnspeakeable benefites bestowed vppon vs, and duely and truely to celebrate his holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes (In the vnfayned doyng and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyshyng of the whiche, standeth that true and right worshipping of God afore mentioned) and the same Churche or temple, is by the scriptures both of the olde Testament and the newe, called the house and temple of the Lorde, for the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier seruice there done to his maiestie by his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; for the effectuous presence of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye grace, where with he by his sayde holye word endueth his people so there assembled. And to the sayde house or temple of God, at all tymes by common order appoynted, are all people that be godly in deede, bounde with all diligence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorte, vnlesse by sicknesse or other moste vrgente causes they be letted therefro. And all the same
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6498:4"/>
so resortyng thyther, ought with all quietnesse and reuerence there to behaue them selues, in doing their bounden duetie &amp; seruice to almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, in the congregation of his Saintes. All which thinges are euident to be prooued by Gods holye worde, as hereafter shall playnelye appeare.</p>
               <p>And firste of all, I wyll declare by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that it is called (as it is indeede) the house of God, and temple of the Lorde. He that swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the temple (sayth our sauiour Christe) <note place="margin">Mat. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And in the booke of the Psalmes, the Prophete Dauid sayth, I wyll <note place="margin">Psal. 5.</note> enter into thyne house, I wyll worshyp in thy holy temple, in thy feare.

Act. 3.</note> storie of the Actes it is mentioned, how that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; John went vp into the temple at the houre of prayer.

And as in all conuenient places, prayer may be vsed of the godly priuately: So it is most certaine, that the Churche or temple is the due and appoynted place for common and publique prayer.</p>
               <p>Nowe that it is lykewise the place of thankes geuyng vnto the Lorde for his innumerable and vnspeakeable benefites bestowed vppon vs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth notably in the latter ende of the Gospell of saint Luke, and the begynnyng of the storie of the Actes, where it is written that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <note place="margin">Luke. 24. Act. 2.</note> and disciples after the assention of the lord, continued with one accorde dayly in the temple, alwayes praysyng and blessyng God.</p>
               <p>And it is lykewyse declared in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, that the Churche is the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> due place appoynted for the reuerent vse of the Sacramentes. It remayneth nowe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <note place="margin">Act. 13.</note> that the Churche or temple is the place where the lyuely worde of God (and not mans inuentions) ought to be read &amp; taught, and that the people are bounde thyther with all diligence to resort: and this proofe likewise to be made by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6498:5"/>
the scriptures, as hereafter shall appeare.</p>
               <p>In the storie of the actes of the apostles, we reade that Paul and Barnabas preached the worde of God in the temples of the Jewes at Salamine. And when they came to Antiochia, they entred on the Sabbath day into the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue or Churche, and sate downe, and after the lesson or readyng of the lawe and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, the ruler of the temple sent vnto them, saying: Ye men and brethren, yf anye of you haue any exhortation to make vnto the people, saye it. And so Paul standyng vp, and makyng scilence with his hande, sayde? Ye men that be Israelites, and ye that feare God, geue eare, and so foorth, preachyng to them a sermon out of the scriptures, as there at large appeareth. And in the same storie of the actes, the seuenteenth <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> Chapter, is testified howe Paul preached Christ out of the Scriptures at Thessalonica. And in <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> the fifteenth Chapter, James the apostle in that holy councell and assemblie of his felowe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles sayth, Moyses of olde tyme hath in euery Citie certayne that preache hym in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues or temples, where he is read euerye Sabbath day. By these places ye maye see the vsage of readyng of the Scriptures of the olde Testament among the Jewes in theyr Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues euery Sabbath daye, and sermons vsually made vpon the same. Howe muche more then is it conuenient that the Scriptures of God, and specially the Gospell of our sauiour Christ, should be read and expounded to vs that be Christians in our Churches, speciallye our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6498:6"/>
sauiour Christe and his apostles allowyng this most godly and necessarie vsage, and by theyr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples confirming the same.</p>
               <p>It is written in the stories of the Gospels in <note place="margin">Mat. 4. Mark. i. Luk. 4. Mat. 13. 20. Mark. 6. Luk. 13.</note> diuers places, that Jesus went rounde about all Galilee, teachyng in theyr Synagogues, &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospell of the kyngdome: In which places is his great diligence in continuall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng and teachyng of the people, most euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set foorth.</p>
               <p>In Luke ye reade, howe Jesus accordyng to <note place="margin">Luk. 4.</note> his accustomed vse came into the temple, and howe the booke of Esaias the prophete was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him, howe he read a text therein, &amp; made a sermon vpon the same.</p>
               <p>And in the. xix. is expressed howe he taught <note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note> dayly in the temple. And it is thus written in the. viii. of John: Jesus came agayne earlye in <note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> the mornyng into the temple, and all the people came vnto hym, and he sate downe and taught them. And in the. xviii. of John, our sauiour testifieth before Pilate, that he spake openly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Iohn. 18.</note> the world, and that he alwayes taught in the Synagogue and in the temple, whyther all the Jewes resorted, and that secretely he spake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And in saint Luke: Jesus taught in the <note place="margin">Luk. 21.</note> temple, and all the people came early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto hym, that they myght heare hym in the temple.</p>
               <p>Here ye see aswell the diligence of our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in teaching the worde of God in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dayly, and specially on the Sabbath dayes, as also the redynesse of the people resortyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6498:6"/>
and that early in the morning, into the Temple to heare hym.</p>
               <p>The same example of diligence in preachyng the worde of God in the Temple, shall ye fynde in the Apostles, and the people resortyng vnto them. Act. the. v. Howe the Apostles, although they had ben whypped and scourged the day before, and by the hygh priest commaunded that they shoulde preache no more in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, yet the day folowyng they entred earlye in the mornyng into the Temple, and dyd not ceasse to teache and declare Jesus Christe. And in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye other places of the storye of the Actes, ye shall fynde lyke diligence both in the Apostles in <note place="margin">Act. 13. 15. 17.</note> teachyng, and in the people in commyng to the temple to heare Gods worde. And it is testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the first of Luke, that when Zacharie the <note place="margin">Luke. 1.</note> holy priest, and father to John baptist, dyd sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice within the temple, al the people stoode with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a long tyme praying, suche was theyr zeale and feruencie at that tyme. And in the seconde <note place="margin">Luke. 2.</note> of Luke appeareth what great iourneyes men, women, yea and chyldren tooke, to come to the temple on the feast day, there to serue the Lorde, and specially the example of Joseph, the blessed virgin Marie mother to our Sauiour Jesus Christe, and of our sauiour Christe hym selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng yet but a child, whose examples are worthy for vs to folowe. So that yf we woulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our negligence in resortyng to the house of the Lorde there to serue hym, to the diligence of the Jewes in commyng dayly verye early, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6498:7"/>
great iourneyes to theyr temple, and when the multitude coulde not be receaued within the temple, the feruent zeale that they had, declared in standyng long without and praying: We may iustly in this comparison condemne our slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and negligence, yea playne contempt in comming to the Lordes house, standyng so nere vnto vs, so seldome, and scarcely at none time. So farre is it from a great many of vs to come early in the morning, or geue attendaunce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, who disdayne to come into the temple, and yet we abhorre the verye name of the Jewes when we heare it, as of a moste wycked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly people. But it is to be feared, that in this poynt we be farre worse then the Jewes, and that they shall ryse at the day of iudgement to our condemnation, who in comparison to them, shewe suche slackenesse and contempt in resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng to the house of the Lorde, there to serue him, according as we are of duetie most bounde. And besides this moste horrible dread of Gods iust iudgement in the great day, we shall not in this lyfe escape his heauie hande and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce for this contempt of the house of the Lord and his due seruice in the same, accordyng as the Lorde him selfe threatneth in the firste Chapter of his prophete Aggeus after this sort: Because you haue left my house desert and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payne <note place="margin">Agge. 1.</note> (sayth the Lorde) and ye haue made haste euery man to his owne house, for this cause are the heauens stayed ouer you that they shoulde geue no deaw, and the earth is forbidden that it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6498:7"/>
shall bryng foorth his fruite, and I haue called drought vpon the earth, and vppon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, and vpon corne, and vpon wyne, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon oyle, and vpon al things that the earth brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth, and vpon men, and vppon beastes, and vpon all thynges that mens handes labour for. Beholde, yf we be such worldlinges that we care not for the eternall iudgementes of GOD, (whiche yet of all other are moste dreadfull and horrible) we shall not escape the punishment of God in this worlde by drought and famine, and the takyng away of all worldlye commodities, whiche we as worldlinges seeme only to regard and care for. Whereas on the contrary part, yf we woulde amende this faulte or negligence, slouthfulnesse and contempt of the house of the Lorde, and his due seruice there, and with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence resort thither together, to serue the Lorde with one accorde and consent, in all holines and ryghteousnesse before hym: we haue promises of benefites both heauenly and worldly. Whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> two or three be gathered in my name (saieth our sauiour Christ) there am I in the middest of them. And what can be more blessed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue our sauiour Christe amongst vs? Or what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine can be more vnhappy or mischeuous, then to driue our sauiour Christe from amongst vs, and to leaue a place for his and our most aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and mortall enemie the olde dragon and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent Satan the deuyll in the middest of vs?</p>
               <p>In the second of Luke it is written, how that <note place="margin">Luk. 2.</note> the mother of Christ and Joseph, when they had long sought Christ whom they had lost, &amp; coulde
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6498:8"/>
finde hym no where, that at the last they founde hym in the temple, sittyng in the middest of the doctours. So if we lacke Jesus Christe, that is to say, the sauiour of our soules and bodyes, we shall not finde hym in the market place, or in the guylde hal, much lesse in the alehouse or tauerne amongst good felowes (as they call them) so soone as we shall fynde hym in the temple the Lordes house, amongst the teachers and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of his worde, where in deede he is to be founde. And as concerning worldly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, we haue a sure promise of our sauiour Christe: Seke ye first the kingdome of God, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse therof, and al these thinges shal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all be geuen vnto you. And thus we haue in the first part of this Homilee declared by gods word, that the Temple or Churche is the house of the Lorde, for that the seruice of the Lorde (as tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and hearing of his holy worde, calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his holye name, geuyng thankes to hym for his great and innumerable benefites, and due ministring of his sacraments) is there vsed. And it is lyke wyse declared alredy by the scriptures, howe all godly and Christian men and women ought at tymes appoynted, with diligence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort vnto the house of the Lord, there to serue hym, and to glorifie hym, as he is most worthy, and we most bounde, to whom be all glory and honor world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ende,</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was declared in the firste part of this Homilee, by gods word, that the temple or Churche is the house of the lord, for that the seruice of the Lorde (as teaching &amp; hearyng of his holy worde, calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his holy name, geuyng thankes to hym for his great and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable benefites, and due ministring of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes) is there vsed. And it is lyke wyse alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy declared by the scriptures, how all godly and christian men &amp; women, ought at times appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with diligence to resort vnto the house of the Lorde, there to serue him, and to glorifie hym, as he is most worthy, and we most bounden.</p>
               <p>Nowe it remayneth in this second parte of the Homilee concernyng the ryght vse of the temple of God, to be likewyse declared by Gods worde, with what quietnesse, scilence, and reuerence, those that resort to the house of the Lord, ought there to vse and behaue them selues.</p>
               <p>It may teache vs sufficiently how well it doth become vs christian men reuerently to vse the Churche and holy house of our prayers, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in how greate reuerence and veneration the Jewes in the olde lawe had their Temple, whiche appeareth by sundrye places, whereof I wyll note vnto you certayne. In the xxvi. of <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> Matthewe, it was laide to our sauiour Christes charge before a temporall iudge, as a matter
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6498:9"/>
worthy death, by the two false witnesses, that he had sayde, he could destroy the temple of GOD, and in three dayes buylde it agayne, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but yf they might make men to beleue that he had sayde any thyng agaynst the honour and maiestie of the temple, he should seeme to al men moste worthy of death. And in the. xxi. of the Actes, when the Jewes found Paul in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Actes. 21.</note> they layde handes vppon hym, crying: Ye men Israelies helpe, this is that man who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all men euery where agaynst the people and the lawe, and agaynst this place: besydes that, he hath brought the Gentiles into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hath prophaned this holy place. Behold howe they tooke it for a lyke offence to speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the temple of God, as to speake agaynst the lawe of God, and howe they iudged it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that none but godly persons and the true worshippers of God, should enter into the temple of GOD. And the same fault is layde to Paules charge by <hi>Tertullus</hi> an eloquent man, and by the Jewes in the. xxiiii. of the Actes, before a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall <note place="margin">Act. 24.</note> Judge, as a matter worthy death, that he went about to pollute the temple of GOD. And in the. xxvii. of Matthewe, when the cheefe priestes had receaued agayne the peeces of siluer <note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> at Judas hande, they sayde, It is not lawfull to put them into <hi>Corban</hi> (whiche was the treasure house of the temple) because it is the price of blood. So that they coulde not abyde that not onely any vncleane person, but also any other dead thyng that was iudged vncleane, shoulde once come into the temple, or any place thereto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6498:9"/>
belonging. And to this ende is saint Paules say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng in the second Epistle to the Corinthians the <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> vi. Chapter to be applyed: What felowshippe is there betwixt righteousnes, &amp; vnrighteousnes? or what communion betwene light &amp; darknesse? or what concorde betweene Christe and Beliall? or what part can the faythfull haue with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythful? or what agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t can there be betwene the temple of God and images? Which sentence, although it be cheefly referred to the temple of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynde of the godlye: yet seeyng that the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and pith of the argument is taken from the material temple, it enforceth that no vngodlines, specially of images or idols, may be suffred in the temple of God, whiche is the place of worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng God: and therefore can no more be suffered to stande there, then light can agree with darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or Christ with Belial: for that the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of god, and the worshipping of images, are moste contrarye. And the settyng of them vp in the place of worshyppyng, may geue great occasion to the worshyppyng of them. But to turne to the reuerence that the Jewes had to their temple. You will say they honoured it su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously, &amp; a great deale to much, crying out, the temple of the Lorde, the temple of the Lorde, being notwithstanding most wicked in life, &amp; be therfore most iustly reproued of Jeremie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete <note place="margin">Hier. 7.</note> of the Lorde. Trueth it is, that they were superstitiously geuen to the honouryng of theyr temple: But I woulde we were not as farre to short from the due reuerence of the Lords house, as they ouershot them selues therein. And if the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6498:10"/>
prophete iustlye reprehended them, hearken also what the Lord requireth at our handes, that we may know whether we be blame worthy or no.</p>
               <p>It is written in Ecclesiastes the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: When thou doest enter into the house of God <note place="margin">Eccle. 4.</note> (saith he) take heede to thy feete, draw neare that thou mayest heare, for obedience is muche more worth then the sacrifice of fooles, whiche know not what euill they do. Speake nothyng rashly there, neyther let thyne heart be swyft to vtter wordes before God. For God is in heauen, and thou art vpon the earth, therfore let thy wordes be fewe. Note (welbeloued) what quietnesse in gesture and behauiour, what scilence in talke &amp; wordes, is required in the house of God, for so he calleth it. See whether they take heede to theyr feete, as they be here warned, which neuer ceasse from vncomely walking and ietting vp &amp; downe and ouerthwarte the Churche, shewyng an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent signification of notable contempt, both of God, and all good men there present: and what heede they take to their tounges, &amp; speach, which do not only speake wordes swiftly and rashly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lorde (whiche they be here forbydden) but also often tymes speake fylthyly, couetously, and vngodly, talkyng of matters scarce honest or fytte for the alehouse or tauerne, in the house of the Lorde, lytle consyderyng that they speake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who dwelleth in heauen (as is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) when they be but vermins here creeping vpon the earth, in camparison to his eternall maiestie, and lesse regarding that they must geue an accompt at the great day, of euery ydle worde <note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:6498:10"/>
whersoeuer it be spoken, muche more of fylthye, vncleane, or wicked words spoken in the Lordes house, to the great dishonour of his maiestie, and offence of all that heare them. And in deede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the people and multitude, the temple is prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be hearers, rather then spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, consyderyng that aswell the word of god is there read or taught, whereunto they are bound to geue diligent eare with all reuerence and sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as also that common prayer and thankes geuyng are rehearsed and sayde by the publique minister in the name of the people &amp; the whole multitude present, wherunto they geuyng their redye audience, shoulde assent and say Amen, as S. Paul teacheth in the firste Epistle to the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> Corinthians. And in another place, glorifiyng God, with one spirite and mouth: which can not be when euery man and woman in seuerat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of deuotion, prayeth priuately, one askyng, another geuyng thankes, another readyng doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, &amp; forceth not to heare the common prayer of the minister. And peculierly, what due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is to be vsed in the ministring of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes in the temple, the same saint Paul <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> teacheth in his Epistle to the Corinthians, rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng suche as dyd vnreuerently vse them selues in that behalfe. Haue ye not houses to eate and drynke in (sayth he?) Do ye despise the Churche or congregation of God? What shall I saye to you? Shall I prayse you? In this I prayse you not. And God requireth not onely this outward reuerence of behauiour and scilence in his house, but al inward reuerence in clensing of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6498:11"/>
thoughtes of our heartes, threatning by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Ose in the. ix. Chapter, that for the malice <note place="margin">Ose. 9.</note> of the inuentions and deuises of the people, he will cast them out of his house: whereby is also signified the eternall castyng of them out of his heauenlye house and kyngdome, whiche is most horrible. And therefore in the. 19. of Leuit. God sayth, Feare you with reuerence my sanctuarye, <note place="margin">Leui. 19.</note> for I am the Lorde. And accordyng to the same the prophete Dauid sayth, I wyll enter into <note place="margin">Psal. 5.</note> thine house, I wyll worshyp in thy holy temple in thy feare: shewyng what inward reuerence and humblenes of mynde the godly men ought to haue in the house of the Lorde. And to alleage some what concerning this matter out of the newe Testament, in what honour God woulde haue his house or temple kepte, and that by the example of our sauiour Christe, whose auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ought of good reason with all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">Mat. 21. Mark. 11. Luk. 19. Iohn. 11.</note> to be of most wayght and estimation: It is written of all the foure Euangelistes, as a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acte, and worthy to be testified by many holy witnesses, how that our sauiour Jesus Christe, that mercifull and mylde Lorde, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared for his meekenesse to a sheepe, suffring with scilence his fleece to be shorne from him, and to a lambe led <note place="margin">Esai. 53. Act. 8.</note> without resistaunce to the slaughter, whiche gaue his body to them that dyd smyte hym, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered not hym that reuiled, nor turned away his face from them that dyd reproche hym and <note place="margin">Esai. 50. Mat. 5.</note> spit vpon him, and accordyng to his owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, gaue preceptes of mildnes and sufferaunce to his disciples: Yet when he seeth the temple and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6498:11"/>
holy house of his heauenly father misordred, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and prophaned, vseth great seueritie and sharpenes, ouerturneth the tables of thexchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, subuerteth the seates of them that solde doues, maketh a whip of cordes, and scourgeth out those wicked abusers and prophaners of the temple of God, saying, My house shalbe called the house of prayer, but ye haue made it a den of theeues. And in the. ii. of John, Do not ye make <note place="margin">Iohn. 2.</note> the house of my father, the house of marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize. For as it is the house of GOD, when Gods seruice is duely done in it: So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we wickedly abuse it with wicked talke or couetous bargay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we make it a den of theeues, or an house of marchaundize. Yea, and suche reuerence woulde Christe shoulde be therein, that he woulde not <note place="margin">Mar. 11.</note> suffer any vessell to be caryed through the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And where as our saniour Christe (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned out of S. Luke) coulde be founde no where (when he was sought) but only in the temple amongst the doctours, and nowe agayne exerciseth his aucthoritie and iurisdiction, not in castles and princely palaces amongst souldiers, but in the temple: Ye may hereby vnderstande in what place his spirituall kyngdome (whiche he denyeth to be of this worlde) is sonest to be founde, and best to be knowen of all places in this worlde. And accordyng to this example of our sauiour Christe in the primitiue Churche, which was most holy &amp; godly, and in the which due discipline with seueritie was vsed agaynst the wicked, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offenders were not suffered once to enter into the house of the Lorde, nor admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6498:12"/>
to common prayer, and the vse of the holye Sacramentes with other true Christians, vntil they had done open penaunce before the whole Churche.

Against the which <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.

And secondly, the testimonies of the holy and ancient learned fathers and doctours, out of their owne workes and auncient histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ecclesiasticall, both that you may at once knowe their iudgementes, and withall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande what maner of ornamentes were in the temples in the primatiue church in those times, whiche were moste pure and sincere. Thirdly, the reasons and argumentes made for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of images or idols, and the outragious dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of temples and Churches, with golde, syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, pearle, and pretious stone, shalbe confuted, and so this whole matter concluded. But least any shoulde take occasion by the way of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng by wordes or names, it is thought good heere to note first of all, that although in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speache we vse to call the lykenesse or simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men or other thynges images, and not idols: yet the scriptures vse the saide two wordes (idols and images) indifferently for one thyng alway.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, Saint Hierome lyke wyse translateth <hi>Simulacrum,</hi> as in all other lyke pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of scripture vsually he doth so translate. And <note place="margin">Libr. de corona militis.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a most ancient doctour, and wel lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in both the tongues, Greeke &amp; Latin, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretyng this place of Saint John, Beware of idols, that is to say (sayeth <hi>Tertullian)</hi> of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them selues: The Latin wordes whiche he vseth, be <hi>Effigies</hi> and <hi>Imago,</hi> to say, an image. And therfore it forceth not, whether in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse we vse the one terme or the other, or both together, seyng they both (though not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Englishe speache, yet in scripture) signifie one thyng. And though some, to blynde mens eyes, haue heretofore craftily gon about to make them to be taken for wordes of diuers significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in matters of religion, and haue therefore vsually named the lykenesse or similitude of a thyng set vp amongst the heathen in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or other places to be worshipped, an idoll. But the lyke similitude with vs, set vp in the Churche, the place of worshippyng, they call an image, as though these two wordes (idoll and image) inscripture, dyd differ in proprietie and sense, whiche (as is aforesayde) differ onely in sound and language, and in meaning be in dede all one, specially in the scriptures and matters
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6498:15"/>
of religion. And our images also haue ben, and be, and yf they be publiquely suffred in Churches and temples, euer wilbe also worshipped, and so idolatrie committed to them, as in the last part of this Homilie, shall at large be declared and proued. Wherefore our images in temples and Churches, be in deede none other but Idols, as vnto the whiche idolatrie hath ben, is, and euer wyll be committed.</p>
               <p>And first of all, the scriptures of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, condemnyng and abhorring aswell all idolatrie or worshyppyng of images, as also the very idols or images them selues, speciallye in temples, are so many and plentiful, that it were almoste an infinite worke, and to be conteyned in no small volume, to recorde all the places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same. For when God had chosen to him selfe a peculier and speciall people from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all other nations that knewe not God, but worshypped idols and false gods: he gaue vnto them certayne ordinaunces and lawes, to be kept and obserued of his sayde people. But concerning none other matter did he geue either mo, or more earnest and expresse lawes to his sayde people, then those that concerned the true worshyppyng of hym, and the auoyding and flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of idols and images, and idolatrie: for that, that both the sayde idolatrie is moste repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt to the ryght worshipping of him and his true glorye aboue all other vices, and that he knewe the pronenesse and inclination of mans corrupt kynde and nature, to that most odious
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6498:16"/>
and abominable vice. Of the whiche ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and lawes so geuen by the Lorde to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple concerning that matter, I wyll rehearse and alleage some that be moste speciall for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that you by them may iudge of the rest.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Chapter of the booke named Deuteronomie, is a notable place, and most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with all diligence to be marked, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynneth <note place="margin">Deut. 4. Num. 23.</note> thus: And nowe Israel heare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes and iudgements which I teach thee (sayth the Lorde) that thou doyng them, mayest liue, and enter &amp; possesse the lande which the Lorde God of your fathers wyll geue you. Ye shall put nothyng to the worde whiche I speake to you, neyther shall ye take anye thyng from it. Kepe ye the commaundementes of the Lorde your God, which I commaund you. And by and by after he repeateth the same sentence three or foure tymes, before he come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he woulde specially warne them of, as it were for a preface, to make them to take the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heede vnto it. Take heede to thy selfe (sayth he) and to thy soule, with all carefulnes, lest thou forgettest the thynges whiche thyne eyes haue seene, and that they go not out of thy heart all the dayes of thy life, thou shalt teach them to thy children and nephues, or posteritie. And shortly after, The Lorde spake vnto you out of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of fire, but you hearde the voyce or sounde of his wordes, but you did see no fourme or shape at al. And by and by foloweth, Take heede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diligently vnto your soules, you sawe no maner of image in the day in the which the lord
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6498:16"/>
spake vnto you in Horeb, out of the myddest of the fyre, least peraduenture, you beyng deceaued, shoulde make to your selues any grauen image, or lykenesse of man or woman, or the lykenesse of any beaste whiche is vppon the earth, or of the birdes that flee vnder heauen, or of any creeping thing that is moued on the earth, or of the fishes that do continue in the waters: leste paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou lyftyng vp thyne eyes to heauen, do see the sunne and the moone, and the starres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and so thou being deceaued by errour, shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest honour and worshyp them whiche the Lord thy God hath created to serue all nations that be vnder heauen. And agayne: Beware that thou forget not the couenaunt of the Lorde thy God, whiche he made with thee, and so make to thy selfe any carued image of them whiche the Lorde hath forbidden to be made: for the Lorde thy God is a consumyng fyre, and a ielous God. If thou haue chyldren and nephues, and do tary in the lande, and beyng deceaued do make to your selues any similitude, doyng euyll before the Lord your GOD, and prouoke hym to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: I do this day call vppon heauen and earth to wytnesse, that ye shall quicklye peryshe out of the lande whiche you shall possesse, you shall not dwell in it anye long tyme, but the Lorde wyll destroye you, and wyll scatter you amongst all nations, and ye shall remayne but a verye fewe amongst the nations, whyther the Lorde wyll leade you away, and then shall you serue gods whiche are made with mans handes, of wood and stone, whiche see not, and heare not, neyther
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6498:17"/>
eate, nor smell, and so foorth. This is a notable Chapter, and entreateth almoste altogether of this matter. But because it is to lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to write out the whole, I haue noted you certayne principall poyntes out of it. First, howe earnestly and ofte he calleth vpon them to marke &amp; to take heede, &amp; that vpon the perill of their soules, to the charge which he geueth them. Then, howe he forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by a solemne &amp; long rehearsal of all thinges in heauen, in earth, and in the water, any image or lykenes of any thyng at all to be made. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what penaltie and horrible destruction, he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly, with inuocation of heauen &amp; earth for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, denounceth and threatneth to them, their children, and posteritie, if they contrary to this commaundement, do make or worshyppe anye images or similitude, which he so straightly hath forbidden. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they, this notwithstanding, partlye by inclination of mans corrupte nature moste prone to idolatrie, and partly occasioned by the Gentiles and Heathen people dwellyng about them, who were idolaters, dyd fall to the makyng and worshyppyng of Images: GOD accordyng to his worde, brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them all those plagues whiche he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with, as appeareth in the bookes of the kinges and the Chronacles, in sundrye pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at large. And agreeable hereunto are many other notable places in the olde Testament. Deuteronomie. xxvii. Cursed be he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a carued image, or a cast or moulten image, whiche is abomination before the Lorde, the worke of the artificers hand, and setteth it vp in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6498:17"/>
a secret corner, and all the people shall say Amen.</p>
               <p>Reade the, xiii. and. xiiii. Chapters of the booke of wysedome, concernyng idols or images, howe they be made, set vp, called vppon, and offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and how he prayseth the tree whereof the gybbet is made, as happye, in comparison to the tree that an image or idoll is made of, euen by these very wordes, Happie is the tree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through ryghteousnesse commeth, (meaning the gybbet) but cursed is the idoll that is made with handes: yea, both it, and he that made it, and so foorth. And by and by he sheweth how that the thynges whiche were the good creatures of God before (as trees or stones) when they be once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and fashioned into images to be worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, become abhomination, a temptation vnto the soules of men, and a snare for the feete of the vnwyse. And why? the seekyng out of images, is the begynnyng of whoredome (sayth he) and the bryngyng vp of them, is the destruction of lyfe: for they were not from the begynnyng, neyther shall they contynue for euer. The welthy idlenesse of men hath founde them out vppon earth, therefore shall they come shortlye to an ende, and so foorth to the ende of the Chapter, conteynyng these poyntes: Howe idols or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were fyrste inuented, and offered vnto, how by an vngratious custome they were estably<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, how tyrauntes compell men to worshyppe them, how the ignoraunt and the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are deceaued by the cunnyng of the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the beawty of the image, to do honour vnto it, and so to erre from the knowledge of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6498:18"/>
God, and of other great and many mischefes that come by images. And for a conclusion he sayth, that the honouring of abhominable images, is the cause, the begynnyng, and ende of all euyll, and that the worshippers of them be either mad, or most wycked. See and view the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with diligence, for it is worthy to be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydered, speciallie that is wrytten of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the simple and vnwyse common people by idols and images, and repeated twyse or thrise least it shoulde be forgotten. And in the Chapter <note place="margin">Sapi. 15.</note> folowyng be these wordes: The paynting of the picture and carued image with dyuers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, enticeth the ignoraunt so, that he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and loueth the picture of a dead image that hath no soule. Neuerthelesse, they that loue such euyll thynges, they that trust in them, they that make them, they that fauour them, and they that honour them, are all worthy of death, and so foorth.</p>

he hath set foorth the incomprehensible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God, he asketh to whom then wyll ye make God lyke? Or what similitude wyll ye set vp vnto hym? Shall the Caruer make hym a carued image? and shall the Goldsmyth couer hym with Golde, and cast hym into a fourme of syluer plates? And for the poore man, shal the image maker frame an image of tymber, that he maye haue somewhat to set vp also? And after this he cryeth out: O wretches, hearde ye neuer of this? Hath it not ben preached vnto you since the begynnyng, and so foorth, how by the creation of the worlde, and the greatnesse of the worke, they myght vnderstande the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God, the Creator and Maker of all, to be greater then that it shoulde be expressed, or set foorth in anye image or bodilye similitude?

Thirdely, that they haue no power to do good nor harme to others, though some of them haue an axe, some a sworde, some a speare in their handes, yet do theeues come into their Temples and robbe them, and they can not once stur to defend them selues from the theeues: nay if the Temple or Churche be set a fyre, that their

               <p>First the Scriptures of the new Testament do in sundry places make mention with reioycing, as for a moste excellent benefite and gyft of God, that they whiche receaued the fayth of Christe, were turned from their dumbe, &amp; dead images, vnto the true &amp; lyuyng God, who is to be blessed for euer: namely in these places, the. xiiii. &amp;. xvii.

of the Actes of the Apostles, the. xi. to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, the fyrste Epistle to the Corinthians the xii. Chapter, to the Galathians the. iiii. and the first to the Thessalonians, the first Chapter.</p>
               <p>And in lyke wyse the sayd idols or images, and worshyppyng of them, are in the Scriptures of the newe Testament by the spirite of God much abhorred and detested, and earnestly forbydden, as appeareth both in the forenamed places, and also manye others besydes, as in the. vii. and. xv. of the Actes of the Apostles, the fyrste to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, where is set foorth the horrible plague of idolaters, geuen ouer by God into a reprobate sense, to worke all wyckednesse and abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not to be spoken, as vsuallye spirituall and carnall fornication go together.</p>
               <p>In the first Epistle to the Corinthians the fifth Chapter, we are forbidden once to keepe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or to eate and drynke with suche as be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led brethren or Christians that do worshyp ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

from the worshyppyng of them yf we be wyse, that is to say, yf we care for health and seare destruction, yf we regarde the kyngdome of God, and lyfe euerlastyng, and dread the wrath of God and euerlastyng damnation. For it is not possible that we shoulde be worshyppers of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the true seruauntes of God also, as. S. Paul teacheth, the seconde to the Corinthians the. vi. Chapter, affyrming expresly that there can be no more consent or agreement betweene the Temple of God (which al true Christians be) and images, then betweene ryghteousnesse and vnryghteousnes, betweene lyght and darknesse, betweene the faythfull and the vnfaythfull, or betweene Christ and the deuyll. Which place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth both that we shoulde not worshippe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that we should not haue images in the Temple, for feare and occasion of worshyppyng them, though they be of them selues thynges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: For the Christian is the holye Temple and lyuely image of God, as the place well decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to suche as wyll reade and weight it.

But our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our repelleth Satan by the Scriptures, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is wrytten, Thou shalt worshyppe thy Lorde God, and hym alone shalt thou serue.

But let vs, brethren, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther folowe the counsell of the good angell of GOD, then the suggestion of subtyll satan, that wycked angell and olde serpent: Who accordyng to the pryde whereby he firste fell, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth alwaye by suche sacriledge to depryue God (whom he enuyeth) of his due honour: and (because his owne face is horrible and vglye) to conuey it to hymselfe, by the mediation of gylte stockes and stones, and withall to make vs the

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6498:26"/>
in the Churche of Christ, contrary to thauetho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the scriptures, I did teare it, and gaue councell to the kepers of the Churche, that they shoulde winde a poore man that was dead in the sayde cloth, and so bury hym. And afterwardes the same <hi>Epiphanius</hi> sendyng another vnpayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cloth for that paynted one whiche he had torne, to the sayde Patriarche, wryteth thus, I pray you wyll the elders of that place to receaue this clothe whiche I haue sent by this bearer, and commaunde them that from hencefoorth no suche paynted clothes, contrary to our religion, be hanged in the Churche of Christe. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth your goodnes rather to haue this care, that you take away such scrupulositie, which is vnsitting for the Churche of Christe, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue to the people committed to your charge. And this Epistle, as worthy to be read of many, dyd saint Ierome hym selfe translate into the Latine tongue. And that ye may knowe that saint Ierome had this holy and learned Bishop Epiphanius in most high estimation, and therfore dyd translate this Epistle, as a wrytyng of auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: heare what a testimonie the sayde saint Ierome geueth him in another place in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie agaynst the errours of Iohn Byshop of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, where he hath these wordes: Thou hast <note place="margin">All notable Bishoppes were then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Surely thou art not to be preferred before hym, neyther for age nor learnyng, nor godlynesse of lyfe, nor by the testimonie of the whole worlde. And shortlye after in the same treatie sayth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6498:26"/>
Saint Jerome: Bishop <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was euer of so great veneration and estimation, that Valens the Emperour, who was a great persecutour, dyd not once touche hym. For heritikes beyng princes, thought it theyr shame yf they shoulde persecute suche a notable man. And in the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite <note place="margin">Lib. 9. cap. 48.</note> ecclesiasticall hystorie, the. ix. booke and xlviii. Chapter, is testified, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng yet alyue dyd worke miracles, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, deuils being expelled at his graue or tombe, dyd rore. Thus you see what auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie saint Ierome and that moste auncient hystorie geue vnto the holy and learned Byshop Epiphanius, whose iudgement of images in Churches and temples, then begynnyng by stealth to creepe in, is worthy to be noted.</p>
               <p>First, he iudged it contrary to Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the aucthoritie of the scriptures, to haue any images in Christes Churche. Secondly, he reiected not only carued, grauen, and moulten images, but also painted images out of Christes Churche. Thirdly, that he regarded not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the image of Christe, or of any other saint, but beyng an image, woulde not suffer it in the Churche. Fourthlye, that he dyd not onlye remoue it out of the Churche, but with a vehement zeale tare it a sunder, and exhorted that a corse shoulde be wrapped and buryed in it, iudgyng it meete for nothyng but to rotte in the earth, folowyng herein the example of the good kyng Ezechias, who brake the brasen serpent to peeces, and burned it to ashes, for that idolatrie was committed to it. Last of al, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:6498:27"/>
thinketh it the duetie of vigilant Byshoppes, to be carefull that no images be permitted in the Churche, for that they be occasion of scruple and offence to the people committed to theyr charge. Nowe wheras neyther saint Hierome, who did translate the sayde Epistle, nor the aucthours of that most auncient historie ecclesiasticall trypar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite (who do most highly commende <hi>Epiphanius</hi> as is aforesaid) nor no other godly or learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop at that time or shortly after, haue wrytten any thing against <hi>Epiphanius</hi> iudgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning images: it is an euident profe, that in those dayes, whiche were about foure hundreth yeres after our sauiour Christe, there were no images publiquely vsed and receaued in the Churche of Christe, whiche was then muche lesse corrupt, &amp; more pure then nowe it is.</p>
               <p>And where as images began at that tyme se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretelye and by stealth to creepe out of priuate mens houses into the Churches, and that firste in paynted clothes and walles: such Byshops as were godlye and vigilante, when they espied them, remoued them away, as vnlawfull &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christian religion, as dyd here Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, to whose iudgement you haue not onlye Saint Ierome the translatour of his Epistle, and the wryter of the Historie tripartite, but also all the learned and godly Byshops and Clarkes, yea and the whole Churche of that age, and so vpwarde to our sauiour Christes tyme, by the space of about foure hundreth yeres, consenting and agreeyng. This is written the more largely of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> for that our image maynteyners
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6498:27"/>
nowe a dayes, seeing them selues so pressed with this most playne and earnest act and wrytyng of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> a Byshop and doctour of suche anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, holynesse, and aucthoritie, labour by all meanes (but in vayne agaynst the trueth) eyther to proue that this Epistle was neyther of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius wrytyng, nor saint Ieromes translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: eyther yf it be, say they, it is of no great forte, for this <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> say they, was a Iew, and beyng conuerted to the Christian fayth, and made a Byshoppe, retayned the hatred whiche Iewes haue to images still in his mynde, and so dyd and wrote agaynst them as a Iewe, rather then as a Christian. O Iewishe impudencie and malice of suche deuisers, it woulde be prooued, and not sayd only, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was a Iewe. Furthermore concernyng the reason they make, I would admit it gladly. For if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agaynst images is not to be admitted, for that he was borne of a Iewe an enemie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche be Gods enemies, conuerted to Christes religion: then lykewyse foloweth it, that no sentence in the old doctours and fathers soundyng for images, ought to be of any auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, for that in the primitiue Churche the most part of learned wryters, as Tertulian, Cip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6498:28"/>
that images came firste from the Gentiles to vs Christians. And much more doth it folowe, that the opinion of all the rablement of the Popyshe Church, mainteyning images, ought to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of small or no aucthoritie, for that it is no maruell that they whiche haue from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ben brought vp amongst images &amp; idolles, and haue drunke in idolatrie almost with theyr mothers mylke, holde with images and idolles, and speake and wryte for them. But in deede it woulde not be so muche marked whether he were of a Jewe or a Gentile conuerted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes religion, that wryteth, as howe agreeably or contrarily to Gods worde he doth wryte, and so to credite or discredite hym. Nowe what gods worde sayth of idols and images, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppyng of them, you hearde at large in the first part of this Homilee.</p>
               <p>Saint Ambrose in his treatie of the death of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, sayth, Helene founde the crosse and the tytle on it. Shee worshypped the kyng, and not the wood surely (for that is an ethnyshe errour, and the vanitie of the wycked) but she worshypped hym that hanged on the crosse, and whose name was written in the title, and so foorth. See both the godly Empresse fact, and saint Ambrose iudgement at once. They thought it had ben an Heathenyshe errour and vanitie of the wycked, to haue worshypped the crosse it selfe which was embrewed with our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christes owne precious blood. And we fal downe before euery crosse peece of tymber, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is but an image of that crosse.</p>

Saint Augustine, the best learned of al aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctours, in his. xliiii. Epistle to <hi>Maximus</hi> sayth, Knowe thou that none of the dead, nor any thing that is made of God, is worshipped as god, of the catholique Christians, of whom there is a Churche also in your towne. Note, that by Saint Augustine, suche as worshypped the dead or creatures, be no catholique Christians.</p>
               <p>The same saint Augustine teacheth in the. xxii. booke of the citie of God, the tenth Chapter, that neyther temples or Churches ought to be buylded or made for martyrs or saintes, but to God alone: and that there ought no priestes to be appoynted for martyr or saint, but to God onlye. The same saint Augustine in his booke of the maners of the catholique Churche, hath these wordes: I knowe that many be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of tombes and pictures, I know that there be manye that banquet moste ryotously ouer the graues of the dead, and geuyng meate to dead carkases, do bury them selues vppon the buried, and attribute theyr gluttonye and drunkennesse to religion. See, he esteemeth worshyppyng of saintes, tombes, and pictures, as good religion as gluttonie and drunkennesse, and no bettter at all.

Whereunto saint Augustine hym selfe aunswereth thus, For (sayth he) when images are placed in temples, and set in honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sublimitie, and begyn once to be worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, foorth with breedeth the moste vyle affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of errour. This is saint Augustines iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of images in Churches: that by and by they breede errour and idolatrie. It would be to tedious to rehearse al other places whiche might be brought out of the auncient doctours against images and idolatrie. Wherefore we shall holde our selfe contented with these fewe at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Nowe as concernyng histories ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, touchyng this matter, that ye may knowe why and when, and by whom images were first vsed priuately, and afterwardes not only recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the Christians Churches and temples, but in conclusion worshypped also, and how the same was gaynesayde, resisted, and forbidden, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well by godly Bishoppes and learned doctours, as also by sundry Christian princes: I wil breefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collect into a compendious historie, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is at large and in sundrye places written by diuers auncient wryters and historiographers concernyng this matter.</p>
               <p>As the Jewes, hauyng moste plaine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commaundement of God, that they should neyther make nor worshyp any image (as it is at large before declared) dyd notwithstandyng, by the example of the Gentyles or Heathen people that dwelt about them, fall to the makyng of images, and worshyppyng of them, and so to the committyng of moste abominable idolatrie, for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6498:29"/>
the whiche God by his holy prophetes doth most sharpely reprooue and threaten them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde dyd accomplyshe his sayde threatnynges by extreme punyshyng of them (as is also aboue specified) Euen so some of the Christians in olde tyme, whiche were conuerted from worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of idols and false Gods, vnto the true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng GOD, and to our sauiour Jesus Christe, dyd of a certayne blynde zeale (and as men long accustomed to images) paynt or carue images of our sauiour Christe, his mother Marie, and of the Apostles, thynkyng that this was a poynt of gratitude and kyndenesse towardes those by whom they had receaued the true knowledge of God, and the doctrine of the Gospell. But these pictures or images came not yet into Churches, nor were not worshypped of a long tyme after. And least you shoulde thynke that I do say this of myne owne head onlye without aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I alleage for me <hi>Eusebius</hi> Byshop of Cesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, and the moste auncient aucthour of the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall historie, who lyued about the, 330. yere of our Lord in <hi>Constantinus magnus</hi> dayes, and his sonne <hi>Constantius,</hi> Emperours, in the seuenth booke of his historie ecclesiasticall, the xiiii. Chapter, and saint Jerome vppon the, x. Chapter of the prophete Jeremie: who both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly say, that the errours of images (for so saint Jerome calleth it) hath come in and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Christians from the Gentyles, by an Heathenyshe vse and custome. The cause and meanes <hi>Eusebius</hi> she weth, saying, It is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if they whiche beyng Gentiles before, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6498:30"/>
did beleue, semed to offer this, as a gyft vnto our sauiour, for the benefites whiche they had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him. Yea and we do see no we that images of Peter and Paul, and of our sauiour hym selfe be made, and tables to be paynted, whiche me thynke to haue ben obserued and kept indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently by an Heathenishe custome. For the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then are wont so to honour them whom they iudged honour worthy, for that some tokens of old men should be kept. For the remembraunce of posteritie, is a token of theyr honour that were before, and the loue of those that come after.</p>
               <p>Thus farre I haue rehearsed <hi>Eusebius</hi> wordes. Where note ye, that both saint Jerome and he agreeth herein, that these images came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christian men by suche as were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles, and accustomed to idols, and beyng con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the fayth of Christe, retayned yet some remnauntes of gentilitie not throughlye pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: For saint Jerome calleth it an errour ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestlye. And the lyke example we see in the Actes of the Apostles, of the Jewes, who when <note place="margin">Actes. 15.</note> they were conuerted to Christe, woulde haue brought in theyr circumcision (whereunto they were so long accustomed) with them, into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes religion. With whom the Apostles (namelye saint Paul) had muche ado for the staying of that matter. But of circumcision was lesse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, for that it came first in by Gods ordinaunce and commaundement. A man may most iustly wonder of images, so directly agaynst gods holy worde and straight commaundement, how they should enter in. But images were not yet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shypped
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6498:30"/>
in <hi>Eusebius</hi> tyme, nor publiquely set vp in Churches and temples, and they who priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had them, dyd erre of a certayne zeale, and not by malice: but afterwardes they crepte out of priuate houses into Churches, and so bread first superstition, and last of all idolatrie amongst Christians, as hereafter shall appeare.</p>
               <p>In the tyme of <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Martian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who raigned about the yere of our Lorde 460. and. 1100. yeres ago, when the people of the citie of <hi>Nola</hi> once a yere dyd celebrate the byrth day of saint Felix in the temple, and vsed to banquet there sumptuouslye, <hi>Pontius Paulinus</hi> Byshop of <hi>Nola</hi> caused the walles of the temple to be paynted with stories taken out of the olde Testament, that the people beholdyng and consyderyng those pictures, might the better ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne from to muche surfetting and ryot. And about the same time <hi>Aurelius Prudentius,</hi> a very learned &amp; Christian poet, declareth howe he dyd see paynted in a Church, the historie of the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of saint <hi>Cassian,</hi> a scoolemaister and martyr, whom his owne scollers at the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of the tyraunt, tormented with the pryckyng or stabbing in of theyr poyntelles or brasen pennes into his body, and so by a thousand wounds and mo (as sayth <hi>Prudentius)</hi> most cruelly slew him. And these were the first payntings in Churches that were notable of antiquitie. And so by this example came in painting, and afterwarde ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of tymber and stone, and other matter, into the Churches of Christians. Nowe and ye wyll consyder this beginning, men are not so redye to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6498:31"/>
worshyppe a picture on a wal, or in a wyndowe, as an embossed and gylte image set with pearle and stone. And a processe of a storie, painted with the gestures and actions of many persons, and commonly the summe of the storie written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, hath another vse in it, then one dumbe idoll or image standing by it selfe. But from learning by paynted stories, it came by lytle and litle to idolatrie. Whiche when godly men (aswell Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and learned Byshoppes, as others) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, they commaunded that suche pyctures, images, or idols, shoulde be vsed no more. And I wyll for a declaration therof, begin with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the auncient Christian Emperours, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> the seconde, who raigned about foure hundreth yeres after our sauiour Christes ascention, who forbad that anye ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges shoulde be made or paynted priuatelye. For certayne it is, that there was none in temples publiquely in theyr tyme. These Emperours dyd write vnto the capitayne of the armie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng on the Emperours, after this sorte, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> Emperours, vnto the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the armie: Whereas we haue a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent care to maynteyne the religion of GOD aboue, in all thynges: We wyll graunt to no man to set foorth, graue, carue, or paynt the image of our sauiour Christe in colours, stone, or any other matter, but in what place soeuer it shalbe founde, we commaunde that it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and that all suche as shall attempte any thyng contrary to our decrees or commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement herein, shalbe moste sharpely punished.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6498:31"/>
This decree is written in the bookes, named <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri Augustales,</hi> the Emperial bokes, gathered by <hi>Tribunianus, Basilides, Theophilus, Dioscorus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Satira,</hi> men of great aucthoritie and learnyng, at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the Emperour <hi>Iustiniane,</hi> and is alleaged by <hi>Petrus Erinilus,</hi> a notable lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, in the. ix. booke and. ix. Chapter of his worke, entituled, <hi>De honesta disciplina,</hi> that is to say, of honest learnyng. Heare you see what Christian princes of most auncient times decreed agaynst images, whiche then began to creepe in amongst the Christians. For it is certayne that by the space of three hundreth yeres and more, after the death of our sauiour Christe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these godlye Emperours raigne, there were no images publiquely in Churches or temples. Howe woulde the idolaters glory, if they had so muche antiquitie and aucthoritie for them, as is here agaynst them?</p>
               <p>Nowe shortlye after these dayes, the Gothes, Uandales, Hunnes, and other barberous and wicked nations, burst into Italie, and all partes of the westcountreyes of Europe, with huge and mightie armies, spoyled all places, destroyed Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and burned Libraries, so that learning and true religion went to wracke, and decayed incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diblye. And so the Byshops of those latter dayes, beyng of lesse learnyng, and in the myddest of warres, takyng lesse heede also then did the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops afore, by ignoraunce of Gods worde, and negligence of Byshops, and specially barbarous princes, not ryghtly instructed in true religion, bearyng the rule, images came into the Church
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6498:32"/>
of Christe in the sayde west partes, where these barbarous people ruled, not nowe in paynted clothes only, but embossed in stone, tymber, met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and other lyke matter, and were not onlye set vp, but began to be worshypped also. And therefore <hi>Serenus</hi> Byshoppe of <hi>Massile</hi> the heade towne of <hi>Gallia Narbonensis</hi> (nowe called the Prouince) a godly and learned man, who was about sixe hundreth yeres after our sauiour Christe, seeyng the people by occasion of images fal to most abominable idolatrie, brake to peeces all the images of Christe and saintes whiche were in that citie, and was therfore complayned vpon to Gregorie, the first of that name Byshop of Rome, who was the first learned Byshop that dyd alowe the open hauyng of images in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that can be knowen by any wrytyng or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of antiquitie. And vpon this Gregorie do all image worshyppers at this day ground theyr defence. But as all thinges that be amysse, haue from a tollerable beginning growen worse and worse, tyll they at the last became vntollerable: So dyd this matter of images. Firste, men vsed priuately stories paynted in tables, clothes, and walles. Afterwardes, grosse and embossed ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges priuately in theyr owne houses. Then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, pictures first, and after them embossed images began to creepe into Churches: learned and godly men euer speaking agaynst them. Then by vse it was openly mayneteyned that they might be in Churches: but yet forbidden that they shoulde be worshypped. Of which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was Gregorie, as by the sayde Gregories
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6498:32"/>
Epistle to the forenamed <hi>Serenus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile,</hi> playnely appeareth. Whiche Epistle is to be founde in the booke of the Epistles of Gregorye, or Register, in the tenth part of the fourth Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, where he hath these wordes: That thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest forbid images to be worshipped, we praise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, but that thou diddest breake them, we blame. For it is one thyng to worshyp the pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and another thyng by the pycture of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to learne what is to be worshypped. For that whiche scripture is to them that reade, the same doth picture perfourme vnto idiottes or the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, beholdyng, and so foorth. And after a fewe wordes: therefore it shoulde not haue ben broken, whiche was set vp, not to be worshipped in Churches, but onlye to instruct the mindes of the ignoraunt. And a lytle after, thus thou shouldest haue sayde, If you wyll haue images in the Churche for that instruction wherefore they were made in olde tyme, I do permit that they may be made, and that you may haue them. And shewe them, that not the syght of the storie, whiche is opened by the picture: but that worshyppyng whiche was inconueniently geuen to the pictures, did mistike you. And if any woulde make images, not to forbid them: but auoide by all meanes to worship any image. By these sentences taken here and there out of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories Epistle to <hi>Serenus</hi> (for it were to long to rehearse the whole) ye may vnderstand wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter was now come. vi. hundreth yeres after Christe: that the hauyng of images or pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Churches, were then maynteyned
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6498:33"/>
in the west part of the worlde (for they were not so frowarde yet in the easte Churche) but the worshyppyng of them was vtterlye forbidden. And you may withall note, that seeyng there is no grounde for worshyppyng of images in Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories wrytyng, but a playne condemnation thereof, that suche as do worshyp images, do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly alleage Gregorie for them. And further, if images in the Churche do not teachemen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to Gregories mynde, but rather blynde them: it foloweth, that images shoulde not be in the Churche by his sentence, who onely woulde they shoulde be placed there, to the ende that they might teache the ignoraunt. Wherefore, if it be declared that images haue ben and be worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and also that they teache nothyng but er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and lyes (which shall by Gods grace here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be done) I truste that then by Gregories owne determination, al images and image wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers shalbe ouerthrowen. But in the meane season, Gregories aucthoritie was so great in all the west Churche, that by his incouragement, men set vp images in all places: but their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not so good to consider why he would haue them set vp, but they fell all on heapes to manifest idolatrie by worshyppyng of them, which Bishop <hi>Serenus</hi> (not without iust cause) feared woulde come to passe. Now if <hi>Serenus</hi> his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, thinking it meete that images wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto idolatrie was committed, should be destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had taken place, idolatrie had ben ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: For to that which is not, no man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth idolatrie. But of Gregories opinion, thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6498:33"/>
that images might be suffered in churches. so it were taught that they should not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped: what ruine of religion, and what mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe insued afterwarde to all Christendome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath to our great hurt and sorowe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. First, by the scisme rysing betwene the East and the West Churche about the sayde images. Nexte, by the diuision of the Empire into twoo partes by the same occasion of images, to the great weakening of all Christendome, whereby last of all, hath followed the vtter ouerthrowe of the christian religion and noble empire in <hi>Grece</hi> and all the east partes of the worlde, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Mahomets false religion, and the cruel dominion &amp; tyrannie of the Sarasens &amp; Turks, who do nowe hange ouer our neckes also that dwell in the west partes of the worlde, readye at all occasions to ouerrunne vs. And all thys do we owe vnto our idols and images, and our ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie in worshipping of them.</p>
               <p>But nowe geue you eare a little to the processe of the historie, wherin I do much follow the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of <hi>Paulus Diaconus,</hi> &amp; others, ioyned with <hi>Eutropius</hi> an olde writer. For though some of the <note place="margin">Eutrop. li. de rebus. Rom. 23</note> aucthours were fauourers of images: yet doe they most playnely and at large prosecute the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of those times, whom <hi>Baptist Platina</hi> also <note place="margin">Platina in vitis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantini &amp; Grego. ii.</note> in his historie of Popes, as in the lyues of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seconde, byshoppes of Rome, and other places (where he intreateth of this matter) doth chieflye followe. After <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> time, <hi>Constantine</hi> bishop of Rome assembled a councell of bishoppes in the west Churche, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6498:34"/>
did condempne <hi>Philippicus</hi> then emperour, and John bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of the heresie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> not without a cause in deede, but very iustly. When he had so done, by the consent of the learned about him, the sayd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> Bishop of Rome, caused the images of the auncient fathers which had ben at those sixe councels which were alowed and receaued of all men, to be paynted in the entrie of saint Peters Church at Rome. When the <hi>Grekes</hi> had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hereof, they began to dispute and reason the matter of images with the <hi>Latines,</hi> and held this opinion, that images could haue no place in Christes Churche, and the <hi>Latines</hi> helde the contrarie, &amp; toke part with the images. So the east &amp; west Churches which agreed euil before, vpon this contention about images fell to vtter enmitie, which was neuer well reconciled yet. But in the meane season <hi>Philippicus</hi> and <hi>Arthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi> or <hi>Anastasius</hi> Emperours, commaunded images and pictures to be pulled downe, &amp; rased out in euery place of their dominion. After them came <hi>Theodosius</hi> the third: he commaunded the defaced images to be paynted agayne in their places: but this <hi>Theodosius</hi> raigned but one yere. <hi>Leo</hi> the third of that name succeeded him, who was a <hi>Syrian</hi> borne, a very wyse, godly, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, &amp; valiaunt prince. This <hi>Leo</hi> by proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commaunded, that al images set vp in chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be worshipped, should be plucked downe and defaced: and required specially the bishop of Rome that he should do the same, and himselfe in the meane season caused all images that were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6498:34"/>
in the imperial citie <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on an heape in the middest of the citie, and there publiquely burned them to ashes, and whyted ouer, and rased out al pictures paynted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the walles of the temples, &amp; punished sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diuers maynteyners of images. And when some did therefore report him to be a tyraunt, he aunswered, that such of al other were most iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished, whiche neither worshipped God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryght, nor regarded the imperial maiestie and aucthoritie, but malicioustie rebelled agaynst holsome and profitable lawes. When <hi>Gregorius,</hi> the third of that name bishop of Rome, hearde of the Emperours doinges in <hi>Grece</hi> concerning images, he assembled a councell of Italian By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops agaynst him, and there made decrees for Images, and that more reuerence and honour shoulde yet be geuen to them then was before, and stirred vp the Italians against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, first at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and moned them to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. And as <hi>Aspurgensis</hi> and <hi>Anthonius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Florence</hi> testifie in their Cronicles, he caused Rome &amp; all Italie at the last to refuse their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and the payment of any more tribute to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour: and so by treason &amp; rebellion mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned their idolatrie.

And vniuersally after this tyme, all the emperours of <hi>Grece</hi> (only <hi>Theodosius</hi> excepted) destroyed continually all images. Nowe on the contrarie parte, note ye, that the Byshoppes of Rome, beyng no ordinarie magistrates appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, out of their diocesse, but vsurpers of princes aucthoritie contrarie to gods word, were the mainteyners of images against Gods word, and stirrers vp of sedition and rebellion, and workers of continuall treason against theyr so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lords, contrary to gods lawe and the ordinaunces of all humane lawes, beyng not

In the nonage of <hi>Constantine</hi> the sixth, the Empresse <hi>Hyrene</hi> his mother, in whose handes the regiment of the Empire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned, was gouerned muche by the aduyse of <hi>Theodore</hi> Byshop, and <hi>Tharasius</hi> patriarche of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who practised and helde with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop of Rome in mainteining of images most earnestly: By whose councell and entreatie, the Empresse first most wickedly digged vp the body of her father in lawe <hi>Constantine</hi> the fifth, and commaunded it to be openly burned, &amp; the ashes to be throwen into the sea. Whiche example (as the constant report goeth) hadde lyke to haue ben put in practise with Princes corses in our dayes, had the aucthoritie of the holy father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued but a little longer. The cause why the Empresse <hi>Hyrene</hi> thus vsed her father in lawe, was, for that he when he was alyue had destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed images, and had taken away the sumptuous ornamentes of Churches, saying that Christ, whose temples they were, allowed pouertie, and not pearles and pretious stones. Afterward the said <hi>Hyrene,</hi> at the perswasion of <hi>Adrian</hi> bishop of Rome, &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> the patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> &amp; his successour <hi>Tharasius,</hi> assembled a councel of

And so the Empresse, sparing no diligence in setting vp of Images, nor cost in decking them in all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, made <hi>Constantinople</hi> within a short tyme altogether lyke Rome it selfe. And nowe you may see that cummen to passe whiche Bishop <hi>Serenus</hi> feared, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first forbad in vayne: to wit, that Images should in no wyse be worshipped. For nowe not onely the simple and vnwyse (vnto whom Images, as the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach, be specially a snare) but the bishops and learned men also, fall to idolatrie by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of images, yea and make decrees and lawes for the mayntenaunce of the same. So harde is it, and in deede impossible any long time to haue images publiquely in churches &amp; temples with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out idolatrie, as by the space of little more then one hundred yeres betwixt <hi>Gregori</hi> the first, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding most strayghtly the worshipping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirde, <hi>Paule,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the third, Bishops of Rome, with this councel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding and decreeing that images should be worshipped, most euidently appeareth.</p>

Nowe when <hi>Constantine</hi> the younge Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour came to the age of twentie yeares, he was dayly in lesse and lesse estimation: for suche as were about his mother, perswaded her that it was Gods determination that she should raigne alone, and not her sonne with her. The ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woman beleuing the same, depryued her sonne of all imperiall dignitie, and compelled all the men of warre, with their Capitaynes, to sweare to her that they would not suffer her sonne <hi>Constantine</hi> to raigne during her lyfe. With which indignitie the young Prince being moued, recouered the regiment of the Empyre vnto him selfe by force, and being brought vp in true religion in his fathers tyme, seing the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of his mother <hi>Hyrene,</hi> and the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie committed by images, cast downe, brake, and burned al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idols and images that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had set vp.

In this historie ioyned to <hi>Eutropius</hi> it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the sunne was darkened by the space of xvii. dayes most strangely and dreadfully, &amp; that all men sayde, that for the horriblenes of that cruell and vnnaturall fact of <hi>Hyrene,</hi> &amp; the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Emperours eyes, the sunne had lost his light. But in deede, God would signifie by the darkenes of the sunne, into what darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and blindenes of ignoraunce and idolatrie all christendom should fall by the occasion of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

whose treason continually studied and wrought was most abominable, whose wicked and vnnaturall crueltie passed <hi>Medea</hi> &amp; <hi>Progne,</hi> whose detestable paricides haue ministred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Poetes to write their horrible tragidies. And yet certaine Historiographers, who do put in wryting all these her horrible wickednes, for loue they had to images, which she mainteined, do prayse her as a godly Empresse, &amp; as sent from God. Such is the blyndnes of false superstition, if it once take possession in a mans mynde, that it will both declare the vices of wicked princes, &amp; also commend them. But not long after, the said <hi>Hyrene</hi> being suspected to the princes and lordes of <hi>Grece</hi> of treason, in alienating the Empire to <hi>Charles</hi> king of the <hi>Francons,</hi> and for practising a secrete mariage betwene herselfe and the sayd kyng, and being conuicted of the same, was by the sayd Lordes deposed and depriued againe of the Empire, and caried into exile into the Iland <hi>Lesbos,</hi> where she ended her leude lyfe.</p>

But images were not so fast set vp, and so much honoured in Italie and the west: but <hi>Nycaepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours <hi>Scauratius,</hi> the two <hi>Michaels, Leo, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> and other emperours their successours in <note place="margin">Or Staura <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

would at the councel of <hi>Lions</hi> haue agreed with the Bishop of Rome, and haue set vp images: he was by the nobles of the empire of <hi>Grece</hi> depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and another chosen in his place: and so rose agelousie, suspition, grudge, hatred, and enmitie betwene the christians and empires of the East countries and west, which could neuer be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched nor pacified. So that when the Sarasens first, and afterwarde the Turkes, inuaded the Christians: the one part of christendome would not helpe the other. By reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof, at the last, the noble empire of <hi>Grece,</hi> and the citie imperial <hi>Constantinople</hi> was lost, and is come into the hands of the infidels, who now haue ouerrunne almost all christendome, and possessing past the middle of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> whiche is part of the west empire, do hang ouer all our heades, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daunger of all christendome.</p>
               <p>Thus we see what a sea of mischiefes the maintenaunce of images hath brought with it, what an horrible scisme betweene the east and the west Churche, what an hatred betwene one christian and another, councels agaynst coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, churche agaynst church, christians agaynst christians, princes against princes, rebellions, treasons, vnnaturall and most cruell murders, the daughter digging vp and burning her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperours bodye, the mother for loue of idols most abominably murdering her owne sonne being an Emperour, at the last, the tearing in sunder of Christendome and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire into two peeces, till the Infidels, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens, and Turkes, common enemies to bothe

For it is not without a iust and great cause to be dread, leaste as the Empire of Rome was euen for the lyke cause of images and the worshyppyng of them torne in peeces and diuided, as was for Idolatry the kyngdome of Israel in olde tyme diuided: so lyke punyshment, as for the lyke offence fel vpon the Jewes, wyll also lighte vppon vs: That is, least the cruel tyrant and enemie of our common wealth and religion the Turke, by Gods iuste vengeaunce, in lykewise partly murder, &amp; partly leade awaye into captiuitie vs christians, as dyd the <hi>Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> kynges murder and leade away the Israelites: and least the empire of Rome &amp; christian religion be so vtterly brought vnder foote, as was then the kyngdome of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and true religion of God, whereunto the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter already (as I haue declared) shrewdlye incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth on our part, the greater part of christendom within lesse then three hundreth yeares space, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng brought into captiuitie and moste miserable thraldome vnder the Turke, and the noble em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Grece</hi> cleane euerted. Whereas yf the christians, diuided by these image matters, had holden together, no Infidels and miscreauntes could thus haue preuayled against christendome. And all this mischiefe and miserie, whiche we
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6498:41"/>
haue hitherto fallen into, do we owe to our mightie gods of gold and siluer, stocke and stone, in whose helpe and defence (where they can not helpe them selues) we haue trusted so long, vntyl our enemies the Infidels haue ouercome and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer runne vs almost altogether.

what similitude wyl ye set vp vnto hym? Shall the Caruer make hym a caruen image? and shall the Goldsmyth couer hym with golde, or cast him into a fourme of syluer plates? And for the poore man, shall the image maker frame an image of tymber, that he maye haue somwhat to set vp also? And after this he cryeth out: O wretches, heard ye neuer of this? Hath it not ben preached to you since the beginning, how by the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlde, and the greatnesse of the worke, they myght vnderstande the maiestie of God, the Maker and Creatour of all, to be greater then that it could be expressed or set foorth in any image or bodily similitude? Thus farre the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esaias, who from the. xliiii. Chapter, to the xlix. intreateth in a maner of no other thyng. And. S.

For how can God, a most pure spirite, whom man neuer sawe, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by a grosse, bodily, and visible similitude? How can the infinite maiestie &amp; greatnes of god, incomprehensible to mans mynde, muche more not able to be compassed with the sense, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in an infinite and litle image? How can a dead and dombe image expresse the lyuyng God? What can an image, which when it is fallen, can not ryse vp agayne, which can neyther help his freendes, nor hurte his enemies, expresse of the moste puissaunt and myghtie God, who alone is

able to rewarde his freendes, and to destroy his enemies euerlastyngly? A man myght iustly crye with the prophet Habacus, Shall suche images instruct or teach any thyng ryght of God? or shall <note place="margin">Habac. 20.</note> they become doctours? Wherfore men that haue made an image of God wherby to honour hym, haue therby dishonoured him most hyghly, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his maiestie, blemished his glorye, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified his trueth. And therefore saint Paul saith, that suche as haue framed anye similitude or <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> image of God lyke a mortall man, or anye other lykenes, in tymber, stone, or other matter, haue chaunged his trueth into a lye. For both they thought it to be no longer that whiche it was, a stocke or a stone, and toke it to be that which it was not, as God, or an image of God. Wherfore an image of God, is not onlye a lye, but a double lye also. But the deuill is a lyer, and the father of lyes: wherefore the lying images which be made of God, to his great dishonour, and horrible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> of his people, came from the deuyll.</p>
               <p>Wherefore they be conuict of foolishnesse and wickednesse in making of images of God, or the Trinitie: for that no image of God ought or can be made, as by the scriptures and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son euidently appeareth: yea, and once to desyre an image of God, commeth of infidelitie, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not God to be present, except they myght see some signe or image of hym, as appeareth by the Hebrues in the wyldernesse, wyllyng Aaron to make them gods whom they might see go before them.

Christe may be made, for that he toke vppon him fleshe, and became man. It were well that they woulde firste graunt, that they haue hytherto done moste wyckedlye in makyng and mayntey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of images of God, and of the trinitie in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, whereof they are by force of Gods word and good reason conuicted: and then to discend to the tryall for other images. Nowe concernyng their obiection, that an image of Christe may be made: the aunswere is easy. For in Gods worde and religion, it is not onlye requyred whether a thyng may be done or no: but also, whether it be lawfull and agreeable to Gods worde to be done, or no. For al wyckednesse may be &amp; is dayly done, which yet ought not to be done. And the wordes of the reasons aboue alleaged out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, that images neither ought nor can be made vnto God. Wherefore to reply that images of Christe maye be made, excepte withall it be proued that it is lawfull for them to be made, is, rather then to holde ones peace, to say somwhat, but nothyng to the purpose. And yet it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that no image can be made of Christe, but a lying image (as the scripture peculierlye calleth images lyes) For Christ is God and man. Seing <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> therefore that for the Godhead, which is the most excellent parte, no images can be made, it is falsly called the image of Christe: wherefore images of Christe be not onlye defectes, but also lyes. Which reason serueth also for the images of saintes, whose soules, the more excellent partes of them, can by no images be represented and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. Wherefore, they be no images of saintes,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6498:45"/>
whose soules raigne in ioy with God, but of the bodies of Saintes, whiche as yet lye putrified in the graues. Furthermore, no true image can be made of Christes body, for it is vnknowen nowe of what fourme and countenaunce he was. And there be in Grece and at Rome, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, dyuers images of Christe, and none of them lyke to other, and yet euerye of them affirmeth, that theirs is the true and liuely image of Christ, which can not possible be. Wherefore, as sone as an image of Christe is made, by and by is a lye made of hym, which by Gods word is forbidden. Which also is true of the images of any Saintes of antiquitie, for that it is vnknowen of what fourme and countenaunce they were. Wherefore seeing that religion ought to be grounded vppon trueth, images whiche can not be without lyes, ought not to be made, or put to anye vse of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to be placed in Churches and Temples, places peculierly appoynted to true religion and seruice of God. And thus much, that no true image of God, our sauiour Christe, or his saintes can be made: wherwithall is also confuted that their allegation, that images be the laye mens bookes. For it is euident of that whiche is afore rehearsed, that they teache no thinges of God, of our sauiour Christe, and of his saintes, but lyes and errours. Wherfore, either they be no bookes, or if they be, they be false and lying bookes, the teachers of all errour.</p>
               <p>And nowe if it should be admitted &amp; graunted, that an image of Christe could truely be made, yet it is vnlawfull that it shoulde be made, yea,

or that the image of anye saint shoulde be made, speciallye to beset vp in Temples, to the greate and vnauoydable daunger of idolatrie, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shalbe proued.

This is saint <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgemente of images in Churches, that by and by they breede errour and idolatrie.

And as it is written. <hi>Sapi. xiiij.</hi> that images were not from the beginning, neyther shall they continue to the end: so were they not in the begynnyng in the primatiue Churche, God graunt they may in the ende be destroyed. For all Christians in the primatiue Churche, as <hi>Origen</hi> agaynste <hi>Celsus, Ciprian</hi> also and <hi>Arnobius</hi> do

Wherefore dyd they not I pray you, confourme themselues to the Gentiles in makyng of images, but for lacke of them sustayned their heauie displeasure, if they had taken it to be lawfull by Gods worde to haue images? It is euident therefore that they toke al images to be vnlawful in the Churche or Temple of God, and therefore had none, though the Gentiles therefore were most highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, folowing this rule: We must obey God rather then men. And <hi>Zephirius</hi> in his notes vppon the Apologie of <hi>sertullian,</hi> gathereth, that all his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement <note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note> perswasion shoulde be but colde, except we know this once for all, that Christian men in his tyme dyd moste hate images with their orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. And <hi>Ireneus</hi> (as is aboue declared) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth the heretikes called <hi>Gnostici,</hi> for that they caryed about the image of Christ. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the primatiue Church which is speciallie to be folowed as most incorrupt and pure, had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely in Churches, neyther idols of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, nor any other images, as thynges directly forbidden by Gods word. And thus it is declared by Gods worde, the sentences of the Doctours, and the iudgement of the primatiue Churche, whiche was moste pure and sincere, that all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, aswell ours, as the idols of the Gentiles, be by Gods word forbidden, and therfore vnlawful, specially in Temples and Churches.</p>
               <p>Nowe yf they (as their custome is) flee to this aunswere, that Gods worde forbiddeth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely all images to be made, but that they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6498:48"/>
shoulde not be made to be worshypped, and that therefore we maye haue images, so we worshyp them not, for that they be thynges indifferent, which may be abused, or wel vsed. Which semeth also to be the iudgement of <hi>Damascene</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>

And this is one of their cheefe allegations for the mayntey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of images, whiche haue ben alleaged since <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first his tyme.</p>
               <p>Well, then we be come to their seconde allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiche in parte we woulde not sticke to graunte them. For we are not so superstitious or scrupulous, that we do abhorre eyther flowres wrought in Carpettes, hangynges, and other arrasse, eyther the Images of Princes prynted or stamped in their Coynes, whiche when Christe did see in a Romane Coyne, we reade not that he reprehended it, neyther do we condemne the artes of payntyng and image making, as wicked of them selues. But we would admit and graunt them, that images vsed for no religion, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition rather, we meane images of none wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, nor in daunger to be worshypped of any, may be suffred. But images placed publiquely in Temples, can not possiblye be without daunger of worshyppyng and idolatrie, wherfore they are not publiquely to be had or suffered in Temples and Churches. The Jewes, to whom this lawe was firste geuen (and yet beyng a morall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and not ceremoniall, as all Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours interpret it, byndeth vs aswel as them) the Jewes I saye, who shoulde haue the true sense and meanyng of Gods lawe so peculierly geuen

And <hi>Origene</hi> addeth this cause, least their myndes shoulde be plucked from God, to the contemplation of earthly thynges. And they are muche commended for this earnest zeale, in maynteyning of Gods honour and true religion. And trueth it is, that the Jewes and Turkes, who abhorre images &amp; idols as directly forbiddenby Gods worde, wil neuer come to the trueth of our religion, whiles these stumbling blockes of images remayne amongest vs, and lye in their way. If they obiect yet the brasen serpent which Moyses dyd set vp, or the images of the Cherubims, or anye other Images whiche the Jewes had in their Temple, the aunswere is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy. We must in religion obey Gods general lawe, which bindeth al men, &amp; not folowe examples of particuler dispensation, which be no warrantes for vs: els we may by the same reason resume cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cision &amp; sacrifising of beastes, &amp; other rites per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes. Neither can those images of cherubim, set in secret wher no man might come nor behold, be any example for our publique set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vp
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6498:49"/>
of images in Churches and Temples. But to let the Jewes go. Where they say that images, so they be not worshypped, as thynges indifferent maye be tollerated in Temples and Churches: We inferre and say for the aduersatiue, that all our images of God, our Sauiour Christ, and his Saintes, publiquely set vp in Churches &amp; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, places peculierlye appoynted to the true worshipping of God, be not thynges indifferent, nor tollerable: but agaynst Gods lawe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, taking their owne interpretation and exposition of it. Firste, for that all images so set vp publiquely, haue ben worshipped of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and simple sorte, shortly after they haue ben publiquely so set vp, and in conclusion, of the wyse &amp; learned also. Secondly, for that they are worshypped in sundry places now in our time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. And thirdly, for that it is impossible that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God, Christe, or his Saintes, can be suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (specially in Temples and Churches) anye while or space without worshipping of them: &amp; that idolatrie, which is most abhominable before God, can not possibly be escaped &amp; auoyded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the abolishing and destruction of images &amp; pictures in Temples and Churches, for that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie is to images, speciallye in Temples and Churches, an inseparable accident (as they tearme it) so that images in Churches, and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, go alwayes both together, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one can not be auoyded, except the other, (specially in all publique places) be destroyed. Wherefore, to make images, and publiquely to set them vp in Temples and Churches, places
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6498:49"/>
appoynted peculierly to the seruice of God, is, to make images to the vse of religion, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye agaynst this precept: Thou shalt make no maner of image, but agaynst this also: Thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor worship them. For they beyng set vp, haue ben, be, and euer will be worshipped. And the full proofe of that which in the beginning of the first part of this treatie was touched, is here to be made &amp; perfourmed: To wit, that our images, and idols of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be all one, aswell in the things them selues, as also in that our images haue ben before, be now, and euer wilbe worshypped, in like fourme and maner, as the idols of the Gentiles were worshipped, so long as they be suffered in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and temples.

And where one saint hath images in diuers places, the same saint hath diuers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes thereof, moste lyke to the Gentiles. When you heare of our Lady of Walsingham, our Lady of Ipswich, our Lady of Wilsdon, &amp; suche other: what is it but an imitation of the Gentiles ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters? <hi>Diana Agrotera, Diana Coriphea, Diana Ephesia, &amp;c.

For where no images be, they haue no such meanes. <hi>Terentius varro</hi> sheweth, that there were three hundred <hi>Iupiters</hi> in his tyme, there were no fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer <hi>Veneres</hi> and <hi>Dianae,</hi> we had no fewer Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophers, Ladies, and Marie Magdalens, and other saintes. <hi>Oenomaus</hi> and <hi>Hesiodus</hi> shewe,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6498:51"/>
that in theyr time there were thirtie thousande Gods. I thinke we had no fewer saintes, to whom we gaue the honour due to God. And they haue not only spoyled the true liuing God of his due honour, in temples, cities, countreyes and landes, by suche deuises and inuentions, as the Gentiles idolaters haue done before them: but the Sea and waters haue aswell speciall saintes with them, as they had Gods with the Gentiles, <hi>Neptune, Tritron, Nereus, Castor, &amp; Pollux, Venus,</hi> and suche other. In whose places be come saint Christopher, saint Clement, and diuers other, and specially our Lady, to whom shypmen syng <hi>Aue maris stella.</hi> Neyther hath the fyre scaped theyr idolatrious inuentions. For in steade of <hi>Vulcane</hi> and <hi>Vesta,</hi> the Gentiles gods of the fyre, our men haue placed saint Agatha, and make letters on her day for to quenche fyre with. Euerye artificer and profession hath his speciall saint, as a peculier God. As for example, scollers haue saint Nicholas and saint Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, paynters saint Luke, neyther lacke souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers theyr <hi>Mars,</hi> nor louers theyr <hi>Venus,</hi> amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Christians. All diseases haue theyr speciall saintes, as gods the curers of them. The pockes saint Roche, the fallyng euyll saint Cornelis, the toothe ache saint Appoline. &amp;c. neyther do beastes and cattell lacke theyr Gods with vs, for saint Loy is the horseleache, and saint Anthonie the swinehearde. &amp;c. Where is Gods prouidence and due honour in the meane season? who sayth, The heauens be myne, and the earth is myne, the whole worlde and al that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6498:51"/>
in it is, I do geue victorie, and I put to flight, of me be al councels and helpe. &amp;c. Except I kepe the citie, in vayne doth he watch that kepeth it, thou Lorde shalt saue both men and beastes. But we haue left hym neyther heauen, nor earth, nor water, nor countrey, nor citie, peace no warre to rule and gouerne, neyther men, nor beastes, nor theyr diseases to cure, that a godlye man myght iustlye for zelous indignation crye out, O heauen, O earth, and seas, what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wickednesse agaynst God are men fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into? What dishonour do the creatures to theyr creator and maker? And yf we remember God sometime, yet because we doubt of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie or will to helpe, we ioyne to hym another helper, as he were a nowne adiectiue, vsyng these sayinges: suche as learne, God and saint Nicholas be my speede: such as neese, God helpe and saint John: to the horse, God and saint Loy saue thee. Thus are we become like horses and moyles, whiche haue no vnderstandyng. For, is there not one God only, who by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and wysdome made all thynges, and by his prouidence gouerneth the same? and by his goodnes maynteyneth and saueth them? Be not all thynges of hym, by hym, and through hym? Why doest thou turne from the creatour to the creatures? This is the maner of the Gentiles idolaters: but thou art a Christian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Christe alone hast accesse to God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and helpe of him only. These thynges are not wrytten to any reproche of the saintes them selues, who were the true seruauntes of God,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6498:52"/>
and dyd geue all honour to him, taking none vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselues, and are blessed soules with God: but against our foolishnes and wickednes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of the true seruauntes of God, false gods, by attributyng to them the power and honour whiche is Gods, and due to hym only. And for that we haue suche opinions of the power and redy helpe of saintes, al our Legendes, Hymnes, Sequences, and Masses, dyd conteyne stories, laudes, and prayses of them, and prayers to them: yea, and sermons also altogether of them and to theyr prayses, Gods worde beyng cleane layde asyde. And this we do altogether agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the saintes, as dyd the Gentiles idolaters to theyr false gods. For these opinions whiche men haue had of mortall persons, were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so holye, the olde moste godlye and learned Christians, haue written agaynst the faygned gods of the Gentiles, and Christian princes haue destroyed theyr images, who yf they were nowe lyuyng, woulde doubtlesse lykewyse both wryte agaynst our false opinions of saintes, and also destroye theyr images. For it is euident, that our image maynteyners, haue the same opinion of saintes, whiche the Gentiles had of theyr false gods, and thereby are moued to make them images as the Gentiles dyd. If aunswere be made, that they make saintes but interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours to God, and meanes for suche thynges as they woulde obteyne of God: that is euen after the Gentiles idolatrious vsage, to make them of saintes, gods, called <hi>Dij Medioximi,</hi> to be meane <note place="margin">Medioxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi Dij.</note> intercessours and helpers to God, as though he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6498:52"/>
dyd not heare, or shoulde be weerye yf he dyd all alone. So dyd the Gentiles teache, that there was one cheefe power workyng by other, as meanes, and so they made all gods subiect to fate or destenye: as <hi>Lucian</hi> in his dialogues fayneth, that <hi>Neptune</hi> made suite to <hi>Mercurie,</hi> that he myght speake with <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And therefore in this also, it is moste euident that our image mainteiners be al one in opinion with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles idolaters.</p>
               <p>Nowe remayneth the thirde parte, that theyr rites and ceremonies in honouryng &amp; worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the images or saintes, be all one with the rites whiche the Gentiles idolaters vsed in honouryng theyr idols. First, what meaneth it, that Christians after the example of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles idolaters, go on pylgrimage to visite ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where they haue the lyke at home, but that they haue a more opinion of holynesse and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in some images, then other some, lyke as the Gentiles idolaters had? whiche is the redyest way to bryng them to idolatrie by worshypping of them, and directly against Gods worde, who sayth, Seeke me, and ye shall lyue, and do not <note place="margin">Amos. v.</note> seeke <hi>Bethel,</hi> neyther enter not into <hi>Gilgal,</hi> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go to <hi>Bersaba.</hi> And agaynst suche as had any superstition in the holynesse of the place, as though they shoulde be hearde for the places sake, saying, Our fathers worshypped in this <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> mountayne, and ye saye, that at Hierusalem is the place where men shoulde worshyp, our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christe pronounceth: Beleue me, the houre commeth when you shall worshyppe the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6498:53"/>
father neyther in this mountayne, nor at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, but true worshippers shall worshyp the father in spirite and trueth. But it is to well knowen, that by suche pilgrimage goyng, Lady <hi>Venus</hi> and her sonne <hi>Cupide,</hi> were rather wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped wantonly in the fleshe, then God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our sauiour Christe his sonne, truely worshipped in the spirite.</p>
               <p>And it was verye agreeable (as saint Paul teacheth) that they which fell to idolatrie, which <note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What meaneth it that Christian men, after the vse of the Gentiles idolaters, cap and kneele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore images? whiche if they had any sense and gratitude, woulde kneele before men, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Masons, Plasterers, Founders, and Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smithes, theyr makers and framers, by whose meanes they haue attayned this honour, which els shoulde haue ben euyll fauoured and rude lumpes of claye, or plaster, peeces of tymber, stone, or mettall, without shape or fashion, and so without all estimation and honour, as that idol in the Pagane poete confesseth, saying, I was <note place="margin">Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yf they say, they exhibite suche honour not to the image, but to the saint whom it representeth, they are conuicted of follye, to beleue that they please saintes with that honour, whiche they abhorre, as a spoyle of Gods honour. For they be no chaungelynges: but nowe both hauyng greater vnderstanding, and more feruent loue of God, do more abhorre to depriue him of his due honour: and beyng nowe lyke vnto the angels of God, do with angels flee to take vnto them by sacrilege the honour due to God. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall is confuted theyr lewde distinction of <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Dulia:</hi> where it is euident, that the saintes of God can not abyde, that as muche as any outwarde worshippyng be done or exhibited to them. But satan, Gods enemie, desyryng to robbe God of his honour, desyreth exceedynglye that such honour might be geuen to him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> those whiche geue the honour due to the creatour to any creature, do seruice acceptable to no saintes (who be the freendes of God) but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to satan, Gods and mans mortall and sworne enemie. And to attribute suche desyre of diuine honour to saintes, is to blot them with a moste odious and deuilyshe ignominie and villanie, and in deede of saintes, to make them satans and very deuils, whose propertie is to chalenge
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6498:54"/>
to them selues, the honour which is due to God onelye. And furthermore, in that they say that they do not worshyp the images, as the Gentiles dyd theyr idols, but God and the saintes whom the images do represent, and therefore that theyr doynges before images, be not lyke the idolatrie of the Gentiles before theyr idols: saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, Lactantius,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> do proue eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that by this theyr aunswere, they be all one with the Gentiles idolaters. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles (sayth saint <hi>Augustine)</hi> whiche seeme to <note place="margin">Augusti. Psal. <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

And <hi>Lactantius</hi> sayth, The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <note place="margin">Lactan. li.2. institu.</note> saye, we feare not the images, but them after whose lykenesse the images be made, and to whose names they he consecrate. Thus farre <hi>Lactantius.</hi> And <hi>Clemens</hi> sayth, That serpent the deuyll, vttereth these wordes by the mouth <note place="margin">Lib. 5. ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

See howe in vsyng the same excuses whiche the Gentiles idolaters preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they shewe them selues to be all one with them in idolatrie. For notwithstandyng this excuse, saint <hi>Augustine, Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> prooue them idolaters. And <hi>Clemens</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the serpent the deuyll putteth suche excuses in the mouth of idolaters. And the Scriptures sayth, they worshyppe the stockes and stones notwithstandyng this excuse) euen as our image maynteyners do. And <hi>Ezechiel</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:6498:54"/>
therefore calleth the gods of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> stockes and stones, although they were but images of theyr gods. So are our images of God and the saintes, named by the names of god and his saintes, after the vse of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. And the same <hi>Clemens</hi> sayeth thus in <note place="margin">Lib. 5. ad Iacobum Domini fratrem.</note> the same booke, They dare not geue the name of the Emperour to anye other, for he puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth his offendour and traytour by and by: but they dare geue the name of god to other, because he for repentaunce suffereth his offendours. And euen so do our image worshyppers, geue both names of god and the saintes, and also the honour due to God, to theyr images, euen as dyd the Gentiles idolaters to theyr idols. What shoulde it meane, that they accordyng as dyd she Gentiles idolaters, lyght candelles at noone time, or at mydnyght, before them, but therwith to honour them: for other vse is there none in so doyng. For in the day it needeth not, but was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a prouerbe of foolishnesse, to lyght a candle at noone tyme. And in the nyght, it auayleth not to light a candle before the blynde: and god hath neyther vse nor honour thereof. And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this candle lighting, it is notable that <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius</hi> aboue a thousande yeres ago hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <note place="margin">Liber. 6. iustit. ca. 2</note> after this maner, If they woulde beholde the heauenlye lyght of the Sunne, then should they perceaue that God hath no neede of theyr candelles, who for the vse of man hath made so goodly a lyght. And whereas in so lytle a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Sunne, whiche for the great distaunce,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6498:55"/>
seemeth to be no greater then a mans head, there is so great bryghtnesse, that the syght of mans eye is not able to behold it, but if one sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastlye looke vpon it a whyle, his eyes will be dulled and blynded with darknesse. Howe great lyght, howe great clearenesse may we thinke to be with God, with whom is no night nor dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? and so foorth. And by and by he sayth, Seemeth he therefore to be in his ryght minde, whiche offereth vp to the geuer of lyght, the lyght of a waxe candell for a gyfte? He requireth another lyght of vs, whiche is not smokye, but bryght and cleare, euen the lyght of the mynde and vnderstandyng. And shortlye after he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, But theyr gods, because they be earthlye, haue neede of lyght, lest they remayne in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whose worshyppers, because they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande no heauenlye thyng, do drawe religion whiche, they vse, downe to the earth, in the whiche beyng darke of nature, is neede of light: Wherefore they geue to theyr gods no heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, but the earthlye vnderstandyng of mortall men. And therefore they beleue those thynges to be necessarie and pleasaunt vnto them, which are so to vs, who haue neede eyther of meate when we be hungrye, or drynke when we be thirstie, or clothyng when we be a colde, or when the sunne is set, candle lyght, that we maye see. Thus farre <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and muche more, to long here to wryte, of candle lyghtyng in temples before images and idols for religion: whereby appeareth both the foolyshnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and also, that in opinion and acte, we do
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6498:55"/>
agree altogether in our candle religion, with the Gentiles idolaters. What meaneth it that they, after the example of the Gentiles idolaters, burne incense, offer vp golde to images, hang vp crouches, chaynes, and shyppes, legges, armes, and whole men and women of waxe, before ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as though by them, or saintes (as they say) they were deliuered from lamenesse, sicknes, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, or shypwracke? Is not this <hi>Colere imani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Colere</note> to worship images, so earnestly forbidden in Gods worde? If they denie it, let them reade the xi. Chapter of Daniel the prophete, who sayth of Antechriste: He shall worship God whom his fathers knewe not, with golde, syluer, and with precious stone, and other thinges of pleasure: in whiche place the Latine worde is <hi>Colet.</hi> And in the seconde of Paralepomenon the. xxix. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all the outwarde rites and ceremonies, as burnyng of incence, and suche other, wherwith God in the temple was honoured, is called <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cultus.</note> (to say) worshyppyng, whiche is forbidden strayghtly by Gods word to be geuen to images. Do not all stories ecclesiasticall declare, that our holy martyrs, rather then they woulde bow and kneele, or offer vp one crumbe of incense before an image or idoll, haue suffered a thousande kindes of most horrible and dreadfull death? And what excuse soeuer they make, yet that all this running on pilgrimage, burning of incence and candels, hanging vp of crouches, chaines, ships, armes, legges, and whole men and women of waxe, kneelyng and holdyng vp of handes, is done to the images, appeareth by this, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6498:56"/>

no more then Ezechias lefte the brasen serpent vndestroyed, when it was worshipped, although it were both set vp by Gods commaundement, and also approued by a great and true miracle, for as many as beheld it, were by and by healed: neyther ought miracles to perswade vs to do contrarye to Gods worde.

the olde godly fathers and doctours, by the open confession of Byshops assembled in counselles, by most euident signes and argumentes, opinions, idolatrous actes, deedes, and worshyppyng done to our images, and by their owne open confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and doctrine set foorth in their bookes, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and shewed, that our images haue ben, and be commonly worshipped, yea, and that they ought so to be: I wyll out of Gods worde make this generall argument agaynst al such makers, letters vp, and maynteyners of images in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique places. And firste of all I wyll begyn with the wordes of our sauiour Christe. Do be to that <note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> man by whom an offence is geuen, wo be to him that offendeth one of these litle ones, or weake ones: better were it for him, that a milstone were hanged about his necke, &amp; he cast into the middle of the sea and drowned, then he should offend one of these litle ones or weake ones. And in Deut. God himselfe denounceth him accursed that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Deut. 27.</note> the blinde to wander in his way. And in Leuit. Thou shalt not lay a stumbling blocke or <note place="margin">Leuit. 19.</note> stone before the blynd. But images in Churches and temples haue ben and be, and (as afterward shalbe proued) euer wilbe offences &amp; stumbling blockes, specially to the weake, simple, and blind common people, deceauing their heartes by the cunnyng of the artificer (as the scripture expressy in sundrye places doth testifie) and so bryngyng <note place="margin">Sapi. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:6498:60"/>
Jf aunswere be yet made, that this offence may be taken away by diligent and sincere doctrine &amp; preachyng of Gods word, as by other meanes: And that images in Churches and Temples therefore, be not thynges absolutely euyll to all men, although daungerous to some: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it were to be holden, that the publique hauyng of them in Churches and Temples, is not expedient, as a thyng perilous, rather then vnlawfull, as a thyng vtterly wycked.</p>
               <p>Then foloweth the thirde article to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whiche is this: That it is not possible, if images be suffered in Churches and Temples, either by preachyng of Gods worde, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes, to keepe the people from worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of them, &amp; so to auoyde idolatrie. And firste concernyng preachyng, if it shoulde be admitted, that although images were suffred in Churches, yet might idolatrie by diligent and sincere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of Gods worde be auoyded: it shoulde fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe of necessitie, that sincere doctrine myght alwayes be had and continue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as images. And so that wheresoeuer, to offence, were erected an image, there also of reason, a godly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere preacher shoulde and myght be continually maynteyned. For it in reason, that the warnyng be as common as the stumblyng blocke: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie as large as is the offence: the medicine as generall as the poyson, but that is not possible, as both reason and experience teacheth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preachyng cannot stay idolatrie, images be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng publiquely suffered. For an image whiche will last for many hundred yeres, may for a litle
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6498:60"/>
be bought: but a good preacher can not be with muche contynually maynteyned.</p>
               <p>Item if the prince wil suffer it, there wil be by and by many, yea, infinite images: But sincere preachers were and euer shalbe but a fewe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the multitude to be taught. For our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christe sayth, the haruest is plentifull, but the workemen be but a fewe: whiche hath ben hitherto continually true, and wyl be to the worldes ende. And in our tyme, and here in our countrey so true, that euery shyre shoulde scarsly haue one good preacher, if they were diuided.</p>
               <p>Nowe images wyl continually to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders preache their doctrine, that is, the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images and idolatrie, to the whiche prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching mankynde is exceedyng prone, and encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to geue eare and credite: as experience of all nations and ages doth to muche proue. But a true preacher to stay this mischeefe, is in very manye places scarsly heard once in a whole yere, and some wheres not once in seuen yeres, as is euident to be proued. And that euyll opinion whiche hath ben long rooted in mens heartes, can not sodenly by one sermon be rooted out cleare. And as fewe are inclined to credite sounde doctrine: as many, and almost all, be prone to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and idolatrie. So that herein appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not only a difficultie, but also an impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the remedie.</p>
               <p>Further, it appeareth not by any storie of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, that true and sincere preachyng hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in anye one place aboue one hundred yeres: But it is euident, that images, superstition,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6498:61"/>
and worshyppyng of images and idolatrie, haue continued manye hundred yeres. For all wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges and experience do testifie, that good thynges do by litle and litle euer decaye, vntyll they be cleane banished: and contrarywyse, euyll thynges do more and more encrease, tyll they come to a full perfection of wyckednesse. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neede we to seeke examples farre of for a proofe hereof, our present matter is and example. For preachyng of Gods worde (moste sincere in the begynnyng) by processe of tyme, waxed lesse and lesse pure, and after corrupt, and last of all, altogether layde downe and left of, and other inuentions of men crept in place of it. And on the other parte, images among Christian men were firste paynted, and that in whole stories to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whiche had some signification in them: Afterwardes, they were imbossed, and made of tymber, stone, playster, and mettall. And firste they were only kepte pryuately in pryuate mens houses: And then after, they crepte into Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Temples, but fyrst by payntyng, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by embossyng: And yet were they no where at the fyrst worshypped. But shortlye after, they began to be worshypped of the ignoraunte sorte of men: as appeareth by the Epistle that <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the firste of that name Byshop of Rome, dyd wryte to <hi>Serenus</hi> Byshop of <hi>Marcelles.</hi> Of the whiche two Byshoppes, <hi>Serenus</hi> for idolatrie committed to images, brake them, and burned them, <hi>Gregorie</hi> although he thought it tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to let them stande: yet he iudged it abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable that they shoulde be worshypped, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6498:61"/>
thought (as is nowe alleaged) that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppyng of them myght be stayed, by teachyng of Gods worde, accordyng as he exhorteth <hi>Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to teache the people, as in the same Epistle appeareth. But whether <hi>Gregories</hi> opinion, or <hi>Serenus</hi> iudgement, were better herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder ye I pray you, for experience by and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth <hi>Gregories</hi> opinion. For notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng <hi>Gregories</hi> wrytyng, and the preachyng of others, images beyng once publiquely set vp in Temples and Churches, simple men and women shortly after fell on heapes to worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of them: And at the last, the learned also were caryed away with the publique errour, as with a violent streame or fludde. And at the seconde counsell <hi>Nicene,</hi> the Byshoppes and Cleargie decreed, that images shoulde be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shypped: and so by occasion of these stumblyng blockes, not onlye the vnlearned and simple, but the learned and wyse, not the people onlye, but the Byshoppes, not the sheepe, but also the shepheardes them selues (who shoulde haue ben guydes in the ryght way, and lyght to shyne in darkenesse) beyng blynded by the be witching of images, as blynde guydes of the blynde, fell both into the pitte of damnable idolatrie. In the whiche all the worlde, as it were drowned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynued, vntylourage, by the space of aboue eight hundred yeres, vnspoken agaynst in a maner. And this successe had <hi>Gregories</hi> order: whiche mischeefe had neuer come to passe, had Byshoppe <hi>Serenus</hi> way ben taken, and all idols and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ben vtterly destroyed and abolished: for no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6498:62"/>
man worshippeth that that is not. And thus you see, how from hauing of images priuately, it came to publique settyng of them vp in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Temples, although without harme at the fyrste, as was then of some wyse and learned men iudged: and from simple, hauing them there, it came at the last to worshippyng of them. Firste, by the rude people, who specially (as the <note place="margin">Sapi. 13, &amp; 14.</note> Scriptures teacheth) are in daunger of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and idolatrie, and afterwardes by the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes, the learned, and by the whole Cleargie. So that laytie and Clearge, learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all ages, sectes, and degrees of men, women and children of whole Christendome (an horrible and most dreadfull thyng to thynke) haue ben at once drowned in abhominable idolatrie, of all other vices most detested of God, and moste dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to man, and that by the space of eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres and more. And to this end is come that beginning of settyng vp of images in Churches then iudged harmelesse, in experience proued not onlye harmefull, but exitious and pestilent, and to the destruction and subuertion of all good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion vniuersaliye. So that I conclude, as it may be possible in some one Citie or litle Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to haue images set vp in temples and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet idolatrie, by earnest and continual preachyng of Gods true worde, and the sincere Gospel of our sauiour Christe, may be kept away for a short tyme: So is it impossible, that (ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges once set vp and suffred in temples and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) any great countreys, muche lesse the whole worlde, can any long tyme be kepte from idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.

And the godly wyll respect not onely their owne Citie, Countrey, and time, and the health of men of their age: but be carefull for all places and tymes, and the saluation of men of all ages. At the leaste, they wyll not lay such stumblyng blockes and snares, for the feete of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen and ages, whiche experience hath alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die proued to haue ben the ruine of the worlde.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I make a generall conclusion of all that I haue hitherto sayde: yf the stumblyng blockes, and poysons of mens soules, by settyng vp of images, wyl be many, yea, infinite yf they be suffered, and the warnynges of the same stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng blockes, and remedies for the sayde poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by preachyng, but fewe, as is alredy decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yf the stumblyng blockes be easy to be layde, the poysons soone prouided, and the warnynges and remedies harde to knowe or come by: yf the stumblyng blockes lye continuallye in the way, and poyson be redye at hand euery where, and warnynges and remedies but seldome geuen: and if all men be more redy of them selues to stumble and be offended, then to be warned, all men more redie to drynke of the poyson, then to taste of the remedie (as is before partly, and shall hereafter more fully be declared) and so in fine, the poyson continually and deepely drunke of many, the remedie seldome and fayntly tasted of a fewe: Howe can it be but infinite of the weake and infirme shalbe offended, infinite by ruine shall breake their neckes, infinite by deadly v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome be poysoned in their soules? And howe is the charitie of God, or loue of our neyghbour in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6498:63"/>
our heartes then, if when we may remoue suche daungerous stumbling blockes, suche pestilent poysons, we wyll not remoue them? What shall I saye of them whiche wyll laye stumbling blockes, where before was none, and set snares for the feete, nay, for the soules of weake and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones, and worke the daunger of their eternal ruine, for whom our Sauiour Christe shed his precious blood, where better it were that the artes of painting, playstering, caruing, grauing, and foundyng, had neuer ben founde nor vsed, then one of them, whose soules in the syght of God are so precious, should by occasion of image or picture perishe and be loste. And thus is it declared that preachyng can not possiblye stay idolatrie, if images be set vp publiquely in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Churches. And as true is it, that no other remedye, as wrytyng agaynst idolatrie, counsels assembled, decrees made agaynste it, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere lawes lykewyse and proclamations of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Emperours, neyther extreame punysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and penalties, nor anye other remedye coulde or can be possiblie deuised for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of idolatrie, if images be publiquely set vp and suffered. For concernyng wrytyng agaynste images, and idolatrie to them committed, there hath ben alleaged vnto you in the second part of this treatise a great manye of places, out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian, Origene, Lactantius, S. Augustine, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, S. Ambrose, Clemens,</hi> and diuers other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; holy byshops and doctours of the Churche. And besides these, all histories ecclesiasticall, and bookes of other godlye and learned byshoppes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6498:63"/>
and Doctours are full of notable examples and sentences agaynst images and the worshyppyng of them. And as they haue moste earnestly wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, so dyd they sincerely and most diligently in their time teache and preache, accordyng to their wrytynges and examples. For they were then preachyng Byshops, and more often seene in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pittes, then in prynces palaces, more often occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed in his legacie, who sayde, go ye into the whole world, and preache the Gospell to all men: then in imbassages and affayres of princes of this worlde. And as they were moste zealous and diligent, so were they of excellent learnyng and godlynes of lyse, and by both of great aucthoritie and credite with the people, and so of more force and lykelyhood to perswade the people, and the people more lyke to beleue and folowe their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. But if their preachynges coulde not helpe, muche lesse could their writynges, which do but come to the knowledge of a fewe that be learned, in comparison to continuall preachyng, whereof the whole multitude is partaker. Neyther dyd the old fathers, Byshoppes, &amp; Doctours, seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye onlye by preachyng and wrytyng, but also to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, great numbers of them assembled in sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes and counsels make decrees and ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawes agaynst images, and the worshipping of them: neyther dyd they so once or twyse, but diuers times, and in diuers ages and countreys, assemble synodes and counsels, and made seuere decrees agaynst images and worshyppyng of them, as hath ben at large in the seconde parte of this Nomilee before declared. But all their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6498:64"/>
wrytyng, preachyng, assemblyng in counselles, decreeyng, and makyng of lawes ecclesiasticall, coulde nothyng helpe eyther to pull downe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to whom idolatrie was committed, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst idolatrie whilest images stood. For those blynde bookes and dumbe Scholemaisters, I meane images and idols (for they call them laye mens bookes, and Scholemaisters) by their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and paynted wrytynges, teachyng and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng idolatrie, preuayled agaynst all their wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bookes, and preachyng with lyuely voyce, as they call it. Well, if preachyng and wrytyng could not keepe men from worshyppyng of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and idolatrie, if pennes and wordes coulde not do it, you woulde thynke that penaltie and swordes myght do it, I meane, that prynces by seuere lawes and punishmentes, myght stay this vnbridled affection of al men to idolatrie, though images were set vp and suffered. But experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence proueth, that this can no more help agaynst idolatrie, then wrytyng and preachyng. For Christian Emperours (whose aucthoritie ought of reason, and by Gods law, to be greatest) aboue eight in number, and sixe of them successiuelye raigning one after another (as is in the histories before rehearsed) makyng moste seuere lawes and proclamations agaynst idols and idolatrie, images, and the worshipping of images, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting most greeuous punishmentes, yea, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of death, vpon the mainteiners of images, and vppon idolaters and image worshyppers: could not bryng to passe, that either images once set vp, myght throughly be destroyed, or that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6498:64"/>
men shoulde refrayne from the worshyppyng of them, beyng set vp. And what thynke you then wyll come to passe, yf men of learnyng shoulde teache the people to make them, and shoulde maynteyne the settyng vp of them, as thynges necessarie in religion? To conclude, it appeareth euidently by all stories and wrytynges, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of tymes past, that neither preaching, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrytyng, neyther the consent of the learned, nor aucthoritie of the godly, nor the decrees of counsels, neyther the lawes of prynces, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame punyshmentes of the offendours in that behalfe, nor no other remedy or meanes, can help agaynst idolatrie, if images be suffered publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. And it is truely sayde, that tymes past are scholemaisters of wysedome to vs that folow and lyue after. Therefore in tymes past, the vertuest and best learned, the moste diligent also, and in number almoste infinite auncient fathers, By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Doctours, with their wrytyng, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, industrie, earnestnes, aucthoritie, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and counselles, coulde do nothyng agaynst images &amp; idolatrie, to images once set vp: What can we, neyther in learning, nor holinesse of lyfe, neither in diligence, neither aucthoritie to be compared with them, but men in contempt, and of no estimation (as the world goeth now) a fewe also in number, in so great a multitude &amp; malice of men: What can we do I say, or bryng to passe, to the stay of idolatrie or worshippyng of images, if they be alowed to stand publiquely in temples and Churches? And if so many, so mightie Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, by so seuere lawes and proclamations,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6498:65"/>
so rigorous and extreame punishmentes and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, coulde not stay the people from settyng vp and worshypppng of images: what wyll en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue thynke you, when men shall commend them as necessarie bookes of the lay men? Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of these latter dayes learne this lessen of the experience of the auncient antiquitie, that idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie can not possiblie be separated from images anye long tyme: but that as an vnseparable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or as a shadowe foloweth the body when the sunne shyneth, so idolatrie foloweth and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the publique hauing of images in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Churches. And finally, as idolatrie is to be abhorred and auoyded, so are images (whiche can not be long without idolatrie) to be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and destroyed. Besides the whiche experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and proofes of tymes before, the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and origine of images them selues draweth to idolatrie most violently, and mans nature and inclination also is bent to idolatrie so vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is not possible to seuer or parte images, nor to kepe men from idolatrie, if images be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred publiquely. That I speake of the nature and origin of images, is this: Euen as the fyrste in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of them is naught, &amp; no good can come of that whiche had an euyll begynnyng, for they be altogether naught, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his boke against the gentiles declareth, and saint Jerome also vppon the prophet Jeremie the. vi. Chapter, and <hi>Eusebius</hi> the seuenth booke of his ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall historie the. xviii. Chapter testifieth, that as they first came from the Gentiles, which were idolaters and worshippers of images, vnto vs,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6498:65"/>
and as the inuention of them was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of spirituall fornication, as the worde of God testifieth, Sap. 14. So will they naturally (as it were, and of necessitie) turne to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from whence they came, and draw vs with them most violently to idolatrie, abominable to God and all godly men. For if the origine of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and worshipping of them, as it is recorded in the eight chapter of the booke of wysedome, began of a blynde loue of a fonde father, framing for his comfort an image of his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, being dead, and so at the last men fel to the worshiping of the image of him whom they did know to be deade: Howe much more will men &amp; women fall to the worshipping of the images of God, our sauiour Christ, &amp; his saintes, if they be suffered to stande in churches &amp; temples publiquely? For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoppinion is of the maiestie &amp; holines of the person to whom an image is made, the sooner will the people fall to the worshipping of the sayd images. Wherfore the images of God, our sauiour Christ, the blessed virgin Mary, the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels, martirs, and other of notable holinesse, are of all other images most daungerous for the peril of idolatrie, and therefore greatest heede to be taken that none of them be suffered to stande publiquely in Churches and temples. For there is no great dread least any should fall to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of the images of <hi>Annas, Cayphas, Pilat,</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytour, if they were set vp. But to the other, it is alredy at full proued, that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie hath ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6498:66"/>
and is here more largely to be declared, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is none otherwyse bent to worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of images (if he maye haue them and see them) then it is bent to whoredome and adultrie in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as vnto a man geuen to the lust of the fleshe, seyng a wanton harlot, sitting by her, and imbracing her, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth little for one to saye be ware of fornication, God will condempne fornicatours and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: <note place="margin">

For a number will notwithstanding fall headlonges vnto it, what by the nature of images, and by the inclination of their owne corrupt nature. Wherefore as a man geuen to luste, to sit downe by a strumpet, is to tempt God: So is it lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse to erect an idoll in this pronenesse of mans nature to idolatrie, nothing but a tempting. Nowe if any will saye that this similitude pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing, yet I pray them let the worde of God, out of the whiche the similitude is taken, <note place="margin">Leui. 17. and. 20. Num. 25. Deute. 31. Baruc. 6.</note> proue something. Doth not the woorde of God call idolatrie spirituall fornication? Doth it not call a gilt or paynted idoll or image, astrumpet with a paynted face? Be not the spirituall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6498:66"/>
of an idols intising, like the flatteries of a wanton harlot? Be not men &amp; women as prone to spirituall fornication (I meane idolatrie) as to carnall fornication? It this be denied, let all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon the earth which haue ben idolaters (as by all stories appeareth) proue it true. Let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes &amp; the people of God whiche were so often and so earnestly warned, so dreadfully threatned concerning images &amp; idolatrie, and so extremely punished therefore (and yet fel vnto it) proue it to be true: as in almost al the bookes of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, namely the Kings &amp; the Cronicles, and the Prophetes, it appeareth most euidently. Let all ages and times, and men of all ages &amp; times, of all degrees and conditions, wise men, learned men, princes, idiotes, vnlearned, and comminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, proue it to be true. If you require examples: For wyse men, ye haue the Egyptians, and the Indian <hi>Gimnosophistes,</hi> the wysest men of the worlde, you haue Salomon the wysest of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For learned men, the <hi>Grekes,</hi> and namely the <hi>Atheniens,</hi> exceeding all other nations in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and idolatrie, as in the historie of the Actes of the Apostles saint Paul chargeth them. <note place="margin">Actes. 17.</note> For princes and gouernours, you haue the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, <note place="margin">Rom. i.</note> the rulers of the roste (as they saye) you haue the same forenamed king Salomon, and al the kinges of Israel and Juda after him, sauing Dauid, Ezechias, and Josias, and one or two more. All these (I say) and infinite others, wyse, learned, princes, and gouernours, being all ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours, haue you for examples and a proofe of mens inclination to idolatrie. That I may

passe ouer with silence in the meane tyme, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite multitudes and millions of idiotes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, the ignorant and grosse people like vnto horses and moyles in whom is no vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, <note place="margin">Psal. 31.</note> whose perill and daunger to fall on heapes to idolatrie by occasion of images, the Scriptures specially foreshe we and geue warning of. And <note place="margin">Sap. 13, 14.</note> in deede howe should the vnlearned, simple, and foolishe, scape the nettes and snares of idols and images, in the whiche the wysest and best lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned haue ben so entangled, trapped, and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped? Wherfore the argument holdeth this grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sure, that men be as enclyned of their corrupt nature to spirituall fornication as to carnall, which the wisedome of God foreseeing, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall prohibition that none shoulde make to them selues anye image or similitude, addeth a cause, depending of mans corrupt nature: Least (sayth God) thou being deceaued with errour, <note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> honour and worship them. And of this grounde of mans corrupt inclination, as well to spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fornication as to carnall, it must needs folow, that as it is the dutie of the godlie Magistrate, louing honestie, and hating whoredome, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue all Strumpets and harlots, specially out of places notoriouslie suspected, or resorted vnto of naughtie packes, for the auoyding of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fornication: So it is the dutie of the same godly magistrate, after the examples of the godly Kynges Ezechias and Josias, to dryue away all spirituall harlottes (I meane idols and images) specially out of suspected places, churches &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, daungerous for idolatrie to be committed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6498:67"/>
to images placed there, as it were in the appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place and height of honour and worship (as saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth) where the liuing god only (and not dead stones and stoches) is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped: <note place="margin">Augustin. in psal. 36. et 113. et. li. 4. ca. 3. de ciuitate dei.</note> It is I say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of godly magistrates lykewyse to auoyde images and Idolles out of Churches and Temples, as spirituall harlottes out of suspected places, for the auoyding of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, whiche is spirituall fornication. And as he were the enemie of all honestie, that woulde bring strumpettes and harlottes out of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete comers into the publique market place, there freely to dwel and occupie their filthy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundyse: So is he the enemie of the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of God, that bringeth idols and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into the Temple and Churche the house of God, there openly to be worshipped, and to spoile the zelous GOD of his honour, who will not geue it to any other, nor his glorie to caruen J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, who is as muche forsaken, and the bond of loue betwene man and him as muche broken by idolatrie, whiche is spirituall fornication, as is the knot and bonde of mariage broken by carnall fornication. Let all this be taken as a lye, if the worde of God enforce it not to be true. Cursed be the man, saith God in <hi>Deuteronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> that maketh a caruen or moulten Image, and placeth it in a secrete corner: and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall say Amen. Thus sayth God, for at that time no man durst haue or worship images ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, but in corners onely, and the whole world being the great Temple of God, he that in any corner thereof robbeth God of his glory, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6498:68"/>
it to stockes and stones, is pronounced by Gods worde accursed. Nowe he that will bring these spirituall harlottes out of their lurkyng corners, into publique Churches and Temples, that spirituall fornication maye there openlye of all men &amp; women without shame be committed with them, no doubte that person is cursed of God, and twyse cursed, and all good and godlye men and women will say Amen, &amp; their Amen will take effect also. Yea, and furthermore the madnesse of all men professing the religion of Christe, nowe by the space of a sorte of hundred yeares, and yet euen in our tyme in so great light of the Gospell verye manye running on heapes by sea and lande, to the great losse of their tyme, expence and waste of their goodes, destitution of their wyues, children, and families, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their own bodies and liues, to <hi>Compostile, Rome, Hierusalem,</hi> and other farre countries, to visite dumbe and dead stockes and stones, doth sufficiently proue the pronenesse of mans corrupt nature to the seeking of idolles once set vp, and the worshipping of them. And thus aswell by the origin and nature of Idolles and Images them selues, as by the prouenesse and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans corrupt nature to idolatrie, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that neither images, if they be publiquely set vp, can be separated, nor men, if they see ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Temples and Churches, can be stayd and kept from idolatrie. Nowe where as they yet alleage, that howsoeuer the people, princes, learned, and wyse of olde tyme, haue fallen into idolatrie by occasion of images, that yet in our
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6498:68"/>
tyme the most part, specially the learned, wyse, and of any aucthoritie, take no hurt nor offence by idolles and images, neyther do runne into farre countreyes to them and worshippe them: And that they knowe well what an idoll or J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is, and howe to be vsed, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it foloweth, images in Churches and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be an indifferent thing, as the whiche of some is not abused: and that therefore they may iustly holde (as was in the beginning of this part by them alleaged) that it is not vnlawfull or wicked absolutelye to haue images in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and temples, though it maye for the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the simple sorte seeme to be not altogether expedient.</p>
               <p>Whereunto maye be well replied, that Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon also the wysest of all men, did well knowe what an idoll or image was, and neyther tooke any harme thereof a great whyle himselfe, and also with his godlye Wrytinges armed others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst <note place="margin">Sap. 13. 14.</note> the daunger of them. But yet afterward the same Salomon suffering his wanton Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to bryng their idolles into his court and palace, was by carnall harlottes perswaded and brought at the laste to the committing of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fornication with idolles, and of the wysest and godliest prince, became the most foolyshest <note place="margin">Eccle. iii. and, xiii. i.

redeemed them being lost, to the dead &amp; dumbe idoll, the worke of mans hande, whiche neuer did nor can do any thing for them, no is not able to stirre nor once to moue, and therefore worse then a vyle worme which can moue and creepe. The excellent kyng Josias also did take him selfe no hurte of Images and Idols, for he did knowe well what they were: did he therefore because of his owne knowledge let Idols and images stand? muche lesse did he set any vp? Or rather did he not by his knowledge and auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie also succour the ignoraunce of suche as did not knowe what they were, by vtter taking awaye of all suche stumbling blockes as might be occasion of ruine to his people and subiectes. Will they because a fewe toke no hurt by images or idols, breake the generall lawe of God, Thou shalt make to thee no similitude. &amp;c They might aswell, because Moyses was not seduced by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throes</hi> daughter, nor <hi>Boos</hi> by <hi>Ruth,</hi> being straungers, reason, that all the Jewes might breake the generall lawe of God, forbidding his people to ioyne their children in mariage with straungers, least they seduce their children that they shoulde not followe God. Wherefore they which thus reason, Though it be not expedient, yet it is lawfull to haue images publiquely, and do proue that lawfulnesse by a fewe pyked and chosen men: if they obiecte that indifferently to all men, whiche a verie fewe can haue without hurte and offence, they seeme to take the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for vyle soules (as he sayeth in <hi>Virgil)</hi> of whose losse and safegarde no reputation is to be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6498:70"/>
had, for whom yet Christe payde as dearelye as for the myghtiest prince, or the wysest and best learned in the earth. And they that will haue it generally to be taken for indifferent, for that a verye fewe take no hurte of it, though infinite multitudes besyde perishe thereby: shewe that they put little difference betwene the multitude of christians and bruite beastes, whose daunger they do so little esteeme. Besides this, if they be Byshoppes or parsonnes, or otherwyse hauing charge of mens consciences, that thus reason, <hi>It is lawfull to haue images publiquely, though it be not expedient,</hi> what maner of pastours shew they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to be to their flocke, which thrust vnto them that, which they them selues confesse not to be expedient for them, but to the vtter ruyne of the soules committed to their charge, for whom they shall geue a strayte accompt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prince of pastours at the last daye? For in deede, to obiecte to the weake and redy to fall of them selues such stumbling blockes, is a thing not onely not expedient, but vnlawful, yea, and most wicked also. Wherefore it is to be wondered how they can cal images, set vp in churches and temples to no profite or benefite of any, and to so great peril and daunger, yea, hurt and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manye, or rather infinite, thinges indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Is not the publique setting vp of them rather a snare for all men, and the tempting of God? I beseche these reasoners to call to mynd their owne accustomed ordinaunce and decree, whereby they determined that the Scripture, though by GOD him selfe commaunded to be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6498:70"/>
knowen of all men, women, and children, should not be read of the simple, nor had in the vulgare <note place="margin">Deut. 31.</note> tongue, for that (as they sayd) it was daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by bringing the simple people into errors. And will they not forbid Images to be set vp in Churches and Temples, whiche are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, but forbidden most straytlye by God, but let them stil be there, yea, and mainteine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, seing the people are brought, not in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger onelye, but in deede into most abhominable errour and detestable idolatrie thereby? Shall Gods worde, by God commaunded to be read vnto all and knowen of all, for daunger of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie (as they saye) be shut vp? and idolles and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not withstanding they be forbidden by God, and not withstanding the daunger of idolatrie by them, shall they yet be set vp, suffered, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in churches and temples? O worldly and fleshely wysedome, euer bent to maynteyne the inuentions and traditions of men by carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and by the same to disanull or deface the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinaunces, lawes, and honour of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, who is to be honoured and praysed for euer.

               <p>Nowe it remayneth for the conclusion of this treatie, to declare aswell the abuse of churches &amp; temples, by to costely and sumptuous deckyng and adourning of them, as also the leude pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, gylding, and clothing of idols and images, and so to conclude the whole treatie. <note place="margin">Tertull.

And so farre of was it that they had before his tyme any goodly or gorgious declied temples, that lawes were made in <hi>Antonius Verus</hi> and <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperours times, that no christians should dwell in houses, come in publique bathes, or be <note place="margin">Eus. lib. 5.

So that christians wer then driuen to dwel in caues and dennes: so farre of was it that they had any publique temples adourned and decked as they now be. Which is here rehearsed to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of those impudent shamlesse lyers, whiche reporte suche glorious glosed fables, of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gorgious Temple that Saynt Peter, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Cletus,</hi> and those thirtie Bishoppes their successours had at Rome, vntill the time of the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> and whiche saint <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpe</hi> should haue in <hi>Asia,</hi> or <hi>Ireneus</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> by suche lyes, contrarie to all true Histories,

to maynteyne the superfluous gylding and dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Temples now a dayes, wherein they put almost the whole summe and pith of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in those tymes the worlde was wonne to Christendome, not by gorgious, gylted, and paynted temples of christians, which had scarse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houses to dwell in: but by the godly, and as it were golden mynds, and fyrine fayth of suche as in al aduersitie &amp; persecution professed the trueth of our religion. And after these tymes, in <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eus. lib. 8. cap. 19. et li. 9. ca. 9.</note> and <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperors proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the places wher Christians resorted to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique prayer, were called conuenticles. And in <hi>Galerius Maximinus</hi> the Emperors Epistle, they are called <hi>Oratories</hi> and <hi>Dominica,</hi> to saye, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces dedicate to the seruice of the Lorde. And here by the waye it is to be noted, that at that tyme there were no Churches or temples erected vnto any saint, but to God onely, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>

the vaultes whiche yet are buylded vnder great Churches, to put vs in remembraunce of the old state of the primitiue church before <hi>Constantine,</hi> where as in <hi>Constantines</hi> tyme, and after him, were buylded great and goodly temples for chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, called <hi>Basilicae,</hi> either for that the <hi>Grekes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Basilicae.</note> vsed to call all great and goodly places <hi>Basilicas,</hi> or for that the hyghe and euerlasting kyng God and our Sauiour Christe was serued in them. But although <hi>Constantine,</hi> and other princes, of good zeale to our religion, did sumptuouslye decke and adourne Christians temples, yet did they dedicate at that time all Churches and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to God or our Sauiour Christe, and to no saint, for that abuse began long after in <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nouel constitu. 3. et. 47.</note> tyme. And that gorgeousnes then vsed, as it was borne with, as rysing of a good zeale: so was it signified of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly learned euen at that tyme, that such coste might otherwyse haue ben better bestowed. Let saint Jerome (although o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse to great a lyker and a lower of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and outwarde thinges) be a proofe hereof, who hath these wordes in his Epistle to <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triades:</hi> Let other (sayeth saint Jerome) buylde Churches, couer walles with tables of marble, carrye together huge pyllers, and gylde their toppes or heades, whiche do not feele or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande their precious decking and adourning, let them decke the doores with iuorie and siluer, and set the golden Aulters with precious stones, I blame it not, let euerye man abounde in his owne sense, and better is it so to do, then care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6498:72"/>
to keepe their ryches layde vp in store. But thou hast another waye appoynted thee, to cloth Christ in the poore, to visit him in the sicke, feede him in the hungrie, lodge him in those who do lacke harbour, and specially suche as be of the householde of fayth.</p>
               <p>And the same Saint Jerome toucheth the same matter some what more freelye in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the lyfe of Clarkes to <hi>Nepotian,</hi> saying thus: Many buylde walles, and erect pyllers of Churches, the smoothe marbles do glister, the roofe shyneth with Golde, the aulter is set with precious stone: But of the ministers of Christe, there is no election or choyce. Neither let any man obiecte and aleage agaynst me the ryche temple that was in Jurie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table, candlestickes, incense, shippes, platters, cuppes, morters, and other thinges all of golde. Then were these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges allowed of the Lorde, when the Priestes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered sacrifices, and the blood of beastes was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the redemption of sinnes. Howbeit, all these thinges went before in figure, and they were written for vs, vppon whom the ende of the worlde is come. And nowe when that our Lorde beyng poore, hath dedicate the pouertie of his house, let vs remember his crosse, and we shall esteeme ryches as myre ordongue. What do wee maruell at that whiche Christe calleth wicked Mammon? Whereto do we so hyghlye esteeme and loue that, whiche saint Peter doth for a glorie testifie that he had not. Nytherto saint Jerome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:6498:73"/>
Thus you see how saint Jerome teacheth the sumptuousnes amongst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes to be a figure to signifie, and not an example to follow, &amp; that those outward thinges were suffered for a tyme, vntill Christ our Lorde came, who turned all those outwarde thinges into spirite, fayth, and trueth. And the same saynt Jerome vpon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth chapter of Jeremy saith: God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both the Jewes at that time, and nowe vs who are placed in the Churche, that we haue no trust in the goodlinesse of building and gylte rooffes, and in walles couered with tables of marble, and say: the temple of the Lord, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord. For that is the temple of the lorde wherein dwelleth true fayth, godly conuersation, and the company of all vertues. And vppon the Prophet Agge, he descrybeth the true and ryght decking of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Temple after this sorte: I (sayth Saint Jerome) do thinke the siluer wherewith the house of God is decked, to be the doctrine of the scriptures, of the whiche it is spoken: The doctrine of the Lorde is a pure doctrine, siluer tryed in fyre, purged from drosse, purified seuen tymes. And I do take golde to be that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth in the hid sense of the saintes, and the secrete of the heart, and shyneth with the true lyght of God. Which is euident that the Apostle also meant of the saintes that buylde vppon the foundation of Christ, some siluer, some golde, some precious stones: that by the Golde, the hid sense, by siluer, godlye vtteraunce, by preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones, workes whiche please God, myght
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6498:73"/>
be signified. With these mettals, the Churche of our sauiour is made more goodly and gorgeous, then was the synagogue in olde tyme. With these liuely stones, is the Churche and house of Christ builded, and peace is geuen to it for euer. All these be saint Hieromes sayinges. No more dyd the olde godly Bishops and doctours of the Churche, allowe the outragious furniture of Temples and Churches, with plate, vesselles of golde, siluer, and precious vestures. Saint <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> sayth, In the ministerie of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, there is no neede of golden vesselles, but of golden mindes. And saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <note place="margin">2. Offi ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitu. 28.</note> Christe sent his Apostles without golde, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his Church without golde. The Churche hath golde, not to hepe it, but to bestowe it on the necessities of the poore. The Sacramentes looke for no golde, neyther do they please God for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of golde, which are not bought for golde. The adournyng and deckyng of the Sacramentes, is the redemption of captyues. Thus much saint <hi>Ambrose.</hi>

               <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> commendeth <hi>Exuperius</hi> By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Tolose,</hi> that he caryed the Sacrament of the Lordes bodye in a wycker basket, and the Sacrament of his blood in a glasse, and so caste couetousnes out of the Churche.

And <hi>Zephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> the. xvi. Byshoppe of Rome made a decree that they shoulde vse vesselles of glasse. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse were the vestures vsed in the Churche in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6498:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
olde tyme very playne and single, and nothyng costly. And <hi>Rabanus</hi> at large declareth, that this <note place="margin">Li. 1. insti. cap. 14.</note> costly and manifolde furniture of vestmentes of late vsed in the Churche, was fet from the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishe vsage, and agreeth with Aarons appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling almost altogether. For the maintenaunce of the which, <hi>Innocentius</hi> the Pope pronounceth boldly, that all the customes of the olde lawe be not abolished, that we might in suche apparel, of Christians, the more willingly become Jewish. This is noted, not agaynst Churches &amp; temples, which are most necessary, &amp; ought to haue theyr due vse and honour, as is in another Homilee for theyr purpose declared, nor against the conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient cleanlinesse and ornamentes thereof: but agaynst the sumptuousnes &amp; abuses of Temples and Churches. For it is a Churche or Temple also, that glistereth with no marble, shyneth with no golde, nor syluer, glittereth with no pearles nor precious stones: but with plainnesse and frugalitie, signifieth no proude doctrine nor people, but humble, frugall, and nothyng estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng earthly and outwarde thynges, but glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslye decked with inwarde ornamentes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the prophet declareth, saying, The kings daughter is altogether glorious inwardlye.</p>
               <p>Nowe concernyng outragious deckyng of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and idolles, with paynting, gyldyng, adour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng with precious vestures, pearle, and stone, what is it els, but for the further prouocation and intisement to spirituall fornication, to decke spirituall harlottes moste costly and wantonlye: which the idolatrious Churche vnderstandeth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6498:74"/>
wel enough. For shee beyng in deede not only an harlot (as the scriptures calleth her) but also a foule, fylthye, olde, withered harlot (for she is in deede of auncient yeres) and vnderstandyng her lacke of naturall and true beawtie, and great lothsomenesse, whiche of her selfe she hath, doth (after the custome of suche harlottes) paynte her selfe, and decke &amp; tire her selfe with golde, pearle, stone, and all kinde of precious iewels, that she shyning with the outward beawtie and glory of them, may please the foolyshe fantasie of fonde louers, and so entice them to spirituall fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with her: Who, yf they sawe her (I wyll not say naked) but in simple apparell, woulde abhorre her, as the fowlest and fylthyest harlot that euer was seene: Accordyng as appeareth by the discription of the garnyshyng of the great strumpette of all strumpettes, the mother of whoredome, set foorth by saint John in his <note place="margin">Apo. 16. 18</note> reuelation, who by her glorye prouoked the Princes of the earth to committe whoredome with her. Whereas on the contrarye part, the true Churche of GOD, as a chaste matrone, espoused (as the scripture teacheth) to one husbande, our sauiour Jesus Christe, whom alone she is content onlye to please and serue, and looketh not to delyght the eyes or phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of any other straunge louers, or wooers: is content with her naturall ornamentes, not doubtyng, by suche sincere simplicitie, best to please him, which can well skil of the difference betweene a paynted visage, and true naturall beawtie. And concerning such glorious gildyng
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6498:75"/>
and decking of images, both Gods worde wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the. x. Chapter of the prophete <hi>Hierome,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hier. 10.</note> and saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> commentaries vppon the same, are moste worthye to be noted. Firste, the wordes of the scriptures be these: The worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with his are he wed the tymber out of the wood, with the worke of his handes, he dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it with golde and syluer, he ioyned it with nayles and pinnes, and the stroke of an hammer, that it myght holde together. They be made smothe as the Palme, and they can not speake: yf they be borne, they remoue, for they can not go. Feare ye them not, for they can neyther do euyll nor good. Thus sayth the prophete. Upon which text, saint <hi>Hierome</hi> hath these wordes: This is the description of idols, which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles worshyp, theyr matter is vyle &amp; corruptible. And whereas the artificer is mortal, the thinges he maketh must nedes be corruptible, he decketh it with siluer and golde, that with glitteryng or shynyng of both mettals, he may deceaue the simple. Which errour in deede hath passed ouer from the Gentiles, that we should iudge religion to stand in riches. And by and by after, he saith, They haue the beawtie of mettals, &amp; be beawti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the arte of payntyng, but good or profite is there none in them. And shortly after againe, They make great promises, and deuise an image of vayne worshipping of theyr owne plantasies, they make great bragges to deceaue euery simple body, they dull and amase the vnderstandyng of the vnlearned, as it were with golden senses, and eloquence, shynyng with the bryghtnesse of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6498:75"/>
syluer. And of theyr owne deuisers and makers, are these images aduaunced and magnified, in the whiche is no vtilitie nor profite at all, and the worshyppyng of the whiche, properly partei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Gentiles and Heathen, and suche as knowe not God.</p>
               <p>Thus farre of faint <hi>Hieromes</hi> wordes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon you may note aswell his iudgement of images them selues, as also of the paynting, gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, and deckyng of them: that it is an errour whiche came from the Gentiles, that it perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth religion to remayne in richesse, that it ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth &amp; deceaueth the simple and vnlearned, with golden senses and syluer shinyng eloquence, and that it apparteyneth properlye to the Gentiles and Heathens, and suche as knowe not GOD. Wherefore the hauyng, payntyng, gyldyng, and deckyng of images by S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> iudgement, is erronious, seducing and bringing into errour (specially the simple and vnlearned) heathenish, and voyde of the knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>Surely the prophete Daniel in the. xi. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter declareth such sumptuous decking of images with golde, syluer, and pretious stones, to be a token of antechristes kingdome, who (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete foresheweth) shall worship God with suche gorgeous thynges. Nowe vsuallye suche out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious adorning &amp; deckyng of images, hath ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and ben maynteyned, eyther of offrings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked by superstition and geuen in idolatrie, or of spoyles, robberies, vsurye, or goodes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse vniustly gotten, whereof wicked men haue geuen parte to the images or saintes, (as they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6498:76"/>
call them) that they myght be pardoned of the whole: as of diuers writings &amp; old monuments, concerning the cause and ende of certayne great gyftes, may well appeare. And in deede suche money so wyckedly gotten, is moste meete to be put to so wycked a vse. And that whiche they take to be amendes for the whole before God, is more abominable in his syght, then both the wycked gettyng, and the more wycked spendyng of all the reste. For howe the Lorde aloweth suche gyftes, he declareth euidentlye in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Esaias, saying, I (sayth the Lord) do loue iudgement, and I hate spoile and rauenie offred <note place="margin">Esai. 61.</note> in sacrifice: whiche the verye Gentiles vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode. For <hi>Plato</hi> sheweth, that such men as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <note place="margin">Dialogo. de legib' 10.</note> that God doth pardon wicked men, yf they geue parte of theyr spoyles and rauine to hym, take hym to be lyke a dogge, that woulde be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and hired with part of the pray, to suffer the Wolues to weerye the sheepe. And in case the goodes wherwith images be decked, were iustly gotten, yet is it extreame madnesse, so foolyshly and wickedlye to bestowe goodes purchased by wisdome and trueth. Of such lewdnesse <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Li. 2. insti. cap. 4.</note> wryteth thus. Men do in vayne decke ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the gods with golde, Juorie, and precious stone, as though they coulde take any pleasure of these thinges: For what vse haue they of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous giftes, which vnderstand nor feele nothing? Euen the same that dead men haue. For with like reason do they bury dead bodies, farced with spyces and odours, and clothed with precious vestures, and decke images, which neither felt or
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:6498:76"/>
knewe when they were made, nor vnderstande when they be honoured, for they get no sense &amp; vnderstanding by their consecration. Thus farre <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and muche more, to long here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse, declaryng that as litle girles playe with litle puppettes, so be these decked images great puppettes for olde fooles to play with. And that we may knowe what, not only men of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but Ethnikes also, iudge of suche decking of dead images, it is not vnprofitable to heare what <hi>Seneca,</hi> a wyse and excellent learned Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour of Rome and Philosopher, sayth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng the foolyshnesse of auncient &amp; graue men, vsed in his tyme in worshyppyng and decking of images: We saith <hi>(Seneca)</hi> be not twyse children (as the common saying is) but alwaies children: but this is the difference, that we beyng elder, play the children, and in these playes they bryng in before, great and well decked puppettes (for so he calleth images) oyntmentes, incense, and odours. To these puppettes they offer vp sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whiche haue a mouth, but not the vse of teethe. Uppon these they put attyryng and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious apparell, whiche haue no vse of clothes. To these they geue golde and syluer, whiche they who receaue it (meanyng the images) lacke, aswell as they that haue geuen it from them. And <hi>Seneca</hi> muche commendeth <hi>Dionisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> kyng of <hi>Sicile,</hi> for his merrye robbyng of suche decked and iewelled puppettes. But you wyll aske, what doth this apparteyne to our images, whiche is wrytten agaynst the idols of the Gentiles? Altogether surelye. For
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:6498:77"/>
what vse or pleasure hath our images of theyr deckyng and precious ornamentes? Dyd our images vnderstande when they were made? or know when they be so trimmed and decked? Be not these thinges bestowed vpon them, as much in vaine, as vpon dead men which haue no sense? Wherefore it foloweth, that there is like foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and lewdenesse in deckyng of our images, as great puppettes for olde fooles, like children, to playe the wycked play of idolatrie before, as was among the Ethnikes and Gentiles. Our Churches stande full of suche great puppettes, wonderously decked and adourned, Garlandes, and Coronettes be set on theyr heades, precious pearles hangyng about theyr neckes, theyr fyngers shyne with rynges, set with precious stones, theyr dead and styffe bodyes, are clothed with garmentes styffe with golde. You woulde beleue that the images of our men saintes, were some Princes of <hi>Persie</hi> lande with theyr proude apparell, and the idolles of our women saintes, were nice &amp; well trimmed harlottes, temptyng theyr paramours to wantonnesse: Whereby the saintes of God are not honoured, but most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, and theyr godlynesse, sobernesse, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, contempt of riches and of the vanitie of the worlde, defaced and brought in doubt, by suche monstrous deckyng, moste differyng from theyr sober and godlye lyues. And because the whole Pageaunt muste throughly be playde, it is not enough thus to decke idols, but at the last come in the Priestes them selues, lykewyse decked with golde and pearle, that they may be meete
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6498:77"/>
seruauntes for suche Lordes and ladies, and fyt worshyppers of suche gods and goddesses. And with a solemne pace they passe foorth before these golden puppets, and downe to the ground on theyr marybones before these honourable idols, and then rising vp againe, offer vp odours and incense vnto them, to geue the people an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of double idolatrie, by worshyppyng not only the idoll, but the golde also, and rychesse wherewith it is garnished. Which thinges, the most part of our olde martyrs rather then they would do, or once kneele, or offer vp one crumbe of incense before an image, suffered moste cruell and terrible deathes, as the histories of them at large do declare. And here agayne theyr allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian out of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first and <hi>Damassen,</hi> that <note place="margin">Gregor. Episto. ad Serenum Massile.

For as it hath ben touched in diuers places before, howe they be bookes teachyng nothyng but lyes, as by saint Paul in the first Chapter to the Romanes euidently appeareth, of the images of GOD: So what maner of bookes and scripture these paynted and gylte images of saintes be vnto the common people, note well I praye you. For after that our preachers shall haue instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exhorted the people to the folowyng of the vertues of the saintes, as contempte of this worlde, pouertie, sobernesse, chastitie, and suche lyke vertues, whiche vndoubtedlye were in the saintes: Thynke you assoone as they turne their faces from the preacher, and looke vppon the

When I say they turne about from the preacher, to these bookes and scoolemaisters and paynted scriptures: shall they not fynde them lying bookes? teachyng other maner of lessons, of esteeming of riches, of pride, and vanitie in apparell, of nycenesse and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, and peraduenture of whoredome; as <hi>Choerea</hi> of lyke pyctures was taught. And in <hi>Lucian,</hi> one learned of <hi>Venus Gnidia</hi> a lesson, to abominable here to be remembred.

What wyll they thinke eyther of the preacher, who taught them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye lessons of the saintes, and therefore by these caruen doctours, are charged with a lye, or of the saintes them selues, yf they beleue these grauen bookes and paynted scriptures of them, who make the saintes nowe raignyng in heauen with God, to theyr great dishonour, scoolemaisters of suche vanitie, which they in theyr lyfe tyme moste abhorred? For what
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6498:78"/>
lessons of contempte of rychesse and vanitie of this worlde, can such bookes so besmeared with golde, set with stone, couered with silkes, teache? What lessons of sobernesse and chastitie, can our women learne of these pyctured scriptures, with theyr nice apparell and wanton lookes? But away for shame with these coloured clokes of idolatrie, of the bookes and scriptures of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and pictures, to teache idiottes, nay to make idiotes and starke fooles &amp; beastes of Christians. Do men, I pray you, when they haue the same bookes at home with them, runne on pylgry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to seeke like bookes at <hi>Rome, Compostella,</hi> or <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to be taught by them, when they haue the lyke to learne of at home? Do men reuerence some bookes, and despyse and set lyght by other of the same sorte? Do men kneele before theyr bookes, light candels at noone time, burne incense, offer vp gold and siluer, and other giftes to theyr bookes? Do men eyther fayne or beleue miracles to be wrought by theyr bookes? I am sure that the newe Testament of our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jesus Christe, conteynyng the worde of lyfe, is a more lyuely, expresse, and true image of our sauiour, then all carued, grauen, moulten, and paynted images in the worlde be, and yet none of all these thynges be done to that booke or scripture of the Gospell of our sauiour, which be done to images &amp; pictures, the bookes and scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of lay men and idiotes, as they call them.

For yf you wyll truely honour the image of God, you should by doyng well to man, honour the true image of God in hym. For the image of God is in euery man: But the likenesse of God is not in euery one, but in those onlye which haue a godly heart and pure mynde. If you wyll therefore truely honour the image of God, we do declare to you the trueth, that ye do well to man, who is made after the image of God, that you geue honour and reuerence to hym, and refreshe the hungry with meate, the thirstie with drynke, the naked with clothes, the sicke with attendaunce, the straunger harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse with lodgyng, the prysoners with necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; this shalbe accompted as truely bestowed vpon God.

For what honour of God is this, to runne to images of

               <p>Note I pray you, howe this most auncient and learned doctour, within one hundred yeres of our sauiour Christes tyme, moste playnely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that no seruice of God, or religion accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, can be in honouryng of dead images: but in succouring of the poore, the liuely images of God, according to saint James, who sayth, This is the pure and true religion before God the father, to succour fatherlesse and motherlesse chyldren and wyddowes in theyr affliction, and to hepe hym selfe vndefyled from this worlde. True religion then and pleasing of god, standeth not in makyng, settyng vp, payntyng, gylding, clothing, &amp; decking of dumbe and dead images (which be but great puppettes and mawmettes for old fooles in dotage, and wicked idolatrie, to dally and play with) nor in kyssyng of them, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng, kneelyng, offeryng to them, in sensyng of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, setting vp of candels, hanging vp of legges, armes, or whole bodies of waxe before them, or praying, &amp; askyng of them or of saintes, thynges belongyng onlye to God to geue. But al these thynges be vayne and abominable, and moste
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6498:80"/>
damnable before God. Wherefore all suche do not only bestowe theyr money and labour in vayne: but with theyr paynes and coste, purchase to them selues gods wrath &amp; vtter indignation, and euerlasting damnation both of bodye and soule. For ye haue hearde it euidently proued in these Homilees against idolatrie, by Gods word, the doctours of the Churche, ecclesiasticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, reason, and experience, that images haue ben and be worshypped, and so idolatrie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by infinite multitudes, to the great offence of Gods maiestie, and daunger of infinite soules, and that idolatrie can not possiblye be separated from images set vp in Churches and Temples, gylded and decked gorgeouslye, and that therfore our images be in deede verye idols, and so all the prohibitions, lawes, curses, threatnynges of horrible plagues, as well tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall as eternall, conteyned in the holy scripture, concerning idols, and the makers, mainteyners, and worshyppers of them, apparteyne also to our images set vp in Churches and Temples, to the makers, maynteyners, and worshyppers of them. And all those names of abomination, which Gods word in the holy scriptures geueth to the idols of the Gentiles, apparteyne to our images, beyng idolles like to them, and hauyng lyke idolatrie committed vnto them. And Gods owne mouth in the holye scriptures calleth them vanities, lyes, deceyptes, vncleanlynesse, fylthynesse, dounge, mischeefe, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Lorde. Wherefore Gods horrible wrath, and our moste dreadfull daunger, can
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6498:81"/>
not be auoyded, without the destruction and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abolishing of all suche images and idols out of the Churche and Temple of God, whiche to accomplyshe, GOD put in the myndes of all Christian princes. And in the meane tyme, let vs take heede and be wyse, O ye beloued of the Lord, and let vs haue no straunge gods, but one only god, who made vs when we were nothing, the father of our Lord Jesus Christe, who redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs when we were lost, and with his holye <note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> spirite who doth sanctifie vs. For this is lyfe euerlastyng, to knowe hym to be the onlye true God, and Jesus Christe whom he hath sent. Let vs honour and worship for religions sake none but him, and hym let vs worshyp and honour as he will him selfe, and hath declared by his word, that he wil be honoured and worshipped, not in, nor by images or idolles, whiche he hath moste strayghtly forbidden, neyther in kneelyng, lygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of candels, burnyng of incense, offeryng vp of gyftes vnto images &amp; idols, to beleue that we shall please hym, for all these be abomination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: but let vs honour and worshyp god in spirite and trueth, fearyng and louing hym <note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> aboue all thynges, trustyng in hym onlye, callyng vppon hym, and praying to hym only, praysyng and laudyng of hym onlye, and all other in hym, and for hym. For suche worshyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers doth our heauenly father loue, who is the most purest spirite, and therefore wyll be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shypped in spirite and trueth. And suche wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppers were Abraham, Moyses, Dauid, Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Peter, Paul, John, and all other the holye
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6498:81"/>
patriarkes, prophetes, apostles, martyrs, and all true saintes of God, who all as the true friendes of God, were enemies and destroyers of images and idols as the enemies of God and his true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Wherefore take heede and be wyse, O ye beloued of the Lorde, and that whiche others, contrarie to gods worde, bestowe wickedly, and to their damnation, vpon dead stockes &amp; stones, (no images, but enemies of god and his saintes) that bestowe ye, as the faithfull seruauntes of God, according to Gods worde, mercifully vpon poore men and women, fatherlesse children, wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, sicke persons, straungers, prisoners, and such others that be in any necessitie, that ye may at that great daye of the Lorde, heare that most blessed and comfortable saying of our Sauiour Christ: Come ye blessed into the kingdome of my father, prepared for you before the beginning of the worlde. For I was hungrye, and ye gaue me meate, thirstie, and ye gaue me drinke, naked, &amp; ye clothed me, harbourlesse, and ye lodged me, in prison, and ye visited me, sicke, &amp; ye comforted me.

Ye haue sowed much, and gathered in but little, your meate and your clothes haue neither filled you, nor made you warme, and he that had his wages, put it in a bottomlesse purse. By these plagues whiche God layde vppon his people for neglecting of his temple, it maye euidentlye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that GOD will haue his Temple, his Churche, the place where his congregation shal resort to magnifie him, well edified, well repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and well mainteined. Some, neither regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding godlines, nor the place of godlye exercise, will say: The temple in the olde lawe, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be buylte and repayred by God him selfe, because it had great promises annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and because it was a figure, a sacrament, or a signification of Christe, and also of his Churche. To this maye be easylye aunswered: First, that our Churches are not destitute of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, forasmuche as our Sauiour Christ sayth: Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the middest among them. A great number therefore comming to Church together in the name of Christ, haue there, that is to saye in the Churche, their God and Sauiour Christ Jesus, presently among the congregation of his faythfull people, by his grace, by his fauour and godlye assistance, according to his moste assured and comfortable promises. Why then ought not Christian people to buylde them Temples and Churches, hauing as great promises of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, as euer had Salomon for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall temple whiche he did buyld? As touching the other point, that Salomons temple was a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6498:83"/>
figure of Christ: We knowe that nowe in the tyme of the cleare light of Christe Jesus the sonne of God, all shadowes, figures, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are vtterly gone, all vayne and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ceremonies, bothe Jewishe and Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe, fully abolished. And therefore our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are not set vp for figures and significations of Messias and Christe to come, but for other godly and necessarie purposes. That is to saye, that lyke as euery man hath his owne house to abyde in, to refreshe him selfe in, to rest in, with such like commodities: So almightie God will haue his house and palace whyther the whole parishe and congregation shall resort, whiche is called the Churche and temple of God, for that the Church, which is the company of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, doth there assemble and come together to serue him. Not meaning hereby, that the Lord whom the heauen of heauens is not hable to holde or compryse, doth dwell in the Churche of lyme, and stone, made with mans handes, as wholly and onely contayned there within, and no where els, for so he neuer dwelt in Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s temple. Moreouer, the Churche or Temple is counted and called holy, yet not of it selfe, but because Gods people resorting thereunto, are holye, and exercyse themselues in holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye thinges. And to the intent ye maye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand further, why Churches were buylte among Christian people, this was the greatest consideration: that God myght haue his place, and that God myght haue his tyme, duely to be honoured and serued of the whole multitude in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:6498:84"/>
the parishe. Fyrst there to heare and learne the blessed worde and will of the euerlasting God. Secondly, that there the blessed Sacramentes, whiche our Lorde and Sauiour Christ Jesus hath ordayned and appoynted, should be dulye, reuerently, and honorably ministred. Thirdlye, that there the whole multitude of Gods people in the parishe, should with one voyce and heart, call vpon the name of God, magnifie and praise the name of GOD, render earnest and hartye thankes to our heauenly father, for his heape of benefites dayly and plentifully powred vpon vs, not forgetting to bestow our almes vpon Gods pouertie, to the intent GOD may blesse vs the more rychely. Thus ye may well perceaue and vnderstand wherfore Churches were buylt and set vp amongst Christian people, and dedicated and appoynted to these godly vses, and vtterlye exempted from all filthy, prophane, and worldly vses. Wherefore all they that haue litle mynde or deuotion to repayre and buyld Gods Temple, are to be counted people of muche vngodlinesse, spurning against good order in Christes church, despysing the true honour of God, with euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample offendyng and hinderyng their neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, otherwyse well and godly disposed. The worlde thinketh but a trifle to see their Churche in ruyne and decay. But who so doth not laye to their helping handes, they sinne against God, and his holye congregation. For if it had not ben sinne to neglect and passe little vppon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying and buylding vp againe of his Temple, God would not haue ben so muche greeued, &amp; so
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6498:84"/>
soone haue plagued his people, because they buylded and decked their owne houses so gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslye, and despysed the house of God their lord. It is sinne and shame to see so manye Churches, so ruynous, and so fouly decayed, almoste in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner. If a mans priuate house wherein he dwelleth be decayed, he will neuer cease till it be restored vp againe. Yea, if his barne where he kepeth his corne be out of reparations, what diligence vseth he to make it in perfeete state a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? If his stable for his horse, yea, the stye for his swyne, be not able to holde out water and wynde, howe carefull is he to do cost thereon? And shall we be so myndful of our common base houses, deputed to so lowe occupying? And be forgetfull toward that house of God, wherin be ministred the wordes of our eternall saluation, wherein be intreated the Sacramentes and mysteries of our redemption? The fountaine of our regeneration is there presented to vs, the partaking of the body and blood of our Sauiour Christe, is there offered vnto vs: And shal we not esteeme the place where so heauenly thinges be handled? Wherefore if ye haue any reuerence to the seruice of God, if ye haue any common hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, if ye haue any conscience in keeping of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and godly ordinaunces, kepe your churches in good repayre, wherby ye shal not onely please God, and deserue his manifolde blessinges, but also deserue the good report of all godly people.</p>
            <p>The seconde poynt, whiche apparteyneth to the mayntenaunce of Gods house, is, to haue it well adourned, &amp; comely, &amp; cleane kept. Whiche
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6498:85"/>
thinges maye be the more easylye perfourmed, when the Churche is well repayred. For lyke as men are wel refreshed and comforted, when they fynde their houses hauing all thinges in good order, and all corners cleane and sweete: So when Gods house the Churche is well adour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with places conuenient to sit in, with the pulpit for the preacher, with the Lordes table for the ministration of his holy supper, with the Fonte to Christen in, and also is kept cleane, comely, and sweetely, the people is the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrous, and the more comforted to resort thyther, and to tarrye there the whole tyme appoynted them. With what earnestnesse, with what vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment zeale did our Sauiour Christ driue the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <note place="margin">Mat. v.</note> and sellers out of the temple of God, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe the tables of the chaungers of mony, and the seates of the doue sellers, and could not abyde that any man should cary a vessel through the temple? He tolde them that they had made his fathers house a denne of theeues, partelye through their superstition, hypocrisie, false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, false doctrine, and insatiable couetousnes, and partly through contempt, abusing that place, with walking and talking, with worldly matters, without all feare of God, and due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that place. What dennes of theeues the Churches of Englande haue ben made by the blasphemous bying and selling the moste preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body and blood of Christe in the Masse, as the worlde was made to beleue, at Diriges, at monthes myndes, in trentalles, in abbeyes and chauntries, beside other horrible abuses (Gods

All these abominations, they that supplie the roome of Christe, haue cleansed and purged the Churches of Englande of, takyng awaye all suche fulsumnesse and filthynesse, as through blynde deuotion and ignoraunce hath crept into the Churche this manye hundred ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Wherefore, O ye good Christian people, ye dearelye beloued in Christ Jesu, ye that glory not in worldly and vaine religion, in phantasticall adourning and decking, but reioyce in heart to see the glory of God truelye set foorth, and the Churches restored to their auncient and godly vse, render your most harty thankes to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of almightie God, who hath in our dayes styrred vp the hearts, not onely of his godly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and ministers, but also of his faythfull and most Christian magistrates and gouernours, to bring suche godly thinges to passe.</p>
            <p>And forasmuche as your Churches are scoured and swept from the sinnefull and superstitious fylthynesse wherewith they were defiled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured: Do ye your partes, good people, to kepe your Churches comely and cleane, suffer them not to be defyled with rayne and weather, with dounge of doues, and owles, stares, &amp; choughes, and other filthinesse, as it is soule and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to beholde in many places of this countrey.

And yet his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not by these words, to induce vs to haue any affiaunce, or to put anye confidence in our workes, as by the merite and deseruing of them to purchase to our selues and others remission of sinne, &amp; so consequently euerlasting lyfe, for that were mere blasphemie against Gods mercy, and great derogation to the bloodshedding of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Jesus Christe.

Grace (sayth S. Augustine)
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6498:87"/>
belongeth to God, who doth call vs, and then hath he good works, whosoeuer receaued grace. <note place="margin">Augu. de diuer. que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti. ad sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plic. lib. i. quest. 28.</note> Good workes then bring not foorth grace: but are brought foorth by grace. The wheele (sayeth he) turneth rounde, not to the ende that it maye be made rounde: but because it is firste made rounde, therefore it turneth round. So, no man doth good workes, to receaue grace by his good workes: but because he hath first receaued grace, therefore consequentlye he doth good workes. And in another place he sayth: Good workes go not before in him whiche shall afterwarde be iustified, but good workes do folow after when <note place="margin">Augu. de fide &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus cap. 4.</note> a man is first iustified. Saynt Paule therefore teacheth, that we must do good workes for dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers respectes. First, to shewe our selues obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent children vnto our heauenly father, who hath ordeyned them, that we shoulde walke in them. Secondly, for that they are good declarations and testimonies of our iustification. Thirdly, that others seing our good workes, may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by them be stirred vp and excited to glorifie our father which is in heauen. Let vs not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be slacke to do good workes, seyng it is the will of God, that we should walke in them, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our selues that at the last daye, euery man shall receaue of God for his labour done in true faith, a greater rewarde then his workes haue deserued. And because somewhat shall nowe be spoken of one particuler good woorke, whose commendation is both in the lawe, and in the Gospell: thus muche is sayde in the beginning generally of all good workes. First, to remoue
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6498:87"/>
out of the way of the simple and vnlearned, this daungerous stumbling blocke, that anye man should go about to purchase or bye heauen with his workes. Secondly, to take away (so nyghe as may be) from enuious myndes, and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tongues, all iust occasion of slaunderous speaking, as though good workes were reiected. This good worke which now shall be entreated of, is Fasting, whiche is founde in the scriptures to be of two sortes. The one outwarde, partey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the body, the other inward, in the hart and mynde. This outward fast, is an abstinence from meate, drinke, and all naturall foode, yea, from al delicious pleasures &amp; delectations world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When this outward fast parteyneth to one particuler man, or to a few, and not to the whole number of the people, for causes whiche hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shalbe declared, then it is called a priuate fast: But when the whole multitude of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, in a towneship of Citie, yea, though a whole countrey do faste, it is called a publique fast. Suche was that fast whiche the whole multitude of the children of Israel were commaunded to keepe the tenth daye of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth moneth, because almightie God appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that daye to be a clensing day, a day of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, a tyme of reconciliation, a day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the people were cleansed from their sinnes. The order and maner how it was done, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the xvi. and. xxiii. Chapter of Leuiticus. That day the people did lament, mourne, weepe <note place="margin">Leui. xvi. and. xxiii.</note> and bewayle their former sinnes. And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer vpon that day did not humble his soule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6498:88"/>
his sinnes, as is sayd, abstayning from all bodyly foode, vntill the euening, that soule, (sayeth almightie God) should be destroyed from among his people. We do not reade that Moyses ordayned by order of lawe, any dayes of publique fast throughout the whole yere, more then that one day. The Jewes notwithstanding had more tymes of common fasting, whiche the Prophete Zacharie reciteth, to be the fast of the fourth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 8.</note> fast of the fifth, the fast of the seuenth, and the fast of the tenth moneth. But for that it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not in the leuiticall lawe when they were instituted, it is to be iudged, that those other times of fasting, more then the fast of the seuenth moneth, were ordeyned among the Jewes by the appoyntment of their gouernours, rather of deuotion, then by any open commaundement geuen from God. Upon the ordinaunce of this general fast, good men tooke occasion to appoynt to them selues priuate fastes, at suche tymes as they did eyther earnestlye lament and bewayle their sinfull lyues, or did addict them selues to more feruent prayer, that it might please God to turne his wrath from them, when eyther they were admonished and brought to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof by the preaching of the Prophetes, or otherwise when they sawe present daunger to hange ouer their heades. This sorowfulnes of heart, ioyned with fasting, they vttered some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme by their outwade behauiour and gesture of body, putting on sackcloth, sprinckling them selues with ashes and dust, and sitting or lying vppon the earth. For when good men feele in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6498:88"/>
them selues the heauy burden of sinne, see damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be the rewarde of it, and beholde with the eye of their mynde the horrour of hell, they tremble, they quake, and are inwardly touched with sorowfulnesse of heart for their offences, and cannot but accuse them selues, and open this their griefe vnto almyghtie God, and call vnto him for mercye. This being done seriously, their mynde is so occupyed, partly with sorrowe and heauinesse, partly with an earnest desyre to be deliuered from this daunger of hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that all lust of meate and drinke is layde apart, and lothsomnesse of all worldlye thinges and pleasures commeth in place, so that nothing then liketh them more, then to weepe, to lament, to mourne, and both with wordes and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of bodye, to shewe them selues weary of this lyfe. Thus did Dauid fast, when he made inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to almightie God for the chyldes lyfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in adultrie of <hi>Bethsabe Vrias</hi> wyfe. King <hi>Achab</hi> fasted after this sorte, when it repented him of murdering of <hi>Naboth,</hi> bewayling his owne sinfull doinges. Suche was the Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites fast, brought to repentaunce by <hi>Ionas</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. When fourtie thousande of the Israelites were slayne in battaile against the Beniamites, the scripture sayeth: All the children of Israel, <note place="margin">Iudg. 20.</note> and the whole multitude of people went out to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and sate there weeping before the Lord, and fasted all that daye vntill nyght. So did <hi>Daniel, Hester, Nehemias,</hi> and many others in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde testament fast. But if anye man will saye, it is true, so they fasted in deede, but we are not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:6498:89"/>
nowe vnder that yoke of the lawe, we are set at libertie by the freedome of the Gospell: therfore those rites and customes of the olde lawe, bynde not vs, except it can be shewed by the scriptures of the new Testament, or by examples out of the same, that fasting nowe vnder the Gospell, is a restraint of meate, drynke, and all bodily foode and pleasures fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, as before. First, that we ought to fast, is a trueth more manifest, then that it should here neede to be proued, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whiche teache the same, are euident. The doubt therfore that is, is whether when we fast, we ought to withhold from our bodyes all meat and drinke, duryng the time of our fast, or no? That we ought so to do, may be well gathered vppon a question moued by the Pharisees to Christ, and by his aunswere againe to the same. Why (say they) do Johns Disciples fast often, &amp; praye, and we lykewyse? but thy disciples eate <note place="margin">Luke. v.</note> and drinke, and fast not at all. In this smoothe question, they coutch vp subtilly this argument or reason: Who so fasteth not, that man is not of God. For fasting and prayer are workes bothe commended, and commaunded of GOD in his scriptures: and all good men, from Moyses till this time, as well the prophetes, as others, haue exercised them selues in these workes. John al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so and his disciples at this daye do fast oft, and pray muche, and so do we the Pharisees in lyke maner: But thy disciples fast not at all, whiche if thou wilt denye, we can easylye proue it. For whosoeuer eateth and drinketh, fasteth not. Thy disciples eate and drinke, therefore they fast not.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6498:89"/>
Of this we conclude (say they) necessaryly, that neyther art thou, nor yet the disciples of GOD. Christe maketh aunswere, saying, Can ye make that the children of the weddyng shal fast, while the brydegrome is with them? The dayes shall come, when the bridegrome shalbe taken from them: In those dayes shall they faste. Our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christe, like a good maister, defendeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of his disciples, agaynst the malice of the arrogant Pharisees, and prooueth that his disciples are not gyltie of transgressyng any iot of Gods lawe, although as then they tasted not, and in his aunswere reproueth the Pharisees of superstition and ignoraunce. Superstition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they put a religion in theyr doyngs, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed holynesse to the outward worke wrought, not regardyng to what ende fastyng is orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Of ignoraunce, for that they coulde not discerne betweene tyme and tyme. They knewe not that there is a tyme of reioycyng and myrth, and a tyme agayne of lamentation and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, whiche both he teacheth in his aunswere, as shalbe touched more largely hereafter, when we shall shewe what tyme is moste fit to fast in.</p>
               <p>But here beloued let vs note, that our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christe, in makyng his aunswere to theyr question, denyed not, but confessed that his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fasted not, and therefore agreeth to the pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees in this, as vnto a manifest trueth: that who so eateth and drynketh fasteth not. Fastyng then, euen by Christes assent, is a with holdyng of meate, drinke, and all naturall foode from the body, for the determined tyme of fastyng. And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:6498:90"/>
that it was vsed in the primatiue Churche, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth most euidently by the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, one of the foure first generall counselles. The fathers assembled there, to the number of. 630. consydering with them selues howe acceptable a thing fasting is to God, when it is vsed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to his worde: Agayne, hauing before theyr eyes also the great abuses of the same, crept into the Churche at those dayes, through the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of them whiche shoulde haue taught the people the right vse thereof, and by vaine gloses, deuised of men: To refourme the sayde abuses, and to restore this so good and godly a worke, to the true vse therof, decreed in that counsell, that euery person, aswell in his priuate as publique fast, shoulde continue all the day without meate and drinke, till after the Euenyng prayer. And whosoeuer did eate or drinke before the Euening prayer was ended, shoulde be accompted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted not to consyder the puritie of his fast. This cannon teacheth so euidently howe fastyng was vsed in the primatiue Churche, as by wordes, it can not be more plainely expressed.</p>
               <p>Fasting then, by the decree of those sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and thirtie fathers, groundyng their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in this matter vppon the sacred scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and long continued vsage or practise, both of the prophetes and other godly persons before the comming of Christe, and also of the apostles and other deuoute men in the newe Testament: is, a with holdyng of meate, drinke, and all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fodde from the body for the determined time of fastyng. Thus muche is spoken hytherto, to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:6498:90"/>
make playne vnto you what fastyng is. Nowe hereafter shalbe shewed the true and ryght vse of fastyng.</p>
               <p>Good workes are not all of one sorte. For some are of them selues, and of their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature alwayes good: as to loue God aboue all thinges, to loue my neighbour as my selfe, to honour father and mother, to honour the higher powers, to geue to euery man that which is his due, and suche like. Other workes there be, whiche consydered in themselues without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respect, are of their owne nature, mere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that is, neither good nor euill, but take their denomination of the vse or ende whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they serue. Whiche workes hauing a good ende, are called good workes, and are so in deede: but yet that commeth not of them selues, but of the good ende wherevnto they are referred. On the other side, if the ende that they serue vnto be euill, it can not then otherwyse be, but that they must needes be euill also. Of this sort of workes, is fasting, which of it selfe is a thing meerely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: But is made better or worse by the ende that it serueth vnto. For when it respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a good ende, it is a good worke: but the ende beyng euill, the worke it selfe is also euill. To fast then with this perswasion of minde, that our fasting, and our good workes, can make vs perfect and iust men, and finally, bring vs to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: this is a deuelish perswasion, and that fast, so farre of from pleasing god, that it refuseth his mercie, and is altogether derogatorie to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christes death, and his pretious blood
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:6498:91"/>
shedding. This doth the parable of the Pharisee and the Publicane teache. Two men (sayth <note place="margin">Luke. viii.</note> Christe) went vp together into the Temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, the other a Publicane. The Pharisee stoode &amp; prayed thus within hym selfe: I thanke thee O God, that I am not as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are, extortioners, vniust, adulterers, &amp; as this Publicane is. I fast twise in the weeke, I geue tithes of all that I possesse. The Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane stoode a farre of, and woulde not lift vp his eyes to heauen, but smote his brest, and sayde, God be mercifull to me a sinner. In the person of this Pharisee, our Sauiour Christ setteth out to the eye, and to the iudgement of the worlde, a perfect, iust, and righteous man, suche one as is not spotted with those vices that men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye are infected with, extortion, briberie, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and pilling their neighbour, robbers and spoylers of common weales, craftie, and subtile, in chopping &amp; chaunging, vsing false waightes, and detestable periurie in their buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, fornicatours, adulterers, &amp; vicious liuers. The Pharisee was no such man, neyther faultie in any suche like notorious crime. But where other transgressed by leauing thinges vndone, whiche yet the lawe required: this man dyd more then was requisite by lawe. For he fasted twyse in the weeke, and gaue tythes of all that he had. What could the worlde then iustly blame in this man? yea, what outwarde thing more could be desired to be in him, to make him a more perfect, and a more iust man? Truelye nothyng by mans iudgement: And yet our Sauiour
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6498:91"/>
Christe preferreth the poore Puplicane without fasting before him with his fast. The cause why he doth so, is manifest. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Publicane hauing no good works at al to trust vnto, yelded vp him selfe vnto God, confessing his sinnes, and hoped certainely to be saued by Gods free mercie only. The Pharisee gloried, &amp; trusted so much to his workes, that he thought him selfe sure enough without mercie, and that he should come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his fasting and other deedes. To this ende serueth that parable. For it is spoken to them that trusted in them selues, that they were ryghteous, and despised other. Nowe because the Pharisee directed his worke to an euill ende, seeking by them iustification, whiche in deede is the proper worke of God, without our merites, his fasting twise in the weeke, and all his other workes, though they were neuer so many, and seemed to the worlde neuer so good and holy, yet in very deede before god, they are altogether euil and abominable. The marke also that the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites shoote at with their fast, is, to appeare holy in the eye of the worlde, and so to winne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and prayse of men.

For he sayth, that his soule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth <note place="margin">Esai. 1.</note> &amp; hateth such fastings, yea they are a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vnto him, &amp; he is weary of bearyng them. And therefore he inuayeth moste sharply against them, saying by the mouth of the prophete Esai, Beholde, when you fast, your lust remaineth stil, for ye do no lesse violence to your debters. Lo, ye <note place="margin">Esai. 8.</note> fast to strife and debate, and to smite with the fiste of wickednes. Nowe ye shall not fast thus, that you maye make your voyce to be hearde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue. Thinke ye this fast pleaseth me, that a man should chasten him selfe for a day? should that be called a fasting, or a day that pleaseth the Lorde? Nowe dearely beloued, seeyng that almightie God aloweth not our fast for the workes sake, but chiefely respecteth our heart howe it is affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then esteemeth our fast eyther good or euill by thend that it serueth for: it is our part to rente our heartes, and not our garmentes, as we are aduertised by the prophete Joel, that is, <note place="margin">Joel. 2.</note> our sorowe and mournyng must be inwarde in heart, and not in outward shewe onlye, yea it is requisite that first before all thinges we cleanse our hearts from sinne, and then to direct our fast to such an ende as God wyll alowe to be good.</p>
               <p>There be three endes, whereunto if your fast be directed, it is then a worke profitable to vs, and accepted of God.</p>
               <p>The first is, to chastise the fleshe, that it be not to wanton, but tamed and brought in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the spirite. This respecte had Saint Paul <note place="margin">

in his fast, when he said, I chastice my body, and bring it into subiection, least by anye meanes it commeth to passe, that when I haue preached to other, I my selfe be founde a castaway.</p>
               <p>The seconde, that the spirite may be more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and earnest to prayer. To this ende fasted the prophetes and teachers that were at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oche, <note place="margin">Actes. 13.</note> before they sent foorth Paul and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas to preache the Gospell. The same two Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles fasted for the like purpose, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to God, by their earnest prayers, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations that were at <hi>Antioch, Pisidia, Iconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>

               <p>The thirde, that our fast be a testimonie and witnesse with vs before God, of our humble sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to his high maiestie, when we confesse and acknowledge our sinnes vnto him, &amp; are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly touched with sorowfulnesse of heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling the same in the affliction of our bodies.

Whiche order, though it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth strange to some in these our dayes, because it hath not ben so vsed generally in this Realme of many yeres past: yet that it was so amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g gods people (I meane the Jewes) whom before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our sauiour Christ, god did vouchsafe to chose vnto him selfe, a peculier people aboue all other nations of the earth, and that our sauiour Christ so vnderstood it, &amp; the apostles after Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes ascention did so vse it, was there sufficiently proued by the testimonies &amp; examples of the holy scriptures, aswel of the new Testament, as of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:6498:93"/>
olde. The true vse of fasting was there also she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. In this seconde part of this Homilee shall be shewed, that no constitution or lawe made by man, for thinges whiche of their owne proper nature be meere indifferent, can bynde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of Christen men to a perpetuall obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and keping therof, but that the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers hath full libertie to alter and chaunge euery such lawe and ordinaunce, eyther ecclesiasticall, or politicall, when time and place shall require. But first an aunswere shalbe made to a question that some may make, demaunding what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ought to haue of suche abstinences as are appoynted by publique order &amp; lawes made by princes, and by the aucthoritie of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, vpon policie, not respecting any religion at all in the same. As when any Realme in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syderation of the mainteyning of fissher townes borderyng vpon the seas, and for the encrease of fisshermen, of whom do spring Mariners to go vpon the sea, to the furnishing of the nauie of the Realme, whereby not onlye the commodities of other countreys maye be transported, but also may be a necessarie defence to resist the inuasion of the aduersarie.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderstanding of this question, it is necessarie that we make a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the pollicies of princes, made for the orderyng of their common weales, in prouision of thinges seruing to the more sure defence of their subiects and countreyes, and betweene ecclesiasticall pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, in prescribing such workes, by whiche, as by secondary meanes, Gods wrath may be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6498:94"/>
and his mercie purchased. Positiue lawes made by princes for conseruation of theyr polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, not repugnaunt vnto Gods lawe, ought of all Christian subiectes with reuerence of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to be obaied, not only for feare of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but also (as the apostle sayth) for conscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake. Conscience I say, not of the thing which of the owne nature is indifferent: but of our obedience, which by the law of God we owe vnto the Magistrate, as vnto Gods minister. By whiche positiue lawes, though we subiectes for certaine times &amp; dayes appoynted, be restrained from some kindes of meates and drinke, whiche God by his holy worde hath left free to be taken and vsed of all men with thankes geuing in all places and at all times: yet for that suche lawes of princes and other magistrates are not made to put holines in one kinde of meate &amp; drinke more then another, to make one day more holye then another, but are grounded merely vpon poliicie, al subiectes are bound in conscience to kepe them by Gods commaundement, who by the Apostle willeth all without exception, to submit them selues vnto the aucthoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higher powers. And in this point concerning our dueties which be here dwelling in Englande, enuironed with the sea as we be, we haue great occasion in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to take the commodities of the water, which almightie God by his diuine prouidence hath layd so nye vnto vs, whereby the encrease of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals vppon the land may the better be spared &amp; cherished, to the sooner reducing of victualles to a more moderate price, to the better sustenaunce
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:6498:94"/>
of the poore. And doubtlesse he seemeth to be to daintie an English man, which consydering the great commodities whiche may ensue, wyll not forbeare some peece of his licentious appetite vpon the ordinaunce of his prince, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the wyse of the Realme. What good Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe heart woulde not wishe the olde auncient glory should returne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme, wherin it hath with great commendations excelled before our dayes, in the furniture of the Nauie of the same? What wyll more daunt the heartes of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, then to see vs as well fenced and armed on the sea, as we be reported to be on the lande? If the prince requested our obedience to forbeare one day from fleshe more then we do, and to be contented with one meale in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same day, shoulde not our owne commoditie thereby perswade vs to subiection. But now that two meales be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on that day to be vsed, whiche sometime our elders in very great numbers in the Realme dyd vse with one onlye spare meale, and that in fishe onlye: shall we thinke it so great a burthen that is prescribed?</p>
               <p>Furthermore consyder the decay of the townes nye the seas, whiche shoulde be most redy by the number of the people there to repulse the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and we whiche dwell further of vppon the lande, hauing them as our buckler to defend vs, should be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more in suretie.

If they be our defence, as nyest at hand to repell the enemie, to kepe out the rage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seas whiche els woulde breake vpon our faire pastures, why should we not cherish them? Neither do we vrge

that in the ecclesiasticall pollicie, prescribing a fourme of fasting, to humble our selues in the sight of almightie God, that that order whiche was vsed among the Jewes, and practised by Christes Apostles after his ascention, is of suche force and necessitie, that that onlye ought to be vsed among Christians, and none other, for that were to binde Gods people vnto the yoke &amp; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of Moyses pollicie, yea, it were the verye way to bring vs whiche are set at libertie by the freedome of Christes Gospel, into the bondage of the law againe, which God forbid that any man shoulde attempt or purpose. But to this ende it serueth, to shewe howe farre the order of fasting nowe vsed in the Churche at this day, differeth from that which then was vsed. Gods Churche ought not, neither may i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie Christ him selfe vsed, and left it vnto his Church. He vsed it I say: For the order or decree made by the elders for washing oft times, which was diligently obserued of the Jewes: yet ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to superstition, our sauiour Christe altered and changed the same in his Church, into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable sacrament, the sacrament of our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or newe birth. This aucthoritie to mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate lawes and decrees ecclesiasticall, thapostles
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6498:95"/>
practised, when they, wryting from Hierusalem <note place="margin">Actes. 15.</note> vnto the congregation that was at Antioche, signified vnto them that they would not lay any further burthen vppon them, but these necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: That is, that they shoulde abstayne from thinges offered vnto idols, from blood, from that whiche is strangled, and from fornication, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng that Moyses law required many other obseruances. This aucthoritie to chaunge the orders, decrees, and constitutions of the Churche, was after the Apostles time vsed of the fathers about the maner of fasting, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the Tripartite historie, where it is thus <note place="margin">Tripartit. hist. lib. 9. cap. 38.</note> written: Touching fasting, we finde that it was diuersly vsed in diuers places by diuers men. For they at Rome fast three weekes together before Easter, sauing vpon the Saterdayes and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, whiche faste they call Lent. And after a fewe lines in the same place, it foloweth: They haue not all one vniforme order in fastyng. For some do fast and abstayne both from fishe and fleshe. Some when they fast, eate nothyng but fishe. Others there are, which when they fast, eate of all water foules, as well as of fishe, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues vpon Moyses, that such foules haue their substaunce of the water, as the fishes haue. Some others when they fast, wyll neither eate hearbes nor egges. Some fasters there are, that eate nothing but drye bread. Others when they fast, eate nothing at all, no not so muche as drye bread. Some fast from all maner of foode tyll nyght, and then eate, without makyng any choyse or difference of meates. And a thousande
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:6498:96"/>
such like diuers kindes of fasting may be founde in diuers places of the worlde, of diuers men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly vsed. And for all this great diuersitie in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, yet charitie the very true bonde of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">Eus. lib. 5. cap. 24.</note> peace was not broken, neyther dyd the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of fasting breake at anye time their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and concorde in fayth. To abstaine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time from certayne meates, not because the meates are enill, but because they are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie: <note place="margin">Dogma. ecclesiast. cap. 66.</note> This abstinence (sayth Saint Augustine) is not euill. And to restraine the vse of meates when necessitie and time shall require: this (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he) doth properly parteyne to Christian men.</p>
               <p>Thus ye haue hearde good people, fyrst that Christian subiectes are bound euen in conscience to obey princes lawes, whiche are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt to the lawes of God. Ye haue also hearde that Christes Churche is not so bounde to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue any order, lawe, or decree made by man, to prescribe a fourme in religion: but that the Churche hath full power and aucthoritie from God, to chaunge and aulter the same when nede shall require, which hath ben shewed you by the example of our sauiour Christe, by the practise of the apostles, and of the fathers since that time.</p>
               <p>Nowe shall be shewed briefely what tyme is meete for fasting, for all times serue not for all thinges. But as the wyse man sayth: All thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue their times. There is a time to weepe, and a time agayne to laugh, a time to mourne, <note place="margin">Ecclesi. 3.</note> and a time to reioyce. &amp;c. Our Sauiour Christe excused his disciples, &amp; reproued the Pharisees, because they neyther regarded the vse of fasting,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:6498:96"/>
nor consydered what tyme was meete for the same. Which both he teacheth in his aunswere, saying, The chyldren of the maryage can not <note place="margin">Matth. 9.</note> mourne, whyle the bridegrome is with them. Their question was of fasting, his aunswere is of mournyng, signifying vnto them plainely, that the outwarde fast of the body, is no fast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, except it be accompanyed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde fast, whiche is a mournyng and a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the heart, as is before declared. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng <note place="margin">Matth. 9. Luke. 5.</note> the time of fasting, he sayth? The dayes wyll come, when the bridegrome shalbe taken from them, in those dayes they shall fast. By this it is manifest, that it is no time of fastyng whyle the mariage lasteth, and the bridegrome is there present. But when the mariage is ended, and the bridegrome gone, then is it a meete time to faste. Now to make plaine vnto you what is the sence and meanyng of these wordes: <hi>VVe are at the mariage,</hi> and agayne, <hi>The bridegrome is taken from vs.</hi> Ye shall note, that so long as GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth his mercie vnto vs, and geueth vs of his benefites, eyther spirituall or corporall, we are saide to be with the bridegrome at the mariage. So was that good olde father Jacob at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, when he vnderstood that his sonne Joseph was aliue, and ruled all Egypt vnder king Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao. So was Dauid in the mariage with the bridegrome, when he had gotten the victorie of great Goliah, and had smitten of his head. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith and all the people of <hi>Bethulia</hi> were the children of the wedding, and had the bridegrome with them, when God had by the hande of a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6498:97"/>
woman slayne Holofernes, the graund captaine of the Assyrians hoaste, and discomfited al theyr enemies. Thus were the Apostles the children of the mariage while Christe was corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with them, &amp; defended them from all daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, both spirituall and corporall. But the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is saide then to be ended, and the bryde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome to be gone, when almightie God smiteth vs with affliction, and semeth to leaue vs in the middest of a number of aduersities. So GOD sometime striketh priuate men priuatelye with sundry aduersities, as trouble of minde, losse of frendes, losse of goodes, long and daungerous sicknesses. &amp;c. Then is it a fitte time for that man to humble him selfe to almightie God by fasting, and to mourne and bewayle his sinnes with a sorowfull heart, and to pray vnfaignedly, saying with the prophete Dauid: Turne away thy face, <note place="margin">Psalm. 51.</note> O Lorde, from my sinnes, and blot out of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce all myne offences. Agayne, when God shal afflict a whole region or countrey with warres, with famine, with pestilence, with straunge diseases, and vnknowen sicknesses, and other such lyke calamities: then is it tyme for all states and sortes of people, hygh and lowe, men, women, and chyldren, to humble them selues by fasting, and bewayle their sinfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing before God, and pray with one common voyce, saying thus, or some other suche like pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Be fauourable, O Lord, be fauourable vnto thy people, whiche turneth vnto thee, in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng, fasting, and praying, spare thy people whom thou hast redeemed with thy pretious
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:6498:97"/>
blood, and suffer not thine inheritaunce to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and brought to confusion.</p>
               <p>Fastyng thus vsed with prayer, is of great efficacie, and wayeth much with God. So the angell <hi>Raphel</hi> tolde <hi>Tobias.</hi> It also appeareth <note place="margin">Tobi. 12.</note> by that which our sauiour Christe aunswered to his disciples, demaunding of him why they coulde not cast foorth the euyll spirite out of him that was brought vnto them. This hynde (sayth he) is not cast out but by fastyng and prayer. How auayleable fasting is, how muche it way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with God, and what it is able to obteyne at his hande, can not better be set foorth, then by openyng vnto you, and laying before you some of those notable thynges that hath ben brought to passe by it.</p>
               <p>Fastyng was one of the meanes whereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtie God was occasioned to alter the thyng whiche he had purposed concernyng <hi>Ahab,</hi> for murdering the innocent man <hi>Naboth,</hi> to possesse his vineyarde. God spake vnto <hi>Elia,</hi> saying: Go thy way and say vnto <hi>Ahab,</hi> Hast thou killed, and also gotten possession? Thus sayth the Lord: <note place="margin">3. Reg. 11.</note> It the place where dogges licked the blood of <hi>Naboth,</hi> shall dogges euen licke thy blood also. Beholde, I wyll bryng euill vpon thee, and wyll take away thy posteritie: Yea, the dogges shall eate him of <hi>Ahabs</hi> stocke that dyeth in the Citie, and hym that dieth in the feelde shall the foules of the ayre eate. This punishment had almightie God determined for <hi>Ahab</hi> in this worlde, and to destroy all the male kynde that was begotten of <hi>Ahabs</hi> body, besides that punishment whiche
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:6498:98"/>
shoulde haue happened vnto hym in the worlde to come. When <hi>Ahab</hi> heard this, he rent his clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, and put sackcloth vppon hym, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went bare footed. Then the word of the Lord came to <hi>Elia,</hi> saying: Seest thou how <hi>Ahab</hi> is humbled before me? Because he submitteth hym selfe before me, I wyll not bryng that euyll in his dayes, but in his sonnes dayes wyll I bryng it vpon his house. Although <hi>Ahab</hi> through the wicked counsell of <hi>Iesabel</hi> his wyfe had committed shamefull murder, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst all ryght, disherited and dispossessed for euer <hi>Nabothes</hi> stocke of that vineyarde: yet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his humble submission in heart vnto God, whiche he declared outwardly by putting on sackcloth and fasting, God changed his sentence, so that the punishmente whiche he had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, fell not vpon <hi>Ahabs</hi> house in his tyme, but was deferred vnto the dayes of <hi>Ioram</hi> his sonne. Here we may see of what force our outwarde fast is, when it is accompanyed with the inward fast of the mynd, which is (as is sayde) a sorowful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, detesting and bewayling our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doinges. The lyke is to be seene in the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites:</hi> For when God had determined to destroy the whole Citie of <hi>Niniue,</hi> and the time which he had appoynted, was euen no we at hande, he sent the prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> to say vnto them: yet fourtie <note place="margin">Ionas. 3.</note> dayes, and <hi>Niniue</hi> shalbe ouerthrowne. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by and by beleued God, and gaue them selues to fasting, yea, the kyng by thaduise of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell caused to be proclamed, saying: Let neyther man nor beast, bullock nor sheepe tast any thing,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:6498:98"/>
neither feede, nor drinke water: But let man and beast put on sackcloth, and cry mightilie vnto God, yea, let euery man turne from his euil way, and from the wickednes that is in their handes. Who can tell if God will turne and repent, and turne away from his fierce wrath, that we perish not? And vppon this their heartie repentaunce, thus declared outwardly with fastyng, renting of their clothes, putting on sackcloth, and sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them selues with dust and ashes, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sayth: God saw their workes that they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their euill wayes, and God repented of the euill that he had sayde that he woulde do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and he dyd it not. Nowe beloued, ye haue hearde firste what fasting is, aswell that whiche is outwarde in the body, as that whiche is inward in the heart. Ye haue hearde also that there are three endes or purposes, whereunto if our outwarde fast be directed, it is a good worke that God is pleased with. Thirdely, hath ben de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what tyme is moste meete for to fast, either priuately or publiquely. Last of al, what thynges fastyng hath obteyned of God, by the examples of <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>Niniuites.</hi> Let vs therefore dearely beloued, seeing there are many more causes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng and mournyng in these our dayes, then hath ben of manye yeres heretofore in anye one age, endeuour our selues both inwardly in our heartes, and also outwardly with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, diligently to exercise this godly exercise of fastyng, in suche sorte and maner, as the holy prophetes, the Apostles, and diuers other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute personnes for their tyme vsed the same.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:6498:99"/>
God is now the same God that was then, God that loueth ryghteousnesse, and that hateth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, God whiche wylleth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he turne from his wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and lyue. God that hath promised to turne to vs, if we refuse not to turne to hym: yea, if we turne our euyll workes from before his eyes, ceasse to do euyll, learne to do well, seeke to do ryght, releeue the oppressed, be a ryght iudge to the fatherlesse, defende the wydowe, breake our bread to the hungry, bryng the poore that wander into our house, clothe the naked, and despise not our brother which is our owne fleshe: then shalt thou call (sayth the Prophete) and the Lorde shall aunswere, thou shalt cry, and he shal saye, here am I: Yea, God whiche heard <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> and spared them, will also heare our prayers, and spare vs, so that we, after their example, will vnfaignedly turne vnto him, yea he wyll blesse vs with his heauenly benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the tyme that we haue to tary in this worlde, &amp; after the rase of this mortal life, he will bring vs to his heauenly kingdome, where we shall raigne in euerlasting blessednesse with our sauiour Christ, to whom with the father and the holy ghost be all honour and glory for euer and euer.</p>

            <head>¶ An Homilee <hi>agaynst gluttony and</hi> and drunkennesse.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue heard in the former Sermon welbeloued, the description and the vertue of fastyng, with the true vse of the same. No we ye shall heare howe foule a thing gluttony and drunkennesse is before God, the rather to moue you to vse fasting the more diligently. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande ye therefore, that almightie God (to to thend that we might keepe our selues vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and serue him in holinesse &amp; ryghteousnesse according to his word) hath charged in his scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so many as looke for the glorious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">Titus. 2.</note> of our sauiour Christe, to leade their liues in al sobrietie, modestie, &amp; temperancie. Wherby we may learne how necessarie it is for euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that wyll not be founde vnready at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of our sauiour Christe, to liue sober min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this present worlde, forasmuche as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise being vnready, he can not enter with Christ <note place="margin">Titus. 2.</note> into glorie: And being vnarmed in this behalfe, he muste needes be in continuall daunger of that cruel aduersarie the roring Lion, agaynst whom the Apostle Peter warneth vs to prepare our selues in continuall sobrietie, that we may resist, being stedfast in fayth. To the intent therefore <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> that this sobernesse may be vsed in all our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:6498:100"/>
it shalbe expedient for vs to declare vnto you how muche all kynde of excesse offendeth the maiestie of almightie God, and how greeuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye he punisheth the immoderate abuse of those his creatures whiche he ordeyneth to the mayntenaunce of this our needy lyfe, as meates, drynkes, and apparell. And agayne to shewe the noysome diseases and great mischeefes that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do folow them that inordinately geue vp them selues to be caryed headlong with suche pleasures as are ioyned eyther with daintie and ouerlarge fare, or els with costly and sumptuous apparell.</p>
            <p>And firste, that ye may perceaue how detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hatefull all excesse in eatyng and drynk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is before the face of almyghtie God, ye shall call to mynde what is wrytten by saint Paul to the Galathians, where he numbreth gluttonie <note place="margin">Galat. v.</note> and drunkennesse among those horrible crimes, with the whiche (as he sayth) no man shall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite the kyngdome of heauen. He reckeneth them among the deedes of the flesh, and coupleth them with idolatrie, whoredome, and murder, whiche are the greatest offences that can be named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: For the first spoyleth God of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the seconde defileth his holy Temple, that is to wit, our owne bodyes, the third maketh vs companions of Cayne in the slaughter of our brethren, and who so committeth them as saint Paul sayth, can not inherite the kyngdome of God. Certaynly, that sinne is very odious and lothsome before the face of God, whiche causeth hym to turne his fauourable countenaunce so
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:6498:100"/>
farre from vs, that he shoulde cleane barre vs out of the dores, and disherite vs of his heauenly kyngdome. But he so much abhorreth all beastly <note place="margin">Luke. 6.</note> banquetting, that by his sonne our Sauiour Christe in the Gospell, he declareth his terrible indignation agaynst all belly Gods, in that he pronounceth them accursed, saying: Wo be to you that are full, for ye shall hunger. And by the prophet <hi>Esaias</hi> he crieth out: Wo be to you that rise vp early to geue your selues to drunkennesse, and set al your myndes so on drinkyng, that ye <note place="margin">Esaias. 5.</note> sit swearing therat vntil it be nyght. The harpe, the lute, the shaume, and plentie of wyne are at your feastes, but the workes of the Lord ye do not behold, neither consider the workes of his hands, Wo be vnto you that are strong to drinke wyne. and are mightie to aduaunce drunkennesse. Here the prophet playnely teacheth, that feastyng and banquetting maketh men forgetfull of their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towardes God, when they geue themselues to all kyndes of pleasures, not considering nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the workes of the Lorde, who hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated meates and drinkes, as. S. Paul sayth, to be receaued thankfully of them that beleue &amp; know the trueth. So that the very beholdyng of these creatures (beyng the handy worke of almyghtie God) might teache vs to vse them thankfully as <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> God hath ordeined. Therefore they are without excuse before god, which either filthily feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, not respecting the sanctification which is by the word of god &amp; praier, or els vnthankfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the good creatures of God by surfetting and drunkennes, forasmuch as Gods ordinaunces in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:6498:101"/>
his creatures playnely forbiddeth it. They that geue them selues therefore to bibbing and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting, being altogether without considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods iudgementes, are sodenly oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the day of vengeaunce. And therfore our sauiour Christe warneth his disciples, saying: Take heede to your selues, least at any time your <note place="margin">Luk. 2.</note> heartes be ouercome with surfetting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, and cares of this worlde, and so that day come on you vnwares. Whosoeuer then wyl take warning at Christe, let him take heede to <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> him self, least his heart being ouerwhelmed by surfetting, and drowned in drunkennesse, he be taken vnwares with that vnthriftie seruaunt, which, thinking not on his maisters comming, began to smite his felow seruauntes, and to eate and drinke, and to be drunken, and being soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, hath his iust rewarde with vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hypocrites. They that vse to drinke depely, and to feede at full (wallowing them selues in all kinde of wickednesse) are brought a sleepe in that slumbring forgetfulnesse of Gods holy wyll and commaundementes. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God crieth by the prophet <hi>Ioel:</hi> Awake ye drunkardes, weepe and howle all ye drinkers <note place="margin">Ioel. 1.</note> of wine, because the newe wine shalbe pulled from your mouth. Here the Lord terribly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to withdrawe his benefites from suche as abuse them, and to pull the cup from the mouth of drunkardes. Here we may learne not to sleepe in drunkennes and surfetting, least God depriue vs of the vse of his creatures, when we vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuse them. For certainely the Lorde our God
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:6498:101"/>
wyl not only take away his benefites when they are vnthankfully abused: but also in his wrath and heauye displeasure, take vengeaunce on such as immoderatly abuse them. If our firste pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes <note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> Adam and Eue had not obeyed their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy appetite, in eating the forbidden fruite, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they lost the fruition of Gods benefites which they then enioyed in paradice, neither had they brought so many mischeefes both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and to all their posteritie. But when they passed the bondes that God had appointed them, as vnworthy of Gods benefites they are expelled and dryuen out of paradice, they may no longer eate the fruites of that garden, whiche by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse they had so much abused: As transgressours of Gods commaundement, they and their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie are brought to a perpetuall shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and as accursed of God they must nowe sweate for their liuing, which before had aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce at their pleasure. Euen so, if we in eating and drinking exceede, when God of his large liberalitie sendeth plentie, he wyl soone chaunge plentie into scarsenesse: And where as we gloryed in fulnesse, he wyll make vs emptie, and confounde vs with penurie, yea we shalbe compelled to labour and trauaile with paynes, in seekyng for that whiche we sometime enioyed at ease. Thus the Lorde wyll not leaue them vnpunished, whiche not regardyng his workes, folowe the lustes and appetites of their owne <note place="margin">Gene. 3 Noah.</note> heartes. The patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calleth the preacher of ryghteousnesse, a man exceedingly in Gods fauour, is in holy scripture
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:6498:102"/>
made an example, whereby we may learne to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde drunkennesse. For when he had powred in wine more then was conuenient, in filthie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he lay naked in his tent, his priuities disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: And whereas sometyme he was so muche esteemed, he is now become a laughing stocke to his wicked sonne Cham, no small greefe to Sem and Japheth his other two sonnes, whiche were ashamed of their fathers beastly behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Here we may note that drunkennesse bryngeth with it shame and derision, so that it neuer escapeth vnpunished. Lot in lyke maner beyng ouercome with wine, committeth abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable incest with his owne daughters. So wyll almyghtie God geue ouer drunkardes, to the shamefull lustes of their owne heartes. Here is Lot by drinkyng fallen so farre beside hym <note place="margin">Gene. 3. Lot.</note> selfe, that he knoweth not his owne daughters. Who woulde haue thought that an olde man in that heauie case, hauing lost his wyfe and all that he had, whiche had seene euen nowe Gods vengeaunce in fearefull maner declared on the fiue Cities for their vicious lyuyng, shoulde be so farre past the remembraunce of his duetie? But men ouercome with drynke, are altogether madde as <hi>Seneca</hi> sayth. He was deceaued by his daughters: but nowe many deceaue themselues, <note place="margin">Epist. 84.</note> neuer thinking that GOD by his terrible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmentes wylbe auenged on them that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend by excesse. It is no small plague that Lot purchased by his drunkennesse? For he had copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation moste filthily with his owne daughters, whiche conceaued thereby, so that the matter is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:6498:102"/>
brought to lyght, it can no lenger be hid. Two incestuous chyldren are borne, <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> of whom came two nations, the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> abhorred of God, and cruel aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to his people the Israelites. Lo <hi>Lot</hi> hath gotten to hym selfe by drynking, sorow, and care, with perpetuall infamie and reproche vnto the worldes ende. If God spared not his seruaunt <hi>Lot,</hi> being otherwyse a godly man, nephewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> one that entertained the angelles of God: What wyll he do to these beastly belly slaues, whiche voyde of all godlynes or vertuous behauiour, not once, but continually day and nyght, geue them selues wholly to bibbyng and banquetting? Butlet vs yet further beholde the terrible examples of Gods indignation agaynst <note place="margin">2. Sam. 13.</note> suche as greedyly folowe their vnsatiable lustes. <hi>Ammon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> feastyng hym selfe <note place="margin">Ammon</note> with his brother <hi>Absolon,</hi> is cruelly murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his owne brother <hi>Holophernes,</hi> a valeant and mightie captaine, being ouer whelmed with <note place="margin">Iudith. 19.</note> wine, had his head stricken from his shoulders by that seely woman <hi>Iudith. Simon</hi> the hie priest and his two sonnes <hi>Mattathias</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entertained of <hi>Ptolomie</hi> the son of <hi>Abobus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Mac. 18.</note> who had before maryed <hi>Simons</hi> daughter, after muche eatyng and drynkyng, were trayterously murthered of their owne kynsman. If the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites had not geuen them selues to belly cheare <note place="margin">Fxod. 32.</note> they had neuer so often fallen to idolatrie: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woulde we at this day be so addict to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, were it not that we so much esteemed the fillyng of our bellies. The Israelites when they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:6498:103"/>
serued idolles, sate downe to eate and drynke, <note place="margin">1. Cor. x.</note> and rose agayne to play, as the scripture repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. Therefore seeking to serue their bellyes, they forsooke the seruice of the Lorde their God. So are we drawne to consent vnto wickednesse, when our heartes are ouerwhelmed by drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and feasting. So <hi>Herode</hi> setting his minde on banquetting, was content to graunt that <note place="margin">Mat. 14.</note> the holy man of God John Baptist shoulde be beheaded at the request of his whores daughter, Had not the riche glutton ben so greedely geuen to the pamperyng of his belly, he woulde neuer <note place="margin">Luk. 6.</note> haue ben so vnmercifull to the poore Lazarus, neyther had he felt the tormentes of the vnquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable fire. What was the cause that god so horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly punished <hi>Sodoma</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha?</hi> was it not <note place="margin">Eze. 16.</note> their proud banquetting and continual idlenes, whiche caused them to be so lewde of lyfe, and so vnmercifull towardes the poore? What shall we nowe thinke of the horrible excesse whereby so many haue perished, and ben brought to destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <note place="margin">Alexan.</note> The great Alexander after that he had conquered the whole worlde, was himselfe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by drunkennesse, insomuche that being drunken he slewe his faythfull freende <hi>Clitus,</hi> whereof when he was sober, he was so muche ashamed, that for anguishe of heart he wished death. Yet notwithstandyng, after this he left not his banquetting, but in one nyght swilled in so muche wine that he fell into a feuer, and when as by no meanes he woulde abstaine from wine, within fewe dayes after in miserable sorte he ended his lyfe. The conquerour of the whole
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:6498:103"/>
worlde is made a slaue by excesse, &amp; becommeth so madde that he murdereth his deare freend, he is plagued with sorowe, shame, and greefe of heart for his intemperauncie, yet can he not leaue it, he is kept in captiuitie, and he whiche sometyme had subdued many, is become a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the vile belly. So are drunkardes and gluttons altogether without power of them selues, and the more they drynke, the dryer they waxe, one banquet prouoketh an other, they stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to fyll their greedy stomackes. Therefore it is commonly sayde, <hi>A drunken man is alwayes dry,</hi> and, <hi>A gluttons gutte is neuer filled.</hi> Unsatiable truely are the affections &amp; lustes of mans heart, and therfore we must learne to bridle them with the feare of God, so that we yeelde not to our owne lustes, lest we kyndle Gods indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst our selues, when we seeke to satisfie our beastly appetite. Saint Paul teacheth vs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we eate or drynke, or whatsoeuer we do, to do all to the glory of God. Where he appoynteth as it were by a measure, how muche a man may <note place="margin">1. Cor. x.</note> eate and drynke: that is to wit, so much that the mynde be not made sluggishe by cromming in meate, and powring in drynke, so that it can not lyfte vp it selfe to the glory and prayse of God. Whatsoeuer he be then, that by eating &amp; drinking makes him selfe vnlusty to serue God, let him not thinke to escape vnpunished.</p>
            <p>Ye haue hearde how muche almyghtie God detesteth the abuse of his creatures, as he hym selfe declareth, aswell by his holy worde, as also by the fearefull examples of his iust iudgement.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:6498:104"/>
Nowe if neyther the worde of God can restrayne our ragyng lustes and greedy appetites, neyther the manyfest examples of Gods vengeaunce, feare vs from riotous, and excessiue eatyng and drynking, let vs yet consider the manyfolde mischeefes that proceedeth thereof, so shall we know the tree by the fruites. It hurteth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it infecteth the mind, it wasteth the substance, and is noyfull to the neyghbours. But who is able to expresse the manifold dangers and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neniences that folow of intemperate diet? Ofte commeth sodayne death by banquettyng, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme the members are dissolued, &amp; so the whole body is brought into a miserable state. He that eateth and drynketh vnmeasurably, kyndeleth ofte tymes suche an vnnaturall heate in his bodye, that his appetite is prouoked thereby to desire more then it should, or els it ouercommeth his stomacke, and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But what shoulde I neede to say any more in this behalfe? For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God blesse our meates, &amp; geue them strength to feede vs: agayne except GOD geue strength to nature to digest, so that we may take profite by them, eyther shall we filthily vomite them vp agayne, or els shall they lye stinking in our bodyes, as in a lothesome sinke or chanell, and so diuersly infecte the whole body. And surely the blessyng of God is so farre from suche as vse
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:6498:104"/>
riotous banquetting, that in their faces be some tymes seene the expresse tokens of this intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauncie: As Salomon noteth in his prouerbes.

Marke I beseche you the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tokens of Gods indignation: wo and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, stryfe and brawling, woundes without cause, disfigured face, and rednesse of eyes are to be looked for, when men set them selues to excesse and gurmaundise, deuising all meanes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their greedy appetites by tempering the wine, and sawcing it in suche sort, that it may be more delectable and pleasaunt vnto them. It were expediente, that suche delicate persons should be ruled by Salomon, who in considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aforesaid inconueniences, forbiddeth the very sight of wine. Looke not vppon the wyne (saith he) when it is red, &amp; when he sheweth his colour in the cuppe, or goeth downe pleasauntly: for in the ende thereof it will bite lyke a serpent, and hurte lyke a cockatrice. Thyne eyes shall looke vpon strange women, and thine heart shal speake lewde thynges, and thou shalt be as one that sleepeth in the middes of the sea, and as he that sleepeth in the toppe of the mast.

And surely he hath lost his senses, that can not feele when he is stricken, that knoweth not when he is beaten. So, surfetting and drunkennesse bites by the belly, and causeth continual gnawing in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, bringes men to whoredome and lewde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, with daungers vnspeakable: so that men are bereeued and robbed of their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and are altogether without power of them selues. Who seeth not nowe the miserable estate where into men are brought, by these foule fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie monsters, gluttony, and drunkenes.

Wherefore, that sobrietie also in this excesse may be espyed among vs, I shall declare vnto you, both the moderate vse of apparell, approued by God in his holye worde, and also the abuses thereof, which he forbiddeth and disaloweth, as it may appeare by the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences whiche daylye encrease by the iuste

iudgement of God, where that measure is not kept, which he himselfe hath appoynted. If we consider the end &amp; purpose wherunto almightie God hath ordeyned his creatures, we shal easyly perceaue, that he aloweth vs apparel, not onely for necessities sake, but also for an honest come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. Euen as in hearbes trees, and sundrye fruites, we haue not only, diuers necessary vses, but also the pleasaunt syght and sweete smell, to delyght vs withall, wherein we may behold the singuler loue of God towardes mankynde, in that he hath prouided both to relieue our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; also to refreshe our senses with an honest &amp; moderate recreation. Therefore Dauid in the Ciiii. Psalme, confessing Gods carefull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <note place="margin">Psal. 104.</note> sheweth that God not onelye prouideth thinges necessary for men, as hearbes and other meates, but also suche thinges as maye reioyce and comfort, as wyne to make glad the heart, oyles and oyntmentes to make the face to shine. So that they are altogether past the limittes of humanitie, which yelding onely to necessitie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the lawfull fruition of Gods benefites. With whose traditions we may not be led, if we geue eare to saint Paule, who writing to the Collossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, willeth them not to harken vnto such men <note place="margin">Colloss. 2.</note> as shall saye, touche not, taste not, handle not, superstitiouslye bereeuing them of the fruition of Gods creatures. And no lesse truelye ought we to beware, least vnder pretence of Christian libertie, we take lycence to do what we liste, aduauncing our selues in sumptuous apparell, and despysing other, preparing our selues in

fyne brauerie, to wanton, lewde, and vnchaste behauiour. To the auoyding whereof, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <note place="margin">4.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> appoynted. The first is, that we make not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision for the flesh, to accomplish the lustes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with costlye apparell, as that harlot did, of <note place="margin">Prou. 7.</note> whom Salomon speaketh, Prouerbes the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vii. which perfumed her bed, and deckt it with costly ornamentes of Egipt, to the fulfilling of her lewde lust: but rather ought we by moderate temperaunce to cut of al occasions, whereby the fleshe might get the victorie. The second is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">2 1. Cor. 7.</note> by saint Paul, in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vii. Chapter of his first Epistle to the Corinthes, where he teacheth vs to vse this worlde, as though we vsed it not. Whereby he cutteth away, not only al ambition, pryde, and vayne pompe in apparel: but also all inordinate care &amp; affection, which withdraweth vs from the contemplation of heauenly thinges, and consideration of our duetie towardes God. They that are muche occupyed in caryng for thynges parteyning to the bodye, are moste commonlye negligent and carelesse in matters concerning the soule. Therefore our Sauiour <note place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> Christe willeth vs not to take thought what we shall eate, or what we shall drynke, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we shall be clothed, but rather to seeke the kingdome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ryghteousnesse thereof. Whereby we maye learne to beware, least we vse those thynges to our hinderaunce,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:6498:109"/>
whiche God hath ordayned for our comfort and furtheraunce toward his Kingdome. The third is, that we take in good part our estate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and content our selues with that whiche <note place="margin">3.</note> God sendeth, whether it be muche or little. He that is ashamed of base and simple attyre, wil be proude of gorgeous apparell, if he maye get it. We must learne therefore of the Apostle S. Paul <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> both to vse plentye, and also to suffer penurye, remembring that we must yeelde accomptes of those thinges whiche we haue receaued, vnto him who abhorreth al excesse, pride, ostentation, and vanitie, who also vtterly condempneth and disaloweth whatsoeuer draweth vs from our dutie towardes God, or diminishe our charitie towardes our neighbours and brethren, whom we ought to loue as our selues. The fourth and <note place="margin">4.</note> last rule is, that euery man beholde and consider his owne vocation, in as much as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted euery man his degree and office, within the limittes whereof it behoueth him to keepe him selfe. Therefore all may not looke to weare lyke apparel, but euery one according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as God hath placed him. Which, if it were obserued, manye one doutlesse shoulde be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to weare a russet coate, which nowe ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feleth in silkes and veluettes, spending more by the yere in sumptuous apparel, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their fathers receaued for the whole reuenue of their landes.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:6498:109"/>
on worldly brauerye, abusing Gods goodnesse, when he sendeth plentie, to satisfie their wanton lustes, hauing no regarde to the degree wherin God hath placed them. The Israelites were contented with such apparel as God gaue them, <note place="margin">Deut. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to vse afterwarde. But we are neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and therfore we prosper not, so that most commonly he that ruffleth in his Sables, in his fine furred gowne, corked slippers, trimme bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and warme mittons, is more redy to chill for colde, then the poore labouring man, which can abyde in the fielde all the day long, when the north wynde blowes, with a fewe beggerlye cloutes about him. We are loth to weare suche as our fathers haue left vs, we thinke not that sufficient or good enough for vs. We must haue one gowne for the day, another for the night, one long, another short, one for wynter, another for sommer, one through furred, another but faced, one for the workyng daye, another for the holye day, one of this colour, another of that colour, one of cloth, another of sylke or Damaske. We must haue chaunge of apparel, one afore dinner, another after, one of the Spanishe fassion, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Turkie, and to be briefe, neuer content with sufficient. Our sauiour Christ bad his Disciples <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> they should not haue two coates: but the moste men, farre vnlyke to his scollers, haue their presses so full of apparell, that manye knoweth
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:6498:110"/>
not how many sortes they haue. Whiche thyng caused Saint James to pronounce this terrible <note place="margin">Iacob. 5.</note> curse agaynst such welthy worldlynges. Go to ye riche men, weepe and houle in your wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that shall come vppon you, your ryches are corrupt, and your garmentes are moth eaten, ye haue lyued in pleasure on the earth, and in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, ye haue nourished your heartes, as in the day of slaughter. Marke I besech you, saint James calleth them miserable, notwithstanding their riches and plentie of apparell, forasmuche as they pamper their bodies, to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. What was the ryche glutton the better for his syne fare and costly apparell? Did not he nourishe him selfe to be tormented in hell <note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> fyre? Let vs learne therefore to content our selues, hauing foode and raiment, as saint Paul <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> teacheth, least desyring to be enryched with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundaunce, we fall into temptations, snares, and many noysome lustes, whiche drowne men in perdition and destruction. Certaynlye, suche as delyght in gorgeous apparel, are commonlye puffed vp with pryde, and filled with dyuers vanities. So were the daughters of Sion &amp; people of Hierusalem, whom Esai the Prophete <note place="margin">Esaias. 3.</note> threatneth, because they walked with stretched out neckes and wandring eyes, mincing as they went, and nicely treading with their feete, that almightie God shoulde make their heades balde, and discouer their secrete shame. In that daye, sayth he, shall the Lord take away the ornament of the slippers, and the caules, and the rounde attires, and the sweete balles, and the bracelets,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6498:110"/>
and the attires of the head, and the sloppes, and the headbandes, and the tablettes, and the eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynges, the ringes, and the mustlers, the costlye apparel, and the vayles, and wymples, and the crisping pinne, and the glasses, &amp; the fine linnen, and the hoodes, &amp; the lawnes. So that almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty god would not suffer his benefites to be vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; wantonly abused, no not of that people who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he most tenderly loued, and had chosen to him selfe before all other. No lesse truely is the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is vsed amongst vs in these dayes. For the proude &amp; hautie stomackes of the daughters of Englande, are so mainteyned with diuers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised sortes of costlye apparell, that as <hi>Tertuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Apollog. con. gen. tes. cap. 6.</note> an auncient father sayth, there is lefte no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in apparell betweene an honest matrone and a common strumpet. Yea manye men are become so effeminate, that they care not what they spende in disguysing them selues, euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syring newe toyes, and inuenting new fassions. Therefore a certayne man that woulde picture euery countrey man in his accustomed apparell, when he had paynted other nations, he pictured the English man all naked, and gaue him cloth vnder his arme, and bad him make it him selfe as he thought best, for he chaunged his fassion so often, that he knewe not how to make it. Thus with our phantasticall deuises, we make our selues laughing stockes to other nations, while one spendeth his patrimonie vppon pounces and cuttes, another bestoweth more on a daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng shyrt, then myght suffyce to buy him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and comelye apparell for his whole bodye.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6498:111"/>
Some hang their reuenues about their neckes, ruffling in their ruffes, &amp; many a one ieopardeth his best ioynt, to maynteyne him selfe in sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous rayment. And euery man, nothing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his estate and condition, seeketh to excell other in costely attyre. Whereby it commeth to passe, that in aboundaunce and plenty of al thin <note place="margin">The cause of dearth.</note> ges, we yet complayne of want and penurye, whyle one man spendeth that whiche myght serue a multitude, and no man distributeth of the aboundaunce whiche he hath receaued, and all men excessiuely waste that which should serue to supplye the necessities of other. There hath ben very good prouision made agaynst such abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, by dyuers good and wholsom lawes, which if they were practised as they ought to be of all true subiectes, they myght in some part serue to diminishe this ragyng and ryotous excesse in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. But alas, there appeareth amongst vs litle feare and obedience eyther of God, or man. Therefore must we needes loke for Gods fearful <note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> vengeaunce from heauen, to ouerthrowe our presumption and pryde, as he ouerthrewe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode, who in his royall apparell, forgetting God, was smitten of an Angell, and eaten vp of wormes. By whiche terrible example, God hath taught vs that we are but wormes meate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we pamper ourselues neuer so muche in gorgeous apparell.</p>
            <p>Here we may learne that which Jesus the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of <hi>Syrache</hi> teacheth, not to be proude of clothing <note place="margin">Eccle. 11.</note> and rayment, neyther to exalte our selues in the day of honour, because the workes of the Lorde

are wonderfull, and glorious, secrete, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, teaching vs with humblenesse of mynde, euery one to be myndeful of the vocation whereunto God hath called him. Let Christians therefore endeuour them selues to quenche the care of pleasing the fleshe, let vs vse the benefites of God in this worlde, in such wise, that we be not to much occupied in prouiding for the bodye. Let vs content our selues quyetlye with that which God sendeth, be it neuer so litle. And if it please him to sende plentye, let vs not waxe proude thereof, but let vs vse it moderatly, aswel to our owne comfort, as to the reliefe of such as stande in necessitie. He that in aboundaunce and plentye of apparell, hydeth his face from him that is naked, despyseth his owne fleshe, as Esai <note place="margin">Esai. 58.</note> the Prophete sayeth. Let vs learne to know our selues, and not to despyse other, let vs remember that we stand all before the maiestie of almygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, who shall iudge vs by his holy worde, wherein he forbiddeth excesse, not onely to men, but also to women. So that none can excuse them selues, of what estate or condition so euer they be. Let vs therfore present our selues before his throne as <hi>Tertulian</hi> exhorteth, with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes whiche the Apostle speaketh of, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians the. vi.

attyred sayth <hi>Tertulian.</hi> The wyfe of one <hi>Philo</hi> an heathen Philosopher, beyng demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded why she ware no golde? she aunswered, that she thought her husbandes vertues sufficient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes. Howe muche more ought Christian women, instructed by the word of God, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent them selues in their husbandes? Yea, how much more ought euery Christian to content him selfe in our sauiour Christe, thinkyng him selfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlye garnished with his heauenlye vertues? But it wil be here obiected and said of some nyce and vaine women, that al which we do in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng our faces, in dying our heere, in embaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our bodyes, in decking vs with gay appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, is to please our husbandes, to delyght his eyes, and to retayne his loue towardes vs. O vayne excuse, and most shameful aunswere, to the reproche of thy husband. What couldest thou more say to set out his foolishnes, then to charge him to be pleased and delyghted with the deuyls tyre? Who can paint her face and curle her heere, and chaunge it into an vnnaturall colour, but therein doth worke reprofe to her maker, who made her? As though she coulde make her selfe more comely then God hath appointed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of her beawtie. What do these women, but go about to refourme that whiche God hath made? not knowing that all thinges naturall is the worke of God, and thinges disguysed and vnnaturall be the workes of the deuill. And as though a wyse and Christian husbande shoulde delyght to see his wife in such painted &amp; florished visions, which common harlottes mostly do vse,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6498:112"/>
to traine therwith their louers to naughtinesse, or as though an honest woman could delight to be lyke an harlot for pleasing of her husbande. Nay, nay, these be but vayne excuses of suche as go about to please rather others, then their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes. And such attyres be but to prouoke her to shewe her selfe abroade, to entyce others a worthy matter. She must kepe debate with her husbande to maynteyne such apparel, whereby she is the worse huswyfe, the seldomer at home to see to her charge, and so to neglect his thrift, by geuing great prouocation to her housholde to waste and wantonnes, whyle she must wander abroade to shew her owne vanitie, and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes foolishnesse. By whiche her pryde, she styrreth vp muche enuye of others whiche be so vaynly delighted as she is. She doth but deserue mockes &amp; scornes, to set out all her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation in Jewish &amp; Ethnick apparel, and yet bragge of her Christianitie. She doth but waste super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouslye her husbandes stocke by suche sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and sometymes is the cause of muche bryberie, extortion, and deceipt in her husbands occupying, that she may be the more gorgeouslye set out to the sight of the vaine worlde, to please the deuils eyes, &amp; not gods, who geueth to euery creature sufficient &amp; moderate comlynes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we should be contented if we were of God. What other thing doest thou by those meanes, but prouokest other to tempt thee, to deceaue thy soule, by the bayte of thy pompe and pryde? What els doest thou, but settest out thy pryde, and makest of thy vndecente apparell of thy
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:6498:113"/>
body, the deuils net, to catche the soules of them whiche beholde thee? O thou woman, not a Christian, but worse then a Painim, thou mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the deuill: Why pamperest thou that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren fleshe so hye, whiche sometime doth stinke and rot on the earth as thou goest? Howsoeuer thou perfumest thy selfe, yet cannot thy beastly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be hidden or ouercome with thy smelles &amp; sauours, whiche do rather defourme &amp; mishape thee, then beawtifie thee. What meant Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to say, of such trimming of vaine women, when he sayd, A fayre woman without good manners and conditions, is lyke a Sowe whiche hath a ryng of golde vpon her snout: but that the more thou garnishe thy selfe with these outwarde bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes, the lesse thou carest for the in warde gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of thy mynde, and so doest but defoule thy selfe by such aray, and not beawtify thy selfe? Heare, heare, what Christes holye Apostles do write, Let not the outward apparell of women (sayth saint Peter) be decked with the broiding of heere, with wrapping on of golde, or goodlye clothing: but let the mynde, and the conscience, whiche is not seene with the eyes, be pure and cleane, that is, sayth he, an acceptable and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing before God. For so the old auncient holy women attyred themselues, and were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their husbandes. And saint Paule sayth, that women shoulde apparell them selues with shame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>astnesse &amp; sobernes, and not with braydes of their heere, or golde, or pearle, or precious clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, but as women shoulde do whiche will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse godlinesse by their good outward workes.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:6498:113"/>
Jf ye wyll not kepe the Apostles preceptes, at the least let vs heare what pagans, whiche were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of Christe, haue sayde in this matter. <hi>Democrates</hi> sayth, The ornament of a woman, standeth in scarsitie of speache &amp; apparel. <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> sayth of such apparel thus, It is not an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, O thou foole, but a shame and a many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest shewe of thy folly. <hi>Socrates</hi> sayth, that that is a garnishyng to a woman, whiche declareth out her honestie. The <hi>Grecians</hi> vse it in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe: It is not golde or pearle whiche is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to a woman, but good conditions.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Aristotle</hi> byddeth that a woman shoulde vse lesse apparell then the lawe doth suffer. For it is not the goodlynesse of apparel, nor the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of beautie, nor the aboundaunce of golde, that maketh a woman to be esteemed, but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and diligence to liue honestly in althynges. This outragious vanitie is nowe growne so farre, that there is no shame taken of it. We reade in histories, that when king <hi>Dionisius</hi> sent to the women of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> riche robes, they aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; saide, that they shall do vs more shame then honour: and therefore refused them. The women in Rome in olde tyme abhorred that gaye appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell whiche kyng <hi>Pirrus</hi> sent to them, and none were so greedy and vaine to accept them. And a law was openly made of the senate, and along time obserued, that no woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should weare ouer halfe anounce of golde, nor should weare clothes of diuers colours. But perchaunce some dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dame wyll say and aunswere me, that they muste do somthyng to shewe their byrth and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:6498:114"/>
blood, to shewe their husbandes riches. As though nobilitie were cheefely seene by these thynges, whiche be common to those whiche be most vile, as though thy husbandes riches were not better bestowed then in such superfluities, as though when thou were christened, thou diddest not renounce the pryde of this worlde, and the pompe of the flesh. I speake not agaynst conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent apparel for euery state agreeable: but against the superfluitie, agaynst the vayne delyght to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet such vanities, to deuise new fashions to feede thy pryde with, to spende so muche vpon thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasse, that thou and thy husbande are compelled to robbe the poore, to mainteyne thy costlynesse. Heare how that noble holy woman Queene <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> setteth out these goodly ornamentes (as they be called? when (in respecte of sauing Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) she was compelled to put on suche glorious apparell, knowing that it was a fit stale to blind the eyes of carnal fooles. Thus she prayed. Thou knowest, O Lorde, the necessitie which I am dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to, to put on this apparell, and that I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre this signe of pride, and of this glory which I beare on my head, &amp; that I defie it as a filthie cloth, and that I weare it not when I am alone. Agayne by what meanes was <hi>Holophernes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, but by the glitteryng shewe of apparell, whiche that holy woman <hi>Iudith</hi> did put on her, not as delighting in them, nor seekyng vaine vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous pleasure by them: but she ware it of pure necessitie by Gods dispensation, vsyng this vanitie to ouercome the vayne eyes of Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Suche desyre was in those noble women,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:6498:114"/>
beyng very loth and vnwylling otherwyse to weare suche sumptuous apparell, by the whiche others shoulde be caused to forgette them selues. These be commended in Scripture for abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring suche vanities, whiche by constraynt and great necessitie agaynst their heartes desyred were compelled to weare them for a tyme. And shall suche women be worthy commendations, whiche neyther be comparable with these wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aforesayde in nobilitie, nor comparable to them in their good zeales to God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whose daily delight and seeking is to flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe in suche gaye shiftes and chaunges, neuer satisfied, nor regardyng who smarteth for their apparel, so they may come by it? O vayne men, whiche be subiectes to their wyues in these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affections. O vayne women to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure so muche hurt to them selues, by the whiche they come the sooner to miserie in this worlde, and in the meane tyme be abhorred of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and scorned of wyse men, and in the ende, lyke to be ioyned with suche, who in hell to late repenting them selues, shall openly complayne with these wordes: What hath our pryde profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs? or what profite hath the pompe of ryches brought vs? All those thynges are passed away lyke a shadowe: As for vertue we dyd neuer shewe any signe thereof: And thus we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed in our wickednesse. If thou sayest that the custome is to be folowed, &amp; the vse of the worlde doth compell thee to suche curiositie, then I aske of thee, whose custome shoulde be folowed? wyse folkes maners, or fooles? If thou sayest the wyse:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:6498:115"/>
then I say folowe them: For fooles customes, who shoulde folow but fooles? Consider that the consent of wyse men, ought to be alleaged for a custome. Nowe if any lewde custome be vsed, be thou the firste to breake it, labour to diminishe it and lay it downe: and more laude afore God, and more commendation shalt thou win by it, then by all the glory of such superfluitie.</p>
            <p>Thus ye haue hearde declared vnto you, what God requireth by his worde concernyng the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate vse of his creatures. Let vs learne to vse them moderatly as he hath appoynted. Almygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God hath taught vs, to what end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we shoulde vse our apparell: Let vs therfore learne so to behaue our selues in the vse thereof, as becommeth Christians, alwaies she wing our selues thankfull to our heauenly father for his great and mercyfull benefites, who geueth vnto vs our daily bread, that is to say, al thyngs neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for this our needie life, vnto whom we shall render accomptes for all his benefites, at the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing of our sauiour Christe, to whom with the father, &amp; the holy ghost, be all honour, prayse, and glory, for euer and euer.</p>

For as the Apostle <note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> James saith, Euery good &amp; perfect gift commeth from aboue, and proceedeth from the father of lyghtes, who is also said to be rich and liberal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes all them that cal vpon hym, not because <note place="margin">Rom. x.</note> he eyther wyll not or can not geue without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, but because he hath appoynted prayer as an ordinarie meanes betweene hym &amp; vs. There is no doubt but he alwayes knoweth what we <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> haue neede of, and is alwayes most redy to geue aboundaunce of those thynges that we lacke. Yet to the intent we myght acknowledge hym to be the geuer of all good thynges, and behaue our selues thankfully towardes hym in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, louyng, fearyng, and worshippyng hym sincerely and truely, as we ought to do, he hath profitably and wysely ordeyned, that in tyme of necessitie we shoulde humble our selues in his sight, powre out the secretes of our heart before hym, and craue helpe at his handes, with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall,

Lykewyse in the Gospel by the mouth of his welbeloued sonne Christe, <note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> he sayth: Aske, and it shalbe geuen you, knocke, and it shalbe opened: for whosoeuer asketh, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, whosoeuer seeketh, findeth, and to him that knocketh, it shalbe opened.

Neyther doth the blessed Apostle saint James in this poynt any thing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but earnestly exhorting all men to diligent prayer, sayth: If any man lacke wysedome, let him aske it of God, which geueth liberally to all men, and reprocheth no man. Also in an other <note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> place, Pray one for another (saith he) that ye may be healed: For the ryghteous mans prayer auayleth muche, if it be feruent.

Therefore most fond and foolishe is the opinion and reason of those men, which therfore thynke all prayer to be superfluous and vayne, because God searcheth the heart and the raynes, and knoweth the meanyng of the spirite before we aske.

Nowe then, dearely beloued, seeing prayer is so needeful a thyng, and of so great strength before God, let vs, accordyng as we are taught by the example of Christe and his apostles, be earnest and diligent in calling on the name of the Lord. Let vs neuer faynt, neuer slacke, neuer geue ouer, but let vs daily and hourely, early and late, in season, and out of season, be occupyed in godly meditations and prayers. What if we obtayne not our petitions at the firste? yet let vs not be discoraged, but let vs continually crye and call vpon God: He wyll surely heare vs at length, if for no other cause, yet for very importunities sake. Remember the parable of the vnryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudge, and the poore wydowe, how she by <note place="margin">Luk. 17.</note>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:6498:118"/>
her importunate meanes caused hym to do her iustice agaynst her aduersarie, although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse he feared neyther God nor man. Shall not God muche more auenge his elect (sayth our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christe) whiche crye vnto hym day and nyght? Thus he taught his disciples, &amp; in them all other true Christian men, to pray alwayes, and neuer to faint or shrinke. Remember also the <note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> example of the woman of Canaan, how she was reiected of Christe, and called dogge, as one moste vnworthie of any benefite at his handes: yet she gaue not ouer, but folowed hym still, crying and callyng vppon hym to be good and mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her daughter. And at length by very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, she obtayned her request. O let vs learne by these examples, to be earnest and feruent in prayer, assuryng our selues that whatsoeuer we aske of God the father in the name of his sonne Christe, and accordyng to his wyll, he wyll vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly graunt it. He is trueth it selfe and as truely as he hath promised it, so truely wyll he <note place="margin">Iohn. 16</note> perfourme it. God for his great mercies sake so worke in our heartes by his holy spirite, that we may alwayes make our humble prayers vnto hym as we ought to do, and alwayes obtayne the thyng which we aske, through Jesus Christe our Lorde, to whom with the father and the holy ghost, be al honour and glory, worlde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ende.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firste parte of this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ye hearde the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, &amp; also the great force of deuout and earnest praier declared &amp; proued vnto you, both by diuers waightie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, and also by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry good examples of holy scripture. Now shal you learne whom you ought to call vppon, and to whom ye ought alwayes to direct your prayers. We are euidently taught in Gods holy Testament, that almightie God is the only fountayne and welspring of al goodnes, and that whatsoeuer we haue in this world, we receaue it only at his handes. To this effecte ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the place of S. James: Euery good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> gift, sayth he, commeth from aboue, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the father of lyghtes. To this effect also serueth the testimonie of Paul, in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Epistles, witnessing that the spirite of wisedome, the spirite of knowledge and reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea euery good and heauenly gyfte, as fayth, hope, charitie, grace, and peace, commeth onely and solely of God. In consideration whereof, he bursteth out into a sodayne passion, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: O man, what thyng hast thou, whiche thou <note place="margin">i. Cor. 4.</note> hast not receaued? Therefore whensoeuer we neede or lacke any thyng, parteyning eyther to the body, or to the soule, it behoueth vs to runne onely vnto GOD, who is the onely geuer
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:6498:119"/>
of all good thynges. Our sauiour Christe in the Gospell, teachyng his disciples how they shoulde pray, sendeth them to the father in his name, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Uerily, verily, I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye aske the father in my name, he wyll geue it vnto you. And in an other place, when ye pray, pray after this sorte: Our father whiche art in <note place="margin">Iohn. 19. Mat. 6. Luk. 11.</note> heauen. &amp;c. And doth not God hym selfe, by the mouth of his Prophete Dauid, wyll and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde vs to call vpon hym? The Apostle wysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth grace and peace to all them that call on the <note place="margin">Psalm. 50.</note> name of our Lord, and of his sonne Jesus Christ, as doth also the Prophet Joel, saying: And it shall come to passe, that whosoeuer shall call on <note place="margin">Ioel. 2. Actes. 1.</note> the name of the Lorde, shalbe saued.</p>
               <p>Thus then it is playne by the infallible worde of trueth and lyfe, that in all our necessities we must flee vnto God, direct our prayers vnto hym, call vppon his holy name, desyre helpe at his handes, and at no others. Whereof if ye wyll yet haue a further reason, marke that whiche folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. There are certayne conditions most requisit to be founde in euery suche a one that muste be called vppon, whiche if they be not founde in hym vnto whom we pray, then doth our prayer auayle vs nothyng, but is altogether in vayne.</p>
               <p>The first is this, that he to whom we make our prayers, be able to helpe vs. The second is, that he wyll helpe vs. The thirde is, that he be suche a one as may heare our prayers. The fourth is, that he vnderstand better then we our selues what we lacke, and howe farre we haue
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:6498:119"/>
neede of helpe. If these thynges be to be founde in any other sauing onely God, then may we lawfully call vpon some other besides God. But what man is so grosse, but he wel vnderstandeth that these thynges are only proper to him which is omnipotent, and knoweth al thyngs, euen the very secretes of the heart, that is to say, only and to God alone, whereof it foloweth, that we must call neyther vpon angell, nor yet vpon saint, but only and soly vpon God, as S. Paul doth write: Now shall men call vppon hym in whom they haue not beleued? So that inuocation or prayer, may not be made without faith in hym on <note place="margin">Rom. x.</note> whom they call, but that we must first beleeue in hym, before we can make our prayers vnto hym, whereuppon we must only and solely pray vnto God. For to say that we shoulde beleeue eyther in angell or saint, or in any other liuing creature, were more horrible blasphemie against God and his holy worde, neither ought this fancie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the heart of any Christian man, because we are expressly taught in the worde of the Lorde only to repose our fayth in the blessed trinitie, in whose only name we are also baptized, according to the expresse commaundement of our sauiour Jesus Christe, in the last of Matthewe. <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But that the trueth hereof may the better appeare, euen to them that be moste simple and <note place="margin">Despi. &amp; lit. cap. 50.</note> vnlearned, let vs consider what prayer is. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth it a liftyng vp of the mynde to God, that is to say, an humble and lowly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">De som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo bono ca. 8. li. 3.</note> out of the heart to God. <hi>Isidorus</hi> sayth, that it is an affection of the heart, and not ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:6498:120"/>
of the lippes. So that by these places, true prayer doth consist not so muche in the outward sounde and voyce of wordes, as in the inwarde gronyng, and crying of the heart to God.</p>
               <p>Nowe then, is there any angell, any virgin, any patriarche or prophete among the dead, that can vnderstand, or knowe the meanyng of <note place="margin">Psalm. 7. Apoca. 2. Iere. 7. 2. Par. 6.</note> the heart? The scriptures sayth, it is God that searcheth the heart and raynes, and that he only knoweth the heartes of the chyldren of men. As for the saintes, they haue so litle knowledge of the secretes of the heart, that many of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers greatly doubt, whether they knowe any thing at al, that is commonly done on earth. And albeit some thynke they do, yet saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra pro mort. age<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> da. cap 13</note> a Doctour of great aucthoritie, and also an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, hath this opinion of them: that they knowe no more what we do on earth, then we know what they do in heauen. For proofe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he alleageth the wordes of Esai the prophete, where it is sayde, Abraham is ignoraunt of vs, <note place="margin">De vera reli. ca. 55.</note> and Israel knoweth vs not. His mynde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this, not that we shoulde put any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in worshyppyng them, or praying vnto them: but that we shoulde honour them by folowyng their vertuous and godly lyfe. For as he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth <note place="margin">Lib. 22. de ciuit. dei. ca. 10.</note> in an other place, the martyrs and holy men in tymes past, were wont after their death, to be remembred, and named of the prieste at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine seruice: but neuer to be inuocated or called vpon. And why so? because the prieste (sayth he) is Gods priest, and not theirs: Whereby he is bounde to call vpon God, and not vpon them.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:6498:120"/>
Thus you see, that the aucthoritie both of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and also of <hi>Augustine,</hi> doth not permit, that we should pray vnto them. O that al men would studiously reade, and searche the scriptures, then <note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> shoulde they not be drowned in ignoraunce, but shoulde easily perceaue the trueth, aswell of this poynt of doctrine, as of all the rest. For there doth the holy ghost playnely teache vs, that Christe is our only mediatour and intercessour with God, and that we muste seeke and runne to no other. If any man sinneth saith saint John, we haue <note place="margin">i. Iohn. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> an aduocate with the father, Jesus Christe the ryghteous, and he is the propitiation for our <note place="margin">i. Tim. 2.</note> sinnes. Saint Paul also sayth, There is one God, and one mediatour betweene God and man, euen the man Jesus Christe. Whereunto agreeth the testimonie of our sauiour hym selfe, <note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> witnessing that no man commeth to the father, <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> but onely by hym, who is the way, the trueth, the life, yea and the only dore whereby we muste <note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> enter into the kingdome of heauen, because GOD is pleased in no other but in hym. For <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> whiche cause also he cryeth, and calleth vnto vs, that we shoulde come vnto hym, saying: Come <note place="margin">Mat. 11</note> vnto me all ye that labour and be heauie laden, and I shall refreshe you. Woulde Christe haue vs so necessarily come vnto hym? and shall we moste vnthankfully leaue hym, and runne vnto other? This is euen that whiche God so greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth of by his prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> saying, My people haue committed two great offences, they haue forsaken me the fountaine of the waters of lyfe, and haue digged to them selues broken pits
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:6498:121"/>
that can holde no water. Is not that man thinke you vnwyse, that wyll runne for water to a litle brooke, when he may aswell go to the head spryng? Euen so may his wisedome be iustly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, that wyll flee vnto saintes in tyme of necessitie, when he may boldly and without feare declare his greefe and direct his prayer vnto the Lorde himselfe. If God were straunge, or daungerous to be talked withall, then myght we iustly drawe backe and seeke to some other. But the Lorde is nygh vnto them that call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym in fayth and trueth, and the prayer of <note place="margin">Pal. 144.</note> the humble and meeke hath alwayes pleased hym. What if we be sinners, shall we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Iudith. 9.</note> pray vnto God? or shall we dispayre to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne any thyng at his handes? Why dyd Christe then teache vs to aske forgeuenesse of our sinnes? saying: And forgeue vs our trespasses, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue them that trespasse agaynst vs. Shall we thynke that the saintes are more mercifull in hearing sinners, then God? Dauid sayth, that the Lorde is full of compassion and mercy, slowe to anger, and of great kyndnesse. Saint Paul <note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> sayth, that he is riche in mercy towardes all them that call vppon hym. And he hymselfe by <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> the mouth of his prophet Esai sayth: For a litle while haue I forsaken thee, but with great compassion wyll I gather thee: For a moment <note place="margin">Esai. 52.</note> in myne anger, I haue hid my face from thee, but with euerlastyng mercy haue I had compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vpon thee. Therefore the sinnes of any man ought not to withholde hym from praying vnto the Lorde his God. But if he be truely penitent
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:6498:121"/>
and stedfast in fayth, let him assure him selfe that the Lorde wylbe mercifull vnto hym, and heare his prayers. O but I dare not (wyll some man say) trouble God at all times with my prayers: We see that in kinges houses &amp; courtes of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, men can not be admitted, vnlesse they fyrst vse the helpe and meane of some speciall noble man, to come vnto the speache of the kyng, and to obtayne the thing that they woulde haue. To this reason doth saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> aunswere verye <note place="margin">Ambro. sup. cap. 1, Rom.</note> well, writing vppon the first Chapter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. Therefore (sayth he) we vse to go vnto the king by officers and noble men, because the kyng is a mortall man, and knoweth not to whom he maye commit the gouernment of the common wealth. But to haue God our frende, from whom nothing is hid, we nede not any hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that should further vs with his good worde, but only a deuoute and godlye minde. And yf it be so, that we neede one to entreate for vs: why <note place="margin">Hebre. 7.</note> maye we not content our selues with that one mediatour, whiche is at the ryght hande of God the father, and there liueth for euer to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for vs? As the blood of Christe dyd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs on the crosse, and cleanse vs from our sinnes: euen so it is nowe able to saue all them that come vnto God by it. For Christe sitting in heauen, hath an euerlasting priesthoode, and alwayes prayeth to his father for them that be penitent, obtayning by vertue of his woundes, whiche are euermore in the sight of God, not only perfect remission of our sinnes, but also all other necessaries that we lacke in this worlde, so
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6498:122"/>
that his only mediatour is sufficient in heauen, and nedeth no others to helpe him. Why then do <note place="margin">Matth. 6. Iacob. 5. Coloss. 4. 1. Tim. 2.</note> we pray one for another in this lyfe, some man perchaunce wyll here demaunde? Forsoothe we are wylled so to do, by the expresse commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Christe and his disciples, to declare therein aswell the fayth that we haue in Christe towardes God, as also the mutuall charitie that we beare one towardes another, in that we pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie our brothers case, and make our humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to God for him. But that we shoulde pray vnto Saintes, neyther haue we any commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in all the Scripture, nor yet example whiche we maye safely folowe. So that beyng done without aucthoritie of Gods worde, it lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the grounde of fayth, and therefore can not be acceptable before GOD. For whatsoeuer is not of fayth, is sinne. And the Apostle sayth, <note place="margin">Heb. 11. Rom. 14. Rom. 10.</note> that fayth commeth by hearing, and hearing by the worde of God. Yet thou wylt obiect further, that the saintes in heauen do praye for vs, and that their prayer proceedeth of an earnest cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that they haue towardes their brethren on earth. Where to it may be well aunswered. First, that no man knoweth whether they do pray for vs or no. And yf any wyll go about to prooue it by the nature of charitie, concludyng, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they dyd praye for men on earth, therefore they do muche more the same nowe in heauen: Then may it be sayde by the same reason, that as oft as we do weepe on earth, they do also weepe in heauen, because whyle they liued, in this worlde, it is moste certayne and sure they dyd so.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:6498:122"/>
And for that place whiche is written in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips, namely that the angell dyd offer vp the prayers of the saintes vpon the golden aulter: it is properly meant, and ought properly to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode of those saintes that are yet liuing on earth, and not of them that are dead, otherwyse what neede were it, that the angell shoulde offer vp their prayers, beyng nowe in heauen before the face of aimightie god? But admit the saintes do pray for vs, yet do we not knowe howe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther specially for them whiche call vppon them, or els generally for all men, wishing well to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye man a like. If they pray speciallye for them whiche call vpon them, then it is like they heare our prayers, and also knowe our heartes desyre. Which thing to be false, it is alredy proued both by the scriptures, and also by the aucthoritie of Augustine. Let vs not therefore put our trust or confidence in the saintes or martyrs that be dead. Let vs not call vppon them, nor desyre helpe at their handes: but let vs alwayes lift vp our heartes to GOD, in the name of his deare sonne Christ, for whose sake as God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to heare our prayer, so he wyll truelye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme it. Inuocation is a thing proper vnto God, whiche yf we attribute vnto the saintes, it soundeth to their reproche, neyther can they well beare it at our handes. When Paul had <note place="margin">Actes. 14.</note> healed a certayne lame man, whiche was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent in his feete, at <hi>Listra,</hi> the people woulde haue done sacrifice to him and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas: who renting their clothes, refused it, and exhorted them to worship the true GOD.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:6498:123"/>
Likewyse in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuelation, when saint John fell before the angelles feete to worship him, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell <note place="margin">Apoc. 19.</note> woulde not permit him to do it, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him that he shoulde worship GOD. Whiche examples declare vnto vs, that the saintes and angels in heauen, wyll not haue vs to do any honour vnto them, that is due and proper vnto God. He only is our father, he only is omnipotent, he onlye knoweth and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth all thing, he onlye can helpe vs at all times, and in all places, he suffereth the sunne to shine vppon the good and the bad, he feedeth the young Rauens that crie vnto him, he saueth both man &amp; beast, he wyl not that any one heere of our head shall perishe: but is alwayes redye to helpe and preserue all them that put their truste in him, accordyng as he hath promised, saying, Before they call, I wyll aunswere, and whyles <note place="margin">Esai. 55.</note> they speake, I wyll heare. Let vs not therefore any thing mistrust his goodnesse, let vs not feare to come before the throne of his mercie, let vs not seeke the ayde and helpe of saintes: but let vs come boldlye our selues, nothing doubting but God for Christes sake in whom he is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, will heare vs without a spokes man, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishe our desyre in all suche thinges as shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be agreeable to his most holye wyll. So sayth <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> an auncient Doctour of the <note place="margin">Chriso. 6. Home. de profectu.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:6498:123"/>
to the reliefe of our necessities, and also to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of our soules, whiche he hath purchased vnto vs, not with golde or siluer, but with his pretious blood, shed once for all vppon the crosse.

Thus the kyng cast of this vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and importunate suter.</p>
               <p>Nowe if so great consyderation be to be had, when we kneele before an earthly kyng: howe much more ought to be had, when we kneele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heauenly kyng, who is onlye delighted with iustice and equitie, neyther wyll admit any vayne, foolishe, or vniust petition? Therefore it shalbe good and profitable, throughly to consyder and determine with our selues, what thinges we may lawfully aske of God, without feare of repulse, and also what kinde of persons we are bound to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto god in our dayly prayers. Two thinges are chiesely to be respected in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye good and godly mans prayer: His owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, &amp; the glory of almightie God. Necessitie belongeth eyther outwardly to the body, or els
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:6498:125"/>
inwardly to the soule. Whiche part of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is muche more pretious &amp; excellent then the other, therefore we ought first of all, to craue such thinges as properly belong to the saluation thereof: as the gift of repentaunce, the gyfte of fayth, the gifte of charitie and good workes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and forgeuenesse of sinnes, patience in aduersitie, lowlinesse in prosperitie, and suche other like fruites of the spirite, as hope, loue, ioy, peace, long suffering, gentlenes, goodnes, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">Gala. 6.</note> and temperauncie, which thinges God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of all them that professe them selues to be his children, saying vnto them in this wyse: Let your light so shine before men, that they <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> may see your good workes, and glorifie your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whiche is in heauen. And in another place he also sayth: Seeke first the kingdome of God, <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> and his righteousnesse, and then al other things shalbe geuen vnto you. Wherin he putteth vs in mind, that our cheefe and greatest care, ought to be for those things which parteine to the health and safegarde of the soule, because we haue here (as the apostle sayth) no continuing citie, but do <note place="margin">Hebre. 13.</note> seeke after another in the worlde to come.</p>
               <p>Nowe when we haue sufficiently prayed for thinges belonging to the soule, then may we lawfully and with safe conscience, pray also for our bodily necessities, as meate, drinke, clothing, health of body, deliueraunce out of prison, good lucke in our dayly affayres, and so foorth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng as we shall haue neede. Wherof, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter example can we desire to haue, then of Christ him selfe, who taught his disciples, and all other
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:6498:125"/>
Christian men, first to pray for heauenly things, <note place="margin">Matth. 6. Luke. 11.</note> and afterwarde for earthly thinges, as is to be seene in that prayer, whiche he lefte vnto his Churche, commonly called the Lordes prayer? In the thirde booke of kinges and thirde Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is written, that God appeared by night in a dreame vnto Salomon the king, saying, Aske of me whatsoeuer thou wylt, and I wyll geue thee. Salomon made his humble prayer, and asked a wise &amp; prudent hearte, that might iudge and vnderstande what were good, &amp; what were ill, what were godlye, and what were vngodly, what were righteous, and what were vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the sight of the Lorde. It pleased God wonderously that he had asked this thing. And God sayd vnto him, Because thou hast requested this worde, and hast not desyred manye dayes and long yeres vpon the earth, neither aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of ryches and goodes, nor yet the lyfe of thyne enemies which hate thee, but hast desyred wisdome to sit in iudgement: Beholde, I haue done vnto thee accordyng to thy wordes, I haue geuen thee a wyse heart, full of knowledge and vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, so that there was neuer none like thee before time, neither shalbe in time to come. Moreouer I haue besides this, geuen thee that whiche thou hast not required, namelye world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye wealth and richesse, princely honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, so that thou shalt therein also passe all kynges that euer were. Note this example, howe Salomon beyng put to his choyse to aske of God whatsoeuer he woulde, requested not vaine and transitorie thinges, but the high and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6498:126"/>
heauenly treasures of wysdome, and that in so doyng, he obtayneth as it were in recompence, both riches and honour. Wherein is geuen vs to vnderstande, that in our dayly prayers, we should chiefely and principally aske those things which concerne the kingdome of God, and the saluation of our owne soules, nothyng doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but all other thinges shall (accordyng to the promise of Christe) be geuen vnto vs. But here we must take heede, that we forget not that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende whereof mention was made before, namely the glorye of God. Whiche vnlesse we minde, and set before our eyes in makyng our prayers, we may not looke to be harde, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue any thing of the Lorde. In the. xx. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Matthewe, the mother of the two sonnes of Zebedee came vnto Jesus, worshipping him, and saying: Graunt that my two sonnes may sit in thy kingdome, the one at thy ryght hand, and the other at thy left hande. In this petition she dyd not respect the glory of GOD, but plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared the ambition and vaine glory of her owne minde; for which cause she was also moste worthyly repelled, and rebuked at the Lordes hande. In lyke maner we reade in the Actes of one Simon Magus a Sorcerer, howe that he <note place="margin">Actes. 8.</note> perceauyng that through laying on of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles handes the holy ghost was geuen, offered them money, saying: Geue me also this power, that on whom soeuer I lay my handes, he may receaue the holy ghost. In makyng this request, he sought not the honour and glorye of GOD, but his owne priuate gayne and lucre, thinking
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6498:126"/>
to get great store of money by this feate, and therefore it was iustly sayde vnto him: Thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney perishe with thee, because thou thinkest that the gifte of God maye be obtayned with money. By these and suche other examples we are taught, whensoeuer we make our prayers vnto God, chiefely to respect the honour and glorye of his name. Whereof we haue this generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the Apostle Paul: Whether ye eate or <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. Coloss. 3.</note> drinke, or whatsoeuer you do, looke that you do it to the glory of God. Which thing we shal best of all do, if we folowe the example of our sauiour Christe, who praying that the bitter cuppe of <note place="margin">Mat. 26. Luke. 22.</note> death myght passe from him, woulde not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in haue his owne wyll fulfilled, but referred the whole matter to the good wyll and pleasure of his father.</p>
               <p>And hytherto concernyng those thinges, that we may lawfully and boldly aske of God.</p>
               <p>Nowe it foloweth, that we declare what kinde of persons we are bounde in conscience to praye for. Saint Paul wryting to Timothie, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> him to make prayers and supplications for all men, exempting none, of what degree or state soeuer they be. In which place he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by name of Kynges and Rulers whiche are in aucthoritie, putting vs thereby to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge howe greatlye it concerneth the profite of the common wealth, to praye diligentlye for <note place="margin">Coloss. 4. Rom. 15. 2. Thes. 3. Ephes. 6.</note> the higher powers. Neyther is it without good cause, that he doth so often in all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles craue the prayers of Gods people for hym selfe. For in so doyng, he declareth to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:6498:127"/>
the worlde, howe expedient and needefull it is dayly to call vppon GOD for the ministers of his holy worde and sacramentes, that they may haue the doore of vtteraunce opened vnto them, that they may truely vnderstand the scriptures, that they may effectually preache the same vnto the people, and bring foorth the true fruites thereof, to the example of all other. After this sorte dyd the congregation continually pray for Peter at Hierusalem, and for Paul among the <note place="margin">Actes. 12.</note> Gentiles, to the great encrease and furtherance of Christes Gospell. And if we, folowyng theyr good example herein, wyll studie to do the lyke, doubtlesse it can not be expressed, howe greatly we shall both helpe our selues, and also please God.</p>
               <p>To discourse and runne through all degrees of persons, it were to long. Therefore ye shall briefely take this one conclusion for all: Whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we are bounde by expresse commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to loue, for those also are we bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to pray. But we are bounde by expresse commaundement, to loue all men as our selues: therefore we are also bound to pray for all men, euen as well as if it were for our selues, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng we knowe them to be our extreme and deadly enemies. For so doth our sauiour Christe plainely teache vs in his Gospell, saying, Loue your enemies, blesse them that curse you, do <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> good to them that hate you, praye for them that persecute you, that ye may be the children of your father whiche is in heauen. And as he taught <note place="margin">Luke. 25.</note> his disciples, so dyd he practise him selfe in his
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:6498:127"/>
life time praying for his enemies vpon the crosse, and desyring his father to forgeue them, because they knewe not what they dyd: As did also that holy and blessed martyr Stephen, when he was <note place="margin">Actes. 7.</note> cruelly stoned to death of the stubberne and stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked Jewes, to the example of all them that wyll truely and vnfaignedly folowe their Lorde &amp; maister Christe in this miserable &amp; mortal life.</p>
               <p>Nowe to entreate of that question, whether we ought to pray for them that are departed out of this world, or no. Wherein yf we wyll cleaue only vnto the word of God: then must we nedes graunt, that we haue no commaundement so to do. For the scripture doth acknowledge but two places after this life. The one proper to the elect and blessed of god, the other to the reprobate and dampned soules, as may be well gathered by the parable of Lazarus and the riche man, whiche place saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expoundyng, sayth in this wyse: That which Abraham speaketh vnto the <note place="margin">Luke. 10.</note> riche man in Lukes Gospel, namely that the iust can not go into those places where the wicked <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Euange. questi. cap. 38.</note> are tormented: What other thinges doth it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, but only this, that the iust by reason of gods iudgement, which may not be reuoked, can shewe no deede of mercie in helping them, which after this lyfe are cast into prison, vntill they pay the vttermost farthyng? These wordes as they confounde the opinion of helping the dead by prayer, so they do cleane confute and take away the vaine errour of purgatorie, which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon this saying of the gospell: Thou shalt not depart thence, vntill thou hast payde the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoste
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:6498:128"/>
farthing. Nowe doth saint <hi>Augustine</hi> say, that those men which are cast into prison af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, on that condition may in no wyse be holpen, though we woulde helpe them neuer so much. And why? Because the sentence of God is vnchaungeable, &amp; can not be reuoked agayne. Therfore let vs not deceaue our selues, thinking that eyther we maye helpe other, or other maye helpe vs by their good and charitable prayers in time to come. For as the preacher saith: When the <note place="margin">Eccle. 11</note> tree falleth, whether it be toward the South, or towarde the North, in what place soeuer the tree falleth, there it lyeth: meanyng thereby that euery mortall man dyeth eyther in the state of saluation or dampnation, accordyng as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of the Euangelist John do also plainely impart, saying, He that beleueth on the sonne of God, <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> hath eternall lyfe: But he that beleueth not on the sonne, shall neuer see lyfe, but the wrath of God abideth vpon him. Where is then the thirde place whiche they call purgatorie? or where shall our prayers helpe and profite the dead? Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth onlye acknowledge two places <note place="margin">Li. 5. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogno.</note> after this life, heauen and hell: As for the thirde place, he doth plainely denie, that there is anye suche to be founde in all scripture. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chris. in Heb. 2. Hom. 4. Ciprian. cont. De metrianu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> likewyse is of this minde, that vnlesse we washe away our sinnes in this present worlde, we shall finde no comfort afterwarde. And saint <hi>Ciprian</hi> sayth, that after death, repentaunce and sorowe of paine shalbe without fruite, weping also shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be in vayne, and prayer shalbe to no purpose. Therefore he counselleth all men to make proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:6498:128"/>
for them selues whyle they maye, because when they are once departed out of this lyfe, there is no place for repentaunce, nor yet for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Let these and such other places be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to take away the grosse errour of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie out of our heades, neyther let vs dreame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye more, that the soules of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead are any thing at all holpen by our prayers: But as the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs, let vs thinke that the soule of man passing out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, goeth straightwayes eyther to heauen, or els to hell, whereof the one nedeth no prayer, and the other is without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. The onlye Purgatorie wherein we must trust to be saued, is the death and blood of Christe, which if we apprehend with a true and stedfast fayth, it purgeth and clenseth vs from all our sinnes, euen as well as if he were now han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vpon the crosse. The blood of Christe sayth <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1.</note> saint John, hath clensed vs from all sinne. The blood of Christe sayth saint Paul, hath purged <note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> our consciences from dead workes, to serue the liuing God. Also in another place he sayth: We <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> be sanctified and made holy, by the offering vp of the body of Jesus Christe done once for all. Yea <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> he addeth more, saying With the one oblation of his blessed body &amp; pretious blood, he hath made perfect for euer and euer all them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. This then is that Purgatorie, wherein all Christian men must put their whole truste and confidence, nothing doubting, but yf they truely repent them of their sinnes, and dye in perfecte fayth, that then they shall foorth with passe from death to life. If this kinde of purgation wyll not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:6498:129"/>
serue them, let them neuer hope to be releassed by other mens prayers, though they shoulde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue therein vnto the worldes ende. He that can not be saued by fayth in Christes blood, howe shall he loke to be deliuered by mans intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Hath God more respect to man on earth, then he hath to Christe in heauen? If any man sinne (sayth saint John) we haue an aduocate <note place="margin">Iohn. 2.</note> with the father, euen Jesus Christe the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he is the propitiation for our sinnes. But we must take heede that we call vpon this aduocate whyle we haue space geuen vs in this life, lest when we are once dead, there be no hope of saluation left vnto vs. For as euery man slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth with his owne cause, so euerye man shall ryse agayne with his owne cause. And looke in what state he dyeth, in the same state he shalbe also iudged, whether it be to saluation or damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Let vs not therfore dreame either of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, or of prayer for the soules of them that be dead: but let vs earnestly &amp; diligently praye for them whiche are expresly commaunded in holye scripture, namely for kinges and rulers, for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Gods holy worde and sacramentes, for the saintes of this worlde, otherwyse called the faithfull: to be short, for all men liuing, be they neuer so great enemies to god and his people, as Jewes, Turkes, Pagans, Infidels, Heretikes, &amp;c. Then shall we truely fulfill the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in that behalfe, &amp; plainely declare our selues to be the true children of our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, which suffreth the sunne to shine vpon the good and the bad, and the rayne to fall vpon
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:6498:129"/>
the iust and the vniust: For whiche and al other benefites moste aboundauntlye bestowed vppon mankynde from the beginning, let vs geue him hearty thankes, as we are most bound, &amp; prayse his name for euer and euer.</p>

O my soule prayse the Lord: Yet it appeareth to be Gods good wil and pleasure, that we shoulde at special times, and in special places, gather our selues together, to the intent his name might be renowmed, and his glory set forth in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and assembly of his saintes. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the tyme whiche almightie God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted his people to assemble together solemly, it doth appeare by the fourth commaundement of God: Remember saith God, that thou kepe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the Sabbath day. Upon the which day, as is playne in the actes of the Apostles, the people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customablye <note place="margin">Actes. 13.</note> resorted together, &amp; hearde diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the lawe and the prophetes read among them. And albeit this commaundement of God doeth not bynde christian people so straytlye to obserue and keepe the vtter ceremonies of the Sabbath day, as it was geuen vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes, as touching the forbearing of worke and labour in tyme of great necessitie, and as touching the precise kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the seuenth day, after the manner of the Jewes. For we keepe now the first day, which is our sunday, and make that our sabbath, that is, our day of rest, in the honor of our sauiour christ, who as vpon that daye rose from death, conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the same most triumphantly: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, whatsoeuer is found in the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement apparteyning to the lawe of nature, as a thyng most godlye, moste iuste, and needeful for the setting forth of Gods glorie, it ought to be retayned and kept of all good Christian people. And therfore by this commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we ought to haue a tyme, as one day in a weeke, wherein
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:6498:130"/>
we ought to rest, yea from our lawfull and nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes. For like as it appeareth by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, that no man in the syxe dayes ought to be slouthfull or ydle, but diligentlye to labour in that state wherein God hath set him: Euen so, God hath geuen expresse charge to all men, that vpon the sabbath day, which is now our sunday, they should ceasse from all weaklye and workeday labour, to the entent, that lyke as God him selfe wrought sixe dayes, and rested the seuenth, and blessed, and sanctified it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated it to quyetnes and rest from labour: euen so Gods obedient people shoulde vse the sundaye holyly, and rest from their comon and daily busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and also geue them selues whollye to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly exercises of Gods true religion and seruice. So that God doth not onely commaunde the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of this holy day, but also by his owne example doth stirre and prouoke vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diligent keeping of the same. Good natural children wil not onelye become obedient to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their parents, but also haue a diligent eye to their doings, and gladly folow the same.

                  </gap> be careful to keepe the christian sabbath day, which is the sunday, not onely for that it is Gods expresse commaundement, but also to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our selues to be louing children, in folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of our gratious Lorde and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus it may playnely appeare, that Gods will and commaundement was, to haue a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne time and standing day in the weke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the people shoulde come together, and haue in

remembraunce his wonderfull benefites, and to render him thankes for them, as apparteyneth to louing, kynd, &amp; obedient people. This example and commaundement of God, the godly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people began to follow immediately after the ascention of our Lorde Christ, and began to chose them a standing daye of the weeke to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in: Yet not the seuenth day which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes kept, but the Lordes day, the day of the Lordes resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the day after the seuenth day, which is the first of the weeke.

And in the Apocalips it is more plaine, wher as saint John sayth: I was in the spirite vpon the sunday. Sithens whiche time, Gods people <note place="margin">Apaca. i.</note> hath alwayes in all ages, without any gaynsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vsed to come together vpon the Sunday, to celebrate and honour the Lordes blessed name, &amp; carefully to kepe that day in holy rest &amp; quyetnes, both man, woman, chylde, seruaunt, and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For the trangression and breache of whiche day, God hath declared him selfe much to be gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as it may appeare by him who for gathering <note place="margin">Num. xv.</note> of sticks on the sabbath day was stoned to death. But alas, all these notwithstanding, it is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to see the wicked boldenes of those that will be counted gods people, who passe nothing at al of keeping and halowing the sundaye. And these people are of two sortes. The one sort if they

The other sort is worse: For although they wil not trauell nor labour on the sunday, as they do on the weke day, yet they wil not rest in holines, as God commaundeth: but they rest in vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; filthines, prauncing in their pryde, pranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and pricking, pointing and painting them selues to be gorgeous and gay: they rest in exces &amp; superfluitie, in glutteny and drunkennesse lyke rattes and swyne, they rest in brawling and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in quarreling and fyghting: they reste in wantonnes, in toyishe talkyng, in filthy fleshli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so that it doth to euidentlye appeare that God is more dishonored and the deuill better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on the sunday, then vpon all the dayes in the weeke besyde.

               <p>Nowe concerning the place where the people of God ought to resort together, and where espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they ought to celebrate and sanctifie the sabbath day, that is the sunday, the day of holye rest: That place is called Goddes Tentple or the churche, because the company &amp; congregation of Gods people (which is properly called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church) doth there assemble them selues on the dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for such assemblies &amp; meetinges. And sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as almightie God hath appointed a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall time to be honored in, it is very meete, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and also necessary, that there should be a place appoynted where these people should meete and resort, to serue their gracious God and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full father. Trueth it is, the holy Patriarches for a great number of yeres had neyther temple, nor churche to resort vnto. The cause was, they were not stayed in any place, but were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall perigrination and wandering, that they could not conueniently buyld any churche. But so soone as God had delyuered his people from their enemies, and set them in some libertie in the wildernes, he set them vp a costly &amp; a curious tabernacle, whiche was as it were the paryshe church, a place to resort vnto of the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, a place to haue his sacrifices made in, and other obseruaunces and rites to be vsed in. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:6498:132"/>
after that God according to the trueth of his promise, had placed and quyetlye setled his people in the land of Chanaan, now called Jury, he commaunded a great and a magnificent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be buylded by kyng Salomon, as seldome the lyke hath ben seene, a temple so decked and adourned, so gorgeously garnished, as was meete and expedient for people of that tyme, whiche would be allured &amp; stirred with nothing so much as with suche out warde goodlye gaye thinges. This was nowe the temple of God, indued also with many gyttes &amp; sundry promyses. This was the paryshe churche, and the mother Churche of all Jury. Here was God honoured and serued. Hyther was the whole realme of all the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites bounde to come at three solempne feastes in the yere, to serue their Lord God here. But let vs proceede further. In the tyme of Christe and his Apostles, there was yet no temples nor Churches for Christian men. For whye? they were alwayes for the moste part in persecution, veration, and trouble, so that there coulde be no libertie nor lycence obteyned for that purpose. Yet God delyghted much that they shoulde often resort togyther in a place, and therefore after his ascention they remayned togyther in an vpper chamber, sometyme they entred into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, sometyme into the synagoges, sometyme they were in pryson, sometymes in theyr houses, sometymes in the feeldes. &amp;c. And this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued so long, till the fayth of Chryste Jesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to multiplye in a great parte of the worlde. Nowe when dyuers Realmes were establyshed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:6498:133"/>
in gods true religion, and God hath geuen them peace and quyetnes: then began kynges, noble men, and the people also, stirred vp with a godly zeale and feruentnesse, to buylde vp temples and Churches, whyther the people might resort, the better to do their dutie towardes God, &amp; to keepe holy their sabbath daye, the daye of rest. And to these temples haue the Christians customably vsed to resort from tyme to tyme, as vnto meete places where they might with common consent prayse and magnifie Gods name, yeelding him thankes for the benefites that he dayly powreth vpon them, both mercifully and aboundantlye, where they might also heare his holy word read, expounded, &amp; preached sincerely, and receaue his holy sacramentes ministred vnto them duely and purely. True it is that the chiefe and special tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of God, wherin he hath greatest pleasure, &amp; most delighteth to dwel, are the bodies &amp; mindes of true christians, and the chosen people of God, according to the doctrine of holye scriptures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by Saint Paul. Knowe ye not (sayth he) <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> that ye be the temple of God, and that the spirite of God doth dwell in you? The temple of God is holy, whiche ye are. And againe in the same E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle: Know ye not that your body is the temple <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> of the holye Ghost dwelling in you, whom you haue geuen you of God, and that ye be not your owne? Yet this notwithstanding, God doeth alowe the materiall temple made with lyme and stone (so oft as his people come together into it, to praise his holy name) to be his house, and the place where he hath promised to be present, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:6498:133"/>
where he wil heare the prayers of them that call vpon him. The which thing both Christ and his apostles, with all the rest of the holy fathers, do sufficiently declare by this: That albeit they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynlye knewe that their prayers were heard in what place soeuer they made them, though it were in caues, in woodes, &amp; in desartes, yet (so oft as they could conueniently) they resorted to the material temples, there with the rest of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to ioyne in prayer and true worship.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (dearely beloued) you that professe your selues to be Christians, and glory in that name, disdaine not to folow the example of your maister Christe, whose schollers you saye ye be, shew you to be lyke them whose scholemates you take vpon you to be, that is, the Apostles and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christe. Lift vp pure handes, with cleane heartes in all places, &amp; at all tymes. But do the same in the temples and Churches vpon the sabbath daies also. Our godly predecessours and the auncient fathers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> primitiue Church, spared not their goodes to buylde Churches, no they spared not their lyues in tyme of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to hazarde their blood, that they myght assemble them selues together in Churches. And shal we spare a little labour to come to churches? Shall neither their example, nor our duety, nor the commodities (that thereby shoulde come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs) moue vs? If we will declare our selues to haue the feare of God, if we will shewe our selues true christians, if we will be the folowers of Christ our maister, and of those godly fathers that haue liued before vs, &amp; now haue receaued
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:6498:134"/>
the rewarde of true and faythfull christians, we must both willingly, earnestly, and reuerently, come vnto the material churches and temples to praye, as vnto fit places appoynted for that vse: And that vppon the sabbath day, as at most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient tyme for Gods people, to cease from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyly and worldlye businesse, to geue them selues to holy rest, and godly contemplation parteining to the seruice of almightie God: Wherby we may reconcile our selues to God, be partakers of his reuerent sacramentes, and be deuout hearers of his holye worde, so to be established in fayth to godwarde, in hope agaynst all aduersitie, and in charitie towardes our neighbours. And thus running our course as good christian people, we may at the last attaine the reward of euerlasting glorie, through the merites of our sauiour Iesus Christe, to whom with the father and the holye Ghost, be all honour and glorye.</p>

desirous ye ought to be to come to your Church. Secondly, how sore God is greeued with them that do despyse or little regarde to come to the Churche vpon the holy restfull day. It may wel appeare by the scriptures, that many of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Israelites beyng no we in captiuitie for their sinnes among the Babilonians, full often wys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and desyred to be agayne at Hierusalem: And at their returne, through Gods goodnesse (though many of the people were negligent) yet the fathers were maruelous deuout to buyld vp the temple, that Gods people might repayre thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to honour him. And Kyng Dauid when he was a banished man out of his countrey, out of Hierusalem the holye Citie, from the sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, from the holye place, and from the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God: What desyre, what feruentnesse was in him towardes the holye place? What wysshinges and prayers made he to God to be a dweller in the house of the Lorde? One thing (sayth he) haue I asked of the Lorde, and this will I still craue, that I maye resorte and haue <note place="margin">Psal. 16.</note> my dwelling in the house of the Lorde, so long as I lyue. Agayne, Oh howe I ioyed when I heard these wordes, <hi>VVe shall go into the Lordes</hi>

                  <hi>house.</hi> And in other places of the Psalmes he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth for what intent and purpose he hath such a feruente desyre to enter into the Temple and Churche of the Lorde: I will fall downe (sayth <note place="margin">Psal. 157.</note> he) and worship in the holy temple of the Lord. Agayne, I haue appeared in thy holy place, that <note place="margin">Psal. 63.</note> I myght beholde thy myght and power, that I myght beholde thy glory and magnificence.</p>

Finally he sayth, I will shewe foorth thy name to my brethren, I will prayse thee in the middes <note place="margin">Psal. 21.</note> of the congregation. Why then had Dauid suche an earnest desyre to the house of God? First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there he would worship and honour God. Secondly, there he would haue a contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and a syght of the power and glorye of God. Thirdly, there he would prayse the name of god, with all the congregation and companye of the people. These considerations of this blessed prophet of God, ought to stirre vp and kindle in vs the lyke earnest desyre to resort to the church, especially vppon the holy restfull dayes, there to do our duties &amp; to serue God, there to call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce how God, euen of his mere mercie, &amp; for the glory of his name sake, worketh mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely to conserue vs in health, wealth, and godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; myghtyly preserueth vs from the assaults and rages of our fierce and cruell enemies, and there ioyfully in the number of his faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to prayse and magnitie the Lords holy name.

an olde widowe, departed not out of the temple, geuing her selfe to prayer &amp; fasting day &amp; nyght: And she comming about the same tyme, was likewise inspyred, and confessed and spake of the Lorde to all them that looked for the redemption of Israel. This blessed man, and this blessed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, were not disapoynted of wonderfull fruit, commoditie and comfort whiche God sent them, by their diligent resorting to Gods holy temple. Nowe ye shall heare howe greuouslye God hath ben offended with his people, for that they passed so litle vpon his holy Temple, and foully eyther despysed or abused the same. Whiche thyng maye playnely appeare by the notable plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmentes which God hath layde vpon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, especially in this, that he stirred vp their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, horribly to beate downe, and vtterly to destroye his holy temple with a perpetuall deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Alas, how many Churches countreyes &amp; kingdomes of christian people, haue of late yeres ben plucked downe, ouerrunne, &amp; left wast, with greeuous &amp; intollerable tyrannye and crueltie of the enemy of our Lord Christe the great Turke, who hath so vniuersally scourged the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that neuer the lyke was heard &amp; read of? Aboue thirtie yeres past, the great Turke had ouerrun, conquered, and brought into his dominion and subiection twentie Christian kingdomes, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng away the people from the fayth of Christe, poysonyng them with the dyuelishe religion of wicked Mahomet, and eyther destroying their Churches vtterly, or filthily abusing them with their wicked and detestable errours. And nowe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:6498:136"/>
this great Turke, this bitter and sharpe scourge of Gods vengeaunce, is euen at hande in this part of christendome, in Europe, at the borders of Italy, at the borders of Germany, greedylye gaping to deuour vs, to ouerrunne our country, to destroye our Churches also, vnlesse we repent our sinfull lyfe, and resort more diligently to the Church to honour God, to learne his blessed wil, and to fulfill the same. The Jewes in their time prouoked iustly the vengeaunce of God, for that partly they abused his holy temple with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable idolatrie of the heathen, &amp; supersticious vanities of their owne inuentions, contrary to Gods commaundement, partly they resorted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it as hypocrites, spotted, imbrewed, and fouly defyled with all kinde of wickednesse and sinfull lyfe, partly many of them passed little vpon the holy temple, &amp; forced not whether they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or no. And haue not the Christians of late dayes, and euen in our dayes also, in lyke maner prouoked the displeasure and indignation of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God? partly because they haue propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and defyled their churches with heathenishe and Jewish abuses, with images and idols, with numbers of aulters, too too superstitiously, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerablye abused, with grosse abusing, and fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye corrupting of the Lordes holye supper, the blessed sacrament of his body and blood, with an infinite number of toyes and tryfles of theyr owne deuyces, to make a godly outwarde shewe, and to deface the homely, simple, and sincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Christ Jesus, partlye they resort to the Churche lyke hypocrites, full of all iniquitie and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:6498:136"/>
sinfull lyfe, hauing a vayne &amp; daungerous fansie and perswasion, that if they come to the church, besprinkle them with holy water, heare a masse, and be blessed with the challice, though they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not one worde of the whole seruice, nor feele one motion of repentaunce in their hearts, all is well, all is sure. Fye vpon suche mocking &amp; blaspheming of gods holy ordinaunce. Churches were made for an other purpose, that is, to resort thyther, and to serue God truelye, there to learne his blessed will, there to call vpon his myghtye name, there to vse the holy sacraments, there to trauayle howe to be in charitie with thy neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, there to haue thy poore and needy neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in remembraunce, from thence to departe better and more godly then thou camest thyther. Finallye, Gods vengeaunce hath ben, &amp; is dayly prouoked, because much wicked people passe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to resort to the Church, either for that they are so sore blinded that they vnderstand nothing of God and godlines, and care not with deuilishe example to offende their neighbours, or els for that they see the Churche altogether scoured of such gay gasing sightes as their grosse phantasie was greatly delyghted with, because they see the false religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abandoned, &amp; the true restored, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che seemeth an vnsauery thing to their vnsauery taste, as may appeare by this that a woman said to her neighbour: Alas gossip, what shal we now do at Church since al the saints are taken away, since al the goodly sightes we were wont to haue are gone, since we cannot heare the like pyping, singing, chaunting, &amp; playing vppon the organs
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:6498:137"/>
that we could before. But (dearelye beloued) we ought greatly to reioyce and geue God thankes, that our Churches are deliuered of all those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which displeased God so sore, &amp; filthily defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his holy house and his place of prayer, for the which he hath iustly destroyed many nations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the saying of saint Paule: If any man defyle the temple of God, God will him destroye. <note place="margin">1. Cor. iii.</note> And this ought we greatly to praise god for, that such superstitious &amp; idolatrious maners as were vtterly naught &amp; defaced gods glory, are vtterly abolished, as they most iustly deserued: and yet those things that either god was honored with, or his people edified, are decently reteyned, and in our Churches comely practised. But nowe forasmuch as ye perceaue it is gods determinate pleasure, ye should resort vnto your churches vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the day of holy rest, seyng ye heare what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure God conceaueth, what plagues he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vpon his disobedient people, seyng ye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what blessinges of God are geuen, what heauenly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities come to such people as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirously &amp; zelously vse to resort vnto their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, seyng also ye are now freendly bidden and ioyntly called, beware that ye slacke not your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, take heede that you suffer nothing to let you hereafter to come to the Church at such times as you are ordinarily apoynted &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. Our sauiour Christe telleth in a parable, that a great <note place="margin">Luke. iiii.</note> supper was prepared, gestes were bidden, many excused themselues &amp; would not come: I tel you (sayth Christ) none of them that were called shal taste of my supper. This great supper, is the true

religion of almightie God, wherewith he wyll be worshipped in the due receauyng of his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and sincere preaching and hearyng his holy word, and practising the same by godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. This feast is nowe prepared in Gods banquetting house the Churche, you are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto called and ioyntly bidden: yf you refuse to come, and make your excuses, the same wyll be aunswered to you, that was vnto them. Nowe come therefore (dearely beloued) without delay, and chearefully enter into Gods feastyng house, and become partakers of the benefites prouided &amp; prepared for you. But see that ye come thyther with your holiday garment, not like hypocrites, not of a custome and for maner sake, not with lothsomnesse, as though ye had rather not come then come, yf ye were at your libertie. For God hateth &amp; punisheth such counterfaite hypocrites, as appeareth by Christes former parable. My freend (sayth God) how camest thou in without a wedding garment? And therfore commaunded his seruauntes to binde him hand &amp; foote, and to cast him into vtter darknesse, where shalbe wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and wayling, and gnashyng of teethe. To the intent ye maye auoyde the lyke daunger at Gods hand, come to the Church on the holyday, &amp; come in your holyday garment, that is to say, come with a cheareful and a godly mind, come to seeke Gods glory, and to be thankfull vnto hym, come to be at one with thy neighbour, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in frendship and charitie with him.

fyrst what prayer is, and what a sacrament is, and then howe many sortes of prayers there be, &amp; howe many sacramentes, so shal we the better vnderstand howe to vse them aright. To knowe what they be, saint <hi>Augustine</hi> teacheth vs in his <note place="margin">August de spiritu &amp; anima.</note> booke entituled, Of the spirite and the soule. He sayth this of prayer: Prayer is (saith he) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of the minde, that is to say, the returning to God through a godlye and humble affection, which affection is a certaine willing and sweete enclining of the minde it selfe towardes GOD. <note place="margin">August. lib. 2. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarios le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete. August. ad Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facium.</note> And in the seconde booke agaynst the aduersarie of the lawe &amp; the prophetes, he calleth sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes holy signes. And writing to <hi>Bonifacius</hi> of the baptisme of infantes, he sayth, If sacramentes had not a certayne similitude of those thinges whereof they be sacramentes, they shoulde be no sacramentes at all. And of this similitude, they do for the moste part receaue the names of the selfe thinges they signifie. By these wordes of saint <hi>Augustine</hi> it appeareth, that he aloweth the common description of a sacrament, whiche is, that it is a visible signe of an inuisible grace, that is to saye, that setteth out to the eyes and other outwarde senses, the inwarde workyng of Gods free mercie, and doth (as it were) seale in our heartes the promises of God. And so was circumcision a sacrament, whiche preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the outwarde senses, the inwarde cutting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the foreskin of the hearte, and sealed and made sure in the heartes of the circumcised, the promise of god touching the promised seede that they loked for. Nowe let vs see howe many sortes
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:6498:139"/>
of prayer, and howe many sacramentes there be. In the scriptures we reade of three sortes of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereof two are priuate, and the thirde is common. The first is that whiche Saint Paul speaketh of in his Epistle to Timothie, saying, I wyll that men pray in euery place, lyfting vp <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> pure handes without wrath and sttriuing. And it is the deuout lifting vp of the minde to God, without the vttering of the heartes griefe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre by open voyce. Of this prayer we haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the first booke of the kynges in <hi>Anna</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> when in the heauinesse of <note place="margin">1. Reg. 1.</note> her heart she prayed in the temple, desyring to be made fruitefull. She prayed in her heart (sayth the tert) but there was no voyce hearde. After this sorte must all Christians pray, not once in a weeke, or once in a day onlye: but as saint Paul writeth to the Thessalonians, without ceassyng. <note place="margin">

                  </gap>. Thes. 5. Iacob. 5.</note> And as Saint James wryteth, The continuall prayer of a iust man is of much force. The second sort of prayer is spoken of in the Gospel of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, where it is sayd, When thou prayest, enter into thy secrete closet, and when thou hast shut <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> the doore to thee, pray vnto thy father in secrete, and thy father which seeth in secrete, shal reward thee. Of this sorte of prayer, there be sundry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the scriptures, but it shall suffise to rehearse one, which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Actes of the Apostles. <hi>Cornelius</hi> a deuoute man, a captayne <note place="margin">Actes. 10.</note> of the Italian army, sayth to Peter: that beyng in his house in prayer, at the ninth houre there appeared vnto hym one in a white garment. &amp;c. This man prayed vnto God in secrete, and was
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:6498:139"/>
rewarded openly. These be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two priuate sortes of prayer. The one mentall, that is to say, the deuoute lifting vp of the minde to God: And the other vocall, that is to saye, the secrete vtteryng of the griefes &amp; desires of the heart with wordes, but yet in a secrete closet or some solitarie place. The third sort of prayer, is publique or common. Of this prayer speaketh our Sauiour Christe, when he sayth, If two of you shall agree vppon earth vpon any thing, whatsoeuer ye shall aske, <note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> my father which is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal do it for you, for wheresoeuer two or three be gathered together in my name, there am I in the middest of them. Although God hath promised to heare vs when we pray priuately, so it be done faythfully and deuoutly (For he sayth, Call vppon me in the day <note place="margin">Psalm. 50. Iacob. 5.</note> of thy trouble, and I wyll heare thee. And Elias being but a mortall man, sayth Saint James, prayed, and heauen was shut three yeres and sixe monethes, and againe he praied, and the heauen gaue rayne:) Yet by the histories of the Bible it appeareth, that publique and common praier is most auaileable before god, and therfore is much to be lamented that it is no better esteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs whiche professe to be but one bodye in Christe. When the citie of <hi>Niniue</hi> was threatned to be destroyed within. xl. dayes, the Prince and <note place="margin">Ionas. 3.</note> people ioyned them selues together in publique prayer and fasting, and were preserued. In the prophete <hi>Ioel,</hi> God commaunded a fasting to <note place="margin">Ioel. 2.</note> be proclaymed, and the people to be gathered together, young and olde, man and woman, and are taught to say with one voyce: Spare vs O
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:6498:140"/>
Lorde, spare thy people, and let not thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce be brought to confusion. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes shoulde haue ben destroyed all in one day tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the malice of <hi>Haman,</hi> at the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Hester</hi> they fasted and prayed, and were <note place="margin">Hester. 4.</note> preserued. When <hi>Holophernes</hi> besieged <hi>Bethulia,</hi> by the aduice of <hi>Iudith</hi> they fasted and prayed, and were deliuered. When Peter was in prison, the <note place="margin">Iudith. 8.</note> congregation ioyned them selues together in prayer, and Peter was wonderfully deliuered. <note place="margin">Actes. 12.</note> By these histories it appeareth, that common or publique prayer is of great force to obtayne mercie, &amp; deliueraunce at our heauenlye fathers hand. Therfore brethren, I beseche you, euen for the tender mercies of GOD, let vs no longer be negligent in this behalfe: but as the people wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receaue at Gods hand such good thinges as in the common prayer of the Church are cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, let vs ioyne our selues together in the place of common prayer, and with one voyce and one heart, begge at our heauenlye father all those thinges, which he knoweth to be necessarie for vs. I forbid you not priuate prayer, but I exhort you to esteeme common prayer as it is worthye. And before all thinges, be sure, that in all these three sortes of prayer, your mindes be deuoutlye lifted vp to God, els are your prayers to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, &amp; this saying shalbe verified in you: This people honoureth me with their lips, but theyr <note place="margin">Esai. 29. Matth. 15.</note> heart is farre from me. Thus much for the three sortes of prayer, wherof we reade in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures.</p>
            <p>Nowe with lyke or rather more breuitie, you shall heare howe manye sacramentes there be,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:6498:140"/>
that were instituted by our Sauiour Christe, and are to be continued, and receaued of euerye Christian in due time and order, and for suche purpose as our sauiour Christe wylled them to be receaued. And as for the number of them, yf they shoulde be consydered according to the exact signification of a sacrament, namely for the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signes, expreslye commaunded in the newe Testament, whereunto is anexed the promise of free forgeuenesse of our sinne, and of our holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and ioynyng in Christe: there be but two, namely Baptisme, and the supper of the Lorde. For although absolution hath the promise of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenesse of sinne: yet by the expresse worde of the newe Testament, it hath not this promyse annexed and tyed to the visible signe, whiche is imposition of handes. For this visible signe (I meane laying on of handes) is not expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in the newe Testament to be vsed in absolution, as the visible signes in baptisme and the Lordes supper are: and therefore absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no suche sacrament as baptisme and the Communion are. And though the orderyng of ministers hath his visible signe and promise: yet it lackes the promise of remission of sinue, as all other sacramentes besides do. Therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, nor any other sacrament els, be suche sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes as Baptisme and the Communion are. But in a generall acception, the name of a Sacrament maye be attributed to anye thing whereby an holye thing is signified. In whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vnderstandyng of the worde, the auncient writers haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this name, not only to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:6498:141"/>
fiue, commonly of late yeres taken and vsed for supplying the number of the seuen sacramentes: <note place="margin">Dionisi. Barnard. de coena domini, &amp; abluti pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> but also to diuers and sundry other ceremonies, as to oyle, wasshing of feete, and suche lyke, not meaning thereby to repute them as sacraments, in the same signification that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two forenamed sacramentes are. And therefore saint <hi>Augustine</hi> weyghyng the true signification and exact mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the worde, wryting to <hi>Ianuarius,</hi> &amp; also in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirde booke of christian doctrine, affirmeth that the sacramentes of the Christians, as they are most excellent in signification, so are they most few in number, and in both places maketh mention expressedlye of two, the sacrament of baptisme, and the Supper of the Lorde. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there are reteined by thorder of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of England, besides these two, certayne other Rites and Ceremonies about the institution of ministers in the Churche, Matrimonie, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of children, by examining them of theyr knowledge in the articles of the faith, &amp; ioynyng there to the prayers of the Church for them, and like wise for the visitation of the sicke: yet no man ought to take these for sacramentes in suche sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification &amp; meaning, as the sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Lordes Supper are: but eyther for godly states of life, necessarie in Christes church, and therfore worthy to be set foorth by publique action and solempnitie by the ministerie of the Church, or els iudged to be such ordinaunces, as may make for the instruction, comfort, and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Christes Churche.</p>
            <p>Now, vnderstandyng sufficiently what prayer
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:6498:141"/>
is, and what a sacrament is also, and how many sortes of prayers there be, and howe many sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of our sauiour Christes institution: let vs see whether the scriptures and the examples of the primatiue Churche wyl alowe any vocall prayer, that is, when the mouth vttereth the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions with voyce, or any maner of sacrament, or other publique &amp; common rite or action, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning to the profite and edifying of the poore congregation, to be ministred in a tongue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen or not vnderstande of the Minister or people: yea, and whether anye person maye pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately vse any vocall prayer, in a language that he him selfe vnderstandeth not. To this question we must aunswere, no. And fyrst of Common prayer and administration of Sacramentes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though reason, yf it myght rule, woulde soone perswade vs to haue our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of sacramentes in a knowen tongue, both for that to pray co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, is for a multitude to aske one &amp; the selfe thing with one voyce and one consent of minde, and to administer a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is by the out warde worde and element, to preache to the receauer the inwarde &amp; inuisible grace of God, &amp; also for that both these exercises were first instituted, and are still continued, to the ende that the congregation of Christe might from tyme to tyme be put in remembraunce of their vnitie in Christe, and that as members all of one bodye, they ought both in prayers &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse to seeke and desire one anothers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, and not their owne without others: Yet shall we not neede to flee to reasons profes in this
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:6498:142"/>
matter, syth we haue both the plaine &amp; manifest wordes of the scripture, and also the consent of the most learned &amp; auncient writers to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende the prayers of the congregation in a knowen tongue. First, Paul to the Corinthians sayth: <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> Let all thinges be done to edifying. Whiche can not be, vnlesse commonpraiers &amp; administration of sacramentes be in a tongue knowen to the people. For where the prayers spoken by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and the wordes in the administration of the sacramentes, be not vnderstanded of them that be present, they can not thereby be edified. For as when the trumpet that is blowen in the feelde geueth an vncertaine sounde, no man is therby stirred vp to prepare him selfe to the fight: And as when an instrument of musicke maketh no distinct sound, no man can tel what is piped: Euen so when prayers or administration of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes shalbe in a tongue vnknowen to the hearers, which of them shalbe thereby stirred vp to lyft vp his minde to God, and to begge with the Minister at Gods hand, those things which in the wordes of his prayers the minister asketh? Or who shall in the ministration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes vnderstande what inuisible grace is to be craued of the hearer, to be wrought in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde man? Cruely no man at al. For (sayth S. Paul) he that speaketh in a tongue vnknowen, shalbe vnto the hearer an alient, whiche in a Christian congregation is a great absurditie. For we are not straungers one to another, but we are the citizens of the saintes, &amp; of the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde of GOD, yea, and members of one bodye.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:6498:142"/>
And therfore whiles our minister is in rehersing <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 1. Cor. 10. and. 12.</note> the prayer that is made in the name of vs all, we must geue diligent eare to the wordes spoken by him, and in hearte begge at Gods hande those thinges that he beggeth in wordes. And to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that we so do, we say <hi>Amen</hi> at the ende of the prayer that he maketh in the name of vs al. And this thing can we not do for edification, vnlesse we vnderstand what is spoken. Therfore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of necessitie, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common praier be had in a tongue that the hearers do vnderstande. If euer it had ben tollerable to vse strange tongues in the congregations, the same myght haue ben in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Paul &amp; the other apostles, when they were miraculously endued with the gift of ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues. For it might then haue perswaded some to imbrace the Gospell, when they had hearde men that were Hebrues borne, &amp; vnlearned, speake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greke, the Latin, &amp; other languages. But Paul thought it not tollerable then: And shall we vse it now, when no man commeth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of tongues, other wyse then by diligent &amp; earnest study? God forbid. For we should by that meanes bring all our Church exercises to friuolus super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and make them altogether vnfruitefull. Luke writeth, that when Peter and John were <note place="margin">Actes. 4.</note> discharged by the Princes and high Priestes of Hierusalem, they came to their felowes, &amp; tolde them al that the princes of the priestes and elders had spoken vnto them. Which when they heard, they lyfted vp their voyce together to God with one assent, and sayde, Lord, thou arthe that hast made heauen and earth, the sea, and all thinges
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:6498:143"/>
that are in them. &amp;c. Thus coulde they not haue done, yf they had prayed in a straunge tongue, that they had not vnderstande. And no doubt of it, they dyd not all speake with seuerall voyces: but some one of them spake in the name of them all, &amp; the rest geuing diligent eare to his wordes, consented therunto, and therefore it is sayd, that they lifted vp their voyce together. Saint Luke saith not, Their voices, as many: but, their voice, as one. That one voyce therefore was in suche language as they al vnderstood, other wyse they coulde not haue lifted it vp with the consent of their heartes. For no man can geue consent of the thing he knoweth not. As touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> times before the comming of Christe, there was neuer man yet that would affirme, that eyther the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God or other, had their prayers or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of sacraments, or sacrifices, in a tongue that they them selues vnderstood not. As for the time since Christe, tyll that vsurped power of Rome began to spreade it selfe, and to enforce al the nations of Europe to haue the Romishe language in admiration, it appeareth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the most auncient &amp; learned writers, that there was no straunge or vnknowen tongue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the congregations of Christians. <hi>Instinus</hi> martyr, who liued about. 160. yeres after Christ, <note place="margin">Iustinus. Apol. 2.</note> sayth thus of the administration of the Lordes supper in his time, Upon the Sunday assembles are made, both of them that dwel in cities, and of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dwell in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey also. Amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as much as may be, the writinges of the apostles &amp; prophets are read. Afterwards, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reader
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:6498:143"/>
doth ceasse, the chiefe minister maketh an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, exhorting them to folow so honest things. After this, we ryse altogether and offer prayers, which being ended (as we haue saide) bread and wine and water are brought foorth: Then the head minister offereth prayers &amp; thankesgeuing with al his power, &amp; the people aunswere, Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. These wordes with their circumstaunces beyng duely consydered, do declare plainly, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the scriptures were read in a knowen tongue: but also that praier was made in the same in the congregations of <hi>Iustines</hi> tyme. <hi>Basilius magnus,</hi> and <hi>Iohannes Chrisostomus</hi> dyd in theyr tyme prescribe publique orders of publique admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, which they call <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and in them they appoynted the people to aunswere to the prayers of the Minister, sometime, <hi>Amen,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme, <hi>Lorde haue mercie vppon vs,</hi> sometyme, <hi>and with thy spirite,</hi> and, <hi>we haue our heartes lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp vnto, the Lorde, &amp;c.</hi> Which aunsweres the people coulde not haue made in due time, yf the praiers had not ben in a tongue that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode. The same <hi>Basil</hi> writing to the Cleargie of <note place="margin">Epist. 63.</note> 
               <hi>Neocaesaria,</hi> sayth thus of his vsage in common prayer, appoynting one to beginne the song, the rest folow: And so with diuers songes &amp; prayers, passing ouer the night, at the dawnyng of the day, altogether (euen as it were with one mouth and one heart) they sing vnto the Lorde a song of confession, euery man framing vnto him selfe meete wordes of repentaunce. In another place he sayth, If the Sea be faire, howe is not the assemble of the congregation muche more fayre,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:6498:144"/>
in which a ioyned sounde of men, women, and children (as it were of the waues beating on the shore) is sent forth in our prayers vnto our God? Marke his wordes: A ioyned sounde (sayth he) of men, women, and children. Which can not be, <note place="margin">Basil. Rom. 4.</note> vnlesse they all vnderstande the tongue wherein the prayer is sayde. And <hi>Chrisostome</hi> vppon the wordes of Paul sayth, So soone as the people heare these words, <hi>worlde without ende,</hi> they all do forthwith aunswere, <hi>Amen.</hi> This coulde they <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> not do, vnlesse they vnderstood the worde spoken by the priest. <hi>Dionisius</hi> sayth, that hymnes were <note place="margin">Dionisi.</note> sayde of the whole multitude of people in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Communion. <hi>Ciprian</hi> sayth, <note place="margin">Ciprian. Ser. 6. de ora. do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minica.</note> the Priest doth prepare the mindes of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with a preface before the prayer, saying, <hi>Lyft vp your heartes:</hi> That whyles the people doth aunswere, <hi>VVe haue our heartes lyfted vp to the Lord,</hi> they be admonished that they ought to thinke on none other thing then the Lorde. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> wryting vppon the wordes of saint Paul, sayth, This is it that he sayth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> he which speaketh in an vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tongue, speaketh to God, for he knoweth all thinges: but men know not, and therefore there is no profite of this thing. And agayne vppon these wordes: If thou blesse, or geue thankes with the spirite, howe shall he that occupieth the roome of the vnlearned, say <hi>Amen</hi> at thy geuing of thankes, seeyng he vnderstandeth not what thou sayest? That is (sayth <hi>Ambrose)</hi> yf thou speake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayse of God in a tongne vnknowen to the hearers. For the vnlearned, hearing that whiche he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:6498:144"/>
not, knoweth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and aunswereth not <hi>Amen,</hi> whiche worde is as much to saye, as trueth, that the blessing or thankesgeuing may be confirmed. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the prayer is fulfilled by them that do aunswere, <hi>Amen,</hi> that all thinges spoken, might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in the mindes of the hearers, through the testimonie of the trueth. And after many weightie words, to the same end, he saith: The conclusion is this, that nothing shoulde be done in the Churche in vaine, and that this thing ought chiefely to be laboured for, that the vnlearned also myght take profite, least any part of the body should be darke through ignoraunce. And least anye man shoulde thinke all this to be meant of preaching, and not of prayer, he taketh occasion of these wordes of saint Paul <hi>(If there be not an interpreter, let hym keepe silence in the Churche)</hi> to say, as foloweth: Let hym praye secretly, or speake to GOD, who heareth all thinges that be dumbe: For in the Churche must he speake that maye profite all personnes. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> wryting vpon these wordes of saint Paul, <hi>Howe shall he that supplieth the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> 
               <hi>place of the vnlearned. &amp;c.</hi> sayth, It is the laye man whom Paul vnderstandeth here to be in the place of the ignoraunt man, which hath no ecclesiasticall office: <hi>How shal he aunswere, Amen to the prayer that he vnderstandeth not?</hi> And a litle after, vppon the wordes of saint Paul, <hi>For yf I shoulde pray in a tongue. &amp;c.</hi> he sayth thus, This is Paules meanyng: If any may speake in straunge &amp; vnknowen tongues, his minde is
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:6498:145"/>
made vnfruitefull, not to hym selfe, but to the hearer: For whatsoeuer is spoken, he knoweth it not. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> wryting vpon the. xviii Psalme, saith: What this shoulde be we ought to vnderstande, that we maye sing with reason of <note place="margin">Psalm. 28.</note> man, and not with chattering of birdes. For Owles, Popingayes, Rauens, Pies, and other such like birdes are taught by men to prate they know not what: But to sing with vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, is geuen by Gods holy wil to the nature of man. Againe, the same <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, There nedeth no speache when we pray, sauing perhappes as <note place="margin">De ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist.</note> the priestes do, for to declare their meanyng, not that God, but that men maye heare them. And so beyng put in remembraunce by consentyng with the priest, they may hang vpon God:</p>
            <p>Thus are we taught both by the scriptures and auncient doctours, that in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Common prayer and Sacramentes, no tongue vnknowen to the hearers ought to be vsed. So that for the satisfying of a Christian mans conscience we nede to spend no more tyme in this matter. But yet to stoppe the mouthes of the aduersaries, whiche stay them selues muche vpon generall decrees, it shalbe good to adde to these testimonies of scriptures and doctors, one constitution made by <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour, who liued fiue hundred and twentie and seuen yeres after Christe, and was Emperor of Rome. The constitution is this. We commaunde that <note place="margin">Nouell. Consti. 23.</note> all Byshops and Priestes do celebrate the holye oblation, and the prayers vsed in holye Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, not speakyng lowe, but with a cleare or
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:6498:145"/>
loude voyce, whiche may be heard of the people, that therby the mind of the hearers may be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp with great deuotion in vttering the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Lorde God, for so the holy Apostle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Truely, if thou only blesse or geue thankes in spirite, howe doth he whiche occupyeth the place of the vnlearned, say Amen at thy geuyng of thankes vnto God, for he vnderstandeth not what thou sayest? Thou verily geuest thankes well, but the other is not edified. And agayne in the Epistle to the Romanes, he sayth: With the heart a man beleueth vnto ryghteousnesse, and with the mouth confession is made vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Therefore for these causes it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that among other prayers those thinges also whiche are spoken in the holy oblation, be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and spoken of the moste religious byshoppes and priestes, vnto our Lorde Jesus Christe our God, with the father and the holy ghost, with a loude voyce. And let the most religious priestes knowe this, that if they neglecte any of these thinges, that they shal geue an accompt for them in the dreadfull iudgement of the great God and our sauiour Jesus Christe: Neyther wyll we when we knowe it, rest and leaue it vnreuenged.</p>
            <p>This Emperour (as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> wryteth) fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the byshoppe of Rome, and yet we see ho we playne a decree he maketh for the praying and administring of sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in a knowne tongue, that the deuotion of the hearers might be stirred vp by knowledge, contrary to the iudgement of them that woulde haue ignoraunce to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:6498:146"/>
He maketh it also a matter of dampnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to do these thynges in a tongue that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers vnderstand not. Let vs therefore conclude with God and al good mens assent, that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer or Sacramentes ought to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in a tongue that is not vnderstanded of the hearers. Nowe a worde or two of priuate pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in an vnknowne tongue. We tooke in hande where we began to speake of this matter, not onely to proue that no common prayer or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Sacramentes, ought to be in a tongue vnknowne to the hearers: but also that no person ought to pray priuately in that tongue that he hym selfe vnderstandeth not. Whiche thyng shall not be harde to proue, if we forget not what prayer is. For if prayer be that deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mynde whiche enforceth the heart to lift vp it selfe to God: howe shoulde it be sayde, that that person prayeth, that vnderstandeth not the wordes that his tongue speaketh in prayer? Yea, how can it be sayde that he speaketh? For to speake, is by voyce to vtter the thought of the mynde. And the voyce that a man vttereth in speakyng is nothyng els, but the messenger of the mynde, to bryng abroade the knowledge of that, whiche otherwyse lyeth secret in the heart, and can not be knowne, according to that which Saint Paul wryteth: What man (sayth he) kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2</note> the thynges that apparteyne to man, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng only the spirite of man, which is in man? He therfore that doth not vnderstand the voyces that his tongue doth vtter, can not properly be sayde to speake, but rather to counterfayte, as
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:6498:146"/>
parattes, and suche other byrdes vse to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite mens voyces. No man therefore that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to prouoke the wrath of God agaynst hym selfe, wylbe so bolde to speake of God vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without regarde of reuerent vnderstanding, in his presence, but he wyll prepare his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he presume to speake vnto God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our common prayer the minister doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes say. <hi>Let vs pray,</hi> meanyng thereby to admonishe the people that they shoulde prepare their eares to heare, what he shoulde craue at Gods hand, and their heartes to consent to the same, and their tongues to say Amen at the ende thereof. On this sort dyd the prophet Dauid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his heart, when he sayde: My heart is redy (O God) my heart is redy, I wyll syng and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <note place="margin">Psal. 57.</note> a Psalme. The Jewes also, when in the tyme of <hi>Iudith</hi> they dyd with all their heart pray God to visite his people of Israel, had so prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their heartes before they began to pray. After this sorte had <hi>Manasses</hi> prepared his heart before he prayed, and sayde: And nowe (O Lorde) do I bow the knees of myne heart, asking of thee part <note place="margin">2. Par. 36.</note> of thy mercyful kindnes. When the heart is thus prepared, the voyce vttred from the heart, is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious in the eares of god: otherwyse he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it not to accept it. But forasmuch as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ableth his wordes without sense in the presence of God, sheweth hymselfe not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde the maiestie of hym that he speaketh to: He taketh hym as a contemner of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtie maiestie, and geueth hym his rewarde among hypocrites, whiche make an outwarde
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:6498:147"/>
she we of holynesse, but their heartes are full of abhominable thoughtes, euen in the tyme of their prayers. For it is the heart that the Lorde looketh vppon, as it is wrytten in the historie of <note place="margin">1. Reg. 16.</note> kynges. If we therefore wyll that our prayers be not abhominable before God, let vs so prepare our heartes before we pray, and so vnderstande the thynges that we aske when we pray, that both our heartes and voyces may together sound in the eares of Gods maiestie, and then we shall not fayle to receaue at his hand the thinges that we aske: as good men whiche haue ben before vs dyd, and so haue from tyme to tyme receaued that whiche for their soules health they dyd at any tyme desyre. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> seemeth to <note place="margin">De cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizandis rudibus.</note> beare in this matter: For he sayth thus of them, whiche beyng brought vp in grammer and rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoricke, are conuerted to Christe, and so must be instructed in Christian religion: Let them know also (sayth he) that it is not the voyce, but the affection of the minde that commeth to the eares of God. And so shall it come to passe, that if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they shall marke that some byshoppes or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the Churche do call vppon God, eyther with barbarous wordes, or with wordes disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or that they vnderstande not, or do disorderly diuide the wordes that they pronounce, they shal not laugh them to scorne. Hitherto he seemeth to beare with praying in an vnknowne tongue. But in the next sentence he openeth his mynde thus: Nor for that these thynges ought not to be amended, that the people may say Amen to that whiche they do playnely vnderstande: But yet
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:6498:147"/>
these thyngs must be godly borne withal of these catechistes or instructours of the faith, that they may learne, that as in the common place where matters are pleaded, the goodnesse of an oration consisteth in sounde: so in the Churche it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in deuotion. So that he alloweth not the praying in a tongue not vnderstand of hym that prayeth: But he instructeth the skilfull Oratour, to beare with the rude tongue of the deuout sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple minister. To conclude, if the lacke of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng the wordes that are spoken in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, do make them vnfruitfull to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: How should not the same make the wordes read, vnfruitfull to the reader? The mercyfull goodnesse of God, graunt vs his grace to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym as we ought to do, to his glory and our endlesse felicitie, whiche we shall do, if we humble our selues in his sight, and in all our prayers both common and priuate, haue our myndes fully fixed vpon hym. For the prayer of them that <note place="margin">Eccle. 35.</note> humble them selues, shall pearse through the doudes, and tyll it drawe nygh vnto God, it wyl not be aunswered, and tyll the moste high do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde it, it wyll not departe. And the Lorde wyll not be slacke, but he wyll deliuer the iust, and execute iudgement. To hym therfore be all honour and glory, for euer &amp; euer.</p>

If to knowe God aryght, be an occasion of euyll, then must we needes graunt, that the hearyng, and readyng of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scriptures, is the cause of heresie, carnall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and the subuertion of all good orders. But the knowledge of God, and of our selues, is so farre from beyng an occasion of euill, that it is the redyest, yea, the only meane to brydle car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall libertie, and to kyll all our fleshly affections. And the ordinarie waye to attayne this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is with diligence to heare and reade the holy scriptures. For the whole scriptures (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Saint Paule) were geuen by the inspiration <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> of God. And shall we Christian men thynke to learne the knowledge of God and of our selues, in anye earthly mans worke or wrytyng, sooner or better then in the holy scriptures, wrytten by the inspiration of the holy ghost? The scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were not brought vnto vs by the wyll of man: but holy men of God (as witnesseth Saint Peter) spake as they were moued by the holye spirite of God. The holy ghost is the scholemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <note place="margin">2.

in the sight of God: can we fynde (thinke ye) any better or any suche agayne, as Christe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is, and his doctrine? whose vertuous conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and godly lyfe, the scripture so liuely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and setteth foorth before our eyes, that we beholding that paterne, myght shape and frame our lyues as nigh as may be, agreeable to the perfection of the same: Folow you me (sayth. S. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2</note> Paul) as I folowe Christe. And saint John in his Epistle sayth: Who so abydeth in Christe, must walke euen so as he walked before hym. <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.</note> And where shall we learne the order of Christes lyfe, but in the scripture? Another woulde haue a medicine to heale all diseases and maladies of the minde. Can this be found or gotten other where, then out of Gods owne booke, his sacred scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Christe taught so muche when he sayde to the obstinate Jewes: Search the scriptures, for <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> in them ye thynke to haue eternall lyfe. If the scriptures conteyne in them euerlastyng lyfe, it must nedes folow, that they haue also present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie agaynst all that is an hinderaunce and let vnto eternall lyfe. If we desire the knowledge of heauenly wysedome: why had we rather learne the same of man, then of God hym selfe, who (as saint James sayth) is the geuer of wysedome? <note place="margin">Iacob. 2.</note> Yea, why wyl we not learne it at Christes owne mouth, who promising to be present with his Churche tyll the worldes ende, doth perfourme <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> his promise, in that he is not only with vs by his grace and tender pitie: but also in this that he speaketh presently vnto vs in the holy scriptures, to the great and endlesse comfort of all them that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:6498:149"/>
haue any feelyng of God at all in them. Yea he speaketh nowe in the scriptures more profitably to vs, then he dyd by worde of mouth to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Jewes when he liued with them here vpon earth. For they (I meane the Jewes) coulde ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heare nor see those thynges whiche we may nowe both heare and see, if we wyll bryng with vs those eares and eyes that Christe is hearde and seene with, that is, diligence to heare and reade his holy scriptures, and true fayth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue his most comfortable promises. If one could shewe but the printe of Christes foote, a great number I thynke would fal downe and worship it: But to the holy scriptures, where we may see daily (yf we wyll) I wyll not say the print of his feete onlye, but the whole shape and liuely image of hym, alas we geue litle reuerence or none at all. If any coulde let vs see Christes coate, a sorte of vs woulde make hard shift except we mought come nygh to gase vppon it, yea and kysse it to: And yet all the clothes that euer he dyd weare, can nothyng so truely nor so liuely expresse hym vnto vs, as do the scriptures. Christes images made in wood, stone, or mettall, some men for the loue they beare to Christe, do garnishe and beautifie the same with pearle, golde, and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stone: And shoulde we not (good brethren) muche rather imbrace and reuerence Gods holy bookes, the sacred bible, whiche do represent Christ vnto vs, more truely then can any image? The image can but expresse the fourme or shape of his body, if it can do so muche: But the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth in such sort set foorth Christe, that we
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:6498:150"/>
may see both God and man, we may see hym (I say) speakyng vnto vs, healyng our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diyng for our sinnes, rysing from death for our iustification. And to be short, we may in the scriptures so perfectly see whole Christ with the eye of fayth, as we lacking fayth, coulde not with these bodily eyes see hym, though he stoode now present here before vs. Let euery man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and chylde, therefore with all their hearte, thirst and desyre gods holy scriptures, loue them, embrace them, haue their delight and pleasure in hearing and readyng them, so as at length we may be transfourmed and chaunged into them. For the holy scriptures are Gods treasure house, wherein are found al thynges needefull for vs to see, to heare, to learne, and to beleue, necessarie for the attaynyng of eternall lyfe. Thus muche is spoken, onely to geue you a taste of some of the commodities whiche ye maye take by hearing &amp; reading the holy scriptures. For as I said in the beginning, no tongue is able to declare and vtter all. And although it is more cleare then the noone day, that to be ignorant of the scriptures, is the cause of errour, as Christe sayth to the Saducees: Ye erre, not knowing the scriptures, and that errour doth holde backe, &amp; plucke men <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> away from the knowledge of God. And as saint <hi>Hierome</hi> sayth: Not to know the scriptures, is to be ignoraunt of Christ. Yet this notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, some there be that thynke it not meete for all sortes of men to reade the scriptures, because they are, as they thynke, in sundry places stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng blockes to the vnlearned. Fyrst, for that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:6498:150"/>
the phrase of the scriptures is somtyme so hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, grosse, and playne, that it offendeth the fine and delicate wittes of some courtiers. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, for that the scripture also reporteth, euen of them that haue their commendation to be the children of God, that they did diuers actes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some are contrary to the lawe of nature, some repugnaunt to the law wrytten, and other some seeme to fight manifestly agaynst publique ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie. All whiche thynges (say they) are vnto the simple an occasion of great offence, and cause many to thynke euyl of the Scriptures, and to discredite their aucthoritie. Some are offended at the hearyng and readyng of the diuersitie of the rites and ceremonies of the sacrifices and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the lawe. And some worldly witted men, thynke it a great decay to the quiet and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gouerning of their common weales, to geue eare to the simple and plaine rules and preceptes of our sauiour Christe in his Gospell, as beyng offended, that a man shoulde be redy to turne his right eare, to hym that strake hym on the lefte, and to hym whiche woulde take away his coate, to offer hym also his cloke, with suche other say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges of perfection in Christes meanyng. For carnal reason beyng alway an enemie to God, and not perceauing the thynges of Gods spirite, doth abhorre suche preceptes, whiche yet rightly vnderstanded, infringeth no iudiciall policies, nor Christian mens gouernementes. And some there be, whiche hearyng the scriptures to bid vs to lyue without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:6498:151"/>
Therefore to remoue and put away occasions of offence so muche as may be, I wyll aunswere or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to these obiections. Firste I shall rehearse some of those places that men are offended at, for the homelynes and grossenesse of speach, and wil shewe the meanyng of them. In the booke of Deuteronomie it is wrytten, that almyghtie God made a lawe, yf a man dyed without issue, his brother or next kynsman shoulde marrye his wydowe, and the childe that were firste borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, shoulde be called his chylde that was dead, that the dead mans name myght not be put out in Israel: And if the brother or nexte kynsman would not marry the widow, then she before the magistrates of the Citie shoulde pull of his shoe, and spitte in his face, saying: So be it done to that man that wyll not buylde his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house. Here (dearely beloued) the pullyng of his shoe and spitting in his face, were ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to signifie vnto all the people of that Citie, that the woman was not nowe in faulte that Gods lawe in that poynt was broken, but the whole shame and blame therof did now redound to that man whiche openly before the magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes refused to marry her. And it was not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to hym alone, but to all his posteritie also: For they were called euer after, the house of hym whose shoe is pulled of. Another place out of the Psalmes: I wyl breake (saith Dauid) the hornes of the vngodly, and the hornes of the ryghteous <note place="margin">Psal. 75.</note> shalbe exalted. By anhorne, in the scripture, is vnderstand power, myght, strength, &amp; sometime rule &amp; gouernment. The prophet then saying, I
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:6498:151"/>
wyll breake the hornes of the vngodly, meaneth, that all the power, strength, and myght of Gods enemie, shall not onlye be weakened and made feeble, but shall at length also be cleane broken and destroyed, though for a tyme for the better triall of his people, God suffereth the enemies to preuayle and haue the vpper hande. In the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 132. <note place="margin">Psalm. 132.</note> Psalme it is sayde, I wyll make Dauids horne to florishe. Here Dauids horne signifieth his kyngdome. Almightie God therefore by this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speakyng, promiseth to geue Dauid victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer all his enemies, and to stablishe hym in his kyngdome, spyte of all his enemies. And in the threescore psalme it is wrytten: <hi>Moab</hi> is my <note place="margin">Psalm. 60.</note> washpot, and euer <hi>Edom</hi> wyl I cast out my shoe, &amp;c. In that place the prophete sheweth how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Idumeans,</hi> being two great nations, proude people, stout and mighty, God brought them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and made them seruauntes to the Israelites, seruantes I say, to stowpe downe, to pul of their shoes, and washe their feete. Then <hi>Moab</hi> is my washpot, and ouer <hi>Edom</hi> wyl I cast out my shoe, is as if he had sayde: The <hi>Moabites</hi> and the <hi>Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means,</hi> for all their stoutnesse agaynst vs in the wyldernesse, are now made our subiects, our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, yea vnderlynges to pull of our shoes, and washe our feete.

And though our freendes and kynsfolkes be as deare as our right eyes and our right han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: yet if they woulde plucke vs from God, we ought to renounce them, and forsake them.</p>
               <p>Thus if ye wil be profitable hearers and readers of the holye scriptures, ye must firste denye your selues, and keepe vnder your carnall senses taken by the outward wordes, and searche the inward meaning: reason must geue place to Gods holye spirite, you must submit your worldly wisedome and iudgement, vnto his diuine wysdome and iudgement. Consyder that the scripture, in what straunge fourme soeuer it be pronounced, is the word of the lyuing God. Let that alwayes come to your remembraunce, which is so oft repeated of the prophete Esaias: The mouth of the Lorde (sayth he) hath spoken it, the almighty and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting God, who with his onely worde created heauen and earth, hath decreed it, the Lorde of hoastes, whose wayes are in the Seas, whose pathes are in the deepe waters, that Lorde and God by whose worde all thynges in heauen and in earth are created, gouerned, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, hath so prouided it. The God of Goddes,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:6498:155"/>
and Lorde of all Lordes, yea, God that is God alone, incomprehensible, almyghty, and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, he hath spoken it, it is his worde. It can not therefore be but trueth, whiche proceedeth from the God of all trueth: it can not be but wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and prudently commaunded, what almightie God hath deuysed, how vaynely soeuer through want of grace, we miserable wretches do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and iudge of his most holy worde. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Dauid describing an happye man, sayeth: Blessed is the man that hath not walked after the counsayle of the vngodlye, nor stande in the <note place="margin">Psal. 1.</note> waye of sinners, nor sit in the seate of the scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. There are three sortes of people, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye the prophete would haue him to flee and auoyde, which shall be an happy man, and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Gods blessing. First, he may not walke after the counsayle of the vngodlye. Secondlye, he may not stand in the waye of sinners. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, he muste not sit in the seat of the scornefull. By these three sortes of people, vngodly men, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and scorners, all impietie is signified and fully expressed. By the vngodly, he vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth those which haue no regarde of almightye God, being voyde of all faith, whose heartes &amp; mindes are so set vpon the worlde, that they studie onely howe to accomplishe their worldlye practises, their carnall imaginations, their filthy lust and desyre, without anye feare of God. The seconde sort he calleth sinners, not such as do fal through ignoraunce, or of frailenesse, for then who should be found free? What man euer liued vpon earth (Christe onely excepted) but he hath sinned? The
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:6498:155"/>
iust man falleth seuen times, and ryseth agayne. Though the godly do fall, yet they walke not on <note place="margin">Prou. 24.</note> purposely in sinne, they stande not still to conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and tarye in sinne, they syt not downe like carelesse men, without all feare of Gods iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sinne: but defying sinne, through Gods great grace and infinite mercye, they ryse agayne, and fight agaynste sinne. The Prophete then calleth them sinners whose heartes are cleane turned from God, and whose whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation of lyfe is nothing but sinne, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light so much in the same, that they choose conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to abyde and dwell in sinne. The thyrde sorte he calleth scorners, that is, a sorte of men whose heartes are so stuffed with mallyce, that they are not contented to dwell in sinne, and to leade their lyues in all kynde of wickednesse: but also they do contempne and scorne in other, all godlinesse, true religion, all honestie and vertue. Of the two first sortes of men, I will not say but they may take repentaunce, and be conuerted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Of the third sort, I thinke I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger of gods iudgement pronounce, that neuer anye yet conuerted vnto God by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, but continued on still in their abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wyckednesse, heaping vp to them selues damnation, agaynst the day of Gods ineuitable iudgement. Examples of such scorners, we reade in the seconde booke of Chronicles: When the good kyng <hi>Ezechias,</hi> in the beginnyng of his <note place="margin">2. Par. 30.</note> raygne, had destroyed idolatrie, purged the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and refourmed religion in his Realme, he sent messengers into euerye Citie, to gather the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:6498:156"/>
people vnto Hierusalem, to solemnize the feast of Easter, in such sort as God had appoynted. The postes went from citie to citie, through the land of Ephraim and Manasses, euen vnto Zabulon. And what did the people thinke ye? Did they laude and prayse the name of the Lorde whiche had geuen them so good a kinge, so zelous a Prince to abolish idolatrie, and to restore againe Gods true religion? No, no. The scripture say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, The people laughed them to scorne, and mocked the kynges messengers. And in the laste Chapter of the same booke it is written, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtie God, hauing compassion vppon his people, sent his messengers the Prophetes vnto them, to call them from their abhominable ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and wicked kinde of liuing. But they moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his messengers, they dispised his wordes, &amp; misused his Prophetes, vntill the wrathe of the Lord arose against his people, and till there was no remedie: For he gaue them vp into the hands of their enemies, euen vnto Nabucodonozar kyng of Babilon, who spoiled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their goods, brent their citie, and led them, their wyues, and their children, captiues vnto Babylon. The wicked people that were in the dayes of Noe, made but a mocke at the worde of God, when Noe tolde them that God woulde take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce vppon them for their sinnes. The fludde therefore came sodainely vpon them, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with the whole worlde. Lot preached to the Sodomites, that except they repented, both they and their Citie shoulde be destroyed. They thought his sayings impossible to be true,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:6498:156"/>
they scorned and mocked his admonition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted him as an olde doting foole. But when God by his holy angels had taken Lot, his wyfe and two daughters from among them, he raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downe fyre and brymstone from heauen, and brent vp those scorners and mockers of his holye worde. And what estimation had Christes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine among the Scribes and Pharisees? What rewarde had he among them? The Gospell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth thus: The Pharisees whiche were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous did scorne him in his doctrine. O then ye see that worldly riche men scorne the doctrine of their saluation. The worldly wyse men scorne the doctrine of Christe, as foolishenesse to their vnderstanding. These scorners haue euer ben, and euer shal be to the worldes ende. For Saint Peter prophesied, that suche scorners shoulde be <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> in the worlde before the latter daye. Take heede therefore (my brethren) take heede, be ye not scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Gods most holy worde, prouoke him not to powre out his wrath now vpon you, as he did then vppon those gybers and mockers. Be not wilfull murderers of your owne soules. Turne vnto God whyle there is yet tyme of mercye, ye shall els repent it in the worlde to come, when it shal be to late, for there shall be iudgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy. This might suffise to admonishe vs, and cause vs henceforth to reuerence Gods holy scriptures, but all men haue not faith. This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shal not satisfy and content al mens mindes: but as some are carnal, so they will stil continue, &amp; abuse the scriptures carnally, to their greater dampnation. The vnlearned and vnstable (saith
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:6498:157"/>
saint Peter) paruerte the holy scriptures to their owne destruction. Jesus Christ, as (saint Paul <note place="margin">ii. Pet. ii.</note> sayth) is to the Jewes an offence, to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles foolishnesse: But to Gods children, as wel <note place="margin">i. Cor. i.</note> of the Jewes as of the Gentiles, he is the power and wisdome of God. The holy man <hi>Simeon</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <note place="margin">Luke. ii.</note> that he is set foorth for the fall and rysing againe of many in Israel. As Christe Jesus is a fall to the reprobate, which yet perishe through their owne default: So is his worde, yea the whole booke of God, a cause of dampnation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, through their incredulitie. And as he is a rysing vp to none other then those whiche are Gods children by adoption: So is his worde, yea the whole scripture, the power of God to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to them onelye that do beleue it. Christe him selfe, the Prophetes before him, the apostles after him, all the true ministers of Gods holye worde, yea euery worde in Gods booke, is vnto the reprobate, the sauour of death vnto death. Christ Jesus, the prophetes, the apostles, and all the true ministers of his worde, yea euery iot and title in the holy scripture, haue ben, is, and shal be for euermore, the sauour of lyfe vnto eternall lyfe, vnto all those whose heartes God hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by true fayth. Let vs earnestlye take heede, that we make no iesting stocke of the bookes of holy scriptures. The more obscure and darke the sayinges be to our vnderstanding, the further let vs thinke our selues to be from God and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye spirite, who was the aucthour of them. Let vs with more reuerence endeuour our selues to searche out the wisdome hidden in the outwarde
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:6498:157"/>
barke of the scripture. If we can not vnderstand the sense and the reason of the saying, yet let vs not be scorners, iesters, and deryders, for that is the vttermost token and shewe of a reprobate, of a playne enemie to God and his wysdome. They be not ydle fables to iest at, whiche God doth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslye pronounce, and for serious matters let vs esteeme them. And though in sundrye places of the scriptures, be set out diuers rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, oblations, &amp; sacrifices: let vs not thynke straunge of them, but referre them to the tymes and people for whom they serued, although yet to learned men they be not vnprofitable to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydered, but to be expounded as figures and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of thinges and persons, afterwarde open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye reuealed in the new Testament. Though the rehearsall of the genealogies &amp; petegrees of the fathers, be not to much edification of the playne ignoraunt people: yet is there nothyng so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partinently vttered in all the whole booke of the Byble, but may serue to spirituall purpose in some respecte, to all suche as will bestowe theyr labours to searche out the meanynges. These may not be condemned, because they serue not to our vnderstandyng, nor make not to our edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. But let vs turne our labour to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, and to cary away suche sentences and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as be more fyt for our capacitie and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And wheras we reade in diuers Psalmes, how Dauid did wyshe to the aduersaries of god sometymes shame, rebuke, and confusion, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme the decay of theyr ofspryng and issue, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that they might peryshe and come sodaynly
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:6498:158"/>
to destruction, as he did wishe to the Captaynes of the Philistians: Cast forth (sayth he) thy lyghtening and teare them, shoote out thyne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and consume them, with such other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Psal. 144.</note> of imprecations: Yet ought we not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at suche prayers of Dauid, being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete as he was, singulerly beloued of God, and rapte in spirite, with an ardent zeale to gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. He spake them not of a priuate hatred, and in a stomake against their persons: But wyshed spirituallye the destruction of suche corrupt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and vyces, whiche raygned in all diuilishe persons, set agaynst God. He was of lyke mynd as saint Paule was, when he did deliuer <hi>Hime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> with the notorious fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, to Satan, to their temporal confusion, that their spirite might be saued against the daye of the Lord. And when Dauid did professe in some places that he hated the wicked: yet in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Psalmes he professeth, that he hated them with a perfect hate, not with a malitious hate, to the hurt of the soule. Whiche perfection of spirite, because it can not be perfourmed in vs, so corrupted in affections as we be, we ought not to vse in our priuate causes the lyke wordes in fourme, for that we cannot fulfil the like wordes in sense. Let vs not therefore be offended, but searche out the reason of such wordes before we be offended, that we may the more reuerentlye iudge of such sayinges, though straunge to our carnall vnderstandinges, yet to them that be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded, iudged to be zelously and godlye pronounced. God therefore for his mercies sake,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:6498:158"/>
vouchsafe to purifie our myndes through fayth in his sonne Jesus Christ, and to instill the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly droppes of his grace into our harde stonye heartes to supple the same, that we be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners &amp; deriders of his infallible worde: but that with all humblenes of minde and Christian reuerence, we may endeuour our selues to heare and to reade his sacred scriptures, and inwardly so to digest them, as shall be to the comfort of our soules, and sanctification of his holye name, to whom with the sonne and the holy ghost, three persons and one lyuing God be al laude, honor, and prayse, for euer, and euer.</p>

For so doth the holy ghost testifie vnto vs by the wyse man, saying, He that hath pitie vpon the poore, lendeth vnto the lord <note place="margin">Prou. 10.</note> him selfe.

For thus he saith to the charitable almes geuers, when he sitteth as iudge in the doome, to geue sentence of euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accordyng to his desartes: Uerylye I saye vnto you, whatsoeuer good &amp; mercifull deede you did <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> vpon any of the least of these my brethren, ye did the same vnto me.

ye visited them being sicke or in prison, ye visited me. For as he that receaueth a Princes imbassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and entertayneth them wel, doth honour the Prince, from whom those imbassadours do come: So he that receaueth the poore and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and helpeth them in their affliction and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, doth thereby receaue and honour Christe their maister, who as he was poore and needye him selfe, whylest he lyued here amongst vs, to worke the mysterie of our saluation, so at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture hence, he promised in his steede, to sende vnto vs those that were poore, by whose meanes his absence should be supplied: and therfore that we would do vnto him, we muste do vnto them. And for this cause doth almyghtye God say vnto Moyses, The land wherin you dwell, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be without poore men: because he woulde <note place="margin">Deut. 15.</note> haue continual trial of his people, whether they loued him or no, that in shewing them selues o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto his will, they might certaynlye as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them selues of his loue and fauour towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des them, and nothing doubte, but that as his lawe and ordinaunces (wherein he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them that they shoulde open their hande vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their brethren that were poore and needye in the lande) were accepted of them, and willingly perfourmed: So he woulde on his part louyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept them, and truely perfourme his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that he had made vnto them. The holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and disciples of Christ, who by reason of his dayly conuersation, saw by his deedes, and heard in his doctrine, how much he tendered the poore: the godly fathers also, that were both before and

since Christ, indued without doubt with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost, and most certaynly certified of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wil: they both do most earnestly exhort vs, and in all their wrytinges almost, continually admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe vs, that we woulde remember the poore, and bestowe our charitable aimes vppon them. Saint Paul cryeth vnto vs after this sort, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <note place="margin">i. Thes. v.</note> the feeble mynded, lift vp the weake, and be charitable toward all men. And agayne, To do <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> good to the poore, and to distribute aimes glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, see that thou do not forget, for with such sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices God is pleased. Esai the Prophete teacheth <note place="margin">Esai. liii.</note> on this wyse, Deale thy bread to the hungrye, and bring the poore wandering, home to thy house. When thou seest the naked, see thou cloth him, and hyde not thy face from thy poore neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, neyther despise thou thyne owne fleshe. And the holy father Tobi geueth this councell, <note place="margin">Tobi. iiii.</note> Geue almes (sayeth he) of thine owne goodes, and turne neuer thy face from the poore, eate thy bread with the hungry, and couer the naked with thy clothes. And the learned and godly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Chrisostome</hi> geueth this admonition, Let <note place="margin">Ad pop. Anto. Hom. 35.</note> mercifull almes be alwayes with vs, as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, as mindefull as we will be to put our garmentes vpon vs, to couer our nakednes, to defende vs from the colde, and to shewe our selues comely: So mindfull let vs be at al times and seasons, that we geue almes to the poore, &amp; shewe our selues mercifull towardes them. But what meane these often admonitions &amp; ernest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of the prophetes, apostles, fathers, &amp; holy doctours? Surely, as they were faythful to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:6498:161"/>
Godwarde, and therefore discharged their dutie truely, in telling vs what was Gods wyl: so of a singuler loue to vs ward, they laboured not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to infourme vs, but also to perswade with vs, that to geue almes, and to succour the poore and needie, was a very acceptable thing, and an high sacrifice to god, wherin he greatly delighted, and had a singuler pleasure. For so doeth the wyse man the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> teach vs, saying: Who <note place="margin">Eccle. 33.</note> so is mercifull and geueth almes, he offereth the right thanke offring. And he addeth thereunto: The ryght thanke offering, maketh the aulter fat, and a sweete smell it is before the hyghest, it is acceptable before God, and shall neuer be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. And the trueth of this doctrine is very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the examples of those holy and charitable fathers, of whom we reade in the scriptures, that they were geuen to mercifull compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the poore, &amp; charitable releeuing of their necessities. Such a one was Abraham, in whom God had so great pleasure, that he vouchsafed to come vnto him in fourme of an Angell, and to be intertayned of him at his house. Such was his kinseman Lot, whom God so fauoured for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing his messengers into his house, whiche otherwyse should haue layne in the streete, that he saued him with his whole familie, from the destruction of Sodome and Gomorra. Suche were the holy fathers Job and Toby, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, who felte most sensible profes of Gods especiall loue towardes them. And as all these by their mercifulnes and tender compassion which they shewed to the miserable afflicted membres
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:6498:161"/>
of Christe, in the releeuing, helpyng, and succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them with their temporall goodes in this life, obteyned gods fauour, &amp; were deare, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and pleasaunt in his sight: so now they them selues take pleasure in the fruition of God, in the pleasaunt ioyes of heauen, and are also in Gods eternall worde set before vs, as perfect examples euer before our eyes, both howe we shall please God in this mortall lyfe, and also howe we may come to lyue in ioy with them in euerlastyng pleasure &amp; felicitie. For moste true is that saying whiche. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath, that the geuing of almes and releuing of the poore, is the right way to heauen, <hi>Via coeli pauper est:</hi> The poore man (sayth he) is the way to heauen. They vsed in tymes past, to set in hye wayes sides, the picture of <hi>Mercury,</hi> poyntyng with his fynger, whiche was the ryght way to the towne. And we vse in crosse wayes to set vp a wodden or stone crosse, to admonishe the trauailing man whiche way he muste turne when he commeth thither, to direct his iourney aright. But Gods worde (as. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> sayth) hath set in the way to heauen the poore man &amp; his house, so that who so wyl go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryght thyther, and not turne out of the way, muste go by the poore. The poore man is that <hi>Mercury</hi> that shall set vs the redy way? and if we loke well to this marke, we shal not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der much out of the ryght path. The maner of wise world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men amongst vs is, that if they knowe a man of meaner estate then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to be in fauour with the prince, or any other noble man, whom they eyther feare or loue, suche a one they wyl be
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:6498:162"/>
glad to benefite &amp; pleasure, that when they haue neede, they may become their spokes man, either to obteyne a commoditie, or to escape a displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Nowe surely it ought to be a shame to vs, that worldly men for temporall thinges that last but for a season, should be more wise &amp; prouident in procuring them, then we in heauenly. Our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ testifieth of poore men, that they are deare vnto him, &amp; that he loueth them especially: For he calleth them his litle ones, by a name of tender loue, he sayth they be his brethren. And saint James sayth, that god hath chosen them to be the heires of his kyngdome. Hath not God <note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> (sayth he) chosen the poore of this worlde to hym selfe, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereafter the rich heires of that kyngdome which he hath promised to them that loue hym? And we knowe that the prayer which they make for vs, shalbe acceptable and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, their complaynt shalbe hearde also. Thereof doth Jesus the sonne of Sirach cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely assure vs, saying: If the poore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne <note place="margin">Eccle. 4,</note> of thee in the bitternesse of his soule, his prayer shalbe heard, euen he that made hym shall heare hym. Be curteous therfore vnto the poore. We knowe also, that he who acknowledgeth him selfe to be their maister and patrone, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth not to take them for his seruantes, is both able to pleasure and displeasure vs, and that we stande euery houre in neede of his helpe. Why shoulde we then be eyther negligent or vnwyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to procure their frendship and fauour, by the whiche also we may be assured to get his fauour that is both able &amp; wyllyng to do vs all pleasures
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:6498:162"/>
that are for our commoditie and wealth? Christe doth declare by this, how much he accepteth our charitable affection toward the poore, in that he promiseth a rewarde vnto them that geue but a cup of cold water in his name to them that haue neede thereof, and that rewarde is the kingdome of heauen. No doubt is it therfore that god regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth highly, that which he rewardeth so liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. For he that promiseth a princely recompence, for a beggerly beneuolence, declareth that he is more delighted with the geuyng, then with the gyfte, and that he as muche esteemeth the doyng of the thyng, as the fruite and commoditie that commeth of it. Who so therefore hath hytherto neglected to geue almes, let hym know that God now requireth it of him, &amp; he that hath ben libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the poore, let him knowe that his godly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are accepted, &amp; thankfully take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at gods han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, which he wyll requite with double &amp; treble. For so sayth the wyse man: He whiche sheweth mercie to the poore, doth lay his money in banke to the Lorde, for a large interest and gayne. The gayne beyng cheefely the possession of the lyfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastyng, through the merites of our sauiour Jesus Christe, to whom with the father &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost, be al honour and glory for euer.</p>

Our sauiour Christe in the Gospell teacheth vs, that it profiteth a man nothyng to haue in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> al the ryches of the whole worlde, and the wealth or glory thereof, if in the meane season he lose his soule, or do that thing whereby it should become captiue vnto death, sinne, &amp; hell fire. By the which saying, he not only instructeth vs how muche the soule health is to be preferred before worldly commodities: but also serueth to stirre vp our myndes, and to pricke vs forwardes to seeke diligently and learne by what meanes we may preserue and kepe our soules euer in safety, that is, howe we may recouer our health, if it be lost or impayred, and how it may be defended and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:6498:163"/>
maynteyned, if we once haue it. Yea, he teacheth vs also thereby to esteeme that as a precious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine and an inestimable iewel, that hath suche strength and vertue in it, that can either procure or preserue so incomparable a treasure. For if we greatly regard that medicine or salue that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heale sundrye and greeuous diseases of the body: muche more wyll we esteeme that whiche hath lyke power ouer the soule. And because we might be better assured, both to knowe and haue in redynesse that so profitable a remedye: he as a most faythfull and louyng teacher, sheweth hym selfe both what it is, and where we may fynde it, and how we may vse and applye it. For when <note place="margin">Luk. 11.</note> both he and his disciples were greuously accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the Pharisees, to haue defyled their soules in breakyng the constitutions of the elders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they went to meate and washed not their handes before, accordyng to the custome of the Jewes: Christe aunswering their superstitious complaynte, teacheth them an especiall remedye howe to keepe cleane their soules, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the breache of suche superstitious orders. Geue almes (sayth he) and beholde all thynges are cleane vnto you. He teacheth them, that to be mercyful and charitable in helping the poore, is the meanes to keepe the soule pure and cleane in the syght of God. We are taught therefore by this, that mercyfull almes dealyng, is profitable to purge the soule from the infection and filthie spottes of sinne. The same lesson doth the holy ghost also teache in sundrye places of the scripture, saying: Mercyfulnesse and almes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Tobi. 4.</note>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:6498:164"/>
purgeth from all synnes, and delyuereth from death, and suffereth not the soule to come into darknes. A great confidence may they haue before the hygh God, that shewe mercie and compassion to them that are afflicted. The wyse preacher the sonne of Sirach confirmeth the <note place="margin">Eccle. 5.</note> same, when he sayth, That as water quencheth burning fyre, euen so mercie and almes resisteth and reconcileth synnes. And sure it is, that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulnesse quayleth the heate of synne so muche, that they shall not take holde vpon man to hurt him, or if ye haue by any infirmitie and weaknes ben touched and annoyed with them, straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes shall mercyfulnesse wipe and washe them away, as salues and remedies to heale their sores and greeuous diseases. And therupon that holy father <hi>Ciprian</hi> taketh good occasion to exhort earnestly to the mercyfull worke of geuyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and helpyng the poore, and there he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth to consider how holesome and profitable it is to releeue the needy and help the afflicted, by the which we may purge our synnes, and heale our wounded soules.</p>
               <p>But here some wyll say vnto me, If almes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, and our charitable workes towardes the poore, be able to washe away synnes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile vs to God, to delyuer vs from the peryll of damnation, and make vs the sonnes &amp; heires of Gods kingdome: then is Christes merites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and his blood shed in vayne, then are we iustified by workes, and by our deedes may we merite heauen, then do we in vayne beleue that Christ dyed for to put away our synnes, and that
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:6498:164"/>
he rose for our iustification, as saint Paule teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But ye shall vnderstande (dearely beloued) that neither those places of scripture before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, neither the doctrine of the blessed martyr <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> neither any other godly and learned man, when they in extolling the dignitie, profite, fruit, and effect of vertuous and liberall almes, do say that it washeth away synnes, and bryngeth vs to the fauour of God, do meane that our worke and charitable deede, is the originall cause of our acception before God, or that for the dignitie or worthynesse thereof, our sinnes may be washed away, and we purged &amp; cleansed of al the spottes of our iniquitie: for that were in deede to deface Christ, and to defraud him of his glorie. But they meane this, and this is the vnderstandyng of those and suche lyke sayinges: That God of his mercie and especial fauour towards them whom he hath appoynted to euerlastyng saluation, hath so offred his grace especially, and they haue so receaued it fruitfully, that although by reason of their sinfull lyuyng outwardly, they seemed before to haue ben the children of wrath and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet nowe the spirite of God mightily workyng in them, vnto obedience to Gods wyll and commaundementes, they declare by their outward deedes and lyfe, in the shewyng of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and charitie (which can not come but of the spirite of God and his especiall grace) that they are the vndoubted chyldren of God appoynted to euerlastyng lyfe. And so, as by their wyckednesse and vngodly lyuyng, they shewed them selues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the iudgement of men, which folowe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:6498:165"/>
the outward appearaunce, to be reprobates and castawayes: So nowe by their obedience vnto Gods holy wyll, and by their mercyfulnesse and tender pitie (wherin they shew them selues to be lyke vnto God, who is the fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>yne and spryng of all mercye) they declare openly and manyfestly vnto the sight of men, that they are the sonnes of God, and elect of hym vnto saluation. For as the good fruite is not the cause that the tree is good, but the tree must firste be good before it can bryng foorth good fruite: so the good deedes of man are not the cause that maketh man good, but he is firste made good by the spirite and grace of God that effectually worketh in hym, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde he bryngeth foorth good fruites. And then as the good fruite doth argue the goodnesse of the tree, so doth the good and mercyfull deede of the man, argue and certainely proue the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of hym that doth it, accordyng to Christes sayinges: Ye shall knowe them by their fruites. And if any man wyl obiect, that euil and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men do sometymes by their deedes appeare to be very godly and vertuous: I wyll aunswere, so doth the crab and choke peare seeme outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue sometyme as fayre a redde, and as melow a colour, as the fruite whiche is good in deede. But he that wyl byte and take a taste, shall easily iudge betwixt the sower bytternesse of the one, and the sweete sauorines of the other. And as the true christian man, in thankfulnesse of his heart, for the redemption of his soule pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by Christes death, sheweth kyndly by the fruite of his fayth, his obedience to God: so the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:6498:165"/>
other, as a marchaunt with God, doth all for his owne gayne, thynking to win heauen by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of his workes, and so defaceth and obscureth the pryce of Christes blood, who only wrought our purgation. The meanyng then of these sayinges in the scriptures and other holy wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges: <hi>Almes deedes do washe away our sinnes, and, mercie to the poore doth blot out our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> is, that we doing these thynges accordyng to Gods wyl &amp; our duetie, haue our sinnes in deede washed away, and our offences blotted out: not for the worthinesse of them, but by the grace of God which worketh al in al, and that for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that God hath made to them that are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto his commaundement, that he which is the trueth, might be iustified in perfourming the trueth, due to his true promise. Almes deedes do wash away our sinnes, because god doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe then to repute vs as cleane and pure, when we do them for his sake, and not because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue or merite our purgyng, or for that they haue anye suche strength and vertue in them selues. I know that some men, to much addict to the aduauncing of their good workes, will not be contented with this aunswere: &amp; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, for suche men can no aunswere content nor suffice. Wherfore leauing them to their owne wylful sense, we wyll rather haue regarde to the reasonable and godly, who as they most certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and perswade them selues, that al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, al bountie, al mercy, al benefites, al forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of sinnes, &amp; whatsoeuer can be named good and profitable, either for the body or for the soule,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:6498:166"/>
do come only of Gods mercie and mere fauour, &amp; not of them selues: So though they do neuer so many &amp; so excellent good deedes, yet are they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pufte vp with the vayne confidence of them. And though they heare and reade in gods word, and other where in godly mens workes, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes deedes, mercy, and charitablenes, doth wash away sinne, and blot out iniquitie: yet do they not arrogantly and proudly sticke and trust vnto them, or bragge them selues of them, as the proud Pharisee did, lest with the Pharisee they shoulde be condemned: but rather with the humble and poore Publicane, confesse them selues sinfull wretches, vnworthye to looke vp to heauen, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng and crauyng for mercie, that with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane they may be pronounced of Christ to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified. The godly do learne that when the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures saye, that by good and mercifull workes we are reconciled to Gods fauour: we are taught then to knowe what Christe by his intercession and mediation obteyneth for vs of his father when we be obedient to his wyl, yea they learne in such maners of speakyng a comfortable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods singuler fauour and loue, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth that vnto vs and to our doynges, that he by his spirite worketh in vs, and through his grace procureth for vs. And yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng, they crye out with saint Paule, Oh wretches that we are: &amp; acknowledge (as Christe teacheth) that when they haue all done, they are but vnprofitable seruauntes: &amp; with the blessed kyng Dauid, in respect of the iust iudgementes of God, they do tremble, and say: Who shalbe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:6498:166"/>
able to abide it Lorde, if thou wylt geue sentence accordyng to our desertes? Thus they humble them selues, and are exalted of God: they count them selues vyle, and of God are counted pure and cleane: they condemne them selues, and are iustified of God: they thinke them selues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the earth, and of God are thought worthy of heauen. Thus of Gods worde are they truely taught how to thynke ryghtly of mercyfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of almes, and of Gods especial mercie and goodnesse are made partakers of those fruites that his word hath promised. Let vs then folowe their examples, and both shew obediently in our lyfe those workes of mercie that we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and haue that ryght opinion &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that we are taught, and we shal in lyke maner as they, be made partakers, and feele the fruites and rewardes that folowe such godly lyuyng, so shall we knowe by proofe what profite and commoditie doth come of geuyng of almes, and succouring of the poore.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue alredye hearde two partes of this treatise of almes deedes. The fyrste howe pleasaunt and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before God the doyng of them is, the second, how muche it behoueth vs, and how profitable it is to apply
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:6498:167"/>
our selues vnto them. Nowe in the thirde parte wyll I take away that let that hindereth manye from doyng them. There be many, that when they heare how acceptable a thyng in the syght of God the geuing of almes is, and howe muche God extendeth his fauour towardes them that are mercyfull, and what fruites and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doth come to them by it, they wishe very gladly with them selues that they also myght obteyne these benefites, and be counted suche of God as whom he woulde loue or do for. But yet these men are with greedy couetousnesse, so pulde backe that they wyl not bestowe one halfe peny, or one shiue of bread, that they might be thought worthie of Gods benefites, and so to come into his fauour. For they are euermore fearefull, and doubting, least by often geuing, although it wer but a litle at a tyme, they shoulde consume their goodes, and so impouerishe them selues, that euen them selues at the length shoulde not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lyue, but shoulde be dryuen to begge, and lyue of other mens almes. And thus they seeke excuses to withhold them selues from the fauour of God, and choose with pinchyng couetousnes, rather to leane vnto the deuill, then by charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercyfulnesse, eyther to come vnto Christe, or to suffer Christe to come vnto them. Oh that we had some cunning and skilful phisition that wer able to purge them of this so pestilent an humor, that so sore infecteth, not their bodies, but their myndes, and so by corrupting their soules, bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth their bodyes and soules into daunger of hell fire. Nowe least there be anye suche among vs
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:6498:167"/>
(dearely beloued) let vs diligently search for that phisition, whiche is Jesus Christe, and earnestly labour that of his mercie he wyll truely instruct vs, and geue vs a present remedie agaynst so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous a disease. Hearken then, whosoeuer thou art that fearest least by geuyng to the poore thou shouldest bryng thy selfe to beggery. That which thou takest from thy selfe to bestowe vpon Christ, can neuer be consumed &amp; wasted away. Wherein thou shalt not beleue me, but if thou haue fayth, and be a true Christian, beleue the holy ghost, geue credite to the aucthoritie of Gods worde that thus teacheth. For thus sayth the holy ghost by Salomon: He that geueth vnto the poore, shal neuer want. Men suppose that by hoording and laying vp styll, they shall at length be riche, and that by distributing and laying out, although it be for moste necessarie and godly vses, they shalbe brought to pouertie. But the holy ghost, which knoweth all trueth, teacheth vs another lesson, contrary to this. He teacheth vs that there is a kynde of dispendyng that shall neuer diminishe the stocke, and a kynde of sauing that shall bryng a man to extreame pouertie. For where he sayth, that the good almes man shall neuer haue scars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, he addeth: But he that turneth away his eies from such as be in necessitie, shal suffer great pouertie him selfe. Howe farre different then is the iudgement of man, from the iudgement of the holy ghost? The holy Apostle Paul, a man ful of the holy ghost, and made priuie euen of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete wyll of God, teacheth: that the liberall almes geuer, shall not thereby be impouerished.

He that ministreth (saith he) seed vnto the sower, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.</note> wil minister also bread vnto you for foode, yea, he wyl multiplie your seede and encrease the fruites of your ryghteousnesse. He is not content here to aduertise them that they shall not lacke, but he sheweth them also after what sorte God wyl pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them. Euen as he prouideth seede for the sower in multipliyng it &amp; geuing great encrease: so he wyl multiplie their goodes, &amp; encrease them that there shalbe great aboundaunce. And least we should thynke his sayinges to be but wordes and not trueth, we haue an example thereof in the thirde booke of kynges, which doth confirme and seale it vp as a moste certayne trueth. The poore widow that receaued the banished prophet of God Elias, when as she had but an handful of meale in a vessell, and a litle oyle in a cruse, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of she would make a cake for her selfe and her son, that after that they had eaten that, they myght dye, because in that great famine there was no more foode to be gotten: yet when she gaue parte therof vnto Elias, &amp; defrauded her owne hungry belly, mercifully to releeue hym, she was so bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of God, that neyther the meale nor the oyle was consumed all the tyme whyle that famine dyd laste, but therof both the prophet Elias, she, &amp; her son were sufficiently norished &amp; had enough. Oh consider this example ye vnbeleuing &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les couetous persons, who discredit Gods word, and think his power diminished. This poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in the time of an extreame &amp; long dearth, had but one handfull of meale and a litle cruse of oyle, her onlye sonne was redy to perishe before
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:6498:168"/>
her face for hunger, and she her selfe lyke to pyne away: and yet when the poore prophet came and asked part, she was so myndfull of mercyfulnesse, that she forgat her owne misery, and rather then she woulde omit the occasion geuen to geue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, &amp; worke a worke of ryghteousnes, she was content presentlye to hazarde her owne and her sonnes life. And you who haue great plenty of meates and drynkes, great store of motheaten apparell, yea, many of you great heapes of gold &amp; syluer, and he that hath least, hath more then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, nowe in this time, when (thankes be to God) no great famine doth oppresse you, your chyldren being wel clothed and wel fed, &amp; no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death for famine to be feared: will rather cast doubtes &amp; perils of vnlikely penury, then you wyl part with any peece of your superfluities, to helpe to feed and succour the poore, hungry, &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Christe, that commeth to your doores a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. This poore and seely wydowe neuer cast doubtes in al her miserie what want she her selfe should haue, she neuer distrusted the promise that god made to her by the prophet, but straightway went about to releeue the hungry prophete of god, yea preferring his necessitie before her own. But we, lyke vnbeleeuing wretches, before we wil geue one mite, we wyl cast a thousand doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of daunger, whether that wyll stand vs in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stead that we geue to the poore, whether we should not haue need of it at any other time, and whether here it would not haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bestowed. So that it is more hard to wrench a strong nayle (as the prouerbe sayth) out of a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:6498:169"/>
poste, then to wryng a farthyng out of our fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. There is neyther the feare nor the loue of God before our eyes, we wyl more esteme a mite, then we either desire gods kingdome, or feare the deuils dungeon. Hearken therfore ye mercylesse misers, what wyl be the end of this your vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyful dealyng. As certaynly as God norished this poore wydowe in the tyme of famine, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased her litle store, so that she had enough, and felt no penurie when other pyned away: so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly shall God plague you with pouertie in the middest of plenty. Then when other haue abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce and be fed at full, you shall vtterly waste and consume away your selues, your store shalbe destroyed, your goodes pluckt from you, all your glory and wealth shall perishe: and that whiche when you had, you myght haue enioyed your selfe in peace, and might haue bestowed vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most godly, ye shal seke with sorow &amp; sighes, and no where shall find it. For your vnmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towardes other, ye shall finde no man that will shew mercy towardes you. You that had sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heartes towardes other, shal finde all the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures of god to youward as hard as bras, &amp; iron. Alas what furie and madnesse doth possesse our myndes, that in a matter of trueth &amp; certayntie, we wyll not geue credite to the trueth, testifying vnto that which is most certayne. Christe sayth, that if we wyl first seeke the kyngdome of God, &amp; do the workes of righteousnes therof, we shal not be left destitute, al other thinges shalbe geuen to vs plenteously. Nay say we, I wil first looke that I be able to lyue my selfe, and be sure that I haue
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:6498:169"/>
enough for me and mine, and if I haue anything ouer, I wil bestowe it to get Gods fauour, &amp; the poore shal then haue part with me. See I pray you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peruerse iudgement of men, we haue more care to norishe the carcasse, then we haue feare to see our soule perishe. And as <hi>Ciprian</hi> sayth, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest we stande in doubt least our goodes fayle, in <note place="margin">Sermon. de Elemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina.</note> being ouer liberall, we put it out of doubt that our life &amp; health faileth, in not being liberall at al. Whilest we are carefull for diminishing of our stocke, we are altogether carelesse to diminishe our selues. We loue Mammon, &amp; lose our soules. We feare least our patrimonie shoulde perishe from vs, but we feare not lest we shoulde perishe for it. Thus do we peruersly loue that we should hate, and hate that we shoulde loue, we be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent where we should be careful, &amp; careful wher we nede not. This vaine feare to lacke our selues if we geue to the poore, is muche like the feare of children &amp; fooles, which when they see the bright glimmering of a glasse, they do imagine straight way that it is the lightning, &amp; yet the brightnes of a glasse neuer was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lightning. Euen so, when we imagine that by spending vppon the poore, a man maye come to pouertie, we are cast into a vaine fare, for we neuer heard or knewe that by that meanes any man came to miserie, and was left destitute, and not consydered of god. Nay we reade to the contrary in the scripture (as I haue before shewed, &amp; as by infinite testimonies and examples maye be proued) that whosoeuer ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth God faithfully and vnfaignedly in any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, god wil not suffer him to decay, much lesse
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:6498:170"/>
to perish. The holy ghost teacheth vs by <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 10.</note> that the Lorde wyll not suffer the soule of the ryghteous to perishe for hunger. And therefore Dauid sayth vnto all them that are merciful: O feare the Lorde ye that be his saintes, for they that feare hym lacke nothyng. The Lions do lacke and suffer hunger: but they which seeke the Lord shal want no maner of thing that is good. When <hi>Elias</hi> was in the desart, god fed him by the ministerie of a Rauen, that euenyng &amp; morning brought him sufficient victuals. When <hi>Daniel</hi> was shut vp in the Lions denne, God prepared meate for him, &amp; sent it thither to him. And there was the saying of Dauid fulfilled: The Lions <note place="margin">

                     </gap>. Reg. 17.</note> do lacke &amp; suffer hunger, but they which seeke the Lorde, shall want no good thing. For whyle the Lions which should haue ben fed with his flesh, roared for hunger &amp; desire of their pray, whereof they had no power, although it were present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: he in the meane tyme was freshe fed from God, that should with his fleshe haue filled the Lions. So mightily doth God worke to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue &amp; mainteine those whom he loueth, so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is he also to feede them who in anye state or vocation do vnfaignedly serue him. And shal we nowe thinke that he wylbe vnmyndfull of vs, yf we be obedient to his worde, &amp; accordyng to his wyl haue pitie vpon the poore? He geueth vs all wealth, before we do any seruice for it: and wyll be see vs lacke necessaries when we do hym true seruice? Can a man thinke that he that feedeth Christe, can be forsaken of Christe, and left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out foode? Or wyl Christe denie earthly thinges,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6498:170"/>
vnto them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he promiseth heauenly thinges for his true seruice? It can not be therfore (deare brethren) that by geuing of almes we shoulde at any time want our selues, or that we whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue other mens neede, shoulde ourselues be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with penurie. It is contrarye to Gods worde, it repugneth with his promise, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst Christes propertie and nature to suffer it, it is the craftie surmise of the deuill to perswade vs it. Wherefore sticke not to geue almes freely, and trust not withstandyng, that Gods goodnes wyll minister vnto vs sufficiencie and plentie, so long as we shall liue in this transitorie lyfe, and after our dayes here wel spent in his seruice and the loue of our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we shalbe crowned with euerlasting glory, to raigne with Christe our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in heauen, to whom with the father &amp; the holy ghost, be al honour &amp; glorie for euer.</p>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:6498:171"/>
and lyght exceedeth euery small &amp; litle starre in the firmament. He was made accordyng to the image and similitude of GOD, he was indued with all kinde of heauenly giftes, he had no spot of vncleannesse in him, he was sounde and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in al partes, both outwardly and inwardly, his reason was vncorrupt, his vnderstandyng was pure and good, his wyll was obedient and godly, he was made altogether lyke vnto God, in ryghteousnesse, in holinesse, in wysdome, in trueth, to be short, in all kinde of perfection.</p>
            <p>When he was thus created and made, almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie GOD, in token of his great loue towardes him, chose out a speciall place of the earth for him, namely Paradice, where he liued in all tranquilitie and pleasure, hauyng great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of worldly goodes, and lackt nothing that he myght iustly require or desyre to haue. For as it is sayde, God made him Lord and ruler <note place="margin">Psalm. 8.</note> ouer all the workes of his handes, that he should haue vnder his feete all sheepe &amp; oxen, all beastes of the feelde, all foules of the ayre, all fishes of the sea, and vse them alway at his owne pleasure, according as he shoulde haue nede. Was not this a mirrour of perfection? Was not this a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and blessed estate? Coulde any thing els be well added hereunto, or greater felicitie desyred in this worlde? But as the common nature of all men is, in tyme of prosperitie and wealth, to forget not only them selues, but also God: Euen so did this first man Adam, who hauing but one commaundement at Gods hande, namely that he shoulde not eate of the fruite of knowledge of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:6498:171"/>
good &amp; ill, dyd not withstanding, most vnminde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or rather moste wylfully breake it, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the straight charge of his maker, and geuing eare to the craftie suggestion of that wicked serpent the deuill. Whereby it came to passe, that as before he was blessed, so nowe he was accursed, as before he was loued, so now he was abhorred, as before he was most beautifull and pretious, so nowe he was moste vyle and wretched in the sight of his Lorde and maker. Insteade of the image of God, he was nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the image of the deuill. Insteade of the citezin of heauen, he was become the bondslaue of hell, hauing in hym selfe no one part of his former puritie &amp; cleannesse, but being altogether spotted &amp; defiled, insomuch that nowe he seemed to be nothing els but a lumpe of sinne, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the iust iudgement of god, was condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to euerlasting death. This so great and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a plague, if it had only rested on Adam, who first offended, it had ben so muche the easyer, and myght the better haue ben borne. But it fell not only on hym, but also on his posteritie &amp; children for euer, so that the whole broode of Adams flesh should sustaine the selfe same fall &amp; punishment, which their forefather by his offence most iustly had deserued. Saint Paul in the fifth Chapter to the Romanes sayth, By the offence of onlye Adam, the fault came vpon all men to condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, &amp; by one mans disobedience many were made sinners. By which words we are taught, that as in Adam al men vniuersally sinned: so in Adam all men vniuersally receaued the reward
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:6498:172"/>
of sinne, that is to say, became mortall &amp; subiect vnto death, hauing in them selues nothyng but euerlasting dampnation both of body and soule. They became (as Dauid sayth) corrupt &amp; abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, they went all out of the way, there was none that dyd good, no not one. O what a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable &amp; wofull state was this, that the synne of one man should destroy and condempne al men, that nothyng in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde might be looked for but only pangues of death, &amp; paynes of hell? Had it ben any maruaile if mankinde had ben vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie driuen to desperation, beyng thus fallen from life to death, from saluation to destruction, from heauen to hell? But beholde the great goodnes &amp; tender mercie of god in this behalf: Albeit mans wickednes &amp; sinfull behauiour was such, that it deserued not in any part to be forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet to the intent he might not be cleane destitute of al hope and comfort in tyme to come, he ordeyned a new couenaunt, &amp; made a sure promise thereof, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he would send a Messias or mediatour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, which shoulde make intercession, &amp; put him selfe as a stay betweene both parties, to pacifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath &amp; indignation conceaued against sinne, &amp; to deliuer man out of the miserable curse and cursed miserie wherinto he was fallen head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by disobeying the wyll &amp; commaundement of the only Lord &amp; maker. This couenaunt and promise was first made vnto Adam him selfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after his fall, as we reade in the thirde of Genesis, where God sayd to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> serpent on this wyse: I wyll put enmitie betweene thee and the woman, betweene thy seede &amp; her seede. He shall
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:6498:172"/>
breake thyne head, &amp; thou shalt bruse his heele. After warde, the selfe same couenaunt was also more amplie &amp; plainely renued vnto Abraham, where God promised him, that in his seede all <note place="margin">Gen. 10.</note> nations &amp; families of the earth should be blessed. Agayne it was continued and confirmed vnto Isahac, in the same fourme of wordes, as it was <note place="margin">Gen. 26.</note> before vnto his father. And to the intent that mankinde myght not dispaire, but alwayes lyue in hope, almightie god neuer ceassed to publishe, repeate, confirme, &amp; continue the same, by diuers and sundrye testimonies of his prophetes, who for the better perswasion of the thing, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied the tyme, the place, the maner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of his birth, the affliction of his life, the kinde of his death, the glory of his resurrection, the receauing of his kingdome, the deliueraunce of his people, with all other circumstaunces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto. Esaias prophesied that he should be borne of a virgin, and called <hi>Emanuel.</hi> Micheas prophesied, that he shoulde be borne in Bethlehem a place of Jurie. Ezechiel prophesied that he shoulde come of the stocke and lynage of Dauid. Daniel prophesied that all nations and languages shoulde serue him. Zacharie prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied that he should come in pouertie, riding vpon an Asse. Malachie prophesied that he shoulde sende Elias before him, whiche was John the Baptist. Hieremie prophesied that he should be solde for thirtie peeces of siluer. &amp;c. And all this was done, that the promise &amp; couenaunt of God made vnto Abraham &amp; his posteritie concerning the redemption of the worlde, myght be credited
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:6498:173"/>
and fully beleued. Nowe, as the Apostle Paul sayth, when the fulnesse of time was come, that is, the perfection and course of yeres, appoynted from the beginning, then God accordyng to his former couenaunt and promise, sent a Messias, otherwyse called a mediatour, vnto the worlde, not such a one as Moyses was, not such a one as Josua, Saul, or Dauid was: but suche a one as shoulde deliuer mankinde from the bitter curse of the lawe, and make perfect satisfaction by his death, for the sinnes of all people, namely he sent his deare and only sonne Jesus Christ, made (as the Apostle sayth) of a woman, and made vnder the lawe, that he might redeeme them that were in bondage of the lawe, &amp; make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chyldren of God by adoption. Was not this a wonderfull great loue towardes vs that were his professed and open enemies, towardes vs that were by nature the children of wrath, and fyrebrandes of hell fyre? In this (sayth Saint John) appeared the great loue of God, that he sent his onlye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten sonne into the worlde to saue vs, when we were his extreme enemies. Herein is loue, not that we loued him, but that he loued vs, and sent his sonne to be a reconciliation for our sinnes. Saint Paul also sayth, Christ, when we were yet of no strength, dyed for vs being vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> Doubtlesse a man wyll scarse dye for a rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man. Peraduenture some one durst dye for him of whom they haue receaued good. But god setteth out his loue towardes vs, in that he sent Christe to dye for vs when we were yet voyde of all goodnesse. This and such other comparisons
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:6498:173"/>
doth the Apostle vse, to amplifie and set forth the tender mercie &amp; great goodnes of God, declared towardes mankinde, in sendyng downe a saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from heauen, euen Christe the Lorde. Which one benefite among all other, is so great &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, that neyther tongue can well expresse it, neither heart thinke it, much lesse geue sufficient thankes to god for it. But here is a great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie betwene vs and the Jewes, whether the same Jesus which was borne of the virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, be the true Messias and true sauiour of the worlde, so long promised &amp; prophesied of before. They, as they are and haue ben alwayes, proude &amp; stiffe necked, woulde neuer acknowledge hym vntil this day, but haue loked and gaped for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come. They haue this fond imagination in their heades, that Messias shall come, not as Christ did, like a poore pilgrime and simple soule rydyng vppon an Asse: But lyke a baliaunt and mightie king in great royaltie &amp; honour. Not as Christ did, with a fewe fishermen, and men of small estimation in the world: but with a great armie of strong men, with a great traine of wyse &amp; noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as knightes, Lords, Earles, Dukes, Princes, &amp; so foorth. Neither do they thinke that their Messias shal slaunderously suffer death, as Christ dyd: but that he shall stoutly conquer and manfully subdue al his enemies, and finallie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne such a kingdome on earth, as neuer was seene from the beginning. While they faigne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them selues after this sort a Messias of theyr owne brayne, they deceaue them selues, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt Christe as an abiect &amp; foole of the worlde.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:6498:174"/>
Therefore Christ crucified (as saint Paul sayth) is vnto the Jewes a stumbling blocke, and to the Gentiles foolishnes, because they thinke it an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde thing, and contrary to all reason, that a redemer and sauiour of the whole world, should be handled after suche a sort as he was, namelye scorned, reuiled, scourged, condempned, and last of al cruelly hanged. This, I say, seemed in their eyes straunge, and most absurde, and therefore neyther they would at that tyme, neyther wyll they as yet, acknowledge Christe to be theyr Messias and sauiour. But we (dearely beloued) that hope &amp; loke to be saued, must both stedfastly beleue, and also boldly confesse, that the same Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, which was borne of the virgin Marie, was the true Messias and mediatour betweene God and man, promised and prophecied of so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For as the Apostle writeth: With the heart <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> man beleueth vnto righteousnesse, and with the mouth confession is made vnto saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Againe in the same place: Whosoeuer beleueth in hym, shall neuer be ashamed nor confounded. Wherto agreeth also the testimonie of saint John, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the fourth Chapter of his first generall Epistle, on this wyse: Whosoeuer confesseth that Jesus is the sonne of God, he dwelleth in God, and God in hym.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt, but in this poynt all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men are fully and perfectly perswaded. Yet shal it not be a lost labour to instruct and furnish you with a fewe places concerning this matter, that ye maye be able to stoppe the blasphemous mouthes of all them, that moste Jewishely, or
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:6498:174"/>
rather diuelishly, shall at any time go about to teache or maintaine the contrary. First, ye haue the witnesse and testimonie of the angel Gabriel, declared aswel to Zacharie the high priest, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the blessed virgin. Secondly, ye haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and testimonie of John the Baptist, poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto Christe, and saying, Behold the lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde. Thirdly, ye haue the witnesse and testimonie of God the father, who thundred from heauen, and sayde, This is my dearelye beloued sonne, in whom I am well pleased, heare him. Fourthly, ye haue the witnesse and testimonie of the holye ghost, whiche came downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen in maner of a white doue, and lighted vpon him in time of his baptisme. To these myght be added a great number more, namely the witnesse &amp; testimonie of the wise men that came to Herode, the witnes and testimonie of Simeon and Anna, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and testimonie of Andrew and Philip, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael, and Peter, Nicodemus, and Martha, with diuers other: But it were to long to repeate all, and a fewe places are sufficient in so plaine a matter, specially among them that are alredye perswaded. Therfore if the priuie impes of ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe, and craftie instrumentes of the deuil, shal attempt or go about to withdrawe you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this true Messias, and perswade you to loke for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is not yet come: let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not in any case seduce you, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme your selues with these &amp; such other testimonies of holy scripture, whiche are so sure &amp; certaine, that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuils in hell shal
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:6498:175"/>
neuer be able to withstand them. For as truelye as God liueth, so truelye was Jesus Christe the true messias and sauiour of the worlde, euen the same Jesus which as this day was borne of the virgin Marie, without all helpe of man, only by the power and operation of the holy ghost.</p>
            <p>Concerning whose nature and substaunce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause diuers &amp; sundry heresies are rysen in these our dayes, through the motion and suggestion of Satan: therefore it shalbe needefull &amp; profitable for your instruction, to speake a worde or two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of this parte. We are euidently taught in the scripture, that our Lord and sauiour Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of two seuerall natures, of his manhood, being thereby perfect man, and of his Godhead, being thereby perfect God. It is written, The worde, that is to say, the seconde person in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, <note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> became fleshe. GOD sendyng his owne sonne in the similitude of sinfull fleshe, fulfilled <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> those thinges which the lawe coulde not. Christ being in fourme of God, toke on him the fourme of a seruaunt, &amp; was made like vnto man, beyng <note place="margin">Phillip. 2.</note> founde in shape as a man. GOD was shewed in fleshe, iustified in spirite, seene of angels, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles, beleued on in the world, and receaued vp in glorye. Also in another place: There is one God, and one mediatour betwene God and man, euen the man Jesus Christe.</p>
            <p>These be plaine places for the profe and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both natures, vnited and knitte together in one Christe. Let vs diligently consyder and waygh the workes that he dyd whiles he lyued on earth, and we shall thereby also perceaue
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:6498:175"/>
the selfe same thing to be most true. In that he did hunger and thirst, eate and drinke, sleepe and wake, in that he preached his Gospell to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in that he wept and sorowed for <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> in that he payde tribute for him selfe and Peter, in that he dyed and suffered death, what other thing dyd he els declare, but onlye this, that he was perfect man as we are? For whiche cause he is called in holye scripture, sometyme the sonne of Dauid, sometime the sonne of man, sometime the sonne of Marie, sometime the sonne of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph, and so foorthe. Nowe in that he forgaue sinnes, in that he wrought myracles, in that he dyd cast out deuils, in that he healed men with his only worde, in that he knewe the thoughtes of mens heartes, in that he had the seas at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement; in that he walked on the water, in that he rose from death to lyfe, in that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heauen, and so foorth: What other thing dyd he shew therein, but only that he was perfect god, coequal with the father as touching his deitie? Therfore he sayth, The father and I are all one, which is to be vnderstood of his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. For as touching his manhood, he sayth, The father is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am. Where are nowe those <hi>Marcionites,</hi> that denie Christ to haue ben borne in the fleshe, or to haue ben perfect man? Where are nowe those <hi>Arians,</hi> whiche denye Christe to haue ben perfect God, of equall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce with the father? If there be any suche, ye may easyly reproue them with these testimonies of Gods word, and such other. Wherevnto I am most sure, they shall neuer be able to aunswere.
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:6498:176"/>
For the necessitie of our saluation dyd requyre such a mediatour &amp; sauiour, as vnder one person should be a partaker of both natures: It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite he shoulde be man, it was also requisite he shoulde be God. For as the transgression came by man, so was it meete the satisfaction shoulde be made by man. And because death, accordyng to S. Paul, is the iust stipende and rewarde of sinne: therfore to appease the wrath of God, and to satisfie his iustice, it was expedient that our mediatour shoulde be suche a one, as might take vpon him the sinnes of mankinde, and sustayne the due punishment therof, namely death. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer he came in fleshe, and in the selfe same fleshe ascended into heauen, to declare and testifie vnto vs, that all faithfull people, whiche stedfastly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in hym, shall likewyse come vnto the same mansion place, whereunto he beyng, our chiefe captayne, is gone before. Last of all, he became man, that we thereby might receaue the greater comfort, as well in our prayers, as also in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, consydering with our selues, that we haue a mediatour that is true man as we are, who also is touched with our infirmities, and was tempted eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in like sort as we are. For these and sundry other causes, it was most nedefull he shoulde come, as he dyd, in the fleshe.</p>
            <p>But because no creature, in that he is onlye a creature, hath or maye haue power to destroye death, and geue lyfe, to ouercome hell, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase heauen, to remit sinnes, and geue ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: therefore it was needefull, that our Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ssias, whose proper duetie and office that
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:6498:176"/>
was, shoulde be not onlye full and perfect man, but also full and perfect GOD, to the entent he myght more fully and perfectly make satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for mankind. God sayth, This is my welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> sonne in whom I am wel pleased. By which place we learne, that Christ appeased and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the wrath of his father, not in that he was only the sonne of man: But muche more in that he was the sonne of God.</p>
            <p>Thus ye haue hearde declared out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that Jesus Christe was the true Messias and sauiour of the world, that he was by nature &amp; substaunce perfect God, and perfect man, and for what cause it was expedient he should be so. Nowe that we may be the more mindefull and thankefull vnto God in this behalfe, let vs brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consyder and call to minde, the manifolde and great benefites that we haue receaued by the Natiuitie and byrth of this our Messias and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
            <p>Before Christes comming into the worlde, all men vniuersally in Adam, were nothyng els but a wicked and crooked generation, rotten and corrupt trees, stony ground ful of brambles and bryers, lost sheepe, prodigall sonnes, naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vnprofitable seruauntes, vnryghteous stewardes, workers of iniquitie, the broode of Adders, blind guides, sitting in darknesse and in the shadowe of death: to be shorte, nothyng els but chyldren of perdition, and inheritours of hell fyre. To this doth saint Paul beare witnesse in diuers places of his Epistles, and Christe also him selfe in sundrye places of his Gospell.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:6498:177"/>
But after he was once come downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, and had taken our frayle nature vppon hym, he made all them that woulde receaue hym truely, and beleue his word, good trees, &amp; good ground, fruitefull and pleasaunt braunches, chyldren of light, citezins of heauen, sheepe of his folde, members of his body, heyres of his kyngdome, his true freendes and brethren, sweete and liuely bread, the elect and chosen people of God. For as saint Peter sayth in his fyrst Epistle and seconde Chapter: He bare our sinnes in his body vppon the crosse, he healed vs, &amp; made vs whole by his stripes: and whereas before we were sheepe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing astray, he by his comming brought vs home agayne to the true shephearde and Byshop of our soules, makyng vs a chosen generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all priesthood, an holy nation, a peculier people of GOD, in that he dyed for our offences, and rose agayne for our iustification. Saint Paul to Timothie the thirde Chapter: We were (sayth he) in tymes past vn wyse, disobedient, deceaued, seruing diuers lustes and pleasures, liuyng in hatred, enuie, maliciousnesse, and so foorth. But after the louing kindnesse of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour appeared towardes mankynde, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the ryghteousnesse that we had done, but accordyng to his great mercie, he saued vs by the fountayne of the newe byrth, and by the renewyng of the holy ghost, whiche he powred vpon vs aboundauntly, through Jesus Christe our sauiour, that we beyng once iustified by his grace, shoulde be heyres of eterna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l lyfe, through hope and fayth in his blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:6498:177"/>
In these and suche other places, is set out before our eyes as it were in a glasse, the aboundaunt grace of God, receaued in Christ Jesu, whiche is so muche the more wonderfull, because it came not of any desert of ours, but of his meere &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy, euen then when we were his extreme enemies. But for the better vnderstanding and consyderation of this thyng, let vs beholde the ende of his comming, so shall we perceaue what great commoditie and profite his Natiuitie hath <note place="margin">Matth. 2. Matth. 5. Iohn. 18. Luke. 4. Iohn. 8. Matth. 9.</note> brought vnto vs miserable and sinful creatures. The ende of his comming, was to saue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer his people, to fulfill the law for vs, to beare witnesse vnto the trueth, to teache and preache the wordes of his father, to geue light vnto the world, to cal sinners to repentaunce, the refreshe them that labour and be heauy laden, to cast out <note place="margin">Matth. 11. Iohn. 12.</note> the prince of this worlde, to reconcile vs in the body of his fleshe, to desolue the workes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, last of all, to become a propitiation for our <note place="margin">Collos. 1. Hebru. 10 Rom. 3.</note> sinnes, and not for ours onelye, but also for the sinnes of the whole worlde.</p>
            <p>These were the cheefe endes wherefore Christ became man, not for any profit that should come to him selfe thereby, but onely for our sakes, that we might vnderstande the will of God, be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his heauenly lyght, be delyuered out of the deuils clawes, releassed from the burthen of sinne, iustified through fayth in his blood, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, receaued vp into euerlasting glory, there to raigne with him foreuer. Was not this a great and singuler loue of Christ towardes mankynd, that being the expresse and liuelye image of God,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:6498:178"/>
he woulde notwithstanding humble him selfe, and take vppon him the fourme of a seruant, and that onely to saue and redeeme vs? O how much are we bounde to the goodnesse of God in this behalfe? Howe manye thankes and prayses do we owe vnto him for this our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrought by his deare and onely sonne Christe? who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a pilgrime in earth, to make vs citizens in heauen, who became the sonne of man, to make vs the sonnes of God, who became obedient to the lawe, to deliuer vs from the cursse of the lawe, who became poore, to make vs rich, vyle, to make vs precious, subiect to death, to make vs liue for euer. What greater loue coulde we seelye creatures desire or wishe to haue at Gods handes? Therefore dearelye beloued, let vs not forget this exceeding loue of our Lorde and saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, let vs not shew our selues vnmyndful or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull towardes him: but let vs loue him, feare him, obey him, and serue him. Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse him with our mouthes, praise him with our tongues, beleue on him with our heartes, and glorifie him with our good workes. Christe is the light, let vs receaue the light. Christe is the trueth, let vs beleue the trueth. Christ is the way, let vs folowe the way. And because he is our onely maister, our onely teacher, our onely shepheard and cheefe captayne: therfore let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his seruantes, his schollers, his sheepe, and his souldiers. As for sinne, the flesh, the worlde, and the deuill, whose seruantes and bondslaues we were before Christes comming, let vs vtterly cast them of, and defie them, as the cheefe &amp; onely
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:6498:178"/>
enemies of our soule. And seing we are once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from their cruel tyrannie by Christ, let vs neuer fal into their hands againe, lest we chance to be in a worse case then euer we were before. Happy are they, saith the scripture, that continue to the ende. Be faythful (sayth God) vntil death, and I wil geue thee a crowne of lyfe. Agayne he sayth in another place: He that putteth his hand vnto the plough, and looketh backe, is not meete for the kyngdome of God. Therefore let vs be strong, stedfast, and vnmoueable, abounding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the workes of the Lord. Let vs receaue Christ, not for a tyme, but for euer, let vs beleue his worde, not for a tyme, but for euer, let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his seruaunts, not for a tyme, but for euer, in consyderation that he hath redeemed &amp; saued vs, not for a time, but for euer, and will receaue vs into his heauenly kingdome, there to raygne with him; not for a tyme, but foreuer. To him therfore with the father and the holy ghost, be all honour, prayse, &amp; glory, foreuer and euer.</p>

without any meditation, and remembraunce of that excellent worke of our redemption, wrought as about this time, through the great mercy and charitie of our sauiour Jesus Christ, for vs wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched sinners, and his mortall enemies. For if a mortal mans deede, done to the behofe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, be had in remembrance of vs, with thankes for the benefite and profite whiche we receaue thereby: How much more redily shoulde we haue in memorie this excellent act and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of Christes death? whereby he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for vs, the vndoubted pardon and forgeuenes of our sinnes, whereby he made at one the father of heauen with vs, in suche wyse, that he taketh vs now for his louing children, and for the true inheritours with Christe his naturall sonne, of the kyngdome of heauen? And verily, so muche more doth Christes kindnes appeare vnto vs, in that it pleased him to deliuer him selfe of all his godly honour which he was equally in with his father in heauen, and to come downe into this vale of miserye, to be made mortall man, and to be in the state of a most lowe seruaunt, seruing vs for our wealth and profite, vs I saye, whiche were his sworne enemies, whiche had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his holy law and commaundements, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the lustes and sinfull pleasures of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature. And yet I say did Christe put him <note place="margin">Collos. 2.</note> selfe betwene Gods deserued wrath, &amp; our sinne, and rente that obligation wherein we were in daunger to God, and payde our dette. Our dette was a great deale to great for vs to haue payde. And without payment, God the father coulde
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:6498:179"/>
neuer be at one with vs. Neyther was it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be losed from this dette by our owne habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. It pleased him therefore to be the payer thereof, and to discharge vs quite. Who can now consyder the greuous det of sinne, whiche coulde none otherwyse be payde but by the death of an innocent, and will not hate sinne in his heart? If God hateth sinne so much, that he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe neither man nor Angell for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, but onely the death of his onelye and welbeloued sonne, who will not stande in feare thereof? If we (my freendes) consyder this, that for our sinnes this most innocent lambe was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to death, we shall haue much more cause to bewayle our selues that we were the cause of his death, then to crye out of the mallice and crueltie of the Jewes, whiche pursued him to his death. We did the deedes wherefore he was thus stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and wounded, they were onely the ministers of our wickednes. It is meete then we shoulde step lowe downe into our heartes, and bewayle our owne wretchednes and sinful liuing. Let vs know for a certainetie, that if the most dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued sonne of God was thus punished and stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the sinne which he had not done him self: how muche more ought we sore to be stricken for our dayly and manifolde sinnes whiche we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit agaynst God, if we earnestlye repent vs not, and be not sorye for them? No man can loue sinne, which God hateth so much, and be in his fauour. No man can saye that he loueth Christe truely, and haue his great enemie (sinne I meane, the aucthour of his death) familiar
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:6498:180"/>
and in frendship with him. So much do we loue God and Christe, as we hate sinne. We ought therefore to take great heede, that we be not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers thereof, least we be founde ennemies to God, and traytours to Christe. For not onelye they whiche nayled Christe vppon the crosse, are his tormentours and crucifiers: but all they (sayth saint Paule) crucifie agayne the sonne of God, as muche as is in them, whiche do commit <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> vice and sinne, which brought him to his death. <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> If the wages of sinne be death, and death euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting: Surely it is no small daunger to be in seruice thereof. If we liue after the fleshe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sinfull lustes thereof, saint Paule threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> yea almightie God in saint Paule threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that we shal surely dye.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:6498:180"/>
afterwarde in the purenesse of lyfe. In baptisme we promised to renounce the deuill and his sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions, we promised to be (as obedient chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) alwayes following Gods will &amp; pleasure. Then if he be our father in deede, let vs geue him his due honour. If we be his children, let vs shew him our obedience, like as Christ openly declared his obedience to his father, which (as saint Paul <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> wryteth) was obedient euen to the verye death, the death of the crosse. And this he did for vs all that beleue in him. For him selfe he was not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, for he was pure and vndefiled of al maner of sinne. He was wounded (saith Esai) for our <note place="margin">Esai. 4.</note> wickednes, and striped for our sinnes: he suffred the penaltie of them him selfe, to deliuer vs from daunger: he bare (sayth Esai) al our sores and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities vpon his owne backe. No payne did he refuse to suffer in his owne body, that he myght deliuer vs from payne euerlasting. His pleasure it was thus to do for vs, we deserued it not. Wherfore the more we see our selues bound vnto him, the more he ought to be thanked of vs, yea, and the more hope may we take, that we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue all other good thinges of his hand, in that we haue receaued the gifte of his onelye sonne, through his liberalitie. For if God (sayth Saint <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Paul) hath not spared his owne so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne from paine and punishment, but deliuered him for vs all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death: how should he not geue vs all other thinges with him?

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:6498:181"/>
For such power is geuen to vs, to be the children of God, so many as beleue in Christes name. In his name whatsoeuer we aske, we shall haue it <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> graunted vs. For so well pleased is the father almighty God, with Christ his sonne, that for his sake he fauoureth vs, and will denye vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng. So pleasant was this sacrifice and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his sonnes death, which he so obediently and innocently suffred, that he would take it for the onelye and full amendes for all the sinnes of the worlde. And such fauour did he purchase by his death of his heauenly father for vs: that for the merite thereof (if we be true Christians in deede, and not in worde onely) we be now fullye in Gods grace agayne, and clearelye discharged from our sinne. No tongue surelye is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the worthines of this so precious a death.

For no doubt, all our thoughtes and deedes were of no value, if they were not allowed in the merites of Christes death. All our ryghteousnes is far vnperfect, if it be compared with Christes ryghteousnes. For in his actes and deedes, there was no spot of sinne, or of any vnperfectnes. And

For if Christe was obedient to his father euen to the death, and that the most shameful death (as the Jewes esteemed it) the death of the crosse: Why should we not be obedient to God in lower pointes of charitie and patience? Let vs forgeue then our neighbours their small faultes, as God for Christes sake hath <note place="margin">Eccle. 28.</note> forgeuen vs our great. It is not meete that we should craue forgeuenes of our great offences at Gods handes, and yet will not forgeue the small trespasses of our neighbours agaynst vs. We do <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> call for mercy in vayne, if we will not shew mercy to our neighbours. For if we will not put wrath and displeasure forth of our hearts to our christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an brother, no more wil God forgeue the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and wrath that our sinnes haue deserued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. For vnder this condition doth God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue vs, if we forgeue other. It becommeth not Christian men to be harde one to another, nor yet to thinke their neighbour vnworthye to be forgeuen. For howsoeuer vnworthy he is, yet is Christ worthy to haue thee do thus much for his sake, he hath deserued it of thee, that thou shouldest forgeue thy neighbour. And God is also to be obeyed, which commaundeth vs to forgeue, if we will haue any part of the pardon which our sauiour Christ purchased once of God the father by shedding of his precious blood. Nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth Christes seruantes so much, as mercy <note place="margin">Iacob. 5.</note> and compassion.

When our great graundfather A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had broken Gods commaundement, in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the apple forbidden him in paradice, at the motion and suggestion of his wyfe, he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therby, not onelye to him selfe, but also to his posteritie for euer, the iust wrath &amp; indignation of God, who according to his former sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced at the geuing of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned both him &amp; all his to euerlasting death, both of body and soule. For it was said vnto him, Thou shalt eat frely of euery tree in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garden: but <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> as touching the tree of knowledge of good &amp; ill,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:6498:185"/>
thou shalt in no wyse eat of it. For in what houre soeuer thou eatest thereof, thou shalt dye the death. Now as the Lorde had spoken, so it came to passe. Adam toke vppon him to eate thereof, and in so doing he dyed the death, that is to saye, he became mortall, he lost the fauour of God, he was cast out of paradice, he was no longer a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of heauen: but a fyrebrand of hell, and a bond slaue to the deuil. To this doth our sauiour beare witnesse in the Gospell, callyng vs loste <note place="margin">Luke. xv.</note> sheepe, which haue goue astray &amp; wandred from the true shephearde of our soules. To this also doth saint Paule beare witnesse, saying, That by the offence of onely Adam, death came vppon all <note place="margin">Rom. v.</note> men to condempnation. So that no we neyther he, nor any of his, had any ryght or interest at all in the kyngdome of heauen, but were become plaine reprobates and castawayes, being perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dampned to the euerlasting paynes of hell tyre. In this so great miserie and wretchednes, if mankind could haue recouered him selfe againe, and obtayned forgeuenes at Gods handes, then had his case ben somwhat tollerable, because he might haue attempted some way how to deliuer him selfe from eternall death. But there was no way left vnto him, he coulde do nothyng that might pacifie gods wrath, he was altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in that behalfe.

What should he then do? Shoulde he go about to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and kepe the lawe of God diuided into two tables, &amp; so purchase to him selfe eternall life? In deede, if Adam and his posteritie had ben able to satisfie and fulfill the lawe perfectly, in louyng God aboue all thinges, and their neyghbour as them selues: then shoulde they haue easily quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Lordes wrath, and escaped the terrible sentence of eternall death pronounced agaynst them by the mouth of almightie God.

vpryghtly in Gods commaundementes though he woulde neuer so faine, but dayly and hourely fell from his bounden duetie, offending the Lord his God diuers wayes, to the great encrease of his condempnation, insomuch that the prophete Dauid cryeth out on this wyse: All haue gone <note place="margin">Psalm. 5.</note> astray, all are become vnprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one. In this case what profite coulde he haue by the lawe? None at all. For as saint James sayth, He that shall obserue <note place="margin">Iacob. 2.</note> the whole lawe, and yet faileth in one poynt, is become giltie of all. And in the booke of Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomie it is written, Cursed be he (sayth God) <note place="margin">Deut. 27.</note> which abydeth not in all thinges that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of the lawe to do them. Behold, the lawe bringeth a curse with it, and maketh vs giltie, not because it is of it self naught or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy (God forbid we shoulde so thinke) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the frailtie of our sinfull fleshe is such, that we can neuer fulfill it, accordyng to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Lorde requireth. Coulde Adam then (thinke you) hope or trust to be saued by the law? No, he could not. But the more he looked on the law, the more he sawe his owne dampnation set before his eyes, as it were in a most cleare glasse. So that now of him selfe he was most wretched and miserable, destitute of all hope, &amp; neuer able to pacifie Gods heauie displeasure, nor yet to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the terrible iudgement of God, wherinto he and all his posteritie were fallen, by disobeying the straight commaundement of the Lorde theyr God.

He (sayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophete Esai, <note place="margin">Esai. 55.</note> meaning Christe) hath borne our infirmities, &amp; hath caried our sorowes, the chastisement of our peace was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; by his stripes are we made whole. Saint Paul like wyse sayth: God made <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> him a sacrifice for our sinnes, whiche knewe not sinne, that we should be made the righteousnesse of God by him.

Whiche yf you wyll haue comprehended briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in one worde, it was nothyng els in our parte, but onlye the transgression and sinne of mankinde.

If thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest kept thy selfe vyryght, if thou haddest obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the commaundementes, yf thou haddest not <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> presumed to transgresse the wyll of God in thy fyrst father Adam: then Christe being in fourme of God, needed not to haue taken vppon him the shape of a seruaunt: being immortall in heauen, he needed not to become mortal on earth: beyng the true bread of the soule, he needed not to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: being the healthfull water of lyfe, he needed not to thirst: being life it selfe, he needed not to haue suffred death. But to these and many other suche extremities, was he dryuen by thy sinne, which was so manifolde &amp; great, that god could be onlye pleased in hym, and none other. Canst thou thinke of this; O sinful man, and not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble within thy selfe? Canst thou heare it quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye without remorse of conscience, and sorowe of heart? Did Christ suffer his passion for thee, and <note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> wylt thou shewe no compassion towardes hym? Whyle Christe was yet hangyng on the Crosse,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:6498:187"/>
and yelding vp the ghost, the Scripture witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vale of the temple did rent in twaine, and the earth dyd quake, that the stones claue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, that the graues dyd open, &amp; the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes rise. And shall the heart of man be nothyng moued to remember how greeuously and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was handled of the Jewes for our sinnes? Shall man shew himselfe to be more hard hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then stones, to haue lesse compassion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dead bodies? Call to minde, O sinful creature, and set before thyne eyes Christe crucified. Thinke thou seest his body stretched out in length vppon the crosse, his head crowned with sharpe thorne, his handes &amp; his feete pearsed with nailes, his heart opened with a long speare, his fleshe rente and torne with whippes, his browes sweating wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and blood. Thinke thou hearest hym nowe crying in an intollerable agonie to his father, &amp; saying, My God, my God, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me. Couldest thou behold this wofull sight, or heare this mournefull voyce without teares, consydering that he suffered all this, not for any desart of his owne, but only for the greeuousnes of thy sinnes? O that mankinde shoulde put the euerlasting sonne of God to such paines. O that we should be the occasion of his death, &amp; the only cause of his condempnation. May we not iustly crye wo worth the time that euer we sinned? O my brethren, let this image of Christe crucified, be alwayes printed in our heartes, let it stirre vs vp to the hatred of sinne, &amp; prouoke our mindes to the earnest loue of almightie God. For why? Is not sinne thinke you, a greuous thing in his

True, yea moste true is that saying of Dauid: Thou O Lorde, hatest all them that worke ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, neyther shall the wicked and euill man <note place="margin">Psal. 5.</note> dwell with thee.

This one example which we haue now in hande, is of more force, &amp; ought more to moue vs, then all the rest. Christe being the sonne of god, and perfect God him self, who neuer committed sinne; was compelled to come downe from heauen, &amp; to geue his body to be bruised &amp; broken on the crosse for our sinnes. Was not this a manifest token of Gods great
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:6498:188"/>
wrath and displeasure towardes sinne, that he could be pacified by no other meanes, but onlye by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sweete &amp; precious blood of his deare sonne? O sinne, sinne, that euer thou shouldest dryue Christe to suche extremitie. Wo worth the tyme that euer thou camest into the world. But what booteth it now to bewayle? Sinne is come, and so come that it can not be auoyded. There is no <note place="margin">Prou. 24.</note> man liuing, no not the iustest man on the earth? but he falleth seuen times a day, as Salomon sayth. And our Sauiour Christe, although he hath deliuered vs from sinne: yet not so that we shalbe free from committing sinne: But so that it shal not be imputed to our condempnation. He <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> hath taken vpon him the iust rewarde of sinne, which was death, &amp; by death hath ouerthrowen death, that we beleuing in him, myght lyue for euer, and not dye. Ought not this to engender extreme hatred of sinne in vs, to consyder that it did violently, as it were, plucke God out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to make him feele the horrours and paynes of death? O that we would sometimes consyder this in the middest of our pompes &amp; pleasures, it would bridle the outragiousnesse of the fleshe, it would abate and asswage our carnall affectes, it woulde restraine our fleshly appetites, that we shoulde not run at randon as we commonly do.

griefe and torment of Christe, nowe sittyng in heauen. Let vs therefore remember, and alwaies beare in minde Christe crucified, that therby we may be inwardly moued both to abhorre sinne throughly, and also with an earnest and zelous heart to loue God. For this is another fruite which the memoriall of Christes death ought to worke in vs, an earnest and vnfayned loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God. So God loued the worlde (sayth <note place="margin">Iohn. iii.</note> saint John) that he gaue his only begotten so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, that whosoeuer beleued in hym, shoulde not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe, but haue life euerlasting. If god declared so great loue towardes vs his seely creatures: how can we of ryght but loue him agayne? Was not this a sure pledge of his loue, to geue vs his own sonne from heauen? He myght haue geuen vs an angel if he would, or some other creature, and yet should his loue haue ben farre aboue our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sartes. Nowe he gaue vs not an angell, but his sonne. And what sonne? His only sonne, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sonne, his welbeloued sonne, euen that sonne whom he had made Lorde and ruler of al thinges. Was not this a singuler token of great loue? But to whom did he geue him? He gaue him to the whole worlde, that is to say, to Adam and all that should come after him. O lord what had Adam or anye other man deserued at Gods handes, that he should geue vs his owne sonne? We are all miserable persons, sinfull persons, dampnable perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, iustly driuen out of paradice, iustly excluded from heauen, iustly condempned to hell fyre: And yet (see a wonderfull token of Gods loue) he gaue vs his only be gotten sonne,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:6498:189"/>
vs I say, that were his extreme and deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that we by vertue of his blood shed vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse, might be cleane purged from our sinnes, and made righteous agayne in his sight. Who can chose but maruaile, to heare that god should she we such vnspeakable loue towardes vs, that were his deadly enemies? Indeede, O mortall man, thou oughtest of ryght to marueyle at it &amp; to acknowledge therein Gods great goodnesse and mercie towards mankind, which is so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that no fleshe, be it neuer so worldly wyse, may wel conceaue it or expresse it. For as Saint Paul testifieth, God greatly commendeth and <note place="margin">Rom. v.</note> setteth out his loue towardes vs, in that he sent his sonne Christ to die for vs, when we were yet sinners, and open enemies of his name. If we had in any maner of wyse deserued it at his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, then had it ben no marueile at all, but there was no desert on our part wherefore he shoulde do it. Therefore thou sinful creature, when thou hearest that GOD gaue his sonne to dye for the sinnes of the worlde, thinke not he dyd it for any desert or goodnes that was in thee, for thou wast then the bondslaue of the deuill: But fall downe vpon thy knees, and crye with the prophete Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, O Lorde, what is man, that thou art so <note place="margin">Psal, viii.</note> mindefull of him? or the sonne of man, that thou so regardest him? And seeing he hath so greatlye loued thee, endeuour thy self to loue him againe, with all thy heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, that therin thou mayst appeare not to be vnworthy of his loue. I report me to thyne owne conscience, whether thou wouldest
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:6498:190"/>
not thinke thy loue ill bestowed vpon him, that could not finde in his heart to loue thee agayne? If this be true (as it is most true) then thinke howe greatly it behoueth to thy duetie to loue God, whiche hath so greatly loued thee, that he hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> spared his owne onlye sonne from so cruell and shamefull a death for thy sake. And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto concerning the cause of Christes death &amp; passion, which as yet was on our part most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and greeuous sinne, so on the other side it was the free gift of God, proceeding of his meere and tender loue towards mankind, without any merite or desert of our part. The Lorde for his mercies sake graunt that we neuer forget this great benefite of our saluation in Christe Jesu, but that we alwayes shewe our selues thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it, abhorring all kinde of wickednesse and sinne, and applying our myndes wholy to the seruice of God, and the diligent keeping of his commaundementes.</p>
            <p>Now resteth to shewe vnto you, howe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie Christes death and passion to our comfort, as a medicine to our woundes, so that it maye worke the same effect in vs wherefore it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, namely the health &amp; saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our soules. For as it profiteth a man nothing to haue salue, vnlesse it be well applied to the part affected: So the death of Christ shall stand vs in no force, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we applie it to our selues in suche sorte as God hath appoynted. Almightie God common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worketh by meanes, and in this thing he hath also ordained a certaine meane, wherby we may take fruite and profite to our soules health.
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:6498:190"/>
What meane is that? forsooth it is fayth. Not an vnconstant or wauering fayth: but a sure, sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, grounded, and vnfaigned fayth. GOD sent his sonne into the worlde (sayth Saint John.) <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> To what end? that whosoeuer beleueth in hym, shoulde not perishe, but haue lyfe euerlasting. Marke these wordes: that whosoeuer beleueth in him. Here is the meane whereby we must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the fruites of Christes death vnto our deadly wounde. Here is the meane whereby we must obtaine eternall lyfe, namely fayth. For (as saint Paul teacheth in his Epistle to the Romanes) <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> With the heart man beleueth vnto ryghteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and with the mouth confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made vnto saluation.

Beleue in the Lorde Jesus, so shalt thou and thyne house both be saued. After the Euangelist had described and set foorth vnto <note place="margin">Iohn. 20.</note> vs at large, the life and the death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, in the end he concludeth with these wordes: These thinges are written, that we may beleue Jesus Christe to be the sonne of God, a through sayth obtayne eternall lyfe. To conclude with the wordes of saint Paul which are these: Christ is the ende of the lawe vnto saluation, for euery <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> one that doth beleue. By this then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> wel perceaue, that the only meane and instrument of saluation required of our partes, is faith, that is to saye, a sure trust and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> our sinnes, that he hath accepted vs againe into his sauour,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:6498:191"/>
that he hath released vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bondes of damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and receaued vs againe into the number of his elect people, not for our merites or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sartes, but onlye &amp; solely for the merites of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes death and passion, who became man for our sakes, and humbled him selfe to sustayne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche of the crosse, that we thereby might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and made inheritours of the kingdome of heauen. This fayth is required at our handes. And this yf we keepe stedfastly in our heartes, there is no doubt but we shall obtayne saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at gods handes, as did Abraham, Isahac, and Jacob, of whom the scripture saith, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued, <note place="margin">Gen. xv. Rom, vii.</note> and it was imputed vnto them for ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. Was it imputed vnto them onlye? and shall it not be imputed vnto vs also? Yes, yf we haue the same fayth as they had, it shalbe as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imputed vnto vs for righteousnesse, as it was vnto them. For it is one fayth that must saue both vs and them, euen a sure and stedfast fayth in Christ Jesu, who as ye haue heard, came into the worlde for this ende, that whosoeuer beleue in him, shoulde not perishe, but haue lyfe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. But here we must take heede, that we do <note place="margin">Iohn. iii.</note> not hault with God through an vnconstant and wauering saith, but that it be strong and stedfast to our liues ende. He that wauereth (saith saint James) is lyke a waue of the sea, neyther let <note place="margin">Iacob, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Peter comming to Christe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water, because he fainted in faith, was in daunger of drowning. So we, yf we beginne to <note place="margin">Mat. xiiii.</note> wauer or doubt, it is to be feared lest we shall
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:6498:191"/>
sinke as Peter dyd, not into the water, but into the bottomlesse pit of hell fyre. Therefore I saye vnto you, that we must apprehende the merites of Christes death and passion by faith, and that with a strong and stedfast fayth, nothyng doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but that Christe by his owne oblation, and once offring of him selfe vpon the crosse, hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away our sinnes, &amp; hath restored vs agayne into Gods fauour so fully and perfectly, that no other sacrifice for sinne, shall hereafter be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site or nedefull in all the worlde. Thus haue ye hearde in fewe wordes, the meane whereby we must applie the fruites and merites of Christes death vnto vs, so that it may worke the saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our soules, namely a sure, stedfast, perfect, and grounded fayth. For as all they whiche behelde stedfastly the brasen serpent, were healed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered <note place="margin">Num. 21.

Therfore (dearely beloued) yf we chaunce at anye tyme through frailtie of the fleshe, to fall into sinne (as it can not be chosen, but we must nedes fall often) &amp; yf we feele the heauie burden thereof to presse our soules, tormenting vs with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of death, hell, and dampnation, let vs then vse that meane which God hath appoynted in his word, to wit, the meane of faith, which is the only instrument of saluation nowe left vnto vs. Let vs stedfastly beholde Christe crucified with the eyes of our

Let vs only trust to be saued by his death and passion, &amp; to haue our sinnes cleane wasshed away through his most precious blood, that in the end of the world, when he shal come agayne to iudge both the quicke and the dead, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue vs into his heauenly kingdome, and place vs in the number of his elect and chosen people, there to be partakers of that immortal and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, whiche he hath purchased vnto vs by vertue of his bloddy woundes: To him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with the father, and the holy ghost, be al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorie, worlde without ende.</p>

our Christian religion and fayth, the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Lorde Jesus. So great surely is the matter of this article, and of so great wayght and importaunce, that it was thought worthie to kepe our sayde Sauiour still on earth fourtie dayes after he was rysen from death to lyfe, to the confirmation and stablishment therof in the heartes of his disciples. So that (as Luke clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye testifieth in the first Chapter of the Actes of the Apostles) he was conuersaunt with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples by the space of fourtie dayes continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye together, to thintent he would in his person beyng nowe glorified, teache and instruct them, whiche shoulde be the teachers of other, fullye and in most absolute and perfect wise, the trueth of this moste Christian article, whiche is the grounde and foundation of our whole religion, before he would ascend vp to his father into the heauens, there to receaue the glorye of his most triumphant conquest and victorie. Assuredly, so highly comfortable is this article to our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that it is euen the very locke and key of all our Christian religion and fayth. If it were not true (sayth the holy Apostle Paul) that Christe rose agayne: then our preaching were in vayne, <note place="margin">1.

But nowe is he rysen agayne from death (sayth the Apostle Paul) to be the first fruites of them that be a sleepe, to thintent to raise them to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life agayne: Yea, yf it were not true that Christe is risen againe, then were it neither true that he is ascended vp to heauen, nor that he sent downe from heauen vnto vs the holy ghost, nor that he sitteth on the right hand of his heauenly father, hauing the rule of heauen &amp; earth, raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as the prophete sayth) from sea to sea, nor <note place="margin">Psalm. 17.</note> that he should after this worlde, be the iudge as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of the liuing as of the dead, to geue reward to the good, and iudgement to the euill.

to all the nations of the worlde. Ye see (good Christian people) howe necessarie this article of our fayth is, seeing it was proued of Christe him selfe by suche euident reasons and tokens, by so long time and space. Nowe therefore as our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was diligent for our comfort and instruction to declare it: so let vs be as redy in our beleefe to receaue it to our comfort &amp; instruction. As he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for him selfe, no more dyd he ryse agayne for hym selfe. He was dead (saith Saint Paul) for our sinnes, and rose agayne for our iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O moste comfortable worde, euermore to be borne in remembrance. He dyed (saith he) to put away sinne, he arose agayne to endowe vs with righteousnes. His death tooke away sin &amp; maledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his death was the rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>some of them both, his death destroyed death, &amp; ouercame the deuill, which had the power of death in his subiection, his death destroyed hell, with all the damnation therof. Thus is death swallowed vp by Christes victorie, thus is hell spoyled for euer. If any man doubt of this victorie, let Christes glorious resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection declare hym the thyng. If death coulde <note place="margin">i. Cor. xv.</note> not kepe Christ vnder his dominion and power, but that he arose agayne, it is manifest that his power was ouercome. If death be conquered, then muste it folowe that sinne wherefore death was appoynted as the wages, muste be also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. If death &amp; sinne be vanished away, then is the deuilles tyranny vanished, whiche had the power of death, and was the aucthour &amp; brewer of sin, and the ruler of hell. If Christ had the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of them all by the power of his death, and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:6498:194"/>
openly proued it by his most victorious and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt resurrection (as it was not possible for his great myght to be subdued of them) and then this true that Christ died for our synnes, and rose agayne for our iustification: Whye may not we that be his members by true fayth, reioyce and boldly say with the prophete Osee, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Paul, Where is thy darte O death? where is thy victorie O hell? Thankes be vnto God, say they, whiche hath geuen vs the victorie by our Lorde Christe Jesus. This mightie conquest of his resurrection, was not onlye signified before by diuers figures of the olde Testament, as by Sampson when he slewe the Lion, out of whose mouth came sweetenes and hony, and as Dauid <note place="margin">Luk. xiiii.</note> bare his figure when he deliuered the lambe out of the Lions mouth, and when he ouercame and slew the great gyaunt Goliath, and as when Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas <note place="margin">3.

He hath spoyled, saith saint Paul, rule and power, and all the dominion of our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies. He hath made a shewe of them <note place="margin">Coloss. ii.</note> openly, and hath triumphed ouer them in his owne person. This is the myghtie power of the Lorde, whom we beleue on. By his death, hath he wrought for vs this victorie, and by his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, hath he purchased euerlastyng lyfe and righteousnesse for vs. It has not ben enough to be delyuered by his death from synne, excepte by his resurrection we had ben endowed with
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:6498:195"/>
ryghteousnes. And it shoulde not auayle vs to be delyuered from death, except he had rysen againe to open for vs the gates of heauen, to enter into lyfe euerlastyng. And therefore saint Peter than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ for <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> his aboundaunt mercie, because he hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs (sayth he) vnto a lyuely hope by the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jesus Christe from death, to enioy an inheritaunce immortall, that neuer shall perish, which is layd vp in heauen for them that be kept by the power of God through fayth. Thus hath his resurrection wrought for vs life &amp; righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. He passed through death and hell, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to put vs in good hope, that by his strength we shall do the same. He payde the raunsome of synne, that it shoulde not be layde to our charge. He destroyed the deuill and all his tyrannye, and openly triumphed ouer hym, &amp; tooke away from hym all his captiues, and hath raysed and sette <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> them with himselfe amongst the heauenly Cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins aboue. He dyed to destroy the rule of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in vs, and he rose agayne to sende downe his holy spirite to rule in our heartes, to endowe vs with perfect righteousnes. Thus it is true that Dauid song: <hi>Veritas de terra orta est, et iustitia de</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> 
               <hi>coelo prospexit,</hi> The trueth of gods promise is in the earth to man declared, or from the earth is the euerlasting veritie Gods sonne rysen to life, &amp; <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. Captinam duxit cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinitatem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Thus (good Christian people) forasmuche as ye haue hearde these so great and excellent benefites of Christes myghtie and glorious resurrection, as howe that he hath raunsomed synne, ouercome the deuill, death, and hell, and hath victoriouslye gotten the better hande of them all, to make vs free and safe from them, and knowyng that we be by this benefite of his resurrection, rysen with hym by our fayth, vnto lyfe euerlastyng, beyng in full suretie of our hope, that we shall haue our bodyes lykewyse raysed agayne from death, to haue them glorified in immortalitie, and ioyned to his glorious bodye, hauyng in the meane while his holy spirite within our heartes as a seale and pledge of our euerlastyng inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce.

able to subdue all our euyll affections, rysyng agaynst the pleasure of God.

How can we fynde in our heartes to shewe suche extreame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyndnesse to Christe, which hath now so gently called vs to mercie, and offered him selfe vnto vs, and he nowe entred within vs? yea, howe dare we be so bolde to renounce the presence of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the sonne, and the holy ghost?

Good Christian brethren and sisters aduise your selues, consyder the dignite that ye be nowe set in, let not follie lose the thyng that grace hath so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously offered and purchased, let not wylfulnesse and blindnesse put out so great lyght that is now shewed vnto you.

the daunger of your soules: So nowe lyke obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient chyldren, thus purified by fayth, geue your selues to walk that way which God moueth you to, that ye may receaue the end of your fayth, the saluation of your soules. And as ye haue geuen <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> your bodyes to vnryghteousnes, to synne after sin: so now geue your selfe to ryghteousnes, to be sanctified therein. If ye delyght in this article of your fayth, that Christ is rysen again from death <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> to lyfe: then folowe you the example of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, as Saint Paul exhorteth vs, saying: As we be buried with Christ by our baptisme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, so let vs dayly dye to synne, mortifiyng <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> and kylling the euill desires and motions therof. And as Christe was raysed vp from death by the glorye of the father, so let vs ryse to a newe lyfe, and walke continually therin, that we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse as naturall chyldren liue a conuersation to moue men to glorifie our father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. If we then be risen with Christ by our faith to the hope of euerlastyng lyfe: let vs ryse also <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> with Christe, after his example, to a newe lyfe, and leaue our olde. We shal then be truely rysen, if we seeke for thynges that be heauenly, if we haue our affection on things that be aboue, and not on thynges that be on the earth. If ye desyre to knowe what these earthly thynges be which ye shoulde put of, and what be the heauenly thynges aboue, that ye should seeke and ensue: saint Paul in the Epistle to the Collossians decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, when he exhorteth vs thus: Mortifie your <note place="margin">Coloss. 3.</note> earthly members and olde affections of synne, as fornication, vncleannesse, vnnaturall luste, euyll

Let your affection from henceforth be set on heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges, sue and searche for mercie, kyndnesse, meekenes patience, forbearing one another, and forgeuyng one another. If any man haue anye quarrell to another, as Christe forgaue you, euen so doye. If these and suche other heauenly vertues ye ensue in the residue of your lyfe, ye shall shew playnely that ye be rysen with Christ, &amp; that ye be the heauenly chyldren of your father in heauen, from whom, as from the geuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth these graces &amp; gyftes.

also in that he so kindlye prouided, that the same most mercyful worke myght be had in continual remembraunce, to take some place in vs, and not be frustrate of his ende and purpose. For as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parentes are not content to procure for their chyldren costly possessions and liuelode, but take order that the same may be conserued and come to their vse: So our Lorde and sauiour thought it not sufficient to purchase for vs his fathers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour agayne (whiche is that deepe fountayne of all goodnesse and eternall lyfe) but also inuented the wayes most wysely, whereby they myght re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to our commoditie &amp; profite. Amongst the which meanes, is the publique celebration of the memorie of his pretious death at the Lordes table. Whiche although it seeme of small vertue to some, yet beyng ryghtly done by the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it doth not onlye helpe their weaknesse (who be by their poysoned nature redyer to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber iniuries then benefites) but strengthneth &amp; comforteth their in ward man with peace &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and maketh them thankfull to their redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with diligent care and godly conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as of olde tyme God decreed his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous benefites of the delyueraunce of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Exod. xii.</note> to be kepte in memorie by the eatyng of the passeouer, with his rites and ceremonies: So our louyng Sauiour hath ordeyned and estably<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the remembraunce of his great mercie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in his passion, in the institution of his heauenly supper, where euery one of vs must be <note place="margin">Mat. xxvi. i.

wyse done and ministred, as our Lorde and saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did, and commaunded to be done, as his holy Apostles vsed it, and the good fathers in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Churche frequented it. For (as that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth) he is vnworthy of the Lord, that otherwise doth celebrate that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, then it was delyuered by him.

Let vs rather in these matters folowe the aduice of <hi>Ciprian</hi> in the lyke cases, that is, cleaue fast to the firste beginnyng, holde fast the Lordes tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do that in the Lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration which he him selfe did, he him selfe commaunded, &amp; his apostles confirmed. This caution or foresight yf we vse, then may we see to those thynges that be requisit in the worthy receauer, wherof this was the fyrste, that we haue a ryght vnderstandyng of the thyng it selfe. As concerning which thing, this we maye assuredlye perswade our selues, that the ignoraunt man can neyther worthyly esteeme, nor effectually vse those marueilous gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and benefites offered and exhibited in that Supper: but eyther wyll lightly regarde them, to no small offence, or vtterly condempne them, to his vtter destruction. So that by his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he deserueth the plagues of God to fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym, and by contempt he deserueth euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng perdition. To auoyde then these harmes,

vse the aduice of the wyse man, who wylleth thee when thou sittest at an earthlye kynges ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">Pro. xxiii.</note> to take diligent heede what thinges are set before thee: So nowe much more at the kyng of kynges table, thou must carefully: searche and knowe what dainties are prouided for thy soule, whyther thou art come, not to feede thy senses and belly to corruption, but thy in warde man to immortalitie and lyfe, nor to consyder the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye creatures whiche thou seest, but the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye graces which thy, fayth beholdeth. For this table is not (sayth <hi>Chrisostome)</hi> for chattering Jayes, but for Egles, who flee thither where the dead bodye lyeth. And yf this aduertisement of man can not perswade vs to resorte to the lordes table with vnderstandyng: see the counsell of GOD in the lyke matter, who charged his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to teache their posteritie, not onlye the rites and ceremonies of the Passouer, but the cause and ende thereof. Whence we may learne, that both more perfect knowledge is required at this tyme at our handes, and that the ignoraunt can not with fruite and profite exercise hym selfe in the Lordes Sacramentes. But to come nygher to the matter, Saint Paul blaming the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians for the prophaning of the Lordes supper, concludeth that ignoraunce both of the thing it selfe; and the signification thereof, was the cause of their abuse: for they came thither vnreuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, not discerning the Lordes bodye. Ought not we then by the monition of the wise man, by the wisdome of God, by the fearefull example of the Corinthians, to take aduised heede, that we
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:6498:202"/>
thrust not our selues to this table, with rude and vnreuerent ignoraunce, the smart whereof Christes Churche hath rued and lamented these many dayes and yeres? For what hath ben the cause of the ruyne of Gods religion, but the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce hereof? What hath ben the cause of this grosse idolatrie, but the ignoraunce hereof? What hath ben the cause of this mummishe mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng, but the ignoraunce hereof? Yea what hath ben, and what is at this day the cause of this want of loue and charitie, but the ignoraunce hereof? Let vs therfore so trauaile to vnderstand the Lordes Supper, that we be no cause of the decaye of Gods worship, of no idolatrie, of no dumme massing, of no hate and malice, so maye we the boldlyer haue accesse thyther to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.

Here they may feele wrought the tranquilitie of conscience, the encrease of fayth, the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of hope, the large spreadyng abrode of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindnes, with many other sundry graces of God. The taste whereof they can not attayne

From the whiche (O beloued) washe your selues with the liuyng waters of Gods worde, whence you maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue and know, both the spirituall foode of this costly supper, and the happy trustinges &amp; effectes that the same doth bring with it.</p>
               <p>Now it foloweth to haue with this knowledge a sure and constant faith, not only that the death of Christe is auayleable for the redemption of all the world, for the remission of sinnes, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God the father: but also that he hath made vppon his crosse a full and sufficient sacrifice for thee, a perfect clensyng of thy sinnes, so that thou acknowledgest no other Sauiour, redeemer, mediatour, aduocate, intercessour, but Christe only, and that thou mayst say with the Apostle, that he loued thee, and gaue him selfe for thee. For this is to sticke fast to Christes promise made in his institution, to make Christe thyne owne, and to applicate his merites vnto thy selfe. Herein thou nedest no other mans helpe, no other sacrifice or oblation, no sacrifisyng Priest, no masse, no meanes established by mans inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That faith is a necessarie instrument in al these holy ceremonies, we may thus assure our selues, for that as Saint Paul sayth, without fayth it is vnpossible to please god. When a great <note place="margin">Hebr. xi.</note> number of the Israelites were ouerthrowen in the wildernesse, Moyses, Aaron, and Phinees dyd eate Manna, and pleased God, for that they vnderstoode (sayth Saint <hi>Augustine)</hi> the visible <note place="margin">In Iohan.

spiritually they tasted it, that they myght be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually satisfied. And truely as the bodily meate can not feede the outward man, vnlesse it be let into a stomake to be digested, whiche is health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and sound: No more can thy inwarde man be fed, except his meate bereceaued into his<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So then we must shewe outwarde testimonie, in folowyng the signification of Christes death, amongst the which this is not esteemed least, to render than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to almightie God for all his benefites, briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprised in the death, passion, &amp; resurrection of his dearely beloued sonne. The which thing, because we ought chiefly at this table to solemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise, the godly fathers named it Eucharistia, that is, thankesgeuing. As yf they should haue sayde, Nowe aboue all other tymes ye ought to laude and prayse God.

Seeyng then that the <note place="margin">Heb. xxiii</note> name &amp; thing it selfe doth monishe vs of thanks, let vs (as saint Paul sayth) offer alwayes to god, the hoste or sacrifice of prayse by Christe, that is, the fruite of the lippes which confesse his name.

to geue thankes for his health. Yea happye it were, yf among fourtie Communicantes, we coulde see two vnfaignedly geue thankes. So vnkinde we be, so obliuious we be, so proude beggers we be, that partly we care not for our owne commoditie, partlye we knowe not our duetie to God, and chiefely we wyll not confesse all that we receaue. Yea, and yf we be forced by Gods power to do it: yet we handle it so coldely, so drylye, that our lippes prayse him, but our heartes disprayse hym, our tongues blesse hym, but our lyfe curseth hym, our wordes worshippe hym, but our workes dishonour him. O let vs therfore learne to geue God here thankes aright, and so to agnise his exceeding graces powred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, that they beyng shutte vp in the treasure house of our heart, maye in due tyme and season in our lyfe and conuersation, appeare to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of his holye name. Furthermore, for newenesse of lyfe, it is to be noted that Saint Paul wryteth: that we beyng many, are one bread and one body. For all be partakers of one bread.

You shall therefore vnderstande, that the feast of Pentecoste, was alwayes kept the fiftie day after Easter, a great &amp; solempne feast among the Jewes, wherein they dyd celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of their deliueraunce out of Egypt, and also the memoriall of the publishing of the lawe, whiche was geuen vnto them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> vpon that day. It was fyrst ordeyned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be kept holye, not by anye mortall man, but by the mouth of the Lorde him selfe, as we reade in Leuit. 23. &amp; Deut. 16. The place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for the obseruation thereof, was <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> where was great recourse of people from
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:6498:208"/>
all partes of the worlde, as may well appeare in the second Chapter of the Actes, wherein menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of <hi>Parthians, Medes, Elamites,</hi> inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitours of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> inhabitours of <hi>Iurie, Capadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia,</hi> &amp; diuers other such places, whereby we may also partly gather, what great and royal solempnitie was commonly vsed in that feast. Nowe as this was geuen in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to the Jewes in the olde lawe, so dyd our Sauiour Christe, as it <note place="margin">Actes. l.</note> were, confirme the same in the tyme of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ordeyning after a sort, a newe Pentecost for his disciples, namely when he sent downe the holy ghost visiblye in fourme of clouen tongues lyke fyre, and gaue them power to speake in such sort, that euery one myght heare them, and also vnderstand them in his owne language. Which miracle, that it myght be had in perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce, the Church hath thought good, to solemnize and kepe holy this day, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Whitsunday. And here is to be noted, that as the lawe was geuen to the Jewes in the mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the fiftie day after Easter: so was the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, through the myghtie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the holy ghost, geuen to the Apostles in the mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the fiftie day after Easter.</p>
               <p>And hereof this feast hath his name to be called Pentecoste, euen of the number of the dayes. For (as Saint Luke writeth in the actes of the Apostles.) When fiftie dayes were come to an ende, the Disciples beyng altogether with one accorde in one place, the holy ghost came sodenly among them, and sate vpon eche of them, lyke as
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:6498:209"/>
it had ben clouen tongues of fyre. Whiche thing was vndoubtedly done, to teache the Apostles and all other men, that it is he whiche geueth eloquence &amp; vtteraunce in preaching the Gospel, that it is he which openeth the mouth to declare the mightie workes of God, that it is he whiche engendreth a burnyng zeale towardes Goddes worde, and geueth all men a tongue, yea a fierie tongue, so that they may boldly and chearefullye professe the trueth in the face of the whole world, as Esai was indued with this spirite. The Lord <note place="margin">Esai. l.</note> (saith Esai) gaue me a learned &amp; a skilful tongue, so that I might knowe to rayse vp them that are fallen, with the worde. The prophete Dauid cryeth to haue this gyft, saying, Open thou my lippes, O Lorde, and my mouth shall shew forth <note place="margin">Psalm. l.</note> thy prayse. For our sauiour Christe also in the Gospel sayth to his disciples, It is not you that speake, but the spirite of your father whiche is within you. Al whiche testimonies of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do sufficiently declare, that the mysterie in the tongues, betokeneth the preachyng of the <note place="margin">Matth. x.</note> Gospell, and the open confession of the Christian faith, in all them that are possessed with the holy ghost. So that if any man be a dumbe Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not prosessing his fayth openly, but clokyng and colouring hym selfe for feare of daunger in tyme to come, he geueth men occasion, iustly and with good conscience to doubt, least he haue not the grace of the holy ghost within hym, because he is tongue tied, and doth not speake. Thus then haue ye hearde the first institution of this feaste of Pentecoste or Whitsuntide, aswell in the olde
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:6498:209"/>
law among the Jewes, as also in the tyme of the Gospell among the Christians.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs consyder what the holy ghost is, and howe consequently he worketh his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous workes towardes mankind. The holy ghost is a spirituall and diuine substaunce, the thyrde person in the deitie, distincte from the father and the sonne, and yet proceedyng from them both, which thyng to be true, both the Creede of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> beareth witnesse, and may be also easilye proued by most playne testimonies of Gods holy worde. When Christe was baptized of John in the ryuer Jordan, we reade that the holye ghost <note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> came downe infourme of a Doue, and that the father thundred from heauen, saying: This is my deare and welbeloued sonne, in whom I am well pleased. Where note three diuers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct persons, the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost, which all notwithstandyng are not three Gods, but one God. Likewyse, when Christe dyd <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> fyrste institute and ordeyne the sacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, he sent his disciples into the whole world, willyng them to baptize al nations in the name of the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost. And in an other place he sayth: I wyll pray vnto my <note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> father, and he shall geue you another comforter. Agayne, when the comforter shall come whom I wyll sende from my father. &amp;c. These and suche <note place="margin">Iohn. 25.</note> other places of the newe Testament, do so playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euidently confirme the distinction of the holy ghost, from the other persons in the trinitie, that no man possibly can doubt thereof, vnles he will blaspheme the euerlastyng trueth of Gods
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:6498:210"/>
worde. As for his proper nature and substaunce, it is altogether one with God the father, and God the sonne, that is to say, spirituall, eternall, vncreated, incomprehensible, almyghtie, to be short, he is euen God &amp; Lord euerlastyng. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called the spirite of the father, therefore he is sayde to proceede from the father, and the sonne, and therefore he was equally ioyned with them in the commission that the Apostles had to baptize al nations. But that this may appeare more sensibly to the eyes of all men, it shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to come to the other parte, namely to the wonderfull and heauenly workes of the holye ghost, whiche playnely declare vnto the worlde his myghtie and diuine power. Fyrste it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he did wonderfully gouerne and direct the heartes of the patriarkes and prophetes in olde tyme, illuminating their myndes with the knowledge of the true Messias, &amp; geuing them vtteraunce to prophesie of thynges that shoulde come to passe long tyme after. For as saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter witnesseth, the prophesie came not in olde <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> tyme by the wyll of man: But the holye men of God spake as they were moued iuwardly by the holy ghost. And of Zacharie the hygh priest, it is sayde in the Gospell, that he beyng full of the <note place="margin">Luk. 1.</note> holy ghost, prophesied and praysed God. So dyd also Simeon, Anna, Marie, and diuers other, to the great wonder and admiration of all men. Moreouer, was not the holy ghost a mightie worker in the conception and the natiuitie of Christe our sauiour? Saint Matthewe sayth, <note place="margin">Mat. 1.</note> that the blessed virgin was founde with chylde
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:6498:210"/>
of the holy ghost, before Joseph and she came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And the Angell Gabriell dyd expreslye tell her that it shoulde so come to passe, saying: <note place="margin">Luk. 1.</note> The holy ghost shall come vppon thee, and the power of the most hygh shall ouershadowe thee. A marueylous matter, that a woman shoulde conceaue and beare a chylde, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man. But where the holy ghoste wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, there nothyng is vnpossible, as maye fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also appeare by the inwarde regeneration and sanctification of mankynde. When Christe sayde to Nicodemus, vnlesse a man be borne a newe, of water and the spirite, he can not enter into the kyngdome of God: he was greatly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in his mynde, and began to reason with Christe, demaundyng howe a man myght be borne whiche was olde? Can he enter (sayth he) <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> into his mothers wombe agayn, and so be borne a newe? Beholde a liuely paterne of a fleshely and carnall man. He had litle or no intelligence of the holy ghost, and therefore he goeth bluntly to worke, and asketh howe this thyng were possible to be true. Whereas otherwyse, yf he had knowne the great power of the holye ghost in this behalfe, that it is he whiche in wardlye worketh the regeneration and newe byrth of mankynde, he woulde neuer haue marueyled at Christes wordes, but woulde haue rather ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken occasion thereby to prayse and glorifie God. For as there are three seuerall and sundrye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the deitie: So haue they three seuerall and sundrye offices proper vnto eache of them. The father to create, the sonne to redeeme,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:6498:211"/>
the holy ghost to sanctifie and regenerate. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the last, the more it is hidde from our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng, the more it ought to moue all men to wonder at the secrete and mightie workyng of Gods holy spirite whiche is within vs. For it is the holy ghost, and no other thyng, that doth quicken the mindes of men, stirring vp good and godly motions in their heartes, which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the wil &amp; commaundement of God, suche as otherwyse of their owne crooked and peruerse nature they shoulde neuer haue. That whiche is borne of the fleshe (sayth Christe) is fleshe, and <note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> that which is borne of the spirite, is spirite. As who shoulde saye: Man of his owne nature is fleshly and carnal, corrupt and nought, synnefull and disobedient to God, without any sparke of goodnes in hym, without any vertuous or godly motion, onely geuen to euyl thoughtes and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deedes. As for the workes of the spirite, the fruites of fayth, charitable and godly motions, if he haue anye at all in hym, they proceede only of the holy ghost, who is the onlye worker of our sanctification, &amp; maketh vs newe men in Christ Jesu. Dyd not Gods holy spirite miraculously worke in the childe Dauid, when of a poore shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde, he became a princelike prophet? Dyd not <note place="margin">1. Sa. 17.</note> Gods holy spirite miraculously worke in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe, sitting at the receipte of custome, when of a proude Publicane, he became an humble and lowly Euangelist? And who can choose but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle <note place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> to consyder, that Peter shoulde become of a simple fisher, a cheefe and mightie Apostle? Paul of a cruell and bloody persecutour, a faythful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:6498:211"/>
of Christe, to teache the Gentiles. Suche is the power of the holy ghost, to regenerate men, and as it were to bryng them foorth a newe, so that they shalbe nothyng lyke the men that they were before. Neyther doth he thynke it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inwardlye to worke the spirituall and newe byrth of man, vnlesse he do also dwell and abide in hym.

Knowe ye not that your bodies are the temples of the holy ghost, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> you? Agayne he sayth, You are not in the fleshe, but in the spirite. For why? The spirite of God dwelleth in you. To this agreeth the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> of saint John, wrytyng on this wyse: The annoyntyng whiche ye haue receaued (he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.</note> the holy ghost) dwelleth in you. And the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Peter sayth the same, who hath these wordes: The spirite of glory, and of God, resteth <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.</note> vppon you. O what comfort is this to the hearte of a true Christian, to thynke that the holy ghost dwelleth within hym. If God be with vs (as the <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> Apostle sayth) who can be agaynst vs? O but howe shall I knowe that the holy ghost is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, some man perchaunce wyll say? Forsoth, as the tree is knowne by his fruite, so is also the holy ghost. The fruites of the holy ghost (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng <note place="margin">Gala. 5.</note> to the mynde of saint Paule) are these: Loue, ioy, peace, long sufferyng, gentlenes, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, faythfulnesse, meekenes, temperaunce, &amp;c. Contrarywyse, the deedes of the fleshe are these: Adultrie, fornication, vncleannesse, wantonnes, idolatrie, witchcrafte, hatred, debate, emulation,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:6498:212"/>
wrath, contention, sedition, heresie, enuie, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, drunkennesse, gluttonie, and such lyke.</p>
               <p>Here is nowe that glasse wherein thou muste behold thy selfe, and discerne whether thou haue the holy ghost within thee, or the spirite of the fleshe. If thou see that thy workes be vertuous and good, consonant to the prescript rule of gods worde, sauouring and tastyng not of the fleshe, but of the spirite, then assure thy selfe that thou art endued with the holy ghoste. Otherwyse in thynkyng wel of thy selfe, thou doest nothyng els but deceaue thy selfe. The holy ghost doth alwayes declare hym selfe by his fruitefull and gratious gyftes, namely by the worde of wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by the worde of knowledge, whiche is the vnderstandyng of the scriptures, by fayth, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of miracles, by healyng them that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> by prophesie, whiche is the declaration of Gods mysteries, by discerning of spirites, diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of tonges, interpretation of tonges, and so foorth. All whiche gyftes, as they proceede from one spirite, and are seuerally geuen to man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the measurable distribution of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost: Euen so do they bryng men, and not without good cause, into a wonderfull admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods diuine power. Who wyll not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyle at that whiche is wrytten in the Actes of the Apostles, to heare their bolde confession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the counsell at Jerusalem? And to consyder <note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note> that they went away with ioy and gladnesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing that they were counted worthy to suffer rebukes and checkes for the name and fayth of Christe Jesus? This was the myghtie worke of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:6498:212"/>
the holy ghost, who because he geueth patience and ioyfulnesse of heart in temptation and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath therefore worthyly obtayned this name in holye scripture, to be called a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

This was lykewyse the mightie worke of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost, who because he doth instruct the hearts <note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> of the simple in the true knowledge of God and his holy worde, is moste iustly tearmed by this name and title, to be the spirite of trueth. <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

The By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes and other learned men standyng by, were marueylously abashed at the matter, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by his doynges they shoulde be all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and put to open shame. He notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng goeth on, and begynnyng in the name of the Lorde Jesus, brought the Philosopher to suche poynte in the ende, contrary to all
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:6498:213"/>
mens expectation, that he coulde not choose but acknowledge the power of God in his wordes, and to geue place to the trueth. Was not this a miraculous worke, that one seely soule of no learnyng, shoulde do that whiche many byshops of great knowledge and vnderstanding, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer able to bryng to passe? So true is the saying of Bede: Where the holy ghost doth instruct and <note place="margin">Homi. 9. sup. Luca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> teache, there is no delay at al in learnyng. Much more myght here be spoken of the manyfolde gyftes and graces of the holy ghost, moste excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and wonderfull in our eyes. But to make a long discourse through all, the shortnes of tyme wil not serue. And seing ye haue heard the chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, ye may easily conceaue and iudge of the rest. Nowe were it expedient to discusse this question: Whether all they whiche boaste and bragge that they haue the holy ghost, do truely chalenge this vnto them selues, or no? Which doubt, because it is necessarie &amp; profitable, shall (God wylling) be dissolued in the next part of this Homilee. In the meane season, let vs (as we are most bounde) geue heartie thankes to God the father, and his sonne Jesus Christ, for sendyng downe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter into the world, humbly beseeching him, so to worke in our heartes by the power of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirite, that we beyng regenerate and newely borne agayne in all goodnesse, righteousnesse, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie and trueth, may in the end be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of euerlastyng lyfe in his heauenly kyngdome, through Jesus Christe our Lorde and sauiour.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR sauiour Christe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng out of the worlde vnto his father, promised his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <note place="margin">Iohn. 14. 15</note> to sende downe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforter, that shoulde continue with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer, &amp; direct them into al trueth. Which thyng to be faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; truely perfourmed, the scriptures do suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently beare witnes. Neither must we thinke that this comforter was either promised, or els geuen, onlye to the Apostles, but also to the vniuersall Church of Christe, dispearsed through the whole world. For vnles the holy ghost had ben alwaies present, gouernyng and preseruing the Churche from the begynnyng, it coulde neuer haue sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so many and great bruntes of affliction and persecution, with so litle dammage and harme as it hath. And the wordes of Christe are moste playne in this behalfe, saying, that the spirite of <note place="margin">Iohn. 24. Matth. 21.</note> trueth shoulde abyde with them for euer, that he woulde be with them alwayes (he meaneth by grace, vertue, and power) euen to the worldes ende. Also in the prayer that he made to his father a litle before his death, he maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, <note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> not only for him selfe and his apostles, but indifferently for all them that shoulde beleue in hym through their wordes, that is to wit, for
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:6498:214"/>
his whole Churche. Agayne saint Paule sayth: If anye man haue not the spirite of Christe, the <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> same is not his. Also in the wordes folowyng, We haue receaued the spirit of adoption, wherby <note place="margin">Ibidem</note> we crye abba, father. Hereby then it is euident and playne to all men, that the holy ghost was geuen, not onlye to the apostles, but also to the whole body of christes congregation, although not in lyke fourme &amp; maiestie as he came downe at the feaste of Pentecost. But nowe herein stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the controuersie: Whether al men do iustly arrogate to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues the holy ghost, or no? The Byshops of Rome haue for a long tyme made a sore chalenge therunto, reasoning for them seues after this sort. The holy ghost (say they) was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to the Churche, and neuer forsaketh the Church. But we are the cheefe heades, &amp; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of the Churche, therefore we haue the holy ghost for euer, &amp; whatsoeuer thynges we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, are vndoubted verities, and oracles of the holy ghost. That ye may perceaue the weakenes of this argument, it is needfull to teach you, first what the true Churche of Christe is, and then to conferre the Churche of Rome therewith, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne howe well they agree together. The true Churche is an vniuersal congregation, or felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Gods faythfull and elect people, buylt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christe hym selfe beyng the head corner <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> stone. And it hath alwayes three notes or marks wherby it is knowne. Pure and sound doctrine, the sacramentes ministred accordyng to Christes holy institution, and the right vse of ecclesiastical
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:6498:214"/>
discipline. This description of the Churche is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable both to the scriptures of God, and also to the doctrine of the auncient fathers, so that none may iustly fynd fault therewith. Now if ye wyll compare this with the Churche of Rome, not as it was in the begynnnyg, but as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and hath ben for the space of nine hundred yeres and odde: you shall well perceaue the state thereof to be so farre wide from the nature of the true Churche, that nothing can be more. For ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they buylt vppon the foundation of the apostles and prophetes, retaynyng the sound and pure doctrine of Christe Jesu, neyther yet do they order eyther the sacraments, or els the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call keyes, in such sort as he dyd first institute and ordeyne them: But haue so intermyngled their owne traditions and inuentions, by choppyng &amp; chaungyng, by addyng and pluckyng away, that now they may seeme to be conuerted into a new guyse. Christe commended to his Church a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body and blood: They haue changed it into a sacrifice for the quicke and the deade. Christ dyd minister to his apostles, &amp; the apostles to other men, indifferently vnder both kindes: They haue robbed the lay people of the cup, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that for them one kind is sufficient. Christ or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned no other element to be vsed in baptisme, but only water, wherunto when the word is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is made (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) a ful &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">Augusti.</note> sacrament: They beyng wyser in their owne conceipte then Christ, thinke it is not wel nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly done, vnles they vse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iuration, vnles they halow the water, vnles there be oyle, salt, spittle,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:6498:215"/>
tapers and suche other dumbe ceremonies, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to no vse, contrary to the playne rule of. S. Paul, who wylleth all thynges to be done in the Churche vnto edification. Christe ordeyned the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> aucthoritie of the keyes to excommunicate noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sinners, and to absolue them whiche are truely penitent: They abuse this power at their owne pleasure, aswell in cursyng the godly, with bell, booke, and candles, as also in absoluing the reprobate, whiche are knowne to be vnworthy of any Christian societie. Whereof he that lust to see examples, let them searche their lyues. To be shorte, looke what our sauiour Christe pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the Scribes and Pharisees, in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the same may we boldly and with safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science pronounce of the bishops of Rome, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they haue forsaken, &amp; dayly do forsake the commaundementes of God, to erect &amp; set vp their owne constitutions. Which thyng beyng true, as al they which haue any light of Gods word must needes confesse, we may wel conclude according to the rule of <hi>Augustine:</hi> That the byshoppes of Rome &amp; their adherents, are not the true church of Christe, muche lesse then to be taken as cheefe <note place="margin">August. contra Petiliani Donatistae Epi. ca. 4.</note> heades and rulers of the same. Whosoeuer (sayth he) do discent from the scriptures concernyng the head, although they be found in al places where the Church is appoynted, yet are they not in the Churche. A playne place, concluding directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Churche of Rome. Where is now the holy ghost whiche they so stoutly do clayme to them selues? Where is now the spirite of trueth, that wil not suffer them in any wise to erre? If it
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:6498:215"/>
be possible to be there where the true Churche is not, then is it at Rome: otherwyse it is but a vayne bragge, and nothyng els. Saint Paule (as ye haue hearde before) sayth: If anye man haue not the spirite of Christe, the same is not his. And by turnyng the wordes, it maye be as truely sayd: If any man be not of Christe, the same hath not his spirite. Nowe to discerne who are truely his, and who not, we haue this rule geuen vs, that his sheepe do alwayes heare <note place="margin">Iohn. x.</note> his voyce. And saint John sayth: He that is of God, heareth Gods worde. Whereof it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> that the popes in not hearing Christes voyce, as they ought to do, but preferring their owne decrees before the expresse worde of God, do playnely argue to the worlde, that they are not of Christe, nor yet possessed with his spirite. But here they wyll alleage for them selues, that there are diuers necessarie poyntes not expressed in holy scripture, whiche were left to the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy ghost. Who beyng geuen to the Churche, accordyng to Christes promise, hath taught many thynges from tyme to tyme, which <note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> the apostles coulde not then beare. To this we may easily aunswere by the playne wordes of Christe, teachyng vs that the proper office of the holy ghoste is, not to institute and bring in newe ordinaunces, contrary to his doctrine before taught: but to expound &amp; declare those thynges whiche he had before taught: so that they might be wel &amp; truely vnderstode. When the holy ghost <note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> (sayth he) shall come, he shall leade you into all trueth. What trueth doth he meane? Any other
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:6498:216"/>
then he him self had before expressed in his word? No. For he sayth: He shal take of myne, and shew it vnto you. Agayne, he shall bryng you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of all thynges that I haue tolde <note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> you, it is not then the duetie and part of any chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, vnder pretence of the holy ghost, to bryng in his owne dreames and phantasies into the Churche: but he must diligently prouide that his doctrine &amp; decrees be agreeable to Christes holye testament. Otherwise in making the holy ghost the aucthour thereof, he doth blaspheme and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the holy ghost, to his owne condempnation.</p>
               <p>Now to leaue their doctrine, and come to other poyntes. What shall we thynke or iudge of the popes intollerable pryde? The scripture sayth, that God resisteth the proude, and sheweth grace to the humble. Also it pronounceth them blessed, which are poore in spirite, promising that they which humble them selues, shalbe exalted. And Christe our sauiour, wylieth all his to learne of <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> hym, because he is humble and meeke. As for pryde, saint Gregorie sayth, it is the roote of all <note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> mischeefe. And saint Augustines iudgement is this, that it maketh men deuilles. Can any man then, whiche eyther hath or shall reade the popes <note place="margin">Ecclesia.</note> lyues, iustly say that they had the holy ghoste within them? First, as touching that they wil be tearmed vniuersall byshoppes and heades of all Christian Churches through the world, we haue the iudgement of Gregory expresly against them, <note place="margin">Lib. 3. Ep. 76. 78.</note> who wrytyng to <hi>Maritius</hi> the Emperour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth John, bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in that behalfe, calling him the prince of pryde, Lucifers

successour, and the forerunner of Antechriste. Saint <hi>Barnarde</hi> also agreeing thereunto, sayth, <note place="margin">Serm. 3. de resur. dom.</note> What greater pride can there be, then that one man should preferre his owne iudgement before the whole congregation, as though he onlye had the spirite of God? And <hi>Chrisostome</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a terrible sentence agaynst them, affyrming <note place="margin">Dialogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. lib. 3.</note> playnly, that whosoeuer seeketh to be cheefe in earth, shall finde confusion in heauen, and that he whiche striueth for the supremacie, shall not be reputed among the seruauntes of Christe. Agayne he sayth: To desire a good worke, it is good, but to couet the cheefe degree of honour, it <note place="margin">Chrisost. sup. Mat.</note> is mere vanitie. Do not these places sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuince their outragious pride, in vsurping to them selues a superioritie aboue all other, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well ministers and byshops, as kynges also and Emperours? But as the Lion is knowne by his clawes, so let vs learne to knowe these men by their deedes. What shall we say of hym that <note place="margin">Sabelli. Ennead. 9. Lib. 7.</note> made the noble kyng <hi>Dandalus</hi> to be tyed by the necke with a chayne, and to lye flat downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his table, there to gnaw bones lyke a dogge? Shal we thynke that he had Gods holy spirite within hym? and not rather the spirite of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil? Such a tyraunt was pope <hi>Clement</hi> the sixt. What shall we say of hym that proudly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously trode <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Emperour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feete, applying the vearse of the Psalme vnto him selfe: Thou shalt go vpon the Lion and <note place="margin">Psal. 60.</note> the Adder, the young Lion &amp; the Dragon thou shalt tread vnder thy foote? Shal we say that he had Gods holy spirite within hym? &amp; not rather
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:6498:217"/>
the spirite of the deuyll? Suche a tyraunt was pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the thirde. What shall we say of him that armed and animated the sonne against the father, causing him to be taken, &amp; to be cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly famished to death, contrary to the law both God, and also of nature?

Shal we say that he had Gods holy spirite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hym? and not rather the spirite of the deuyll? Suche a tyraunt was pope <hi>Hildebrande,</hi> moste worthy to be called a fyrebrand, if we shal tearme him as he hath best deserued. Many other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might here be alleaged. As of pope Jone the harlot, that was delyuered of a chylde in the hygh streate, goyng solempnly in procession. Of pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the seconde, that wilfully cast Saint Peters keyes into the ryuer <hi>Tiberis.</hi> Ofpope <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixte, that caused fiue Cardinals to be put in sackes and cruelly drowned.

                  <hi>Formosius</hi> his predecessour, when it had ben bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eight yeres. Of Pope John the. xiiii. of that name, who hauing his enemy deliuered into his handes, caused him first to be stripped starke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, his beard to be shauen, and to be hanged vp a whole day by the heere, then to be set vpon an Asse with his face backward towardes the taile, to be caryed round about the Citie in dispite, to be miserablye beaten with roddes, laste of all, to be thrust out of his countrye, and to be banished for euer. But to conclude and make an ende, ye shall breefly take this shorte lesson, Wheresoeuer ye fynde the spirite of arrogancye and pryde, the spirite of enuye, hatred, contention, crueltie, murder, extortion, witchcraft, necromancie. &amp;c. Assure your selues that there is the spirite of the deuill, and not of God, albeit they pretende out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the worlde neuer so muche holinesse. For as the Gospell teacheth vs, the spirit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is a good spirit, an holy spirit, a sweete spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, a lowely spirite, a mercifull spirite, full of charitie and loue, ful of forgeuenes and pitie, not rendring euil for euill, extremitie for extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but ouercomming euill with good, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all offence euen from the heart. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to which rule, if any man liue vprightly, of him it may be safely pronounced that he hath the holy ghost within him. If not, then it is a plaine token that he doth vsurpe the name of the holye ghost in vaine. Therfore (dearely beloued) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good councel of S. John, beleue not <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4.</note> euery spirite, but firste trie them whether they <note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> be of God or no. Manye shall come in my name

But the rule that ye must folowe, is this, to iudge them by their fruites.

This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience sawe Dauid in his dayes. For in his Psalme he saith: Behold, they which withdrawe them selues from thee, shall perishe, for thou hast destroyed them all that are strayed from thee. <note place="margin">Psal. 72.</note>

This experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was perceaued to be true, of that holy prophete Jeremie: O Lord (sayth he) what <note place="margin">Iere. 17.</note> soeuer they be that forsake thee, shalbe confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they that depart from thee, shalbe written in the earth and soone forgotten. It profiteth not (good people) to heare the goodnes of God decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs, if our heartes be not inflamed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to honour &amp; thanke hym. It profited not the Jewes whiche were Gods elect people, to here much of God, seyng that he was not receaued in their heartes by fayth, nor thanked for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites bestowed vpon them, their vnthankfulnes was the cause of their destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let vs esche we the maner of these before rehearsed, and folowe rather the example of that holye Apostle Saint <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> Paul, whiche when in a deepe meditation he dyd beholde the marueylous proceedinges of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtie God, and consydered his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the ordering of his creatures, he brast out into this conclusion: Surely (sayth he) of hym, by hym, and in him, be al thinges. And this once pronounced, he stacke not still at this poynt, but forthwith therupon ioyned to these wordes: To him be glory &amp; prayse for euer, Amen. Uppon the grounde of which wordes of Saint Paul (good audience) I purpose to builde my exhortation of this day vnto you. Wherein I shall do my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, first to proue vnto you that al good things commeth downe vnto vs from aboue from the father of lyght. Secondly, that Jesus Christ his sonne, and our sauiour, is the meane by whom we receaue his liberall goodnesse. Thirdly, that in the power and vertue of the holy ghost, we be
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:6498:220"/>
made meete and able to receaue his giftes &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Which thinges distinctly &amp; aduisedly consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in our myndes, must needes compell vs in most low reuerence, after our bounden duety, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to render him thankes againe, in some te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of our good hearts, for his deserts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. And that the entreating of this matter in hand may be to the glory of almighty God, let vs in one faith and charitie call vpon the father of mercy, from whom commeth euery good gyfte, and euery perfect gift, by the mediation of his welbeloued sonne our sauiour, that we maye be assisted with the presence of his holye spirite, and holsomelye on both our partes, to demeane our selues in speaking and hearing, to the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our soules. In the beginning of my spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto you (good Christian people) suppose not that I do take vpon me, to declare vnto you the excellent power, or the incomparable wisdom of almightie God, as though I would haue you beleeue that it myght be expressed vnto you by wordes. Nay it maye not be thought, that that thing maye be comprehended by mans wordes, that is incomprehensible. And too muche arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie it were for dust and ashes, to thynke that he could worthyly declare his maker. It passeth farre the darke vnderstanding of wysedome of a mortall man, to speake sufficiently of that diuine maiestie whiche the Angels cannot vnderstand. We shall therefore lay apart to speake of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde and vnsearcheable nature of almightie God, rather acknowledging our weaknes, then rashely to attempt that is aboue all mans capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:6498:220"/>
to compasse. It shall better suffise vs in low humilitie to reuerence and dreade his maiestie, whiche we can not comprise, then by ouermuch curious searchyng, to be ouercharged with the glorie. We shal rather turne our whole contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, to aunswer a whyle his goodnes to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vs, wherein we shall be muche more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly occupied, and more may we be bold to search. To consyder this great power he is of, can but make vs dreade and feare. To consyder his hygh wisedome, myght vtterly discomfort our frailtie to haue any thyng adoo with him. But in consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his inestimable goodnes, we take good heart agayne to trust wel vnto hym. By his goodnes we be assured to take him for our refuge, our hope and comfort, our mercyfull father, in all the course of our lyues. His power and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, compelleth vs to take hym for God omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, inuisible, hauyng rule in heauen and earth, hauyng all thynges in his subiection, and wyll haue none in counsell with hym, nor any to aske the reason of his doyng. For he maye do <note place="margin">Daniel. xi.</note> what lyketh hym, and none can resist hym. For he worketh all thynges in his secrete iudgement to his owne pleasure, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation saith Salomon. By the reason of this nature, he is called in Scripture, consumyng <note place="margin">Prou. xvi. Heb. xi.</note> fyre, he is called a terrible and fearefull GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of this behalfe therefore, we maye haue no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie, no accesse vnto hym, but his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse agayne tempereth the rigour of his hygh power, and maketh vs bolde, and putteth vs in hope that he wyll be conuersaunt with vs,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:6498:221"/>
and easye vnto vs. It is his goodnesse that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to say in scripture: It is my delyght to be with the children of men. It is his goodnesse <note place="margin">Prou. 8.</note> that moueth him to call vs vnto him, to offer vs his frendship &amp; presence. It is his goodnes that paciently suffereth our straying from him, and suffreth vs long, to winne vs to repentaunce. It is of his goodnes that we be created reasonable creatures, where els he myght haue made vs bruite beastes. It was his mercye to haue vs borne among the number of christian people, &amp; thereby in a muche more nyghnes to saluation, where we might haue ben borne (if his goodnes had not ben) among the Panims, cleane voyde from God, and the hope of euerlasting lyfe. And what other thing doth his louyng and gentle voyce spoken in his worde, where he calleth vs to his presence &amp; frendship, but declare his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, onelye without regarde of our worthynes? And what other thing doth stirre him to call vs to him, when we be straied from him, to suffer vs paciently, to win vs to repentaunce: but onelye his singuler goodnes, no whit of our deseruyng? Let them all come together that be nowe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in heauen, and let vs heare what aunswere they will make in these poyntes afore rehearsed, whether their fyrst creation was in Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or of them selues. Forsooth Dauid woulde make aunswere for them all and say: Knowe ye for suretie, euen the Lorde is God, he hath made vs, and not we our selues. If they were asked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, who should be thanked for their regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? for theyr iustification? and for their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:6498:221"/>
whether their desertes? or Gods goodnes only? Although in this poynt, euery one confesse sufficiently the truth of this matter in his owne person: yet let Dauid aunswere by the mouth of them all at this tyme, who cannot choose but saye: Not to vs, O Lord, not to vs, but to thy name geue all the thanke, for thy louyng mercy, and for thy truethes sake. If we shoulde aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, from whence came their glorious workes and deedes, which they wrought in their lyues, wherewith God was so hyghly pleased and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by them? Let some other witnesse be brought in, to testifie this matter, that in the mouth of two or three may the truth be knowen. Ueryly that holy prophete Esai beareth recorde, <note place="margin">Esai. 26.</note> and sayeth: O Lord, it is thou of thy goodnesse that hast wrought all our workes in vs, not we our selues. And to vpholde the truth of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, agaynst all iusticiaries and hipocrites, which rob almyghty God of his honour, and ascribe it to them selues, saynt Paule bringeth in his <note place="margin">i. Cor. 3.</note> beleefe: We be not (sayeth he) sufficient of our selues, as of our selues once to thinke any thing: but all our ablenes is of Gods goodnes. For he it is in whom we haue all our beyng, our lyuing, <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> and mouing. If ye wil know furthermore, where they had their gyftes and sacrifices, which they offred continually in their liues to almighty god, they cannot but agree with Dauid, where he sayth: Of thy liberal hand, O Lord, we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that we gaue vnto thee. If this holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany therfore confesseth so constantly, that al the goodes and graces wherewith they were indued
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:6498:222"/>
in soule, came of the goodnes of God only: what more can be sayde to proue that all that is good, commeth from almightie God? Is it meete to thynke that all spiritual goodnes commeth from God aboue onely: and that other good thinges, eyther of nature or of fortune (as we call them) commeth of any other cause? Doeth God of his goodnes adourne the soule, with all the powers thereof, as it is: and commeth the giftes of the body, wherwith it is indued, from any other? If he doth the more, can not he do the lesse? To iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a synner, to newe create hym from a wicked person to a ryghteous man, is a greater act (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth S. <hi>Augustine)</hi> then to make such a new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth as is alredy made. We must nedes agree, that whatsoeuer good thyng is in vs, of grace, of nature, or of fortune, is of God only, as the only aucthour &amp; worker. And yet it is not to be thought, that God hath created al this whole vniuersall worlde as it is, and thus once made, hath geuen it vp to be ruled and vsed after our owne wittes &amp; deuice, &amp; so taketh no more charge therfore. As we see the ship wright, after he hath brought his ship to a perfect end, then delyuereth he it to the maryners, &amp; taketh no more cure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Nay God hath not so created the worlde, that he is carelesse of it: but he styl preserueth it by his goodnes, he styll stayeth it in his creation. For els without his speciall goodnes, it coulde not stande long in his condition. And therfore saint Paule sayth, that he preserueth all thynges, and <note place="margin">Heb. i. Heb. iii.</note> beareth them vp styl in his word, left they should fall without hym to their nothing againe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:6498:222"/>
of they were made. If his speciall goodnes were not euery where present, euery creature shoulde be out of order, and no creature should haue his propertie wherein he was firste created. Hee is therfore inuisible euery where, and in euery cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, and fulfilleth both heauen and earth with his presence. In the fyre, to geue heate, in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to geue moysture, in the earth, to geue fruit, in the hart, to geue his strength, yea in our bread and drinke he is, to geue vs norishment, where without him the bread and drynke cannot geue sustinaunce, nor the hearbe health, as the wyse man plainly confesseth it, saying: It is not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of fruites that feedeth men, but it is thy <note place="margin">Sapi. 18.</note> worde (O Lorde) whiche preserueth them that trust in thee. And Moyses agreeth to the same, when he sayeth: Mans lyfe resteth not in bread <note place="margin">Deut. 8.</note> onely, but in euery word which proceedeth out of Gods mouth. It is neyther the hearbe nor the plaster, that geueth health of themselues, but thy worde, O Lord (sayth the wyse man) which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">Sapi. 17.</note> all thinges. It is not therefore the power of the creatures which worketh their effectes, but the goodnes of God which worketh in them. In his worde truely doth al thinges consist. By that same word that heauen and earth were made, by the same are they vpholden, maynteyned, &amp; kept in order (sayth saynt Peter) &amp; shall be till almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">i. Pet. 3.</note> God shall withdrawe his power from them, and speake their dissolution. If it were not thus, that the goodnes of God were effectuallye in his ceratures to rule them, howe coulde it be that the maine sea, so ragyng and labouring to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:6498:223"/>
the earth, could be kept within his bondes and banks as it is? That holy man Job euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye spyed the goodnes of God in this poynt, and confessed, that if he had not a speciall goodnes to the preseruation of the earth, it coulde not but shortly be ouerflowed of the sea. Howe coulde it be that the elementes, so dyuers and contrary as they be among them selues, should yet agree and abyde together in a concorde, without destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of another to serue our vse, if it came not onely of Gods goodnes so to temper them? How could the fyre not burne and consume al things, if it were left loose to go whyther it woulde, and not stayed in his sphere by the goodnesse of God, measurably to heate these inferiour creatures to their ryping? Consyder the huge substaunce of the earth, so heauye and great as it is: Howe coulde it so stande stablye in the place as it doth, if Gods goodnes reserued it not so for vs to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle on? It is thou O Lorde (sayeth Dauid) <note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> which haste founded the earth in his stabilitie, and duryng thy worde, it shall neuer reele or fall downe. Consyder the great strong beastes and fyshes, farre passing the strength of man, howe fierce so euer they be and strong, yet by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God they preuayle not agaynst vs, but are vnder our subiection, and serue our vse. Of whom came the inuention thus to subdue them, and make them fit for our commodities? Was it by mans braine? Nay rather this inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion came by the goodnes of God, which inspyred mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandyng to haue his purpose of euerye crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Who was it (sayth Job) that put will and <note place="margin">Iob. 33.</note>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:6498:223"/>
wisdom in mans head, but god only of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? And as the same saith agayne, I perceaue that euery man hath a minde: but it is the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the almightie that geueth vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It could not be veryly (good Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that man of his owne wit vnholpen, should inuent so many and dyuers deuyses in al craftes &amp; sciences, except the goodnes of almyghtye God had ben present with men, and had stirred their wittes and studies of purpose, to knowe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and disposition of all his creatures, to serue vs sufficiently in our needs and necessities. Yea, not only to serue our necessities, but to serue our pleasures and delight, more then necessitie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. So liberall is Gods goodnes to vs, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to thanke him, if any heartes we haue. The wise man in his contemplation by him self, coulde not but graunt this thing to be true that I reason vnto you. In his handes (sayth he) be we and our wordes, and al our wisdom, and al our sciences and workes of knowledge. For it is he that gaue me the true instruction of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <note place="margin">Sapi. 7.</note> both to know the disposition of the world, and the vertues of the elementes, the beginning and ende of tymes, the change and diuersities of them, the course of the yere, the order of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> starres, the natures of beastes, and the powers of them, the power of the windes, and thoughtes of men, the differences of planets, the vertue of rootes, and what soeuer is hid and secrete in nature, I learned it. The artificer of all these taught me this wisdome. And further he sayeth: Who can <note place="margin">Sapi. 9.</note> searche out the thinges that be in heauen? for it
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:6498:224"/>
is harde for vs to searche suche thinges as be on earth, and in dayly sight afore vs. For our wits <note place="margin">Sapi. 9.</note> and thoughtes (sayth he) be imperfect, and our pollicies vncertaine: No man can therfore search out the meaning in these things, except thou ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest wisdome, and sendest thy spirit from aboue. If the wise man thus confesseth all these thinges to be of God, why should not we acknowledge it? and by the knowledge of it, consyder our dutye to Godward, and geue him thanks for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? I perceaue that I am farre here ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the plentie and copye of matter, that myght be brought in for the proofe of this cause. If I should enter to shewe howe the goodnesse of almightie god appeared euery where in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the worlde, howe marueylous they be in their creation, howe beawtified in their order, howe necessary they be to our vse, all with one voyce muste needes graunt their aucthour to be none other but almighty God, his goodnes must they needes extoll and magnifie euery where, to whom be all honour and glory for euermore.</p>

Now then consyder, good people, if any aucthour there be of suche thinges concurraunt with mans labour and indeuour, were it meete to ascribe them to any other then to God? as the Panim Philosophers and Poets did erre, which toke Fortune, and made her a Goddesse to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for such thynges?

Can a man hide him selfe in so secrete a corner, that I shall not see him? Do not I fulfill and replenishe both heauen &amp; earth, sayth the Lorde? whiche of these two shoulde be most beleued? Fortune, whom they paynte to be blynde of both eyes, euer vnstable &amp; vnconstant in her wheele, in whose handes they saye these thyngs be? Or God, in whose hand and power these thynges be in deede, who for his truth and constance was yet neuer reproued? For his sight loketh thorowe heauen and earth, and seeth all thinges presently with his eyes.

all health, wealth, &amp; prosperitie, of the which we shoulde haue no part without his liberal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution, and except it came from hym aboue.

Nowe yf any man wyll aske, What shal it auayle vs to knowe that euery good gyft, as of nature and fortune (so called) and euery perfecte gyft, as of grace, concernyng the soule, to be of God, and that it is his gyft onlye? Forsoothe for many causes is it conuenient for vs to knowe it. For so shall we knowe (if we confesse the trueth) who ought iustly to be thanked for them.

As the wyse man in the want of such a lyke gyft, made his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to God for it, as he testifieth in his booke. After I knew (sayth he) that otherwyse I coulde <note place="margin">Sapi. x.</note> not be chast, except God graunted it, (and this was as he there wryteth, hye wysdome to know whose gyft it was) I made haste to the Lorde, &amp; earnestly besought hym, euen from the rootes of my heart, to haue it. I woulde to God (my frendes) that in our wantes and necessities, we would go to God, as saint James biddeth, &amp; as the wyse man teacheth vs that he dyd. I woulde we beleued stedfastly that God only geues them: If we did, we would not seeke our want and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the deuil and his ministers so oft as we do, as dayly experience declareth it. For yf we stand in necessitie of corporal health, whyther go the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, but to charmes, witchcraftes, and other delusions of the deuill? If we knewe
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:6498:226"/>
that god were thaucthour of this gift, we would only vse his meanes appoynted, and bide his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, till he thought it good for vs to haue it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. If the marchaunt and worldlye occupyer knewe that God is the geuer of riches, he would content himself with so much as by iust meanes appproued of God he could get to his liuing, and woulde be no rycher then trueth woulde suffer hym, he woulde neuer procure his gayne &amp; aske his goodes at the deuils hande. God forbyd ye wyll say, that any man should take his ryches of the deuill. Ueryly so manye as increase them selues by vsurie, by extortion, by periurie, by stealth, by deceytes and crafte, they haue theyr goodes of the deuils gyfte. And all they that geue them selues to suche meanes, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the true meanes that god hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, haue forsaken him, and are become worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the deuill, to haue their lukers and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntages. They be suche as kneele downe to the deuill at his bidding, and worship hym. For he promiseth them for so doyng, that he wyll geue them the worlde, and the goodes therein. They can not otherwyse better serue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll, then to do his pleasure and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And his motion and wyll it is, to haue vs forsake the trueth, and betake vs to falshood, to lyes and periuries. They therefore whiche bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth perfectly in theyr hearte that God is to be honoured, and requested for the gyft of all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges necessarie, woulde vse no other meanes to relieue their necessities but trueth and veritie, and woulde serue GOD to haue competencie
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:6498:227"/>
of all thinges necessarie. The man in his neede would not relieue his want by stealth. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would not relieue her necessitie and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by geuing her bodye to other in adulterie for gayne. If God be the aucthour in deede, of lyfe, health, richesse, and welfare, let vs make our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to him, as the aucthour, and we shal haue it, sayth Saint James. Yea it is hie wysdome by the wyse man therfore to knowe whose gyft it is. For manye other skilles it is wysdome to knowe and beleue that al goodnes and graces be of god, as the aucthour. Whiche thing well consydered, must needes make vs thinke that we shall make accompt for that whiche God geueth vs to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and therefore shall make vs to be more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent well to spende them to gods glorye, and to the profite of our neyghbour, that we may make a good accompt at the last, &amp; be praysed for good stewardes, that we maye heare these wordes of our iudge: Well done good seruaunt &amp; faythfull, <note place="margin">Mat. xxiiii</note> thou hast ben faythfull in litle, I wyl make thee ruler ouer much, go in into thy maisters ioy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, to beleue certaynely god to be the aucthour of all the giftes that we haue, shal make vs to be in scilence &amp; pacience when they be taken againe from vs. For as God of his mercie doth graunt vs them to vse: So other whyles he doth iustlye take them againe from vs, to proue our pacience, to exercise our fayth, and by the meanes of the taking away of a few, to bestow the more ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those that remayne, to teache vs to vse them the more to his glory, after he geueth them to vs agayne. Many there be that with mouth can
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:6498:227"/>
say that they beleue that God is the aucthour of euery good gifte that they haue: but in the tyme of temptation they go backe from this beliefe. They say it in worde, but deny it in deede. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder me the vsage of the worlde, &amp; see whether it be not true. Beholde the riche man that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with substaunce, yf by anye aduersitie his goodes be taken from hym, howe fumeth and fretteth he? how murmureth he and dispaireth? He that hath the gyft of good reputation, yf his name be anye thing touched by the detractour, howe vnquiet is he? howe busie to reuenge his despite? If a man hath the gyft of wysdome, and fortune to be taken of some euyll wyller for a foole, &amp; is so reported: howe much doth it greeue hym to be so esteemed? Thinke ye that these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue constantly that God is the aucthour of these giftes? If they beleue it veryly, why shoulde they not patiently suffer God to take away his giftes agayne, whiche he gaue them freely, and lent for a time? But ye wyl say, I could be content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to God such giftes, yf he toke them agayne from me: But nowe are they taken from me by euyll chaunces and false shrewes, by naughtye wretches, how should I take this thing patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye? To this may be aunswered, that almightye God is of his nature inuisible, &amp; commeth to no man visiblye after the maner of man, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his giftes that he lent. But in this poynt whatsoeuer God doth, he bryngeth it about by his instrumentes ordeyned therto. He hath good angels, he hath euill angels, he hath good men, and he hath euyll men, he hath hayle and rayne,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:6498:228"/>
he hath winde and thunder, he hath heate and colde. Innumerable instrumentes hath he, and messengers, by whom agayne he asketh suche giftes as he committeth to our trust, as the wyse man confesseth, The creature must needes waite to serue his maker, to be fierce agaynst vniust <note place="margin">Sapi. xvii.</note> men to their punishment. For as the same auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour sayth, He armeth the creature, to reuenge his enemies. And otherwhiles to the probation of our fayth, styrreth he vp suche stormes. And therfore by what meane and instrument soeuer God takes from vs his giftes, we must patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take gods iudgement in worth, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be the taker &amp; geuer, as Job sayth: The Lorde gaue, and the Lorde toke, when yet <note place="margin">Iob. i.</note> his enemies draue his cattell away, &amp; when the deuill slue his chyldren, and afflicted his bodye with a greeuous sicknes. Such meekenesse was in that holy king and prophete Dauid, when he was reuyled of <hi>Semei,</hi> in the presence of all his hoast, he toke it patiently, &amp; reuyled not agayne. But as confessing God to be the aucthour of his innocencie &amp; good name, and offering it to be at his pleasure: Let hym alone (sayth he to one of <note place="margin">

Reg. xvi.</note> his knightes that woulde haue reuenged suche despite) for God hath commaunded hym to curse Dauid, and peraduenture God intendeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to render me some good turne for this curse of him to day. And though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minister otherwhyses doth euill in his acte, proceedyng of malice, yet forasmuch as God turneth his euil act to a profe of our pacience, we shoulde rather submit our selfe in patience, then to haue indignation at

gods rod, which peraduenture whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vs to our nurture, he wyll cast it into the fire as it deserueth. Let vs in lyke maner truely acknowledge all our gyftes and prerogatiues, to be so gods giftes, that we shalbe ready to resigne them vp at his wyll and pleasure againe. Let vs throughout our whole lyues confesse all good thinges to come of God, of what name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture soeuer they be, not of these corruptible thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges only, whereof I haue nowe last spoken, but much more of all spiritual graces behoueable for our soule, without whose goodnesse no man is called to fayth, or stayed therein, as I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in the next part of this Homilee declare to you. In the meane season forget not what hath alredy ben spoken to you, forget not to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in your iudgementes to the trueth of this doctrine, and forget not to practise the same in the whole state of your lyfe, whereby ye shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessing promised by our sauiour Christ: Blessed be they which heare the word of God, &amp; fulfilleth it in lyfe.

and heare what is testified fyrst of the gyfte of faith, the first entrie into the Christian life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which no man can please God. For S. Paul confesseth it plainely to be Gods gyft, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Ephes. ii.</note> Fayth is the gyft of God. And agayne saint Peter sayth, It is of Gods power that ye be kept <note place="margin">i. Pet. i.</note> through fayth to saluation. It is of the goodnes of god that we faulter not in our hope vnto him. It is verily gods worke in vs, the charitie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we loue our brethren. If after our fall we repent, it is by him that we repent, whiche rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth foorth his mercifull hande to rayse vs vp. If any wyll we haue to ryse, it is he that preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth our wyll, &amp; disposeth vs therto. If after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition we feele our conscience at peace with god, through remission of our sinne, and so be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled againe to his fauour, and hope to be his children &amp; inheritours of euerlasting lyfe: who worketh these great myracles in vs, our worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, our deseruinges &amp; endeuours, our wittes, and vertue? Nay veryly. Saint Paul wyll not suffer fleshe and clay to presume to such arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; therfore sayth, All is of God, which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vs to hym selfe by Jesus Christe. For God was in Christe when he reconciled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world vnto him selfe. GOD the father of all mercie, wrought this high benefite vnto vs, not by his owne person: but by a meane, by no lesse meane then his only beloued sonne, whom he spared not from any payne &amp; trauayle that myght do vs good. For vpon him he put our sinnes, vpon him he made our raunsome, hym he made the meane betwixt vs &amp; him selfe, whose mediation was so
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:6498:229"/>
acceptable to GOD the father, through his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and perfect obedience, that he toke his acte for a full satisfaction of all our disobedience &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, whose ryghteousnesse he toke to waye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst our sinnes, whose redemption he would haue stande agaynst our dampnation. In this poynt, what haue we to muse within our selues good freendes? I thinke no lesse then that which saint Paul sayde, in the remembraunce of this wonderfull goodnesse of God, Thankes be to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie <note place="margin">Rom. vii.</note> God, through Christe Jesus our Lorde: for it is he for whose sake we receaued this hygh gyft of grace. For as by him (beyng the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng <note place="margin">Ephes. i.</note> wysdome) he wrought all the worlde and that is contayned therein: So by him only, and wholy woulde he haue all thynges restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne in heauen and in earth. By this our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly mediatour therefore, do we knowe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and mercie of God the father, by him know <note place="margin">Hebr. i.</note> we his wyll and pleasure towardes vs, for he is the brightnesse of his fathers glorye, and a verye <note place="margin">Mat. iii.</note> cleare image and paterne of his substaunce. It is he whom the father in heauen delyghteth to haue for his welbeloued sonne, whom he auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised to be our teacher, whom he charged vs to heare, saying, Heare him. It is he by whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. i.</note> father of heauen doth blesse vs with all spiritual and heauenly giftes, for whose sake and fauour (writeth saint John) we haue receaued grace &amp; <note place="margin">Iohn. i.</note> fauour. To this our sauiour &amp; mediatour hath God the father geuen the power of heauen and earth, and the whole iurisdiction &amp; aucthoritie, to distribute his goodes and gyftes committed to
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:6498:230"/>
hym. For so wryteth the apostle: To euery one of vs is grace geuen, accordyng to the measure of <note place="margin">Ephes. iiii.</note> Christes geuing. And thereupon to execute his aucthoritie committed, after that he had brought sinne and the deuill to captiuitie, to be no more hurtfull to his members, he ascended vp to his father agayne, &amp; from thence sent liberall gyftes to his welbeloued seruauntes, and hath styll the power to the worldes ende to distribute his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers giftes continually in his Churche, to the establishment and comfort thereof. And by hym hath almyghtie God decreed to dissolue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, to call al before him, to iudge both the quicke and the dead, and finally by hym shall he condempne the wicked to eternall fyre in hell, and geue the good eternall lyfe, and set them assuredly in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with hym in heauen for euermore. Thus ye see how all is of God, by his sonne Christe our Lord and sauiour. Remember I say once againe your duetie of thankes, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be neuer to want, still ioyne your selfe to continue in thankes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, ye can offer to God ne better sacrifice. For he sayth hym selfe: It is the sacrifice of prayse and thankes that shall honour me. Which thyng was well perceaued of that holy prophete Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, when he so earnestly spake to him selfe thus: O my soule blesse thou the Lorde, and all that is <note place="margin">Psalm. l.</note> within me blesse his holy name. I say once again O my soule blesse thou the Lorde, &amp; neuer forget <note place="margin">Psal. ciii.</note> his manifolde rewardes. God geue vs grace (good people) to know these things, &amp; to feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our heartes. This knowledge and feeling is not in our selfe, by our selfe it is not possible to
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:6498:230"/>
come by it, a great pitie it were that we shoulde lose so profitable knowledge. Let vs therefore meekely cal vpon that bountiful spirite the holy ghost, which proceedeth from our father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; from our mediatour Christ, that he woulde assist vs, and inspire vs with his presence, that in him we may be able to heare the goodnes of god declared vnto vs to our saluation. For without his liuely &amp; secrete inspiration, can we not once so muche as speake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of our mediatour, as saint Paul plainely testifieth: No man can once name our Lorde Jesus Christe, but in the holye ghost. Much lesse shoulde we be able to beleue &amp; knowe these great mysteries that be opened to vs by Christe. Saint Paul sayth, that no man <note place="margin">i. Cor. xii.</note> can knowe what is of god, but the spirite of god. As for vs (sayth he) we haue receaued not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the world, but the spirite which is of god, <note place="margin">i. Cor. ii.</note> for this purpose: that in that holye spirite we myght knowe the thynges that be geuen vs by Christe. The wyse man sayth, that in the power &amp; vertue of the holy ghost, resteth al wysdome, &amp; al habilitie to know God, and to please hym. For he writeth thus: Be know that it is not in mans power to guide his goinges. No man can know thy pleasure except thou geuest wysdome, &amp; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thy holy spirite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue. Send him downe <note place="margin">Sapi. ix.</note> therefore (prayeth he to God) from thy holy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, &amp; from the trone of thy maiestie, that he may be with me and labour with me, that so I may knowe what is acceptable before thee. Let vs with so good heart pray, as he dyd, &amp; we shall not faile but to haue his assistance. For he is sone
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:6498:231"/>
seene of them that loue him, he wyll be founde of them that seeke him: For very liberall and gentle is the spirite of wisdome. In his power shall we haue sufficient abilitie to knowe our duetie to God, in him shall we be comforted and couraged to walke in our duetie, in hym shall we be meete vessels to receaue the grace of almightie God: for it is he that purgeth and purifieth the minde by his secrete working. And he onlye is present eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where by his inuisible power and conteineth all thinges in his dominion. He lyghtneth the heart to conceaue worthy thoughtes to almygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, he sitteth in the tongue of man to stirre him to speake his honour, no language is hyd from him, for he hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of al speache, he only ministreth spiritual strength to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our soule &amp; body. To hold the way whiche God had prepared for vs, to walke ryghtly in our iourney, we must acknowledge that it is in the power of his spirite which helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. That we may boldly come in prayer, and call vpon almyghtie God as our father, it is by this holy spirite, whiche maketh intercession for vs with continuall sighes. If any gyft we haue <note place="margin">Galat. iiii. Rom. viii.</note> wherewith we may worke to the glory of God, &amp; profite of our neyghbour, all is wrought by his owne &amp; selfe same spirite, whiche maketh his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributions peculierly to euerye man as he wyl. <note place="margin">i. Cor. xii.</note> If any wysdome we haue, it is not of our selues, we can not glory therein as begun of our selues, but we ought to glory in God from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it came to vs, as the prophete Jeremie wryteth: Let him <note place="margin">Ierem. ix.</note> that reioyceth, reioyce in this, that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:6498:231"/>
&amp; knoweth me, for I am the lord which sheweth mercie, iudgement, and righteousnes in the earth, for in these thinges I delight saith the Lorde. This wysdome can not be attayned, but by the direction of the spirite of God, &amp; therefore it is called spiritual wysdome. And no where can we more certainely searche for the knowledge of this wyll of God (by the which we must direct al our workes &amp; deedes) but in the holy scriptures, for they be they that testifie of hym, sayth our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christe. It maye be called knowledge and <note place="margin">Iohn. v.</note> learnyng that is other where gotten out of the worde: but the wyse man plainely testifieth, that <note place="margin">Sap. xiii.</note> they al be but vaine which haue not in them the wisdome of God. We see to what vanitie the olde Philosophers came, which were destitute of this science, gotten &amp; searched for in his worde. We see what vanitie the schole doctrine is mixed with, for that in this world they sought not the wyll of God, but rather the wyll of reason, the trade of custome, the path of the fathers, the practise of the Churche. Let vs therfore reade &amp; reuolue the holy scripture both day &amp; nyght: for blessed is he <note place="margin">Psalm. i. Psal. cxix.</note> that hath his whole meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therin. It is that that geueth light to our feete to walke by. It is that whiche geueth wysdome to the simple and <note place="margin">Psal. xix.</note> ignoraunt. In it may we finde eternall lyfe. In the holy scriptures find we Christ, in Christ find <note place="margin">Iohn. v.</note> we God: for he it is that is the expresse image of the father. He that seeth Christ, seeth the father. <note place="margin">Hebre. i. Iohn. xiiii Hierome.</note> And contrary wyse, as Saint Hierome sayth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignorance of scripture, is the ignorance of Christ. Not to knowe Christ, is to be in darknesse, in the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:6498:232"/>
middes of our worldly and carnal light of reason and philosophie. To be without Christe, is to be <note place="margin">Colloss. ii.</note> in foolishnes: For he is the only wysdome of the father, in whom it pleased hym that all fulnesse &amp; perfection shoulde dwel. With who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whosoeuer is indued in heart by faith, &amp; rooted fast in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hath layde a sure foundation to buylde on, whereby he may be able to comprehende with al saintes what is the breadth, length, &amp; deapth, &amp; <note place="margin">Ephes. iii.</note> to know the loue of Christe. This vniuersal and absolute knowledge, is that wysdome which S. Paul wisheth these Ephesians to haue, as vnder heauen the greatest treasure that can be obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For of this wysdome the wyse man wryteth thus of his experience. All good thinges came to <note place="margin">Sapi. vii.</note> me together with her, and innumerable ryches through her handes. And addeth moreouer in that same place: She is the mother of all these things. For she is an infinite treasure vnto men, which who so vse, become partakers of the loue of God. I might with many wordes moue some of this audience to searche for this wysdome, to sequester their reason, to folowe gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to cast fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wittes of their braines, to fauour this wysdome, to renounce the wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; pollicie of this fonde worlde, to taste and sauour that whereunto the fauour &amp; wyll of god hath called them, and willeth vs finally to enioy by his fauour, if we would geue eare: But I wil haste to the thirde part of my text, wherein is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed further in sapience, how God geueth his electe an vnderstandyng of the motions of the heauens, of the alterations and circumstaunces
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:6498:232"/>
of time. Whiche as it foloweth in wordes more plentifull in the text which I haue last cited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: So it must needes folow in them that be indued with this spiritual wysdome. For as they can searche where to finde this wysdome, and know of whom to aske it: So know they againe that in time it is found, and can therefore attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them selues to the occasion of the time, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no time to passe away, wherein they maye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this wysdome. And to encrease therein, they knowe how God of his infinite mercie and lenitie geueth all men here tyme and place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And they see howe the wicked (as Job <note place="margin">Iob. xxiiii</note> wryteth) abuse the same to their pride, &amp; therfore do the godly take the better holde of the time, to redeeme it out of suche vse as it is spoyled in by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked. They which haue this wisdome of God, can gather by the diligent and earnest studye of the worldlinges of this present lyfe, howe they wayte theyr times, and apply them selues to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occasion of time to get riches, to encrease their landes &amp; patrimonie.

Yea christian men for that they heare how greuously God complaineth, and threatneth in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures them whiche wyll not knowe the tyme of his visitations, are learned thereby, the rather earnestly to apply them selues thereunto. After our sauiour Christ had prophesied with weeping <note place="margin">Luke. xix.</note> teares of the destruction of Hierusalem, at the last he putteth the cause: For that thou hast not knowen the time of thy visitation. O England, ponder the tyme of Gods mercifull visitation, which is shewed thee from day to day, &amp; yet wylt not regarde it, neyther wylt thou with his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment be dryuen to thy duetie, nor with his benefites be prouoked to thankes. If thou kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west what may fal vpon thee for thine vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, thou wouldest prouide for thy peace. Brethren, howsoeuer the world in generalitie is forgetfull of God, let vs particulerly attende to our time, &amp; win the time with diligence, &amp; applie our selues to that light &amp; grace that is offered vs, let vs, if gods fauour and iudgementes which he
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:6498:233"/>
worketh in our tyme, can not stirre vs to call home to our selfe to do that belong to our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: At the least way, let the malice of the deuil, the naughtines of the worlde which we see exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in these perilous and last times, wherin we see our dayes so daungerously set, prouoke vs to watche diligently to our vocation, to walke and go forwarde therein. Let the miserie and short transitorie ioyes, spyed in the casualtie of our dayes, moue vs, while we haue them in our han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, &amp; seriously stirre vs to be wise, and to expend the gratious good wyl of God to vs ward, which all the day long stretcheth out his handes (as the <note place="margin">Esai. 65.</note> prophete sayth) vnto vs, for the moste part his mercyfull handes, sometyme his heauy handes, that we beyng learned thereby, may escape the daunger that must needes fal on the vniust, who leade their dayes in felicitie &amp; pleasure, without the knowyng of Gods wyll towarde them, but sodenly they go downe into hell. Let vs be found watchers, founde in the peace of the Lorde, that at the last day we may be founde without spot, &amp; blameles: yea let vs endeuour our selues (good <note place="margin">Iob. 22.</note> Christian people) diligently to kepe the presence of his holy spirite. Let vs renounce all vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for he is the spirite of puritie. Let vs auoyde all hypocrisie, for this holy spirite wyll flee from that which is faigned.

Let vs cast awaye all the whole lumpe of sinne that standeth about vs, for he will neuer dwell in that body that is subdued <note place="margin">Hebr. 12.</note> to sinne.

If we do our endeuour, we shall not neede to feare, we <note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> shall be able to ouercome all our enemies that lyght agaynst vs. Onely let vs apply our selfe to accept that grace that is offred vs. Of almightie God we haue comfort by his goodnes, of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christes mediation we may be sure. And this holy spirite will suggest vnto vs that shal be holsome, and confirme vs in all thinges. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be but true that saynt Paule affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: Of him, by him, and in him, be al things, and in him (after this transitorie lyfe wel passed) shal we haue all thinges. For saint Paule sayth: When the sonne of God shall subdue all thinges vnto him, then shall God be all in all. If ye will knowe howe God shall be all in all, veryly after <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> this sense may ye vnderstand it: In this worlde ye see that we be fayne to borowe many thinges to our necessitie, of manye creatures: there is no one thing that suffiseth all our necessities. If we be an hungred, we lust for breade. If we be a thirst, we seeke to be refreshed with ale or wyne. If we be colde, we seeke for cloth. If we be sicke, we seeke to the phisition. If we be in heauines, we seeke for comfort of our frendes, or of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, so that there is no one creature by it selfe that can content al our wantes &amp; desyres. But in the worlde to come, in that euerlasting felicitie, we shall no more begge and seeke our particuler comfortes and commodities of dyuers creatures: but we shall possesse al that we can aske &amp; desyre, in God. And God shall be to vs all thinges. He
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:6498:234"/>
shall be to vs both father and mother, he shall be breade and drinke, cloth, phisitions comfort, he shall be all thinges to vs, and that of much more blessed fassion and more sufficient contentation, then euer these creatures were vnto vs, with much more declaration then euer mans reason is able to conceaue. The eie of man is not able to <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> behold, nor his eare can heare, nor it can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed in the heart of man, what ioye it is that God hath prepared for them that loue him.</p>
               <p>Let vs all conclude then with one voyce with the wordes of saint Paul: To him which is able to do aboundauntlye beyonde our desyres and <note place="margin">Ephe. 3.</note> thoughtes, accordyng to the power workyng in vs, be glory and prayse in his Church, by Christ Jesus for euer, world without ende.</p>

Let no man subtillye compasse or defraude his neyghbour (biddeth saint Paul) <note place="margin">1. Thess. 4.</note> in any manner of cause. For God (sayth he) is a reuenger of all such. God is the God of all equitie and ryghteousnesse, and therefore forbiddeth all suche deceipt and subtiltie in his lawe, by these wordes, Ye shall not do vniustlye in iudgement, <note place="margin">Deut. 19.</note> in lyne, in wayght, or measure. You shall haue iuste ballaunces, true wayghtes, and true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. False ballaunce (sayth Salomon) are an <note place="margin">Pro. 11. 20.</note> abomination vnto the Lord. Remember what Saint Paule sayeth, God is the reuenger of all wrong &amp; in iustice, as we see by dayly experience, howe euer it thriueth vngratiouslye whiche is
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:6498:237"/>
gotten by falshoode and craft. We be taught by experience, howe almighty God neuer suffereth the thirde heyre to enioy his fathers wrong pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, yea, manye a tyme they are taken from him selfe, in his owne lyfe tyme. God is not bound to defend such possessions as be gotten by the deuill and his counsel. God will defende all suche mens goodes and possessions, whiche by him are obteyned and possessed, and will defend them against the violent oppressour. So wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth Salomon, The Lorde will destroye the <note place="margin">Prou. 25.</note> house of the proude man: But he will stablishe the borders of the widowe. No doubt of it (sayth Dauid) better is a little truelye gotten to the ryghteous man, then the innumerable ryches of <note place="margin">Psal. 36.</note> the wrongfull man.

But what do we speake of house and lande? Nay it is sayd in scripture, that God in his yre doeth roote vp whole kingdomes for wronges and oppressions, &amp; doth transtate king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes from one nation to another, for vnrygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing, for wronges and ryches gotten by deceite. This is the practyse of the holy one (saith Daniel) to the intent that lyuing men maye know, that the most hie hath power on the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes <note place="margin">Daniel. 4.</note> of men, and geueth them to whom soeuer he will. Furthermore, what is the cause of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurie and scarcenesse, of dearth and famine? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing but a token of Gods yre, reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng

Ye haue sowen muche (obraydeth God by his prophete Aggei) and yet bryng in little, ye eate, but ye be not satisfyed, ye drynke, but ye be <note place="margin">Agges. 1.</note> not filled, ye cloth your selues, but ye be not warme, and he that earneth his wages, putteth it in a bottomlesse purse: ye looke for muche en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, but loe, it came to little, and when ye brought it home (into your barnes) I did blow it away, sayth the Lorde. O consyder therefore the yre of God agaynst gleaners, gatherers, and incrochers vppon other mennes landes and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions. It is lamentable to see in some places, howe greedy men vse to plowe and grate vppon their neighbours lande, that lyeth next them, howe couetous men nowe a dayes plowe vp so nyghe the common balkes and walkes, whiche good men before tyme made the greater and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, partlye for the commodious walke of his neyghbour, partlye for the better shacke in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest tyme, to the more comfort of his poore neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours cattell. It is a shame to behold the insacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of some couetous personnes in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges: that where their auncetours left of their lande a broade and sufficient beere balke, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the corps to the Christian sepulture, how men pinche at suche beere balkes, which by long vse and custome ought to be inuiolablye kept for that purpose. And nowe they eyther quite ere them vp, and turne the dead bodye to be borne farther about in the hye streates, or els if they leaue anye such meere, it is to strayte for two to walke on. These straunge encrochementes (good

And afterwarde the parties admonished, &amp; charitablye refourmed, who be the doers of such priuate gainyng, to the staunder of the towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and to the hinderaunce of the poore. Your hye wayes should be consydered in your walkes, to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d where to bestow your daies works, accordyng to the good Statutes prouided for the same. It is a good deede of mercy, to amend the daungerous and noysome wayes, whereby thy poore neyghbour sitting on his seely weake beast foundereth not in the deepe thereof, and so the market the worse serued, for discouraging of poore vittailers to resorte thyther for the same cause. If now therfore ye wyl haue your prayers hearde before almyghtie God, for the increase of your corne and cattel, and for the defence therof, from vnseasonable mistes and blastes, from haile and other such tempestes, loue equity, and rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, ensue mercy and charitie, whiche God most requyreth at our handes.

Thus honour thou the Lorde with thy rytches, and with the firste fruites of thyne encrease: So shall thy barnes be filled with aboundaunce, and thy presses shall brust with newe wyne. Nay, God hath promysed to open the windowes of heauen, vppon the liberall ryghteous man, that he shall want nothyng. He wyll represse the deuouryng Caterpiller, which should deuour your fruites.

ours, doth as it were from aboue, assault mans nature and condition. For this folly is euer from our tender age growen vp with vs, to haue a desyre to rule, to thynke hyghlye by our selfe, so that none thynketh it meete to geue place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That wicked vyce of stubburne will &amp; selfe loue, is more meete to breake and to disseuer the loue of heart, then to preserue concorde. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maryed persons must apply their myndes in moste earnest wyse to concorde, and must craue continually of God the helpe of his holy spirite, so to rule their heartes, and to knit their myndes together, that they be not disseuered by any diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of discorde. This necessitie of prayer, must be oft in the occupying and vsing of maryed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that oft tymes the one shoulde pray for the other, lest hate and debate do arise betwixt them. And because fewe do consyder this thing, but more fewe do perfourme it (I saye to praye dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently) we see howe wonderfull the deuill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth and scorneth this state, howe fewe matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies there be without chydinges, brawlings, tauntinges, repentinges, bitter cursinges, and fyghtinges. Which thinges whosoeuer do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they do not consyder that it is the instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ghostly enemie, who taketh great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght therein: For els they woulde with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest endeuour, stryue agaynst these mischeefes, not onely with prayer, but also with all possible diligence. Yea they woulde not geue place to the prouocation of wrath, which stirreth them either to such rowgh &amp; sharpe words, or stripes, which is surely compassed by the deuill, whose tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:6498:240"/>
if it be folowed, must needes begin &amp; weaue the web of all miseries and sorrowes. For this is moste certaynly true, that of suche beginninges must needes ensue the breache of true concorde in heart, whereby all loue must needes shortly be banished. Then can it not be but a miserable thing to beholde, that yet they are of necessitie compelled to lyue together, which yet cannot be in quyet together. And this is most customably euery where to be seene. But what is the cause thereof? Forsoth, because they will not consyder the craftie traynes of the deuill, and therefore geueth not them selues to praye to God, that he woulde vouchsafe to represse his power. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer they do not consyder how they promote the purpose of the deuill, in that they followe the wrath of their heartes, whyle they threate one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, whyle they in their follye turne all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde downe, whyle they will neuer geue ouer their ryght as they esteeme it, yea, whyle manye tymes they will not geue ouer the wrong parte in deede. Learne thou therefore, if thou desyrest to be voyde of all these miseries, if thou desyrest to lyue peaceably and comfortablye in wedlocke, howe to make thy earnest prayer to God, that he would gouerne both your heartes by his holy spirite, to restrayne the deuils power, whereby your concorde may remayne perpetuallye. But to this prayer, muste be ioyned a singuler dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, whereof saint Peter geueth this precept, saying: You husbandes deale with your wyues <note place="margin">i. Pet. 3.</note> accordyng to knowledge, geuing honour to the wyfe, as vnto the weaker vessell, &amp; as vnto them
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:6498:241"/>
that are heyres also of the grace of lyfe, that your prayers be not hyndered. This precept doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly parteyne to the husband. For he ought to be the leader &amp; aucthour of loue, in cherishing and increasing concorde, whiche then shall take place, if he will vse measurablenesse and not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, &amp; if he yelde some thinges to the woman. For the woman is a weake creature, not endued with like strength and constancie of mynd, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be the sooner disquieted, and they be the more prone to all weake affections &amp; dispositions of mynde, more then men be, and lighter they be, and more vaine in their fantasies and opinions. These thinges muste be consydered of the man, that he be not to stiffe, so that he ought to winke at some thinges, and must gentlye expounde all thynges, and to forbeare. Howbeit the common sorte of men doth iudge, that suche moderation should not become a man. For they say that it is a token of womanishe cowardnesse, and therfore they thynke that it is a mans parte to fume in anger, to fyght with fiste and staffe. Howbeit, howsoeuer they imagine, vndoubtedlye Saint Peter doth better iudge what should be seeming to a man, and what he should most reasonablye perfourme. For he sayth, reasoning should be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and not fyghting. Yea he sayth more, that the woman ought to haue a certayne honour at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to her, that is to say, she muste be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and borne with, the rather for that she is the weaker vessel, of a frayle heart, inconstant, and with a worde soone stirred to wrath. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consydering these her frayleties, she is to be
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:6498:241"/>
the rather spared. By this meanes, thou shalt not onlye norishe concorde: but shalt haue her heart in thy power and wyll. For honest natures wyl sooner be retayned to do their duetie, rather by gentle wordes, then by stripes. But he which wyl do al thynges with extremitie and seueritie, and doth vse alwaies rigour in wordes &amp; stripes, what wyll that auayle in the conclusion? Uery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothyng, but that he therby setteth forwarde the deuilles worke, he banisheth away concorde, charitie, and sweete amitie, and bryngeth in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, hatred, and yrkesomnes, the greatest greefes that can be in the mutuall loue and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of mans lyfe. Beyonde al this, it bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth another euil therewith: For it is the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interruption of prayer. For in the tyme that the mynde is occupyed with discention and discord, there can be no true prayer vsed. For the Lordes prayer hath not only a respect to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler persons, but to the whole vniuersall. In the whiche we openly pronounce, that we wyll for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue them which hath offended against vs, euen as we aske forgeuenes of our synnes of God. Which thyng how can it be done ryghtly, when their heartes be at discention? Howe can they pray each for other, when they be at hate betwixt them selues? Now, if the ayde of prayer be taken away, by what meanes can they sustayne them selues in any comfort? For they can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse eyther resist the deuill, or yet haue their heartes stayed in stable comfort in al perilles and necessities, but by prayer. Thus all discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, aswell worldly as ghostly, folowe this fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:6498:242"/>
testinesse, and cumbrous fiercenes, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which be more meete for brute beastes, then for reasonable creatures. Saint Peter doth not alowe these thynges, but the deuil desyreth them gladly. Wherefore take the more heede. And yet a man may be a man, although he doth not vse such extremitie, yea though he should dissemble some thynges in his wyues maners. And this is the part of a Christian man, which both pleaseth God, and serueth also in good vse to the comfort of their mariage state. Nowe as concernyng the wyues duetie. What shall become her? shall she abuse the gentlenes and humanitie of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande? and at her pleasure, turne all thynges vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde downe? No surely. For that is farre repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt agaynst gods commaundement. For thus doth Saint Peter preache to them: Ye wyues, be <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. Pet. 3.</note> ye in subiection to obey your owne husband. To obey, is another thyng then to comptrole or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. Which yet they may do to their chyldren, and to their familie. But as for their husbandes, them must they obey, and ceasse from commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, and perfourme subiection. For this surelye doth norish concorde very muche, when the wyfe is redy at hand, at her husbandes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when she wyll apply her selfe to his wyll, when she endeuoureth her selfe to seeke his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, and to do him pleasure, when she wyll esche we all thynges that myght offend hym. For thus wyll moste truely be verified the saying of the Poet: A good wyfe by obeying her husbande, shall beare the rule, so that he shal haue a delyght and a gladnesse, the sooner at al tymes to returne
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:6498:242"/>
home to her. But on the contrary part, when the wyues be stubborne, froward, and malapert, their husbandes are compelled therby to abhorre and flee from their owne houses, euen as they shoulde haue battayle with their enemies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it can scantly be, but that some offences shal sometyme chaunce betwixt them: For no man doth liue without fault, specially for that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the more frayle partie. Therfore let them beware that they stande not in their faultes and wylfulnesse: but rather let them acknowledge their follies, and say: My husband, so it is, that by my anger I was compelled to do this or that, forgeue it me, and hereafter I wyll take better heed. Thus ought the women the more redily to do, the more they be redy to offende. And they shall not do this only to auoyde strife and debate: but rather in the respect of the commaundement of God, as Saint Paule expresseth it in this fourme of wordes: Let women be subiecte to their husbandes, as to the Lorde. For the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> is the head of the woman, as Christ is the head of the Churche. Here you vnderstand, that God hath commaunded that ye shoulde acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the aucthoritie of the husbande, and referre to hym the honour of obedience. And Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> sayth in that place before rehearsed, that holy matrones dyd sometyme decke themselues, not with gold and syluer, but in putting their whole hope in God, and in obeying their husbandes, as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling hym lord, whose daughters ye be (saith he) if ye folowe her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This sentence is very meete for woman to
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:6498:243"/>
print in their remembraunce. Trueth it is, that they must specially feele the greefe and paynes of their matrimonie, in that they relinquish the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of their owne rule, in the payne of their traueling, in the bryngyng vp of their chyldren: In whiche offices they be in great perils and be greued with great afflictions, which they might be without if they lyued out of matrimonie. But saint Peter sayth, that this is the cheefe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of holy matrones, in that they set their hope and trust in God, that is to say, in that they refused not from mariage for the busynes therof, for the greefes and perils thereof: but committed al suche aduentures to God, in most sure trust of helpe, after that they haue called vppon his ayde. O woman, do thou the lyke, and so shalt thou be most excellently beautified before God and al his angels and saintes, and thou needest not to seeke further for doyng any better workes. For obey thy husbande, take regarde of his requestes, and geue heede vnto hym, to perceaue what he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of thee, and so shalt thou honour God, and lyue peaceably in thy house. And beyond all this, God shall folowe thee with his benediction, that all thynges shal well prosper, both to thee and to thy husband, as the Psalme sayth: Blessed is the man whiche feareth God, and walketh in his wayes, thou shalt haue the fruite of thyne owne handes, happie shalt thou be, and well it shall go with thee. Thy wyfe shalbe as a vine, plentifully spreadyng about thy house. Thy chyldren shalbe as the young sprynges of the Oliues about thy table. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>othus shall that man be blessed (sayth
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:6498:243"/>
Dauid) that feareth the Lorde. This let the wyfe haue euer in minde, the rather admonyshed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the apparell of her head, whereby is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that she is vnder couert and obedience of her husbande. And as that apparell is of nature so appoynted to declare her subiection: So biddeth saint Paul that all other of her rayment shoulde expresse both shame fastnes and sobrietie. For if it be not lawful for the woman to haue her head bare, but to beare thereon the signe of her power wheresoeuer she goeth: more is it required that she declare the thyng that is meant thereby. And therefore these auncient women of the old world called their husbandes lordes, and shewed them reuerence in obeying them. But peraduenture she wyl say, that those men loued their wyues in deede. I know that wel enough, and beare it wel in minde. But when I do admonishe you of your dueties, then cal not to consideration what their dueties be. For when we our selues do teache our chyldren to obey vs as their parentes, or when we refourme our seruauntes, and tell them that they shoulde obey their maisters, not only at the eye, but as to the Lorde: If they shoulde tell vs agayne our dueties, we would not thynke it wel done. For when we be admonished al our dueties and faultes, we ought not then to seeke what other mens dueties be. For though a man had a companion in his fault, yet should not he therby he without his fault. But this must be onlye lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on, by what meanes thou mayst make thy selfe without blame. For Adam did lay the blame vpon the woman, &amp; she turned it vnto the serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:6498:244"/>
but yet neyther of them was thus excused. And therefore bryng not suche excuses to me at this tyme: but applye al thy diligence to heare thyne obedience to thy husbande. For when I take in hande to admonyshe thy husbande to loue thee, and to cherishe thee: yet wyll I not ceasse to set out the lawe that is appoynted for the woman, as well as I woulde requyre of the man what is wrytten for his lawe. Go thou therefore about such thynges as becommeth thee only, and shew thy selfe tractable to thy husbande. Or rather if thou wylt obey thy husband for gods precept, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alleage such thyngs as be in his duetie to do, but perfourme thou diligently those thynges which the lawmaker hath charged thee to do. For thus is it moste reasonable to obey God, if thou wylt not suffer thy selfe to transgresse his law. He that loueth his freende, seemeth to do no great thyng: but he that honoreth hym that is hurtful &amp; hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to hym, this man is worthy much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Euen so thinke thou, if thou canst suffer an extreame husband, thou shalt haue a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde therefore. But if thou louest hym only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is gentle &amp; curtesse, what rewarde wyll God geue thee therefore? Yet I speake not these thynges that I would wish the husbandes to be sharpe towardes their wyues: But I exhort the women that they woulde patiently beare the sharpnesse of their husbandes. For when eyther partes do their beste to perfourme their dueties the one to the other, then foloweth theron great profite to their neighbours for their examples sake. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the woman is redy to suffer a sharp
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:6498:244"/>
band, &amp; the man wil not extreamely intreate his stubborne &amp; troublesome wife, then be al things in quyet, as in a most sure haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Euen thus was it done in olde time, that euery one did their own duetie and office, &amp; was not busie to require the duetie of their neighbours. Consyder I pray thee that Abraham tooke to him his brothers sonne his wyfe dyd not blame hym therefore. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to go with him a long iourney <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he did not gaynesay it, but obeyed his precept. Agayne, after all those great miseries, labours, &amp; paines of that iourney, when Abraham was made as lord ouer al, yet did he geue place to Lot of his superioritie: whiche matter Sara toke so litle to greefe, that she neuer once suffered her tong to speake such wordes as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is wont to do in these daies, when they see their husbandes in suche roomes, to be made vnderlyngs, and to be put vnder their youngers, then they vpbrayde them with combrous talke, and call them fooles, dastardes &amp; cowardes for so doyng. But Sara was so farre from speakyng any such thing, that it came neuer into her mynd and thought so to say, but allowed the wysdome and wyll of her husbande. Yea, besydes all this, after the sayde Lot had thus his wyll, and left to his vnkle the lesser portion of lande, he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to fall into extreame peryll. Whiche chaunce when it came to the knowledge of this sayd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarche, he incontinently put al his men in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; prepared him self with al his family &amp; fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, against the hoast of the Persians. In which case, Sara dyd not counsayle hym to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor dyd say, as then myght haue ben sayde:
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:6498:245"/>
My husbande, whither goest thou so vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Why runnest thou thus on head? Why doest thou offer thy selfe to so great perylles, and art thus redy to ieopard thyne owne lyfe, and to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill the lyues of all thine, for suche a man as hath done thee suche wrong? At the least way, if thou regardest not thy selfe, yet haue compassion on me, whiche for thy loue haue forsaken my kynred and my countrey, and haue the want both of my freendes and kynsfolkes, and am thus come into so far countreyes with thee, haue pitie on me, &amp; make me not here a wydowe, to cast me to suche cares and troubles. Thus myght she haue sayde. But Sara neither said nor thought such words, but she kept her self in scilence in al thynges. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, all that time when she was baren, and toke no paynes as other women did, by bringing foorth fruite in his house? What dyd he? He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned not to his wyfe, but to almyghtie God. And consyder howe eyther of them dyd their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as became them. For neyther dyd he despise Sara because she was baren, nor neuer dyd cast it in her teeth. Consyder agayne how? Abraham expelled the handmayde out of the house when she requyred it: So that by this I maye truely proue, that the one was pleased and contented with the other in all thynges. But yet set not your eyes only on this matter, but looke further what was done before this, that Agar vsed her maistresse despitefully, and that Abraham hym selfe was somwhat prouoked against her, which must needes be an intollerable matter &amp; a payne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to a free hearted woman and a chast. Let not
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:6498:245"/>
therfore the woman be to busie to call for the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of her husbande, where she shoulde be redy to perfourme her owne, for that is not worthy any great commendation. And euen so agayne, let not the man onlye consyder what longeth to the woman, &amp; to stand to earnestly gasing theron, for that is not his part or duety: But as I haue said, let eyther partie be redy &amp; willyng to perfourme that which belongeth specially to them selfe. For if we be bounde to holde out our left cheeke to straungers which wyll smyte vs on the ryght cheeke: how much more ought we to suffer an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame and vnkynd husbande? But yet I meane not that a man should beate his wife, God forbid that, for that is the greatest shame that can be, not so much to her that is beaten, as to hym that doth the deed, but if by such fortune thou chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest vpon such an husband, take it not to heauily, but suppose thou, that therby is layde vp no smal rewarde hereafter, and in this lyfe tyme no small commendation to thee, if thou canst be quyet. But yet to you that be men, thus I speake, Let there be none so greeuous fault to compell you to beate your wyues. But what say I your wyues, no, it is not to be borne with, that an honest man should lay handes on his may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seruaunt to beat her. Wherfore if it be a great shame for a man to beate his bonde seruaunt, muche more rebuke it is, to lay vyolent handes vppon his tree woman. And this thyng may be well vnderstande by the lawes whiche the painims hath made, whiche doth discharge her any longer to dwell with such an husbande, as vnworthye to haue any further
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:6498:246"/>
pany with her that doth smyte her. For it is an extreame poynt, thus so vyle to entreate her lyke a slaue, that is felowe to thee of thy lyfe, and so ioyned vnto thee before tyme in the necessarie matters of thy lyuyng. And therefore a man may well lyken such a man (if he may be called a man, rather then a wylde beaste) to a kyller of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or his mother. And whereas we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to forsake our father and mother, for our wyues sake, and yet thereby do worke them none iniurie, but do fulfill the law of God. Howe can it not appeare then to be a poynt of extreame madnesse, to entreate her despitefully, for whose sake God hath commaunded thee to leaue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? Yea, who can suffer such despite? Who can worthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Who would not think that it were better for such a man to wish the ground to open, and to swallowe hym in, then once euer after to be seene in the market? But peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture thou wilt obiect, that the woman prouoketh thee to this point. But consyder thou again that the woman is a frayle vessel, &amp; thou art therefore made the ruler and head ouer her, to beare the weakenes of her in this her subiection. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore study thou to declare the honest commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thyne aucthoritie, whiche thou canst no way better do, then to forbeare to vtter her in her weakenes &amp; subiection. For euen as the kyng ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:6498:246"/>
so muche the more noble, the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and noble he maketh his officers and leefete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes, whom if he should dishonour, &amp; despise the aucthority of their dignitie, he should depriue hym selfe of a great part of his own honor: Euen so, if thou doest despise her that is set in the nexte roome besyde thee, thou doest much derogate and decay the excellencie and vertue of thyne owne aucthorite. Recount all these thynges in thy mynde, and be gentle and quiet. Understand that God hath geuen thee chyldren with her, and art made a father, &amp; by such reason appease thy selfe. Doest not thou see the husbandmen what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they vse to tyll that grounde whiche once they haue taken to farme, though it be neuer so full of faultes? As for an example, though it be drye, though it bryngeth foorth weedes, though the soyle can not beare to much wette, yet he tyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, and so winneth fruite thereof: Euen in lyke maner, if thou wouldest vse lyke diligence to instruct and order the mind of thy spouse, if thou wouldest diligently applye thy selfe to weede out by litle and litle the noysome weedes of vncomly maners out of her mind, with holsome precepts, it could not be, but in tyme thou shouldest feele the pleasaunt fruite thereof to both your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes. Therefore that this thyng chaunce not so, perfourme this thyng that I do here counsayle thee: Whensoeuer any displeasaunt matter riseth at home, if thy wife hath done ought amisse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, &amp; encrease not the heauines. For though thou shouldest be greeued with neuer so manye things, yet shalt thou find nothing more greuous
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:6498:247"/>
then to want the beneuolence of thy wyfe at home. What offence soeuer thou canst name, yet shalt thou fynde none more intollerable, then to be at debate with thy wyfe. And for this cause most of all oughtest thou to haue this loue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence. And if reason moueth thee to beare any burthen at any other mens handes, muche more at thy wyues. For if she be poore, vpbrayde her not, if she be simple, taunt her not, but be the more curteous. For she is thy body, and made one fleshe with thee. But thou peraduenture wylt say that she is a wrathfull woman, a drunkarde, and beastly, without wit and reason. For this cause bewayle her the more. Chafe not in anger, but pray to almyghtie God. Let her be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and holpen with good counsayle, &amp; do thou thy best endeuour, that she may be delyuered of al these affections. But if thou shouldest beat her, thou shalt encrease her euil affections. For fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes &amp; sharpnes, is not amended with fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes: but with softnes and gentlenes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, consider what reward thou shalt haue at Gods hande: For where thou myghtest beate her, and yet for the respecte of the feare of God, thou wilt abstaine and beare patiently her great offences, the rather in respect of that lawe which forbiddeth that a man shoulde caste out his wyfe what faulte soeuer she be combred with, thou shalt haue a very great rewarde, &amp; before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of that rewarde, thou shalt feele many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: For by this meanes she shalbe made the more obedient, and thou for her sake shalt be made the more meeke. It is wrytten in a storye
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:6498:247"/>
of a certayne straunge Philosopher, which had a cursed wyfe, a frowarde, and a drunkarde. When he was asked for what consyderation he dyd so beare her euyll maners? He made aunswere. By this meanes (sayde he) I haue at home a Scholemaister, and an example howe I shoulde behaue myselfe abroade. For I shall (sayth he) be the more quiet with other, beyng thus dayly exercised and taught in the forbearyng of her. Surely it is a shame that painims shoulde be wyser then we, we I say, that be commaunded to counterfayte angels, or rather God hym selfe through meekenesse. And for the loue of vertue, this saide Philosopher Socrates woulde not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell his wyfe out of his house. Yea some say that he dyd therefore marrye his wyfe, to learne this vertue by that occasion. Wherefore, seeyng many men be farre behynd the wysedome of this man, my counsell is, that fyrste and before all thynges, that man do his best endeuour to get hym a good wyfe, endued with all honestie and vertue. But if it so chaunce that he is deceaued, that he hath chosen suche a wyfe as is neyther good nor tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, then let the husband folowe this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and let hym instruct his wyfe in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and neuer lay these matters to syght. For the marchaunt man, except he fyrst be at compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition with his factour to vse his interaffayres quietly, he wyll neyther stirre his shippe to sayle, nor yet wyll lay handes vpon his marchaundize. Euen so, let vs do all thynges, that we may haue the felowship of our wyues, which is the factour of all our doynges at home, in great quiet and
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:6498:248"/>
rest. And by these meanes all thynges shall pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per quyetly, and so shall we passe through the daungers of the troublous sea of this worlde. For this state of lyfe wyll be more honorable and comfortable then our houses, then seruauntes, then money, then landes and possessious, then all thynges that can be tolde. As all these with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and discord, can neuer worke vs any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: So shall all thynges turne to our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie and pleasure, if we drawe this yoke in one concorde of heart and mynd Whereupon do your best endeuour, that after this sorte ye vse your matrimonie, and so shall ye be armed on euerye syde. Ye haue escaped the snares of the deuyll, and the vnlawfull lustes of the fleshe. Ye haue the quietnesse of conscience by this institution of matrimonie ordeyned by God. Therefore vse oft prayer to hym, that he woulde be present by you, that he woulde continue concorde and charitie betwixt you. Do the best ye can of your partes, to custome your selues to softnesse and meeknes, and beare well in worth suche ouersightes as chaunce. And thus shall your conuersation be most pleasaunt and comfortable. And although (whiche can no otherwyse be) some aduersities shall folowe, and otherwhiles nowe one discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, nowe another shall appeare: yet in this common trouble and aduersitie, lyfte vp both your handes vnto heauen, call vppon the helpe and assistaunce of God, the aucthour of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and surely the promise of releefe is at hand. For Christe affyrmeth in his gospell: Where two or three be gathered together in my name, and
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:6498:248"/>
be agreed, what matter soeuer they praye for, it shalbe graunted them of my heauenly father. Why therefore shouldest thou be afrayde of the daunger, where thou hast so redy a promise, and so nye an helpe? Furthermore you must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, how necessarie it is for Christian folke to beare Christes crosse: For els we shall neuer feele how comfortable Gods helpe is vnto vs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore geue thankes to God for his great benefite, in that ye haue taken vpon you this state of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, and pray you instauntly, that almyghtie God may luckely defende and maynteyne you therein, that neyther ye be ouercommed with any temptation, nor with any aduersitie. But before all thynges, take good heede that ye geue no occasion to the deuyll to let and hynder your prayers by discorde and discention. For there is no stronger defence and stay in all our lyfe, then is prayer, in the which we may call for the helpe of God and obteyne it, whereby we may winne his blessyng, his grace, his defence and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so to continue therein to a better lyfe to come. Which graunt vs he that died for vs all, to whom be all honour and prayse, for euer and euer.</p>

Almyghtie God, after that he had created ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, put him into paradice, that he might dresse &amp;
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:6498:249"/>
kepe it: But when he had transgressed gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, eating the fruite of the tree which was forbidden hym, almyghtie God foorth with <note place="margin">Gen. iii.</note> did cast him out of paradice into this wofull vale of miserie, enioyning him to labour the grounde that he was taken out of, and to eate his bread in the sweate of his face all the dayes of his lyfe. It is the appoyntment and wyll of God, that euery man, during the tyme of this mortall and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie lyfe, should geue himself to some honest and godly exercise &amp; labour, and euery one to do his owne busines, &amp; to walke vpryghtly in his owne <note place="margin">Iob. v. Eccle. vii.</note> calling. Man (sayth Job) is borne to labour. And we are commaunded by Jesus Syrach, not to hate painefull workes, neyther husbandry, or other such mysteries of trauaile, which the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hath created. The wise man also exhorteth vs <note place="margin">Prou. v.</note> to drinke the waters of our owne cesterne, and of the riuers that runne out of the middes of our owne well: meanyng therby, that we should lyue of our ownelabours, &amp; not deuour the laboures of other. Saint Paul hearing that among the <note place="margin">ii.

Whiche
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:6498:250"/>
doctrine of S. Paul (no doubt) is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the generall ordinaunce of God, whiche is, that euery man should labour: And therfore it is to be obeyed of al men, and no man can iustly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt hym selfe from the same. But when it is sayde, al men should labour, it is not so straightly meant, that all men should vse handye labour. But as there be diuers sortes of labour, some of the minde, &amp; some of the body, and some of both: So euery one (except by reason of age, debilitie of body, or want of health, he be vnapt to labour at all) ought both for the getting of his owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng honestly, and for to profite others, in some kind of labour to exercise him selfe, accordyng as the vocation wherevnto God hath called hym, shall require. So that whosoeuer doth good to the common weale and societie of men with his industry and labour, whether it be by gouerning the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale publiquely, or by bearing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique office or ministerie, or by doyng any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon necessary affayres of his countrey, or by geuyng counsell, or by teachyng &amp; instructing others, or by what other meanes soeuer he be occupied, so that a profite and benefite redound thereof vnto others, the same person is not to be accompted idle, though he worke no bodyly labour, nor is to be denied his liuyng (yf he attende his vocation) though he worke not with his handes. Bodyly labour is not required of them which by reason of their vocation and office, are occupied in the labour of the minde, to the profite and helpe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Saint Paul exhorteth Timothie, to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <note place="margin">i. Tim. v.</note> we and refuse idle widowes, which go about
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:6498:250"/>
from house to house, because they are not onlye idle, but pratlers also and busybodyes, speakyng thinges whiche are not comely. The prophete Ezechiel declaring what the sinnes of the citie of <note place="margin">Ezec. xvi.</note> Sodome were, reckeneth idlenesse to be one of the principall. The sinnes (sayth he) of Sodome were these: Pride, fulnes of meate, aboundance, and idlenesse. These thynges had Sodome and her daughters, meaning the cities subiect to her. The horrible and straunge kynde of destruction of that citie, and al the countrey about the same, (which was fyre and brimstone raigning from heauen) most manifestly declareth, what a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinne idlenesse is, and ought to admonishe vs to flee from the same, and embrace honest and godly labour. But yf we geue our selues to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; slouth, to lurking and loitering, to wylful wandering, &amp; wastefull spending, neuer setling our selues to honest labour, but liuing like drone bees by the labours of other men, then do we breake the Lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, we go astray from our vocation, and incurre the daunger of Gods wrath and heauie displeasure to our end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse destruction, except by repentaunce we turne agayne vnfaignedly vnto God. The inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and mischeefes that come of idlenes, aswel to mans body, as to his soule, are more then can in short time be well rehearsed. Some we shall declare and open vnto you, that by consyderyng them, ye may the better with your selues gather the rest. An idle hande (sayth Salomon) maketh <note place="margin">Prou. x.</note> poore, but a quicke labouring hand maketh rich. Agayne, he that tillleth his lande, shall haue
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:6498:251"/>
plenteousnesse of bread, but he that floweth in idlenesse, is a very foole, and shall haue pouertie <note place="margin">Pro. 11. 28.</note> enough. Agayne, a slouthfull body wyl not go to plowe for colde of the winter, therefore shal he go <note place="margin">Prou. x.</note> a beggyng in sommer, and haue nothyng. But what shall we nede to stand much about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this, that pouertie foloweth idlenesse? We haue to much experience therof (the thing is the more to be lamented) in this Realme. For a great part of the beggery that is amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the poore, can be imputed to nothyng so muche, as to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to the negligence of parents, which do not bryng vp their chyldren, eyther in good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, honest labour, or some commendable occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation or trade, wherby when they come to age, they myght get their liuing. Dayly experience also teacheth, that nothyng is more enemie or pernicious to the health of mans bodye, then is idlenesse, to much ease and sleepe, and want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise. But these and suche lyke incommodities, albeit they be great &amp; noysome, yet because they concerne chiefely the body and externall goodes, they are not to be compared with the mischeefes &amp; inconueniences, which through idlenesse hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the soule, whereof we wyll recite some. Idlenes is neuer alone, but hath alwaies a long tayle of other vices hanging on, whiche corrupt and infect the whole man, after such sort, that he is made at length nothyng els but a lumpe of sinne. Idlenesse (sayth Jesus Syrach) bringeth <note place="margin">Eccle. 33.</note> much euill and mischeefe. Saint Barnarde calleth it the mother of al euyls, and stepdame of all vertues, addyng moreouer, that it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:6498:251"/>
and as it were treade the way to hell fyre. Where idlenesse is once receaued, there the deuill is alwaies redy to set in his foote, and to plant al kind of wickednesse and sinne, to the euerlasting destruction of mans soule. Whiche thing to be most true, we are plainely taught in the. xiii. of Matthewe, where it is sayde: That the enemie <note place="margin">Mat. xiii.</note> came while men were a sleepe, &amp; sowed naughtie tares among the good wheate. In verye deede the best tyme that the deuyll can haue to worke his feate, is when men be a sleepe, that is to say, idle. Then is he moste busie in his worke, then doth he soonest catch men in the snare of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then doth he fill them with all iniquitie, to bryng them (without Gods speciall fauour) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vtter destruction. Hereof we haue two nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">ii. Reg. xi.</note> examples most liuely set before our eyes. The one in kyng Dauid, who tarying at home idelly (as the scripture sayth) at suche tymes as other kynges go foorth to battaile, was quicklye se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of Satan to forsake the Lord his God, and to commit two greeuous &amp; abominable sinnes in his sight: adultrie and murther. The plagues <note place="margin">ii. Reg. xii</note> that ensued these offences, were horrible and greeuous, as it may easyly appeare to them that wyl reade the story. Another example of Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <note place="margin">Iudg. xvi.</note> who so long as be warred with the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines, enemies to the people of God, could neuer be taken or ouercome: But after that he gaue him selfe to ease and idlenesse, he not onlye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication with the strumpet Dalila, but also was taken of his enemies, and had his eyes miserablie put out, was put in prison, and
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:6498:252"/>
compelled to grinde in a myl, and at length was made the laughing stock of his enemies. If these two who were so excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men, so welbeloued of God, so endued with singuler and deuine giftes, the one namelye of prophesie, and the other of strength, and such men as neuer coulde by vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, labour, or trouble, be ouercome, were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen and fell into greeuous sinnes, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them selues for a short time to ease and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and so consequently incurred miserable plagues at the handes of God: What sinne, what mischeefe, what inconuenience and plague is not to be feared of them whiche all theyr lyfe long geue them selues wholye to idlenesse and ease? Let vs not deceaue our selues, thynkyng litle hurte to come of doyng nothyng. For it is a true saying: When one doth nothing, he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to do euyll. Let vs therefore alwayes be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of some honest worke, that the deuill maye finde vs occupied. He hym selfe is euer occupied, neuer idle, but walketh continually seekyng to deuoure vs. Let vs resist hym with our diligent watching, in labour, and in well doyng. For he that diligently exerciseth hym selfe in honest bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, is not easily catched in the deuils snare. When man through idlenesse, or for default of some honest occupation or trade to liue vpon, is brought to pouertie, and want of thinges neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, we see howe easyly suche a man is induced for his gaine, to lye, to practise howe he maye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue his neyghbour, to foresweare him selfe, to beare false witnesse, and oftentimes to steale and murther, or to vse some other vngodly meane to
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:6498:252"/>
liue withall. Whereby not onlye his good name, honest reputation, and a good conscience, yea his life is vtterly loste, but also the great displeasure and wrath of God, with diuers and sundry gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous plagues, are procured. Lo here the ende of the idle and sluggishe bodyes, whose handes can not away with honest labour: losse of name, fame, reputation, &amp; life here in this worlde, and without the great mercie of god, the purchasyng of euerlasting destruction in the worlde to come. Haue not al men then good cause to beware and take heede of idlenesse, seeyng they that embrace and folowe it, haue commonly of their pleasant idlenesse, sharpe and sowre displeasures? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse good and godly men waying the great and manifold harme that come by idlenesse to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, haue from tyme to tyme prouided with all diligence, that sharpe and seuere lawes myght be made, for the correction and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this euill. The Egyptians had a lawe, <note place="margin">Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> that euery man should weekely bryng his name to the chiefe rulers of the prouince, &amp; there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all declare what trade of life he occupied, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that idlenesse myght be worthyly punished, and diligent labour duely rewarded. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> dyd chastice sluggishe and slouthful people, no lesse then they dyd heynous &amp; greeuous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, consydering (as the trueth is) that idlenesse causeth much mischeefe. The <hi>Arreopagites</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led euery man to a strayght accompt howe he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And yf they founde anye loyterers that dyd not profite the common weale by one meanes or other, they were driuen out and banished as
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:6498:253"/>
vnprofitable members, that dyd onlye hurt and corrupt the body. And in this Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, good and godlye lawes haue ben diuers times made, that no idle vagaboundes and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring runnagates, should be suffered to go from towne to towne, from place to place, without punishment, which neyther serue God nor their prince, but deuoure the sweete fruites of other mens labour, being common liers, drunkardes, swearers, theeues, whoremaisters, and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, refusing all honest labour, and geue them selues to nothyng els, but to inuent and do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe, whereof they are more desyrous and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then is any Lion of his pray. To remedy this inconueniencie, let al parentes &amp; others, whiche haue the care and gouernance of youth, so bring them vp eyther in good learnyng, labour, or some honest occupation or trade, whereby they may be able in time to come, not only to sustaine them selues competently, but also to relieue and supplie the necessitie and want of others. And saint Paul sayth: Let hym that hath stolen, steale no more, and he that hath deceaued others <note place="margin">Ephe. iiii.</note> or vsed vnlawful wayes to get his liuing, leaue of the same, &amp; labour rather, workyng with his handes that thing whiche is good, that he may haue that which is necessarie for hym selfe, and also be able to geue vnto others that stande in neede of his helpe. The prophet Dauid thinketh <note place="margin">Psalm. 128</note> him happy that liueth vpon his labour, saying, When thou eatest the labours of thyne handes, happy art thou, and wel is thee. This happines or blessing consisteth in these &amp; such like pointes.
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:6498:253"/>
First it is the gyft of God (as Salomon sayth) <note place="margin">Eccle. iii.</note> when one eateth and drinketh, and receaueth good of his labour. Secondaryly, when one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of his owne labour (so it be honest &amp; good) he liueth of it with a good conscience. And an vpryght conscience is a treasure inestimable. Thirdly, he eateth his bread not with brawling and chiding, but with peace and quietnes: when he quietly laboureth for the same, accordyng to saint Paules admonition. Fourthly, he is no mans bondman for his meate sake, nor needeth not for that, to hang vpon the good wyll of other men: but so liueth of his owne, that he is able to geue part to others. And to conclude, the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng man and his familie, whyles they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie occupied in their labour, be free from many temptations and occasions of sinne, which they that liue in idlenesse, are subiect vnto. And here ought Artificers and Labouring men, who be at wages for their worke and labour, to consyder theyr conscience to God, and theyr duetie to their neighbour, least they abuse their tyme in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so defraudyng them whiche be at charge both with great wages, and deare commons. They be worse then idle men in deede, for that they seeke to haue wages for their loytring. It is lesse daunger to God to be idle for no gayne, then by idlenes to win out of theyr neyghbours purses, wages for that which is not deserued. It is true that almyghtie God is angry with suche as do defraude the hyred man of his wages. The crie of that iniurie ascendeth vp to Gods eare for vengeaunce. And as true it is, that the hyred
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:6498:254"/>
man, who vseth deceipt in his labour is a theefe <note place="margin">i. Thes. iiii</note> before God. Let no man (sayth saint Paul to the Thessalonians) subtilly beguile his brother, let him not defraud him in his busines: For the lord is reuenger of suche deceiptes. Wherevppon he that wyll haue a good conscience to God, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring man, I say, which dependeth wholye vpon Gods benediction, ministring all thynges sufficient for his liuing, let hym vse his tyme in faythful labour, and when his labour by sicknes or other misfortune doth ceasse, yet let him think for that in his health he serued GOD and his neyghbour truely, he shall not want in tyme of necessitie. God vppon respect of his fidelitie in health, wyll recompence his indigence, to moue the heartes of good men, to relieue suche decayed men in sicknesse. Where otherwyse, whatsoeuer is gotten by idlenesse, shall haue no foyson to helpe in tyme of neede. Let the labouryng man therfore eschew for his part, this vice of idlenesse and deceipt, remembring that saint Paul exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">Ephes. iiii.</note> euery man to lay away al deceipt, dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and lying, and to vse trueth &amp; plainenesse to his neyghbour, because (sayth he) we be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers together in one body, vnder one head Christ our sauiour. And here myght be charged the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing men of this Realme, who spend their tyme in much idlenesse of life, nothyng regardyng the oportunitie of their time, forgetting how seruice is no heritage, howe age will creepe vpon them: where wysdome were, they should expende theyr idle time in some good businesse, whereby they myght increase in knowledge, &amp; so the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:6498:254"/>
to be readye for euery mans seruice. It is a great rebuke to them, that they studie not eyther to write fayre, to kepe a booke of accompt, to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the tongues, and so to get wysdome &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in suche bookes and workes, as be nowe plentifully set out in print of all maner langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Let young men consyder the pretious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of their time, and wast it not in idlenesse, in iolitie, in gaming, in banqueting, in ruffians company. Youth is but vanitie, and must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted for before God. Howe mery and glad so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou be in thy youth, O young man (sayth the preacher) how glad soeuer thy heartbe in thy <note place="margin">Eccle. xi.</note> young dayes, how fast and freely soeuer thou fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the waies of thine owne heart, and the lust of thyne owne eyes, yet be thou sure that God shal bring thee into iudgement for al these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. God of his mercie put it into the heartes &amp; mindes of all them that haue the sworde of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in their hands, or haue families vnder their gouernance, to labour to redres this great enormitie, of al such as liue idelly and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, to the great dishonour of God, &amp; the greeuous plague of his seely people. To leaue sinne vnpunished, and to neglect the good bryngyng vp of youth, is nothyng els but to kindle the Lordes wrath agaynst vs, and to heape plagues vpon our owne heades. As long as the adulterous people were suffered to liue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenciously without reformation: so long dyd the plague continue and increase in Israel, as ye may see in the booke of Numbers. But when <note place="margin">Num. 25.</note> due correction was done vpon them, the Lordes
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:6498:255"/>
anger was straightway pacified, and the plague ceassed. Let al officers therefore loke straightly to their charge. Let all maisters of housholdes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme this abuse in their families. Let them vse the aucthoritie that God hath geuen them. Let them not mainteyne vagaboundes and idle persons, but deliuer the Realme and their house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdes from suche noysome loyterers, that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the mother of al mischeefe, being cleane ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, almyghtie God may turne his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anger away from vs, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the couenant of peace vpon vs for euer, through the merites of Jesus Christ our only Lord &amp; sauiour, to whom with the father and the holy ghost, be all honour and glory, worlde without ende.</p>

And veryly the true preachers of the Gospell of the kingdome of heauen, and of the glad and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tidinges of saluation, haue alwayes in their godly sermons and preachinges vnto the people, ioyned these two together, I meane repentance and forgeuenes of sinnes, euen as our Sauiour Jesus Christe did appoynt him selfe, saying, So it behoued Christe to suffer, &amp; to ryse agayne the thirde day, and that repentance and forgeuenes <note place="margin">Luk. xiiii.</note> of sinnes should be preached in his name among all nations.

Where he sayth, But nowe therefore, sayth the Lord, returne vnto me: It is not without great importaunce, that the prophete speaketh so. For he had afore set foorth at large vnto them, the horrible vengeaunce of god, which no man was able to abide, and therfore he doth moue them to repentaunce, to obtayne mercie, as yf he shoulde say: I wyl not haue these thinges to be so taken, as though there were no hope of grace left. For although ye do by your sinnes deserue to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroyed, and God by his righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts hath determined to bryng no smal destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vppon you, yet nowe that ye are in a maner on the very edge of the sworde, yf ye wyll spedyly returne vnto hym, he wyll most gently and most mercifully receaue you into fauour again.

Whiche moste comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are confyrmed by manye examples of the scriptures. When the Jewes dyd wyllingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue and embrace the wholesome counsel of the prophete Esai, God by and by dyd reache his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hande vnto them, and by his angell, dyd in <note place="margin">Esai. 37.</note> one nyght slea the moste worthye and valiaunt souldiers of Sennacheribs campe.

But let vs more narowly loke vpon
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:6498:257"/>
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the Lorde touchyng this matter. Turne vnto me (sayth he by his prophete Joel) with al your heartes, with fasting, weping and mourning. Rent your heartes and not your garments. &amp;c. In which wordes, he comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth al maner of things that can be spoken of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, whiche is a returning agayne of the whole man vnto God, from whom we be fallen away by sinne. But that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole discourse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may the better be borne away, we shall fyrst consyder in order foure principall poyntes, that is, from what we must returne, to whom we must returne, by whom we may be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, and the maner howe to turne to GOD.</p>
               <p>First, from whence, or from what thynges we must returne. Truely we muste returne from <note place="margin">From whence we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</note> those things, whereby we haue ben withdrawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pluckt, and led away from God. And these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are our sinnes, which as the holy prophete Esai doth testifie, do separate God and vs, and <note place="margin">Esai. lix.</note> hide his face, that he wyll not heare vs. But vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of sinne, not only those grosse wordes and deedes, which by the common iudgement of men are counted to be filthy and vnlawfull, and so consequently abominable sinnes: but also the filthy lustes and inwarde concupiscences of the fleshe, whiche as (saint Paul testifieth) do resist the wyll and spirite of God, and therefore ought <note place="margin">Galat. v.</note> earnestly to be brydled and kept vnder. We must repent of the false and erronious opinions that we haue had of god, and the wicked superstition that doth breede of the same, the vnlawfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping and seruice of God, and other lyke. All
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:6498:257"/>
these thinges must they forsake, that will truely turne vnto the Lorde and repent aryght. For sith that for suche things the wrath of God commeth vpon the children of disobedience, no ende of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> ought to be looked for, as long as we continue in such thinges. Therfore they be here condempned, which will seeme to be repentaunt sinners, and yet will not forsake their Idolatrie and superstition. Secondlye, we muste see vnto whom we ought to returne. <hi>Reuertimini vsque ad me,</hi> sayeth the Lord: that is, Returne as farre as vnto me. We muste then returne vnto the <note place="margin">

But this must be done by fayth. For syth that God is a spirite, he can by no other meane be apprehended and taken hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. Therefore, first they do greatly erre, which do not turne vnto God, but vnto the creatures, or vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuentions of men, or vnto their owne merites. Secondly, they that do begin to returne vnto the Lord, &amp; do faynt in the myd way, afore they come to the marke that is appoynted vnto <note place="margin">By whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> them. Thirdly, because we haue of our owne selues nothing to present vs to God, and do no lesse flee from him after our fall then our fyrst pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Adam did, which when he had sinned, did seeke to hyde hym selfe from the syght of God, we haue nede of a mediatour for to bring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile vs vnto him, who for our sinnes is angry
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:6498:258"/>
with vs. The same is Jesus Christe, who being true and naturall God, equall and of one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce with the father, did at the tyme appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted take vpon hym our frayle nature, in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed virgins wombe, &amp; that of her vndefyled sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, that so he myght be a mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and vs, and pacifie his wrath. Of hym doeth the father hym selfe speake from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, saying: This is my welbeloued sonne, in <note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> whom I am wel pleased. And he him selfe in his Gospell doth crye out and saye: I am the waye, <note place="margin">Ioh. xiiii.</note> the truth, and the life, no man commeth vnto the father but by me. For he alone did with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <note place="margin">Iohn. i. i. Pet. i.</note> of his body and bloode, make satisfaction vnto the iustice of God for our sinnes. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles do testifie, that he was exalted for to geue <note place="margin">Act. v. Luke. 24.</note> repentaunce and remission of sinnes vnto Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Both whiche thinges he hym selfe did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde to be preached in his name. Therefore they are greatlye deceaued that preache repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce without Christ, and teach the simple and ignoraunt that it consisteth onely in the workes of men. They may in deede speake many things of good workes, and of amendement of lyfe and <note place="margin">Iohn. xv.</note> maners: but without Christe they be all vayne and vnprofitable. They that thynke that they haue done much of them selues towardes repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, are so much more the farther from God, because that they do seeke those thinges in their owne workes and merites, which ought only to be sought in our sauiour Jesus Christ, and in the merites of his death, passion, and bloodshedding. Fourthly, this holy prophete Joel doth lyuelye
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:6498:258"/>
expresse the maner of this our returning or repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, comprehendyng all the inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <note place="margin">The maner o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> returning.</note> thinges that may be here obserued. First, he will haue vs to returne vnto God with our whole heart, whereby he doth remoue and put away all hypocrisie, lest the same myght iustly be sayde vnto vs: This people draweth neare vnto <note place="margin">Esaias. 29. Mat. xv.</note> me with their mouth, and worshippeth me with their lippes, but their heart is farre of from me. Secondlye, he requyreth a sincere &amp; pure loue of godlynes, &amp; of the true worshipping and seruice of God, that is to say, that forsakyng al maner of thinges that are repugnaunt and contrary vnto Gods wil, we do geue our heartes vnto him, and all the whole strength of our bodyes and soules, according to that which is written in the lawe: Thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thy <note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> heart, with all thy soule, &amp; with all thy strength. Here therefore nothing is left vnto vs, that we may geue vnto the worlde, and vnto the lustes of the flesh. For sith that the heart is the fountayne of al our works, as many as do with their whole heart turne vnto the Lord, do liue vnto him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. Neyther do they yet repent truelye, that hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng <note place="margin">Haltyng on both sydes.</note> on both sydes, do otherwhiles obey god, but by &amp; by do thynk, that laying him aside, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to serue the worlde &amp; the fleshe. And because that we are letted by the natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our owne fleshe, &amp; the wycked affections of the same, he doeth bid vs also to returne with fasting, not thereby vnderstanding a superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abstinence and chosing of meates: but a true discipline or tamyng of the fleshe, whereby the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:6498:259"/>
norishmentes of filthy lustes, and of stubborne contumacie and pryde, may be withdrawen and pluckt awaye from it. Whereunto he doth adde weeping and mourning, whiche do conteine an outwarde profession of repentaunce, which is very needefull &amp; necessary, that so we may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set foorth the ryghteousnes of God, when by such meanes we do testifye that we deserued pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmentes at his handes, and partly stoppe the offence that was openlye geuen vnto the weake. This did Dauid see, who beyng not content to haue be wept and be wailed his sinnes priuately, <note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> would publiquelye in his Psalmes declare and set forth the ryghteousnes of God, in punishing sinne, and also stay them that mought haue abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his example to sinne the more boldely. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are farthest from true repentaunce, that wyll not confesse and acknowledge their sinnes, nor yet bewaile them, but rather do most vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory and reioyce in them. Now least any man shoulde thinke that repentaunce doeth consist in outward weeping and mourning onely, he doth rehearse that wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cheefe of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth lye, when he sayth: Rent your heartes, <note place="margin">Psal. 52.</note> and not your garmentes, and turne vnto the Lord your God. For the people of the East part of the worlde were wont to rent theyr garmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, if anye thing had happened vnto them that seemed intollerable. This thing did hypocrites sometyme counterfaite and followe, as though the whole repentaunce did stande in suche out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <note place="margin">Hypocrites do counterfait all maner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hinges.</note> gesture. He teacheth then, that an other maner of thing is requyred, that is, that they
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:6498:259"/>
be contrite in their heartes, that they must vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye detest and abhorre sinnes, and being at defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce with them, returne vnto the Lorde theyr God, from whom they went awaye before. For God hath no pleasure in the outwarde ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but requyreth a contrite and humble heart, which <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> he will neuer dispyse, as Dauid doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. There is therefore none other vse to these outwarde ceremonies, but as farre foorth as we are stirred vp by them, and do serue to the glorie of God, and to the edifying of other.</p>

For as in all other thinges mens heartes do quaile and faynt, if they once perceaue that they trauayle in vayne: Euen so most specially in this matter, muste we take heede and beware that we suffer not our selues to be perswaded that all that we do is but labour lost. For thereof eyther sodayne desperation doth aryse, or a licentious boldnesse to sinne, which at length bringeth vnto despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Least any suche thing then shoulde happen vnto them, he doth certifie them of the grace and goodnes of God, who is alwayes moste redye to receaue them into fauour agayne, that turne speedylye vnto him. Which thing he doth proue with the same titles whorwith god doth discribe and set foorth himselfe vnto Moyses, speaking <note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> on this maner: For he is gracious and merciful, slowe to anger, of great kyndnesse, and repenteth
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:6498:260"/>
hym of the eui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, thatis, suche a one as is sorye for your afflictious. Fyrst he calleth hym gentle &amp; gracious, as he who of his own nature is more prompt and redye to do good, then to punyshe. Whereunto this saying of Esaias the Prophete <note place="margin">Esaias. 55.</note> seemeth to parteyne, where he sayeth: Let the wycked forsake his waye, and the vnryghteous his owne imaginations, and returne vnto the Lorde, and he will haue pitie on him, and to our God, for he is verye redye to forgeue. Secondly, he doth attribute vnto him mercy, or rather (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng <note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> to the Hebrewe word) the bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whereby he signifyed the naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of parentes towardes their children. Which thing Dauid doth set foorth goodlye, saying: As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lorde compassion on them that feare hym, for he knoweth whereof we be made, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth that we are but duste. Thyrdlye, he sayth, that he is slowe to anger, that is to saye, long sufferyng, and whiche is not lightly prouoked to wrath. Fourthly, that he is of muche kindnesse, for he is that bottomlesse well of all goodnesse, who reioyceth to do good vnto vs. Therefore did he create and make men, that he myght haue whom he shoulde do good vnto, and make parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his heauenly ryches.

And that they may geue the better colour vnto their pestilent and pernicious errour, they do commonlye bryng in the sixth &amp; tenth Chapters of the Epistle to the Hebrues, and the second Chapter of the seconde Epistle of Peter, not consyderyng that in those places the holy Apostles do not speake of the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falles, that we as long as we cary about this body of sinne are subiect vnto: but of the finall fallyng away from Christ and his Gospel, which <note place="margin">

Whereunto may be added the lyke confession of Peter, where Christ doth geue this most infallible testimonie: Thou art blessed Simon the sonne of Jonas, for neither fleshe nor blood hath reuealed this vnto thee, but my father which is in heauen. These words are sufficient to proue that Peter was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redye iustifyed, through this his lyuelye fayth in the onely begotten sonne of god, wherof he made so notable and so solemyne a confession. But did

But now marke what doth followe. After the same holy Apostle had on Whitsondaye <note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> with the reste of the Disciples receaued the gyft of the holy ghost most aboundauntly, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no smal offence in <hi>Antiochia,</hi> by brynging the consciences of the faythfull into doubt by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <note place="margin">Galath. 2.</note> so that Paule was faine to rebuke him to his face, because that he walked not vprightlye, or went not the ryght way in the Gospell. Shall we now say, that after this greeuous offence, he was vtterly excluded and shut out from the grace and mercy of God, &amp; that this his trespasse, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was a stumbling blocke vnto manye, was vnpardonable? God defende we shoulde saye so. But as these examples are not brought in, to the ende that we shoulde thereby take a boldnesse to sinne, presuming on the mercye and goodnesse of God, but to the ende that if through the frayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our owne fleshe and the temptation of the Deuill we fall into the lyke sinnes, we shoulde in no wyse dispayre of the mercy and goodnes of God: Euen so muste we beware and take heede,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Jtherto haue ye heard (wel beloued) how needeful &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary the doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce is, &amp; how earnestly it is throughout all the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God vrged and set foorth, both by the auncient prophetes, by our Sauiour Jesu Christ, &amp; his Apostles, and that forasmuche as it is the conuertion or turning agayne of the whole man vnto God, from whom we go away by sinne, these four pointes ought to be obserued, That is, from whence or from what thinges we muste returne, vnto whom this our returnyng muste be made, by whose meanes it ought to be done that it may be effectual, and last of all, after what sort we ought to behaue our selues in the same, that it may be profitable vnto vs, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto the thing that we do seeke by it. Ye haue also learned, that as the opinion of them that denie the benefite of repentaunce vnto those that after they be come to God and graffed in our sauiour Jesu Christe, do through the fraylenesse of theyr fleshe, and the temptation of the deuill, fall into some greeuous and detestable sinne, is most pestilent and pernitious: So we muste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that we do in no wyse thynke that we are able of our owne selues and of our own strength to retourne vnto the Lorde our God, from whom we are gone awaye by our wyckednesse and sinne. Nowe it shall be declared vnto you,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:6498:263"/>
what be the true partes of repentaunce; &amp; what thinges ought to moue vs to repent, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the Lorde our God with all speede. Repentaunce (as it is sayde before) is a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning vnto God, whereby men, forsakyng vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye their idolatrie and wickednes, do with a lyuelye fayth embrace, loue, and worship the true lyuyng God onelye, and geue them selues to all maner of good workes, whiche by Gods worde they knowe to be acceptable vnto him. Nowe there be foure partes of repentaunce, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng <note place="margin">There be foure partes of repentaunce</note> set together, maye be lykened to an easie and short ladder, whereby we may clymbe from the bottomles pit of perdition, that we caste our selues into by our daylye offences and greeuous sinnes, vp into the castle or to wre of eternal and endelesse saluation. The fyrst is the contrition of the heart. For we must be earnestly sorye for our sinnes, and vnfaynedlye lament &amp; be wayle that we haue by them so greuously offended our most bounteous and mercifull God, who so tenderlye loued vs, that he gaue his onely begotten sonne to dye a most bitter death, &amp; to shed his deare hart blood for our redemption and deliueraunce. And veryly this inward sorowe and greefe being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in the heart for the haynousnesse of sinne, if it be earnest and vnfayned, is as a sacrifice to God, as the holy prophete Dauid doth testifye, saying: A sacrifyce to God is a troubled spyrite, <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> a contrite and broken heart, O Lord thou wylt not dispyse. But that this may take place in vs, we must be diligent to reade and heare the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and worde of God, whiche most lyuely do
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:6498:264"/>
paynt out before your eyes our naturall vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, and the enormitie of our sinfull lyfe. For vnlesse we haue a through feeling of our sinnes, how can it be that we shoulde earnestlie be sorye for them? Afore Dauid did heare the worde of the Lorde by the mouth of the prophet Nathan, <note place="margin">ii. Sa. xii.</note> what heauinesse I praye you was in hym for the adultrie and murther that he had committed? So that it myght be sayd right wel, that he slept in his owne sinne. We reade in the Actes of the Apostles, that when the people had hearde the <note place="margin">Act. iiii.</note> Sermon of Peter, they were compunct and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in theyr heartes. Whiche thing woulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue ben, if they had not heard that holsome Sermon of Peter. They therefore that haue no mynde at all neyther to reade, nor yet to heare Gods word, there is but smal hope of them that they wil as muche as once set their feete, or take holde vpon the fyrst staffe or steppe of this ladder: but rather will sinke deeper and deeper into the bottomlesse pit of perdition. For if at anye tyme through the remorse of their conscience, which accuseth them, they feele any inwarde greefe, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, or heauines for their sinnes, forasmuch as they want the salue and comfort of Gods worde, which they do dispyse, it will be vnto them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a meane to bryng them to vtter desperation then otherwyse. The seconde is, an vnfayned confession and acknowledgyng of our sinnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, whom by them we haue so greeuouslye offended, that if he shoulde deale with vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to his iustyce, we do deserue a thousande helles, if there coulde be so manye. Yet if we
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:6498:264"/>
wyll with a sorowfull and contrite hearte make an vnfayned confession of them vnto God, <note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> he will freely and frankly forgeue them, &amp; so put all our wickednes out of remembraunce before the syght of his maiestie, that they shall no more be thought vppon. Hereunto doth parteyne the golden saying of the holy prophet Dauid, where he sayth on this maner: Then I acknowledged <note place="margin">Psal. xxxi.</note> my sinne vnto thee, neither did I hyde myne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie: I sayde, I will confesse agaynst my selfe my wickednes vnto the Lorde, &amp; thou forgauest the vngodlines of my sinne. These are also the wordes of John the Euangelist: If we confesse <note place="margin">i. Iohn. i.</note> our sinnes, God is faythfull &amp; ryghteous to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue vs our sinnes, &amp; to make vs cleane from all our wickednes. Which ought to be vnderstanded of the confession that is made vnto God. For these are saint Augustines wordes: That confession <note place="margin">In Epist. ad Iulian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> comitem. 30.</note> whiche is made vnto God, is requyred by Gods lawe, whereof John the apostle speaketh, saying: If we confesse our sinnes, God is faythfull and ryghteous to forgeue vs our sinnes, and to make vs cleane from all our wickednesse. For without this confession, sinne is not forgeuen. This is then the cheefest &amp; most principal confession that in the scriptures &amp; worde of God we are bydden to make, and without the whiche we shal neuer obteyne pardon and forgeuenesse of our sinnes. In deede, besydes this there is another kynde of confession, whiche is needefull and necessarye. And of the same doth Saint James speake after this maner, saying: Acknowledge your faultes one to another, and praye one for another, that
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:6498:265"/>
ye may be saued. As if he should saye: Open that whiche greeueth you, that a remedye maye be founde. And this is commaunded both for hym that complayneth, &amp; for hym that heareth, that the one should shew his greefe to the other. The true meaning of it is, that the faythfull ought to acknowledge their offences, whereby some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, rancour, grudge, or malyce, hauyng rysen or growen among them one to another, that a brotherlye reconciliation maye be had, without the which nothing that we do can be acceptable vnto God, as our sauiour Jesus Christ doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> himselfe, saying: When thou offerest thyne offeryng at the aulter, if thou remembrest that thy brother hath ought agaynst thee, leaue there thyne offryng, &amp; go and be reconciled, and when thou art reconciled, come and offer thine offring. It may also be thus taken, that we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our weakenesse and infirmities one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the ende that knowing eche others frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we may the more earnestly pray together vnto almyghtye God our heauenly father, that he will vouchsafe to pardon vs our infirmities, for his sonne Jesus Christes sake, and not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them vnto vs, when he shall render to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to his workes. And where as the aduersaries go about to wrest this place for to maynteyne their auriculer confession withal, they are greatlye deceaued themselues, and do <note place="margin">Aunswere to the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which mainteyne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> shame fullye deceaue others. For if this texte ought to be vnderstanded of auriculer confession: then the Priestes are as muche bounde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them selues vnto the laye people, as the lay
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:6498:265"/>
people are bound to confesse them selues to them. And if to pray, is to absolue: then the laytie by this place hath as great aucthoritie to absolue the priestes, as the priestes haue to absolue the laytie. This dyd <hi>Iohannes Scotus,</hi> otherwyse <note place="margin">Iohannes Scotus. li. 4. senten. distinc. 17. quest. 1.</note> called <hi>Duns,</hi> well perceaue, who vppon this place wryteth on this maner, Neyther doth it seeme vnto me that James dyd geue this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, or that he dyd set it foorth as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng receaued of Christe. For fyrst and foremoste whence had he aucthoritie to bynde the whole Churche, syth that he was only Byshoppe of the Churche of Hierusalem? except thou wylt saye that the same Church was at the beginnyng the head Church, and consequently that he was the head Byshop, which thyng the sea of Rome wyll neuer graunt. The vnderstandyng of it then, is as in these wordes: Confesse your synnes one to another. A perswasion to humilitie, whereby he wylleth vs to confesse our selues generally vnto our neyghbours that we are synners, accordyng to this saying: If we say we haue no synne, we <note place="margin">Math. 8.</note> deceaue our selues, and the trueth is not in vs. And where that they do alleage this saying of our sauiour Jesu Christe vnto the Leaper, to proue auriculer confession to stande on Gods worde, Go thy way and shewe thy selfe vnto the prieste: Do they not see that the Leaper was cleansed from his leprosie afore he was by Christ sent vnto the priest for to shewe hym selfe vnto hym? By the same reason we must be cleansed from our spirituall leprosie, I meane, our synnes muste be forgeuen vs afore that we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:6498:266"/>
What neede we then to tell foorth our synnes into the eare of the priest, sith that they be alredy taken away? Therefore holy Ambrose in his seconde sermon vpon the hundred and nyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <note place="margin">Ambrose</note> Psalme, doth say full well: Go shewe thy selfe vnto the prieste. Who is the true prieste, but he whiche is the prieste for euer after the order of Melchisedech? Whereby this holy father doth vnderstande, that both the priesthood and the law beyng chaunged, we ought to acknowledge none other prieste for delyueraunce from our synnes but our Sauiour Jesus Christe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng our soueraigne Byshop, doth with the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his body and blood, offered once for euer vppon the aulter of the crosse, moste effectuallye cleanse the spirituall leprosie, and washe awaye the synnes of all those that with true confession of the same do flee vnto hym. It is moste eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and playne, that this auriculer confession hath not his warraunt of Gods worde, els it had not ben lawfull for <hi>Nectarius</hi> Byshoppe of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> vpon a iust occasion to haue put it downe. For when any thyng ordeyned of <note place="margin">Nectari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us soro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus ecclesiast. histo. li. 7. cap. 16. Lib. 10. confessio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. ca. 3.</note> God, is by the lewdenes of men abused, the abuse ought to be taken awaye, and the thyng it selfe suffered to remayne. Moreouer, these are Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes: What haue I to do with men, that they shoulde heare my confession, as though they were able to heale all my diseases? A curious sorte of men to knowe another mans lyfe, and slouthfull to correct and amende their owne. Why do they seeke to heare of me what I am, whiche wyll not heare of thee what they
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:6498:266"/>
are? And howe can they tell when they heare by me of my selfe, whether I tell the trueth or not, syth that no mortall man knoweth what is in man, but the spirite of man which is in him? Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine woulde not haue written thus, if auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler confession had ben vsed in his tyme. Beyng therfore not led with the conscience therof, let vs with feare and tremblyng, and with a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, vse that kynde of confession, that God doth commaunde in his worde, and then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as he is faythfull and ryghteous, he wyll forgeue vs our synnes, and make vs cleane from all wyckednesse. I do not saye, but that if anye do fynde them selues troubled in conscience, they may repayre to their learned Curate or Pastour, or to some other godly learned man, and shewe the trouble &amp; doubt of their conscience to them, that they may receaue at their hand the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table salue of Gods worde: but it is agaynst the true Christian libertie, that any man shoulde be bound to the numbryng of his synnes, as it hath ben vsed heretofore in the tyme of blindnesse and ignoraunce.</p>
               <p>The third part of repentaunce, is fayth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we do apprehende and take holde vppon the promises of God, touchyng the free pardon and forgeuenes of our synnes. Whiche promises are sealed vp vnto vs, with the death and bloodshed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of his sonne Jesu Christe. For what should auayle and profite vs to be sorye for our sinnes, to lament and bewayle that we haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our moste bounteous and mercyfull father, or to confesse and acknowledge our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

But all these thynges we fynde in Judas repentaunce, whiche in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde appearaunce dyd farre exceede and passe <note place="margin">Judas and his repentaunce.</note> the repentaunce of Peter. For fyrst and foremost we reade in the gospel, that Judas was so sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and heauie, yea that he was fylled with such <note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> anguishe and vexation of mynde, for that which he had done, that he coulde not abide to lyue any longer. Dyd not he also afore he hanged hym selfe, make an open confession of his faulte, when he sayde, I haue synned, betraying the innocent blood? And veryly this was a very bolde confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whiche might haue brought hym to greate trouble. For by it he did lay to the hygh priestes &amp; elders charge, the sheddyng of innocent blood, and that they were moste abhominable murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. He dyd also make a certayne kynde of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, when he dyd cast their money vnto them agayne. No suche thyng do we reade of Peter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had committed a very heynous synne, and most greeuous offence, in denying of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. <note place="margin">Peter and his repentaunce.</note> We fynde that he went out and wept bytter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:6498:267"/>
whereof Ambrose speaketh on this maner: Peter was sory and wept, because he erred as a <note place="margin">Depeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin. 1. cap. petrus</note> man. I do not fynde what he sayed, I know that he wept. I reade of his teares, but not of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. But howe chaunce that the one was receaued into fauour agayne with God, and the other cast away, but because that the one dyd by a lyuely fayth in hym whom he had denyed, take hold vpon the mercie of God, and the other wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fayth, whereby he dyd dispayre of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and mercie of God? It is euident and playn then, that although we be neuer so earnestly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for our synnes, acknowledge and confesse them: yet all these thynges shalbe but meanes to bryng vs to vtter desperation, except we do stedfastly beleue, that God our heauenly father wyll for his sonne Jesu Christes sake, pardon and forgeue vs our offences and trespasses, and vtterly put them out of remembraunce in his syght. Therefore, as we sayde before, they that teache repentaunce without Christe, and a lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fayth in the mercie of God, do onely teache Cains or Judas repentaunce. The fourth is, an amendement of lyfe, or a newe lyfe in bryngyng foorth fruites worthy of repentaunce. For they that do truely repent, must be cleane altered and chaunged, they muste become newe creatures, they must be no more the same that they were before. And therefore thus sayde John Baptist vnto the Pharisees and Saduces that came <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> vnto his baptisme: O generation of vypers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the anger to come? bryng foorth therefore fruites worthy
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:6498:268"/>
of repentaunce. Whereby we do learne, that if we wyll haue the wrath of God to be pacified, we muste in no wyse dissemble, but turne vnto hym agayne with a true and sounde repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, whiche may be knowne and declared by good fruites, as by moste sure and infallible signes thereof. They that do from the bottome of their heartes acknowledge their synnes, and are vnfaignedly sory for their offences, wyll cast of al hypocrisie, and put on true humilitie, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse of heart. They wyll not onlye receaue the Phisition of the soule, but also with a moste feruent desyre long for hym. They wyll not only abstaine from the sinnes of their former lyfe, and from all other filthy vices, but also flee, exchew, and abhorre all the occasions of them. And as they dyd before geue them selues to vncleannesse of lyfe, so wyll they from henceforwardes with all diligence, geue them selues to innocencie, purenesse of lyfe, and true godlynesse. We haue the Niniuites for an example, whiche at the preachyng of Jonas dyd not onlye proclayme <note place="margin">Ionas. 3.</note> a generall fast, and that they shoulde euery one put on sackloth: but they all dyd turne from their euill wayes, and from the wyckednesse that was in their handes. But aboue all other, the <note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note> historie of Zacheus is moste notable. For beyng come vnto our sauiour Jesu Christe, he dyd say: Beholde Lorde, the halfe of my goodes I geue to the poore, and if I haue defrauded any man, or taken ought away by extortion or fraude, I do restore hym foure folde. Here we see that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his repentaunce, he was no more the man
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:6498:268"/>
that he was before, but was cleane chaunged and altered. It was so farre of, that he woulde continue and byde styll in his vnsatiable coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, or take ought awaye fraudulentlye from any man, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at rather he was most wylling and redye to geue away his owne, and to make satisfaction vnto all them that he had done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie and wrong vnto. Heare may we ryght well <note place="margin">Luk. 7.</note> adde the synfull woman, whiche when she came to our sauiour Jesu Christe, dyd powre downe suche aboundaunce of teares out of those wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton eyes of hers wherwith she had allured many vnto follie, that she dyd with them washe his feete, wypyng them with the heres of her head, whiche she was wont moste gloriously to set out, makyng of them a nette of the deuyll.

               <p>Fyrst, the commaundement of God, who in so many places of the holy and sacred Scriptures, doth byd vs returne vnto hym. O ye chyldren of Israel (sayth he) turne agayne from your infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, wherein ye drowned your selues, Againe, Turne you, turne you from your euil wayes: <note place="margin">Ezech. 33</note> For why wyll ye dye, O ye house of Israel?

<pb n="538" facs="tcp:6498:270"/>
by thyne iniquitie. Take vnto you these wordes with you, when you turne vnto the Lorde and say vnto hym: Take away all iniquitie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue vs gratiously, so will we offer the calues of our lippes vnto thee. In all these places we haue an expresse commaundement geuen vnto vs of God for to returne vnto hym. Therefore we must take good heede vnto our selues, least wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we haue alredy by our manyfolde synnes and transgressions, prouoked and kindeled the wrath of God agaynst vs, we do by breakyng this his commaundemente, double our offences, and so heape styll dampnation vppon our owne heades by our dayly offences and trespasses, whereby we prouoke the eyes of his maiestie, we do well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue (if he should deale with vs accordyng to his iustice) to be put away for euer from the fruition of his glorye. Nowe muche more then are we worthy of the endlesse tormentes of hell, yf when we be so gently called againe after our rebellion, and commaunded to returne, we will in no wyse hearken vnto the voyce of our heauenlye father, but walke stil after the stubbornnes of our owne heartes?</p>
               <p>Secondely, the moste comfortable and sweete promise, that the Lorde our God dyd of his mere mercy and goodnesse, ioyne vnto his comaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For he doth not only say, Returne vnto me O Israel: but also, If thou wylt returne, and put <note place="margin">Hier. 4.</note> away all thyne abhominations out of my syght, thou shalt neuer be moued.

from the bottome of his heart, I wyll put all his wyckednesse out of my remembraunce (sayth the Lorde) so that they shalbe no more thought vpon.

               <p>Thirdly, the filthinesse of synne which is such, that as long as we do abyde in it, God can not but detest and abhorre vs, neyther can there be any hope, that we shall enter into the heauenlye Hierusalem, except we be first made cleane &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from it. But this wyll neuer be, vnlesse forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng our former lyfe, we do with our whole heart returne vnto the Lorde our God, &amp; with a full purpose of amendement of lyfe, flee vnto his mercy, taking sure hold therupon through fayth in the blood of his son Jesu Christe.

And verily herein doth appeare howe filthie a thyng sin is, syth that it can by no other meanes be washed away, but by the blood of the onely begotten sonne of God. And shall we not from
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:6498:271"/>
the bottome of our heartes detest and abhorre, &amp; with all earnestnesse flee from it, syth that it dyd cost the deare heart blood of the onlye begotten sonne of God our sauiour &amp; redeemer, to purge vs from it? <hi>Plato</hi> doth in a certayne place wryte, that if vertue coulde be seene with bodily eyes, all men woulde wonderfully be enflamed and kyndeled with the loue of it: Euen so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if we myght with our bodily eyes beholde the filthynesse of synne, and the vncleannes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we coulde in no wyse abyde it, but as most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and deadly poyson, hate and eschewe it. We haue a common experience of the same in them which when they haue committed any heynous offence, or some filthy and abhominable synne, if it once come to lyght, or if they chaunce to haue a through feelyng of it, they be so ashamed (their owne conscience puttyng before their eyes the filthynes of their acte) that they dare looke no man in the face, muche lesse that they shoulde be able to stande in the syght of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the vncertayntie and brittlenesse of our owne lyues, whiche is such, that we can not assure our selues, that we shall lyue one houre, or one halfe quarter of it. Whiche by experience we do fynde daily to be true, in them that beyng nowe mery and lustye, and sometymes feastyng and banquettyng with their freendes, do fall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly dead in the streetes, and otherwhyles vnder the boarde when they are yet at meate. These daily examples, as they are moste terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dreadfull, so ought they to moue vs to seeke for to be at one with our heauenlye iudge,

that we may with a good conscience appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym, whensoeuer it shal please him for to cal vs, whether it be sodaynly or otherwyse, for we haue no more charter of our lyfe, then they haue. But as we are moste certayne that we shall dye, so are we most vncertayne when we shal dye. For our lyfe doth lye in the hande of God, who wyll take it away when it pleaseth hym. And veryly <note place="margin">Death the Lordes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

For so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly shall the wrath of the Lorde breake foorth, and in thy securitie shalt thou be destroyed, and shalt perishe in tyme of vengeaunce. Whiche wordes I desyre you to marke diligently, because they do most lyuely put before our eyes, the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of manye men, whiche abusyng the long sufferyng and goodnes of God, do neuer thynke on repentaunce or amendement of lyfe.

the wrong done by thee. And saye not, I haue synned, and what euyll hath come vnto me? For the almyghtie is a patient rewarder, but he wyll not leaue thee vnpunished. Because thy synnes are forgeuen thee, be not without feare to heape sin vpon synne. Say not neyther, The mercie of god is great, he wil forgeue my manifold sinnes: For mercy and wrath come from him, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation commeth vpon vnrepentant synners. As if he should say? Art thou strong and mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Art thou lustye and young? Haste thou the wealth and ryches of the worlde? Or when thou hast synned, hast thou receaued no punishment for it? Let none of all these thynges make thee to be the slower to repent, and to returne with speede vnto the Lorde. For in the day of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of his sodayne vengeaunce, they shall not be able to helpe thee. And speciallye when thou art eyther by the preaching of Gods worde, or by some inwarde motion of his holy spirite, or els by some other meanes called vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, neglect not the good occasion that is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred vnto thee, least when thou wouldest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, thou hast not the grace for to do it. For to repent, is a good gyft of God, which he wyll ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer graunt vnto them, whiche lyuyng in carnal securitie, do make a mocke of his threatnynges, or seeke to rule his spirites as they list, as though his workyng &amp; gyftes were tyed vnto their wyll. Fifthly, the auoydyng of the plagues of God, and the vtter destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that by his ryghteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth hang ouer the heades of them all that will in no wyse returne vnto the Lorde: I wyll

The first aucthour of which rebellion, the roote of all vices, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all mischeefes, was Lucifer, fyrst Gods most excellent creature, and moste bounden sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, <note place="margin">Mat. 4. b. 9.

Thus you do see, that neither heauen nor paradise coulde suffer anye rebellion in them, neyther be places for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to remayne in. Thus became rebellion, as you see, both the first and greatest, and the verye roote of all other sinnes, and the first and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cause both of all worldlye and bodyly mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, sorowes, diseases, sicknesses, and deathes, and whiche is infinitely worse then all these, as is sayde, the very cause of death and dampnation eternall also.

               <p>As in readyng of the holye scriptures, we shall finde in very many and almoste infinite places, aswell of the olde Testament, as of the newe, that kynges and princes, aswell the euill as the good, do raigne by Gods ordinaunce, and that subiectes are bounden to obey them: that God doth geue princes wysdome, great power, and aucthoritie: that God defendeth them agaynst their enemies, and destroyeth their enemies hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly: that the anger and displeasure of the prince is as the roaring of a Lion, and the very messenger of death: and that the subiect that prouoketh hym to displeasure, sinneth agaynst his owne soule: With many other thinges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng both the aucihoritie of princes, and the duetie of subiectes. But here let vs rehearse two speciall places out of the new Testament, which may stand in steade of all other. The first out of saint Paules Epistle to the Romanes and the. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <note place="margin">Rom. xiii.</note> Chapter, where he wryteth thus vnto all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, Let euery soule be subiect vnto the hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers, for there is no power but of God, and the powers that be are ordeyned of GOD.
<q>
                     <pb n="548" facs="tcp:6498:275"/>
Whosoeuer therfore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinaunce of God: and they that resist, shall receaue to them selues dampnation. For princes are not to be feared for good workes, but for euil. Wylt thou then be without feare of the power? Do well, so shalt thou haue prayse of the same: For he is the minister of GOD for thy wealth: but yf thou do euill, feare: for he beareth not the sworde for naught, for he is the minister of God to take vengeaunce vppon hym that doth euyll. Wherefore ye muste be subiect, not because of wrath only, but also for conscience sake: for, for this cause ye pay also tribute, for they are Gods ministers, seruyng for the same purpose. Geue to euery man therefore his duetie: tribute, to whom tribute belongeth: custome, to whom custome is due: feare, to whom feare belongeth: honour, to whom ye owe honour.</q> Thus farre are saint Paules wordes. The seconde place is in saint Peters first Epistle, and the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whose wordes are these, <q>Submit you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r selues <note place="margin">i. Pet. ii.</note> vnto all maner ordinaunce of man for the lordes sake, whether it be vnto the kyng, as vnto the cheefe head, eyther vnto rulers, as vnto them that are sent of hym for the punishment of euyll doers, but for the cheryshing of them that do well. For so is the wyll of GOD, that with well doyng ye may stoppe the mouthes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt and foolishe men: as free, and not as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the libertie for a cloke of malitiousnesse, but euen as the seruauntes of GOD. Honour all men, loue brotherly felowship, feare GOD, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the kyng. Seruauntes obey your maisters
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:6498:275"/>
with feare, not onlye yf they be good and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but also though they be frowarde.</q> Thus farre out of Saint Peter. By these two places of the holy scriptures, it is moste euident, that Kinges, Queenes, and other Princes (for he speaketh of aucthoritie &amp; power, be it in men or women) are ordeyned of God, are to be obeyed and honoured of their subiectes: that suche sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes as are disobedient or rebellious agaynst theyr princes, disobey GOD, and procure theyr owne damnation: that the gouernment of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is a great blessing of God, geuen for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, specially of the good and godly: for the comfort and cherishing of whom God geueth and setteth vp princes: and on the contrary part, to the feare and for the punishment of the euyll and wicked. Finally, that yf seruauntes ought to obey theyr maisters, not only beyng gentle, but suche as be frowarde: aswell and muche more ought subiectes to be obedient, not only to their good and curteous, but also to theyr sharpe and rigorous princes. It commeth therfore neyther of chaunce and fortune (as they tearme it) nor of thambition of mortal men and women climing vp of theyr owne accorde to dominion, that there be Kynges, Queenes, Princes, and other gouernours ouer men beyng theyr subiectes: but al Kinges, Queenes, and other gouernours are specially appoynted by the ordinaunce of GOD. And as GOD him selfe, beyng of an <note place="margin">Psal. 10. b. 16. &amp;. 45. a. 6. &amp;c. &amp;. 47. a. 2.</note> infinite maiestie, power, and wysdome, ruleth and gouerneth all thynges in heauen and in earth, as the vniuersal Monarche &amp; onlye Kyng
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:6498:276"/>
and Emperour ouer all, as beyng onlye able to take and beare the charge of all: so hath he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, <note place="margin">Eccle. 17. c</note> ordayned, and set earthly princes ouer particuler kyngdomes and dominions in earth, both for the auoydyng of all confusion, whiche els woulde be in the worlde if it should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such gouernours, and for the great quiet and benefite of earthly men theyr subiectes, and also that the princes them selues in aucthoritie, power, wysdome, prouidence, and ryghteousnes in gouernment of people and countreys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, shoulde resemble his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gouernaunce, as the maiestie of heauenly <note place="margin">Mat. 18. c. 23. &amp;. 22. a. 2 Psalm. x. b 16. &amp;. 45. a. b. &amp;. 47. a. 2. &amp;c.

Unto the which similitude of heaueuly gouernment, the nearer and nearer that an earthly prince doth come in his regiment, the greater blessing of Gods mercie is he vnto that countrey and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ouer whom he raigneth: and the further and further that an earthlye prince doth swarue
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:6498:276"/>
from the example of the heauenly gouernment, the greater plague he is of Gods wrath, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment by Gods iustice, vnto that countrey &amp; people, ouer whom God for their sinnes hath placed suche a prince and gouernour. For it is in deede euident both by the scriptures, and by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye experience, that the maintenaunce of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; godlinesse, and consequently of the wealth and prosperitie of a kyngdome and people, both stand and rest more in a wyse and good prince on the one part, then in great multitudes of other men being subiectes: and on the contrary part, the ouerthrowe of all vertue and godlinesse, and consequently the decay and vtter ruine of a Realme and people doth growe and come more by an vndiscrete and euill gouernour, then by many thousandes of other men being subiectes: thus say the holye scriptures, Well is thee O <note place="margin">Eccle. 10. d. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

subiectes. Thus speake the scriptures, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience testifieth of good and euill princes.</p>
               <p>What shall subiectes do then? shall they obeye valiaunt, stout, wyse, and good Princes, and contempne, disobey, and rebel agaynst chyldren beyng theyr Princes, or agaynst vndiscrete and euill gouernours: GOD forbid. For fyrst what a perilous thing were it to commit vnto the subiectes the iudgement whiche Prince is wyse and godly, and his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good, and which is otherwyfe: as though the foote must iudge of the head: an enterprise very haynous, and must needes breede rebellion. For who els be they that are moste enclined to rebellion, but suche hautie spirites? From whom springeth suche foule ruine of Realmes? Is not rebellion the greatest of all mischeefes? And who are most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye to the greatest mischeefes, but the worste men? Rebelles therefore the worst of all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes are most redye to rebellion, as beyng the worst of all vices, and furthest from the duetie of a good subiect: as on the contrary part, the best subiectes are moste firme and constant in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as in the speciall and peculier vertue of good subiects. What an vnworthy matter were it then to make the naughtiest subiectes, and moste enclined to rebellion and all euill, iudges ouer their princes, ouer their gouernment, and ouer their counsellers, to determine whiche of them be good or tollerable, and whiche be euyll, and so intollerable that they must needes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued by rebels, beyng euer redy as the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest subiectes, soonest to rebell agaynst the best
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:6498:277"/>
Princes, specially yf they be young in age, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in sexe, or gentle and curteous in gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as trusting by their wicked boldnesse, easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to ouerthrowe theyr weakenesse and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or at the least so to feare the mindes of such princes that they maye haue impunitie of theyr mischeuous doynges. But whereas in deede a rebell is worse then the worst Prince, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion worse then the worste gouernment of the worst prince that hitherto hath ben: both are rebels vnmeete ministers, and rebellion an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and vnwholsome medicine to refourme any small lackes in a prince, or to cure anye litle greefes in gouernment, suche leude remedies beyng farre worse then anye other maladyes and disorders that can be in the bodye of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. But whatsoeuer the prince be, or his gouernment, it is euident that for the moste part those princes whom some subiectes do thynke to be very godlye, and vnder whose gouernment they reioyce to liue: some other subiectes do take the same to be euill and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and do wishe for a chaunge. If therefore all subiectes that mislike of their prince, should rebell, no Realme shoulde euer be without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. It were more meete that rebels shoulde heare the aduise of wyse men, and geue place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr iudgement, and folowe the example of obedient subiectes, as reason is that they whose vnderstandyng is blinded with so euyll an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shoulde geue place to them that be of sound iudgement, and that the worse shoulde geue place to the better: and so myght Realmes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:6498:278"/>
in long obedience, peace, and quietnesse. But what yf the prince be vndiscrete, and euil in deede, and it also euident to all mens eyes, that he so is? I aske agayne, what yf it be long of the wickednesse of the subiectes, that the prince is vndiscrete and euyll? Shal the subiectes both by their wickednesse prouoke God for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued punishment to geue them an vndiscrete or euyll prince, and also rebell agaynst hym, and withall agaynst God, who for the punishment of their sinnes dyd geue them suche a prince? Wyll you heare the scriptures concernyng this poynt? <q>God (say the holy scriptures) maketh a <note place="margin">Iob. 34. d. 30.</note> wicked man to raigne for the sinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Agayne, God geueth a prince in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">O see. 13. a. 6.</note> (meanyng an euyll one) and taketh away a prince in his displeasure,</q> meanyng special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye when he taketh away a good prince, for the sinnes of the people: as in our memorie he toke away our good Josias kyng Edwarde in his young and good yeres for our wickednesse. And contrarilye the scriptures do teache that <note place="margin">2. Par. 2. &amp;. 9. Prou. xvi.</note> God geueth wysdome vnto princes, and maketh a wyse and good kyng to raigne ouer that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he loueth, and who loueth hym. <q>Agayne, yf the people obey God, both they and theyr kyng shall prosper and be safe, els both shal <note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>Here you see, that GOD placeth aswell euyll princes as good, and for what cause he doth both. If we therefore wyll haue a good prince, eyther to be geuen vs, or to continue, nowe we haue suche a one, let vs by our obedience to God
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:6498:278"/>
and to our prince, moue God thereunto. If we wyll haue an euyll prince (when God shall sende such a one) taken away, and a good in his place, let vs take away our wickednesse whiche prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth God to place such a one ouer vs, &amp; God wyll eyther displace hym, or of an euyll prince, make hym a good prince: so that we first wyll chaunge our euyll into good. For wyll you heare the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? <note place="margin">Pro. xxi. a Esdr. 7. d.</note> The heart of the prince is in Gods hande, which way soeuer it shall please hym, he turneth it. Thus say the scriptures, wherfore let vs turne from our synnes vnto the Lorde with all our heartes, and he wyl turne the heart of the prince vnto our quiet and wealth: Els for subiectes to deserue through theyr synnes to haue an euyll prince, &amp; then to rebel against hym, were double and treble euyll, by prouokyng GOD more to plague them: Nay let vs eyther deserue to haue a good prince, or let vs patiently suffer and obey suche as we deserue. And whether the prince be good or euill, let vs accordyng to the counsel of the holy scriptures, pray for the prince, for his continuaunce and increase in goodnesse yf he be good, and for his amendement yf he be euyll.</p>
               <p>Wyll you heare the scriptures concerning this most necessarie poynt? <q>I exhort therefore sayth saint Paul, that aboue all thinges, prayers, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, <note place="margin">1.

For what shoulde <note place="margin">The tenth com maundement.</note> I speake of couetyng or desyryng of other mens wiues, houses, landes, goodes, and seruauntes in rebels, who by theyr wylles would leaue vnto no man any thyng of his owne? Thus you see that al gods lawes are by rebels violated and broken, &amp; that all sinnes possible to be committed against God or man, be contayned in rebellion: which sinnes yf a man list to name by the accustomed names of the seuen capitall or deadly sinnes, as pride, enuie, wrath, couetousnes, slouth, glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and letcherie, he shall finde them all in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and amongst rebels. For first, as ambition and desyre to be aloft, whiche is the propertie of pryde, styrreth vp many mens myndes to rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so commeth it of a luciferian pryde and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, that a fewe rebellious subiects should set themselues vp against the maiestie of theyr

prince, agaynst the wysedome of the counsellers, agaynst the power and force of all nobilitie, and the faythfull subiectes and people of the whole realme. As for enuie, wrath, murther, and desyre of blood, and couetousnes of other mens goodes, landes and lyuynges, they are the inseparable accidentes of all rebelles, and peculier properties that do vsually stirre vp wycked men vnto rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Nowe suche as by riotousnesse, gluttonye, drunkennesse, excesse of apparell, and vnthriftie games, haue wasted their owne goodes vnthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, the same are moste apte vnto and most desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of rebellion, whereby they trust to come by other mens goodes, vnlawfully and vyolentlye. And where other gluttons and drunkardes take to muche of suche meates and drynkes as are serued to tables, rebelles waste and consume in short space al corne in barnes, feeldes, orels wher, whole garners, whole storehouses, whole cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, deuour whole flockes of sheepe, whole droues of oxen and kyne. And as rebels that are maryed, leauyng their owne wyues at home, do moste vngratiously: so much more do vnmaryed men worse then any stallandes or horsses, beyng now by rebellion set at libertie from correction of lawes whiche brydeled them before, whiche abuse by force other mens wyues, and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and rauishe virgins, and maydens, moste shamefully, abhominably and damnably. Thus all synnes by all names that synnes may be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and by all meanes that all synnes maye be committted and wrought, do all wholly vppon heapes folowe rebellion, and are to be founde
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:6498:290"/>
altogether amongst rebelles. Nowe whereas pestilence, famine &amp; warre, are by the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declared to be the greatest worldly plagues and miseries that lightly can be, it is euident, <note place="margin">2. Reg. 24. c. 14.</note> that all the miseries that all these plagues haue in them, do wholly altogether folowe rebellion, wherin as all their miseries be, so is there much more mischeefe then in them al. For it is knowne that in the resortyng of great companyes of men together, whiche in rebellion happeneth both vppon the parte of true subiectes, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles, by their close lying together, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ayre and place where they do lye, with ordure and muche fylth, in the hoatte weather: and by vnholesome lodging, and lying often vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the grounde, specially in cold and wette we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Wynter, by their vnholesome diet, and feedyng at all tymes, and often by famine and lacke of meate and drinke in due tyme, and again by takyng to muche at other tymes: It is well knowne I say, that aswell plagues and pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as all other kyndes of sicknesse and maladies by these meanes growe vpon and amongst men, whereby mo men are consumed at the length, then are by dint of sworde sodenly slayne in the feelde. So that not onlye pestilences, but also all other sicknesse, diseases, and maladies, do folow rebellion, which are muche more horrible then plagues, pestilences, and diseases sent directlye from god, as hereafter shall appeare more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>
               <p>And as for hunger and famine, they are the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier companions of rebellion: for whiles rebels
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:6498:290"/>
do in short tyme spoyle and consume al corne and necessarie prouision, whiche men with their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours had gotten and appoynted vpon, for their fyndyng the whole yere after, and also do let all other men, husbandmen, and others, from their husbandrie, and other necessarie workes, wherby prouision should be made for times to come, who seeth not that extreame famine and hunger must needes shortly ensue and folowe rebellion? Now whereas the wyse kyng and godly prophete Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid iudged warre to be worse then either famine <note place="margin">2. Reg. 24. c. 14.</note> or pestilence, for that these two are often suffered by God, for mans amendment, and be not sinnes of them selues: but warres haue alwayes the synnes and mischeefes of men vpon the one syde or other ioyned with them, and therfore is warre the greatest of these worldly mischeefes: but of all warres, ciuil warre is the worst, and farre more abhominable yet is rebellion then anye ciuill warre beyng vn worthy the name of any warre, so farre it exceedeth all warres in all naughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in all mischeefe, and in all abhomination. And therfore our sauiour Christe denounceth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation <note place="margin">Mat. 12. b.</note> and destruction to that Realme, that by sedition and rebellion is diuided in it selfe. Nowe as I haue shewed before, that pestilence and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, so is it yet more euident that all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, miseries, and mischeefes of warre, be more greeuous, and do more folowe rebellion then anye other warre, as beyng farre worse then all other warres. For not onlye those ordinarye and vsuall mischeefe and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:6498:291"/>
of other warres, do folowe rebellion, as corne and other thynges necessarie to mans vse to be spoyled, houses, villages, townes, cities to be taken, sacked, burned, &amp; destroyed, not onlye many very wealthy men, but whole countreyes to be impouerished, and vtterly beggered, manye thousandes of men to be slayne and murthered, women and maydes to be vyolated and deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: whiche thynges when they are done by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne enemies, we do muche mourne, as we haue great causes, yet are al these miseries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wyckednesse wrought by any our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen. But when these mischeefes are wrought in rebellion by them that shoulde be freendes, by countreymen, by kynsmen, by those that should defende their countrey, and countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from suche miseries, the miserie is nothyng so great, as is the mischeefe and wyckednesse when the subiectes vnnaturally do rebel against their prince, whose honour and lyfe they shoulde defende, though it were with the losse of their owne lyues: countreymen to disturbe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique peace, and quietnesse of their countrey, for defence of whose quietnesse they shoulde spende their lyues: the brother to seeke, and often to worke the death of his brother, the sonne of the father, the father to seeke or procure the death of his sonnes, beyng at mans age, and by their faultes to disherite their innocent chyldren and kynsmen their heires for euer, for whom they myght purchase lyuynges and landes, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parentes do take care and paynes, and be at great costes and charges: and vniuersally in stead

In forraigne warres our countreymen in obteynyng the victorye win the prayse of valiauntnesse, yea and though they were ouercommed and slayne, yet wine they an honest commendation in this worlde, and dye in a good conscience, for seruing God, their prince,

and their countrey, and be chyldren of eternall saluation: But in rebellion howe desperate and strong so euer they be, yet wynne they shame here in fyghtyng agaynst God, their prince, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and therfore iustly do fall headlong into hell if they dye, and lyue in shame and fearefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, though they escape. But commonly they be rewarded with shamful deathes, their heades &amp; carkases set vpon poles, or hanged in chaines, eaten with kytes and crowes, iudged vnworthie the honour of buryall, and so their soules, if they repent not (as commonly they do not) the deuyll harryeth them into hell, in the myddest of their mischeefe.

We may soone knowe (good people) how heynous offence the trecherie of rebellion is, if we call to remembraunce the heauie wrath and dreadfull indignation of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtie God agaynst such subiectes as do onlye but inwardely grudge, mutter, and murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst their gouernours, though their inwarde treason so priuilie hatched in their breastes, come not to open declaration of their doynges, as

harde it is whom the deuill hath so farre entised against Gods word to kepe them selues there: no he meaneth still to blowe the cole, to kindle their rebellious heartes to flame into open deedes, if he be not with grace speedily withstanded.</p>
               <p>Some of the chyldren of Israel beyng murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers agaynste their magistrates appoynted ouer <note place="margin">Num. 11. a. Num. 12. c 10. Num. 16.

Whiche horrible destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of suche Israelites as were murmurers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst Moyses, appoynted by God to be their head and cheefe magistrate, are recorded in the booke of Numbers, and other places of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for perpetual memorie and warnyng to al subiects, how hyghly God is displeased with the murmuring and euyll speakyng of subiectes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste their princes, for that as the scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth, <note place="margin">Exo. 16. b. 7. &amp;c.</note> their murmure was not agaynst their prince only, beyng a mortal creature, but against God hym selfe also.

But those examples are wrytten to stay vs, not onlye from suche mischeefes, but also from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, or speaking once an euill worde agaynst our prince, which though any should do neuer so secretly, yet do the holy scriptures shewe that the very byrdes of the ayre wyll bewray them: and these so manye examples before noted out of the <note place="margin">Eccl. 10. d.</note> same holy scriptures do declare, that they shal not escape horrible punyshment therefore. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng actual rebellion, amongst many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof set foorth in the holy scriptures, the example of Absolon is notable: who entryng in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conspiracie agaynst kyng Dauid his father, both vsed the aduice of very wittie men, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled <note place="margin">2. Re. 15. c. 12. &amp;. 17. a. 1. &amp;c. 11. &amp;. 18. b. 7. 81.</note> a verye great and huge companie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels: the whiche Absolon though he were moste goodly of person, of great nobilitie, beyng the kynges sonne, in great fauour of the people, and so dearely beloued of the kyng hym selfe, so much that he gaue commaundement that (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng his rebellion) his lyfe shoulde be saued: when for these consyderations, moste men were <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="586" facs="tcp:6498:294"/>
ayre, to geue an eternall document, that neyther comelynes of personage, neither nobilitie, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the people, no nor the fauour of the king him selfe, can saue a rebel from due punishment: God the king of al kinges being so offended with him, that rather then he should lacke due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his treason, euery tree by the way wyl be a gallous or gybbet vnto hym, and the heere of his owne head wyl be vnto him insteade of an haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to hang hym vp with, rather then he shoulde lacke one: A fearefull example of Gods punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (good people) to consider. Now Achitophel, <note place="margin">Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel.</note> though otherwyse an exceedyng wyse man, yet the mischeeuous counseller of Absolon, in this wycked rebellion, for lacke of an hangman, a conuenient seruitour for suche a traytour, went <note place="margin">2. Re. 15. c. 12. &amp;. 16. d. 21. 23. &amp; 17. f 23.</note> and hanged vp hym selfe, a worthy end of al false rebelles, who rather then they shoulde lacke due execution, wyll by Gods iust iudgement, become hangmen vnto them selues. Thus happened it to the captaynes of that rebellion: besyde fourtie thousande of rascall rebelles slayne in the feelde, and in the chase. Lykewyse is it to be seene in the holy scriptures, how that great rebellion which <note place="margin">2. Reg. 18. c. 7. 8. 9.</note> the traytor Seba moued in Israel, was sodenly appeased, the head of the captayne traytor (by the meanes of a seely woman) beyng cut of. And as the holy scriptures do shewe, so doth daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">2. Reg. 20.</note> proue, that the counsels, conspiracies, and attemptes of rebelles, neuer tooke effect, neyther <note place="margin">Psal. 20. 12. b.</note> came to good, but to most horrible ende. For though God doth often tymes prosper iust and
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:6498:294"/>
lawefull enemies, which be no subiectes, against their forraigne enemies, yet dyd he neuer long prosper rebellious subiectes against their prince, were they neuer so great in aucthority, or so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in number. Fiue princes or kynges (for so the <note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> scripture tearmeth them) with all their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, coulde not preuayle agaynst Chodorlao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, vnto whom they had promised loyaltie and obedience, and had continued in the same certain yeres, but they were all ouerthrowen and taken prisoners by him: but Abraham with his familie and kynsfolkes, an handefull of men in respect, owyng no subiection vnto Chodorlaomor, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>we hym and all his hoast in battell, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the prisoners, and delyuered them. So that though warre be so dreadfull and cruell a thyng, as it is, yet doth God often prosper a fewe in lawefull warres with forraigne enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste manye thousandes: but neuer yet pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered he subiectes beyng rebelles agaynst their naturall soueraigne, were they neuer so great or noble, so manye, so stout, so wittie, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, but alwayes they came by the ouerthrowe, and to a shamefull ende: so muche doth God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre rebellion, more then other warres, though otherwyse beyng so dreadfull, and so great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to mankynde. Though not onlye great multitudes of the rude and rascall commons, but sometyme also men of great wit, nobilitie, and aucthoritie, haue moued rebellions agaynst their lawefull princes (whereas true nobilitie shoulde moste abhorre suche vilanous, and true wysedome shoulde moste detest suche frantike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion)
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:6498:295"/>
though they would pretende sundry cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as the redresse of the common wealth (which rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all other mischeefes doth most destroy) or reformation of religion (whereas rebellion is most agaynst all true religion) though they haue made a great shewe of holy meanyng by begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng their rebellions with a counterfet seruice of God, (as dyd wycked Absolon begyn his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <note place="margin">2. Reg. 15. c. 12.</note> with sacrificing vnto God) though they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, and beare about ensignes, and banners, whiche are acceptable vnto the rude ignoraunt common people, great multitudes of whom by such false pretences and shewes they do deceaue, and draw vnto them: yet were the multitudes of the rebels neuer so huge and great, the captaines neuer so noble, politike, and wittie, the pretences faigned to be neuer so good and holye, yet the speedie ouerthrowe of all rebelles, of what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, state, or condition so euer they were, or what colour or cause soeuer they pretended, is, and euer hath ben suche, that God thereby doth shewe that he alloweth neyther the dignitie of anye person, nor the multitude of anye people, nor the waight of any cause, as sufficient for the whiche the subiectes may moue rebellion agaynste their princes. Turne ouer and reade the histories of all nations, looke ouer the Chronicles of our owne countrey, call to mynde so manye rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of olde tyme., and some yet freshe in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ye shall not fynde that God euer prospered anye rebellion agaynst their naturall and lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prince, but contrarywyse that the rebelles were ouerthrowen and slayne, and such as were
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:6498:295"/>
taken prisoners dreadfullye executed. Consyder the great &amp; noble families of Dukes, Marques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Earles, and other Lordes, whose names ye shall reade in our Chronicles, now cleane extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and gone, &amp; seeke out the causes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, you shall fynd that not lacke of issue &amp; heires male, hath so muche wrought that decay, and waste of noble blooddes and houses, as hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. And for so muche as the redresse of the common wealth hath of olde ben the vsual faig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pretence of rebels, and religion nowe of late begynneth to be a colour of rebellion: let all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and discreete subiectes consyder well of both, and fyrste concerning religion. If peaceable king Salomon was iudged of God to be more meete to buylde his Temple (whereby the orderyng of religion is meant) then his father kyng Dauid, though otherwyse a moste godlye kyng, for that Dauid was a great warryer, and had shead muche blood, though it were in his warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste the enemies of God: of this may all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reasonable subiects consyder, that a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prince, specially our most peaceable and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfull Queene, who hath hitherto shed no blood at all, no not of her most deadly enemies, is more lyke and farre meeter eyther to set vp, or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne true religion, then are bloody rebels, who haue not shead the blood of Gods enemies, as kyng Dauid had done, but do seeke to shead the blood of Gods freendes, of their owne countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of their owne most deare freendes and kynsfolke, yea the destruction of their moste gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious prince and naturall countrey, for defence
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:6498:296"/>
of whom they ought to be redy to shedde their blood, if need should so requyre. What a religion it is that such men and by suche meanes would restore, may easily be iudged: euen as good a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion surely, as rebels be good men and obedient subiectes, and as rebellion is a good meane of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse and reformation, beyng it selfe the greatest deformation of all that may possible be. But as the trueth of the Gospel of our sauiour Christe, beyng quietly and soberly taught, though it do coste them their lyues that do teache it, is able to maynteyne the true religion: so hath a frantike religion neede of such furious maintenances as is rebellion, and of suche patrones as are rebels, beyng redy not to dye for the true religion, but to kyll all that shall or dare speake agaynste their false superstition and wicked idolatrie. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng pretences of any redresse of the common wealth, made by rebels, euerye man that hath but halfe an eye, may see howe vayne they be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion being as I haue before declared, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test ruine &amp; destruction of all common wealthes that may be possible. And who so looketh on the one part vppon the persons and gouernement of the Queenes most honorable counsellers, by the experiment of so manye yeres proued honorable to her Maiestie, and moste profitable and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial vnto our countrey &amp; countreymen, &amp; on the other part, considereth the persons, state, &amp; condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the rebels the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, the refourmers, as they take vpon them, of the present gouernment, he shall fynd that the most rash and harebrayned men, the moste greatest vnthryftes, that haue
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:6498:296"/>
moste lewdely wasted their owne goodes and landes, those that are ouer the eares in debt, and suche as for their theftes, robberies, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, dare not in anye well gouerned common wealth, where good lawes are in force, shewe their faces, suche as are of moste leud and wycked behauiour and lyfe, and all suche as wyll not, or can not lyue in peace, are alwayes moste redye to moue rebellion, or to take part with rebels. And are not these meete men trowe you, to restore the common wealth decayed, who haue so spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and consumed all their owne wealth and thrifte? and very lyke to mende other mens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who haue so vyle vyces, and abhominable conditions them selues? Surely that whiche they falsely call reformation, is in deede not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a defacyng or a deformation, but also an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruction of al common wealth, as woulde well appeare, myght the rebelles haue their wylles, and doth ryght well and to well appeare by their doyng in suche places of the countrey where rebelles do route, where though they tary but a very litle while, they make suche reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they destroy al places, and vndo al men where they come, that the chylde yet vnborne may rue it, and shall many yeres hereafter curse them. Let no good and discreete subiectes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore folowe the flagge or banner displayed to rebellion, and borne by rebelles, though it haue the image of the plough paynted therein, with God speede the plough, wrytten vnder in great letters, knowyng that none hynder the
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:6498:297"/>
plough more then rebels, who will neither go to the plough them selues, nor suffer other that would go vnto it. And though some rebels beare the picture of the fyue woundes painted against those who put their onlye hope of saluation in the woundes of Christe, not those woundes which are paynted in a clout by some leude pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in those woundes whiche Christe hym selfe bare in his pretious body: though they litle knowyng what the crosse of Christe meaneth, whiche neyther caruer nor paynter can make, do beare the image of the crosse paynted in a ragge, against those that haue the crosse of Christe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their heartes, yet though they paynt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in their flagges, <hi>Hoc signo vinces,</hi> By this signe thou shalt get the victorie: by a most fond imitation of the posie of <hi>Constantinus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that noble Christian Emperour, and great conquerer of Gods enemies, a moste vnmeete en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe for rebels the enemies of God, their prince and countrey: or what other banner soeuer they shall beare, yet let no good &amp; godly subiect vpon any hope of victorie or good successe, folowe suche standarde bearers of rebellion. For as examples of suche practises are to be founde aswell in the histories of olde, as also of latter rebellions in our fathers and our freshe memorie: so not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng these pretences made, and banners borne, are recorded withall vnto perpetuall memorie, the great &amp; horrible murthers of infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and thousandes of the common people slayne in rebellion, the dreadfull executions of the aucthours and captaynes, the pitifull vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:6498:297"/>
of their wyues and chyldren, and disheriting of the heyres of the rebelles for euer, the spoiling, wasting, and destruction of the people and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where rebellion was fyrst begun, that the childe then yet vnborne myght rue and lament it, with the finall ouerthrowe, and shamefull deathes of all rebels, set foorth aswell in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of forraigne nations, as in the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our owne countrey, some thereof beyng yet in freshe memorie, which yf they were collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, woulde make many vollumes and bookes: But on the contrary part, al good lucke, successe, and prosperitie that euer happened vnto any rebels of any age, tyme, or countrey, may be conteyned in a very fewe lines, or wordes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to conclude, let all good subiectes consydering how horrible a sinne agaynst God, theyr prince, theyr countrey, and countreymen, agaynst all Gods and mans lawes rebellion is, beyng in deede not one seuerall sinne, but all sinnes agaynst God and man heaped together, consydering the mischeuous life and deedes, and the shamefull endes and deathes of all rebels hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and the pitifull vndoyng of their wyues, chyldren, and families, and disheriting of theyr heyres for euer, and aboue all thinges consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the eternall dampnation that is prepared for all impenitent rebels in hell with Satan the first founder of rebellion, and graunde captayne of all rebels, let all good subiectes I say, consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng these thinges, auoide and flee all rebellion, as the greatest of all mischeefes, and embrace due obedience to God and our prince, as the greatest

               <p>Though manye causes of rebellion maye be reckened, and almost as many as there be vices in men &amp; women, as hath ben before noted: yet in this place I wyll onlye touche the principall and most vsual causes, as specially ambition and ignoraunce. By ambition, I meane the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and restles desire in men to be of higher estate then God hath geuen or appoynted vnto them. By ignoraunce, I meane no vnskilfulnesse in artes or sciences, but the lacke of knowledge of Gods blessed wyll declared in his holye worde, whiche teacheth both extremely to abhorre all rebellion as the roote of all mischeefe, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to delyght in obedience as the begynnyng and foundation of all goodnesse, as hath ben al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so before specified. And as these are the two cheese causes of rebellion: so are there specially two sortes of men in whom these vices do rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne, by whom the deuill the aucthour of al euill doth cheefely stirre vp all disobedience and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
               <p>The restlesse ambitious hauing once determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by one meanes or other to atcheeue to theyr intended purpose, when they can not by lawfull and peaceable meanes clime so hygh as they do
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:6498:299"/>
desyre, they attempt the same by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: wherein when they can not preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the ordinarie aucthoritie and power of lawfull princes and gouernours them selues alone, they do seeke the ayde and helpe of the ignoraunt multitude, abusing them to theyr wicked purpose. Wherfore seeing a fewe ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and malitious are the aucthours &amp; heades, and multitudes of ignoraunt men are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and furtherers of rebellion, the cheefe poynt of this part shalbe aswell to notifie to the simple and ignorant men, who they be, that haue ben and be the vsuall aucthours of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, that they may knowe them: and also to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishe them to beware of the subtill suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of suche restles ambitious persons, and so to flee them: that rebellions (though attempted by a fewe ambitious) through the lack of maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce by any multitudes, maye speedyly and easyly without any great labour, daunger, or domage, be repressed and clearely extinguished. It is well knowen as well by all histories, as by dayly experience, that none haue eyther more ambitiously aspired aboue Emperours, Kinges, and Princes, nor haue more pernitiously moued the ignoraunt people to rebellion agaynst theyr Princes, then certayne persons whiche falsely chalenge to them selues to be onlye counted and called spirituall.

And whereas before that chalenge made, there was great amitie and loue amongst the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of al countreis, herevpon began emulation,
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:6498:300"/>
and much hatred betweene the Bishop of Rome and his Cleargie and freendes on the one part, and the Grecian Cleargie and Christians of the East on the other part, for that they refused to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any such supreme aucthoritie of the Bishop of Rome ouer them: the Bishop of Rome for this cause amongst other, not onlye namyng them, and taking them for schismatikes, but also neuer ceassing to persecute them, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours who had their see and continuaunce in Grece, by stirring of the subiectes to rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst their soueraigne lordes, and by raysyng deadly hatred and most cruell warres betweene them and other Christian princes. And when the Byshops of Rome had translated the title of the Emperour, and as much as in them dyd lye, the Empyre it selfe from their lorde the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Grece, and of Rome also by ryght, vnto the Christian princes of the West, they became in short space no better vnto the West Emperours, then they were before vnto the Emperours of Grece: For the vsuall discharging of subiectes from their othe of fidelitie made vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the West their soueraigne lordes, by the Byshops of Rome: the vnnaturall stirring vp of the subiectes vnto rebellion agaynst their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea of the sonne agaynst the father, by the Byshoppe of Rome: the most cruell and blooddy warres raysed amongst Christian princes of all kyngdomes: the horrible murder of infinite thousandes of Christian men beyng slayne by Christians: and whiche ensued therevpon, the pitifull losses, of so manye goodlye Cities,

The ambitious intent and most subtill driftes of the Byshops of Rome in these their practises, appeared euidently by their bolde attempt in spoyling and robbing the Emperours of their Townes, Cities, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; kingdomes in <hi>Italie, Lumbardie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cicilie,</hi> of auncient right belonging vnto the Empyre, &amp; by the ioyning of them vnto their Byshoprike of Rome, or els geuing them vnto straungers to holde them of the Churche &amp; Byshops of Rome as in <hi>capite,</hi> and as of the cheefe lordes thereof: in whiche tenure they holde the most part therof euen at this day. By these ambitious &amp; in deede trayterous meanes, and spoylyng of their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne lordes, the Byshops of Rome of Priestes, and none other by right then the Bishops of one citie and diocesse, are by false vsurpation become great lordes of many dominions, myghtie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea or Emperours rather, as claymyng to haue diuers princes and kinges to their vassals,
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:6498:301"/>
liege men, and subiectes: as in the same histories written by their owne familiers and courtiers is to be seene. And in deede since the tyme that the Byshops of Rome by ambition, treason, &amp; vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation atcheued and atteined to this height and greatnesse, they behaued them selues more lyke princes, kinges, &amp; Emperours in al things, then remained like priestes, bishops and ecclesiastical, or (as they would be called) spirituall persons in any one thing at al. For after this rate they haue handled other kings &amp; princes of other Realmes throughout Christendome, as well as theyr So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne lordes the Emperours, vsually dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng their subiectes of their othe of fidelitie, and so stirring them vp to rebellion against their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall princes, whereof some examples shall in the last part hereof be notified vnto you.</p>

Romes causelesse curse, had they in those dayes knowen, and vnderstanded, that God doth curse the blessings, and blesse the cursinges of suche wicked vsurping bishops and tyrantes? as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <note place="margin">Mala. 2.</note> afterward in kyng Henrye the eyght his dayes, and kyng Edwarde the sixt, &amp; in our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Soueraignes dayes that nowe is, where neyther the Popes curses, nor Gods manifolde blessinges are wanting. But in kyng Johns tyme the Byshop of Rome vnderstandyng the brute blyndnes, ignorance of Gods worde, and superstition of Englishmen, &amp; how much they were enclined to worship the Babilonicall beast of Rome, and to feare all his threatnings, and causelesse curses, he abused them thus, &amp; by their rebellion brought this noble realme, and kings of England vnder his most cruell tyrannie, and to be a spoyle of his most vyle and vnsaciable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes and rauenye, for a long, and a great deale to long a tyme. And to ioyne vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes of Histories, matters of latter memorie, coulde the Byshop of Rome haue raysed the late rebellions in the North and Weste countries in the tymes of Kyng Henry, and Kyng Edwarde, our gratious Soueraignes father and brother, but by abusing of the ignoraunt people? Or is it not most euident that the Byshop of Rome hath of late attempted by his Irish Patriarkes and Bishops sent from Rome with his bulles, (whereof some were apprehended) to breake downe the barres and hedges of the publibue peace in Ireland, onely vpon confidence easyly to abuse the ignoraunce of the wilde Irish men?
