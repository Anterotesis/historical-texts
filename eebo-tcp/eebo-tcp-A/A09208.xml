            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

were, our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(in the holy

lived; as some, seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14747:9"/>
and some, nine hundred; as
<hi>Methuselah;</hi> since, yeares have

have imagined they could not
be our <hi>Anni solares,</hi> as wee
account yeares by the course
of the Sun, as being a thing
incredible, that the date of a
mans life should extend it selfe
to that length, farre beyond
the age of the eldest Oakes
that may be found. Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>every Summer a year,</hi>

some amongst them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have lived a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeares. Thus far <hi>Pliny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are therefore that

that who are in the Scripture
said to have lived nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

of those monthly yeares
amounting but to ten of ours.
So they beleeved all that

in one yeare, to have
beene anciently divided into
ten parts,<note place="margin">Six times six, or 36.</note> and every part ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

in six daies God finished
his worke of the Creation;
all which number multiplied
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14747:10"/>

Moneths.</p>
               <p>But these conclusions which
they thinke witty, fall out to
be most absurd, they not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
what followeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
for then should <hi>Canan,</hi>
who begat children when he
was aged 70 yeares, have
begotten them when he was
but seven yeares old. Beside,
if wee make a yeare but of
six and thirty daies, of what
length must the Moneth be?
surely, no more than three
dayes: And how may that
place in <hi>Genesis</hi> be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">Genes. 6.</note>
where it is said, <hi>The flood
began the seven and twentieth

how will it agree, where it is

               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore certainly
beleeve the yeares then to
have beene all one with ours,
and that which is spoken of
the great Age of those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
not much to differ
from the computation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our yeares. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
said, that <hi>The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
appeared upon the first
day of the eleventh Moneth;</hi>
therefore the yeare consisted
of many Moneths: and that
we may not think the Month
then consisted of no more
than three daies, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
observe the seven and
twentieth day is named.</p>
               <p>Now, if you would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
know the reason why the
Fathers then lived so long,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14747:11"/>
know there were two causes;
first, the Finall; then, the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
the Finall causes were;
First, increasing the World
with people, wherby it might
be replenished, which they
could not doe, but by living a
long time. Secondly, Arts
were to be invented, for they
are not found, but by long
Experience. Thirdly, the
Worship of God was to be
delivered by Tradition, for
as yet the written Word was
not. But that could not be in
such a varietie of people, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those who received it
from God, had beene long
liv'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Efficient</hi> causes of this
their length of life, were
I. The singular Blessings of
God, <hi>Deuter. 30. I am thy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14747:11"/>
life, and the length of thy daies.</hi>
II. The nearnesse in time to
the Creation, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of men were of a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and a most perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and soundnesse, and
state of Health. III. The
Diet and feeding was farre
more wholesome before the
Flood, then since. IV. The
wits and invention were more
accurat and subtile, in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and finding out the nature
and qualities of all things
whereof they had need, to
the sustenance of life, then
ours are in these daies. For
these reasons, I suppose their
lives were of that length.</p>
               <p>Neither may wee wonder
at it, since Heathen Writers
testifie, That even in their
Times, some thousands of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14747:12"/>

               <p>Thus wee see, every five

God, although the Elect in

               <p>But observe another thing
no lesse wonderfull, that is,
under Kings and Princes of
the same name, how the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and estate of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
hath fallen out to have
beene quite contrarie. The
Kingdome of the <hi>Persians</hi>
grew up, and increased under

<hi>Darius</hi> it was ruined. The

<hi>Phillip</hi> the Father of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander:</hi>
the same Kingdome
under <hi>Phillip</hi> the Father of

                  <hi>Constantine Palaeologus;</hi> that

               <p>Surely, the Providence of

speaking of Thistles,<note place="margin">He mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ech Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chocks.</note> which
began then to be eaten, finds
great fault, that the strangest
things growing out of the
Earth, should serve our riot
and gluttonie; yea such as
foure-footed Beasts refuse to
touch; yet now, these in most
placcs, are usuall dishes, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the taste, and very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14747:25"/>
wholesome. I omit, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all meats, the Matrix of

testifie. See further here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in <hi>Plinie, lib. 11. cap.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>There are divers other
things from which wee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine,
not because they are
not good to be eaten, but
because the commoditie wee
receive by them, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of them in diet withholds
us. Of which sort you may
reckon Horses and Asses flesh,
which our common people
doe loath, as if Nature her
selfe abhorred them; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well dressed and prepared,
they oft times prove better
then many other meats wee
commonly feed upon. The

                  <hi>Arabians</hi> (as also <hi>Iewes</hi>) eate
no Swines flesh, but the flesh
of Cammels is their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
food. And in some places
(as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> testifieth) it
was esteemed a most hainous
offence to kill a Calfe, not
for that it was not allowed for
good meat, but because when
it was growne great, it was so
many waies usefull to man.</p>
               <p>What should I say now, of
those things which men may
be by necessitie compelled to
feed upon? Surely, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
hunger those of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerro</hi>
felt, when that Towne
was besieged, constrained the
miserable Inhabitants to eate,
not onely Mice and Catts,
(which above the rest were

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14747:26"/>
to eate all manner of

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14747:27"/>
being extreame sicke of
a Disease which they call <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephantiasis,</hi>
or <hi>Leprosie,</hi> kept
company a good time with
some Companions of his, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
one above the rest was
infected with the contagion
of the Disease: for hee was
not to bee endured, by reason
of the most loathsome stench
that proceeded from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
bodie: beside, he was
growne monstrously defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
wherefore a Cottage
was built for him neere the
Towne, upon a Hill remote
from people, a faire Spring
running hard by, and herein
this Leper was placed, with
a man attending to bring him
victuals, and other necessaries
every day.</p>
               <p>But about the beginning of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14747:27"/>
the Dog-dayes, sweet Wine
being brought in an earthen
pitcher into the Field to the
Mowers neere the place, hee
that brought it, set it not farre
from them, and vvent his
way. Being gone, and some
of them being thirstie, and
having occasion to drinke, one
takes up the Pitcher, to poure
out the Wine into a great
Bowle halfe full of water,
which they mixed with their
Wine, and out falls a drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Viper from the pitcher
into the bowle. Heereupon
the Harvest-men being ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
let the Wine alone, and
dranke and contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with other water: But
when they had finished their
dayes worke, and were to
goe out of the Field, as it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14747:28"/>
were out of pitie, they gave
to the poore Leprous man
that Wine wherein the Viper
was drowned, supposing it
better for him to dye, than
to live in that miserie. But
hee, when hee had drunke
it, was as it were, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
cured: For all that
thicke and most loathsome
scabbie swelling of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
that as a Coat covered
him all over, fell away from
him, like the hard out-side

underneath in the place,
not much unlike that soft and
thin skinne of Crab-fishes,
when the outward shell is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p>Another Example hereof,
though upon an unlike occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14747:28"/>
happened in <hi>Mysia,</hi>
a Towne of <hi>Asia,</hi> not farre

went unto a hote Bath,
hoping to finde helpe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
This man had a very
fayre and handsome young
wench to his servant, who
was an arrant—This
wench had many Suitors,
some of whom shee well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected:
but these being gone,
and shee having occasion to
use water in the house, went
into an out place, or some
ruinous shedde neere to the
house, which was full of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
by chance one of them
fell into a pot of Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
somewhere carelesly set,
and there was drowned: shee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14747:29"/>
thinking to make good use
heereof for her owne profit,
fills her Master, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
a large Cupp of this
Wine, vvhich hee dranke
quite off, and hereby, (as the
other before that lived in the
Cottage) was perfectly cured.
Hitherto <hi>Galen.</hi>

the one is, That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so ill created by God
to punish sinnfull man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
whereunto there is not

The Viper is the most veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

it is not onely good against
the Leprosie, but in <hi>Treacle,</hi>
(which is made of the flesh
of Vipers) it is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Receipt that is against
all poysons. Heereof see <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,

(upon the twentie one booke

of Saint <hi>Augustine, De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate

in ancient Graves, which by

above fifteen hundred yeares.
Moreover, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
himselfe, in the said booke

that never went out; which

that ever ware cloth of Gold,

Pearle and Precious stone:
which, though it were more

hee was the first that
allowed himselfe to be called,

and to be adored and sued

(but by and by, this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Duke of <hi>Millaine,</hi> that hee

was a very Monster, made

and Vice: for hee was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

Ewers, drinking Boules,
&amp;c. infinite store of the best

out of all Nations; all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for Hunts-men, and
Hounds, which yearly stood
him in six hundred thousand
Crownes, a great sum at that

time. For, besides his large
Kennels of Dogs, there were
great open Galleries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
in long rankes, stood all
kinds of Faulcons, and other
Hawkes upon their perches:
and a wonder it was to see
the state and riches of his
costly hangings of Gold, Silk

the Needle, by cunning hand,
with devices, and Pictures of
the most cunning Masters.

               <p>Many sweet Odours and

But many, the more
mighty and potent they are,
so much the more basely and
foolishly they abuse their

you some examples; as <hi>Xerxes</hi>
that most famous Monarch
of the <hi>Persians,</hi> was in his

the world; so for his ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
folly, hee surpassed, and
bare away the Palme from
all other. Of whom, thus
writeth <hi>Herodotus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herodot. lib. 7.</note> When he

hee commanded three
hundred blowes to be given
(by striking) to the <hi>Hellespont,</hi>
and a paire of Fetters to be
cast downe into the bottome
of that Sea. And I have heard
(saith <hi>Herodotus</hi>) that hee sent
to brand, or burne the said
Sea with a hot iron; but most
true it is, hee caused it to be
soundly box'd and beaten,
uttering these barbarous and
franticke words; Oh bitter
Water, thy King and Lord
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14747:55"/>
inflicts this punishment upon

Whereto agreeth <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
saying, <hi>Xerxes</hi> branded the
Sea, and extremely beat the
same. Moreover, hee sent
this Letter and Message to
the great Mountaine <hi>Atho;

               <p>The like madnesse among

the <hi>Romanes,</hi> possessed <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
who cast huge stones into
the Sea, and by undermining
Mountaines, let it into the
maine Land: whereupon,
very wittily, <hi>Pompey</hi> called
him, <hi>Xerxes togatus.</hi> C. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi>
grew very angry with
Heaven, because it blew, and
stormed upon certaine Stage-players
(whom himselfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
imitated, than beheld)
and because at a Feast, hee
was affrighted with Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he challenged the field
of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to fight with him
hand to hand, uttering aloud
(beholding heaven) that verse
of <hi>Homer,</hi>

that is, Take my life, or else
I will have thine. Afterward,
when hee saw hee could doe

himselfe <hi>Iupiter</hi> (as <hi>Dio</hi> and

him in all other his

imitating him onely in his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

one time he thought himselfe

would yeeld unto his lustfull

prepared a most delicate bed
in a goodly Chamber, richly
furnished with whatsoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to State, being
well gone in drinke, hee wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the comming of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva;</hi>
but having stayed long
for her, and shee not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hee sent one of his Guard
to see whether she were come
into the Chamber, or no:
when hee told the King, shee
was not yet come, the King
shot him to death with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14747:58"/>
then sent he another,

by the example of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
brought word the

him. <hi>Rhianus</hi> a Greek

               <p>
                  <hi>Lopez de Gomara</hi> saith, that
the Kings of <hi>Mexico,</hi> when

he told him, all things through
his Dominions, were at his
becke and command) after
this manner, <hi>Canutus</hi> causing
a Chaire to be set upon the
Sea shore, wherein being set,
hee said to the Sea, flowing
fast towards him, Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longest

Land, upon which I now sit,

(thou Sea) that thou
commest up no higher into
my Land, nor that thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumest

Legges, or Garments.
But the Sea, keeping his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
course, without duty or
reverence, washed both his
Legges and Gowne. He then
leaping backe, said, Let all
the Inhabitants of the world

neither is there any mortall

that himselfe was the Maule,

and slender, it is esteemed the

But one thing must be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from an Emperour, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from a Poet and an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
which passage when I

well considered, and having

                  </gap>ories, I
quickly found what Studies
concerned Princes, and what
vulgar persons. And first, I
met with that of <hi>Livie,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thus; <hi>Inde puerum libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rûm

                  </hi>
After that, from a
Boy, hee began to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ranke of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and to be instructed in
those Arts, by which good
Wits are excited, to be made
capable of a great fortune.
And another writes thus of
<hi>Augustus; Hee was first exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in the way of speaking
Greeke and Latine, hee did
endure the travell and labour
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14747:67"/>
which belonged unto service in
the Warre, hee learned whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
appertained to the Rule of
a Common wealth, or a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
The like did <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi>
in the education of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
her Sonne. For as wee
read, shee perswaded <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
to adopt <hi>Domitius Nero</hi>
her Sonne; which when shee
had done, shee procured <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
(who had,<note place="margin">

given him, amongst us, lying

him, and to make him
fit for Imperiall Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now what are these Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?
I will shew you in few
words. I speake nothing of
Pietie and Religion, which
the meanest knoweth to be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14747:68"/>
the <hi>Basis,</hi> and foundation of
all Princely Education; and
without vvhich, all other
parts, be they never so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
doe but totter and
reele: hee therefore bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
first grounded in the true
knowledge of God, and the
puritie of Christian Religion;
I first bring him to the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
Schoole, and to learne
to be Eloquent: being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
hereunto by <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
vvho in his Dialogue,
(which he intituleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
doth faine <hi>Hercules Ogrisius</hi>
to draw a mightie compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the common people
unto him, fastened by the
cares, unto little Chaines
which proceeded from his
mouth. By which fiction hee
meaneth, that a good Prince,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14747:68"/>
by the benefit of Eloquence,
may ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ily keepe his subjects
in awe, and order. <hi>Musonius</hi>
in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> also saith, It is
a most Kingly thing for a
Prince, not to be out-gone
in abilitie of an Eloquent
tongue. Neither doe I desire,
that a Prince (as King <hi>Iames</hi>
said) should be a passe-master
in Rhetorick and Eloquence,
or to sift all Oratorie for stile
and figures; it is enough if
hee but have a proper and
ready sweetnesse of utterance,
lest perhaps, if any should
perswade him to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
herein, hee might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
his Tutor, as a certaine
Prince in <hi>Euripides,</hi> answered
his, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.
<hi>Princes are not to be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14747:69"/>
instructed concerning light
matters, but in those things
which especially concerne the
Common wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From Eloquence, I would
leade a Prince to the studie
of Philosophy, not to those
subtill <hi>Quiddits,</hi> and deepe
<hi>Theoremes,</hi> which may make
one learned, but seldome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and oftentimes worse:
For, how many hath the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
heereof made plaine
Atheists; and a Prince ought
not to studie to bee eminent
in a Schoole, but learne to
know what may concerne
the life and safetie of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
wherefore the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique
part of Philosophie for
Recreation sake may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of, according to that of
<hi>Neoptolemus, Philosophandum
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14747:69"/>
paucis, nam omnino non place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi>
And as much is confessed
by <hi>Apollonius</hi> in <hi>Philostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
where hee sayeth: The
studie of Philosophie in a
King or Prince, if it be with
moderation, worketh in him
an admirable Temperature:
but overmuch toyling in the
same studie, is odious and
troublesome, and more sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
then may suite with the
State of a King. <hi>Marcus
Antoninus</hi> Emperour, though
hee gave himselfe but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately

                  <hi>quod nimius cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14747:70"/>
versed and well acquainted
with those Theoricall Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which concerne the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques,
after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of many great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Monarchs, who have
made singular use heereof:
For it is a most fitting and
necessarie thing, that a Prince
should know the Situation of
Countries, people, and their
manners; Kingdomes, and
their forme of government;
Passages, Havens, and to
beare them in memory: and
withall, not to bee altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant in Astronomie,
concerning the Heavens and
their Motions, Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
their names, with their
arising, descending, and the
like. This was the studie of
<hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in his Campe, as
<hi>Lucan</hi> testifieth:

               <p>
                  <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the tenth King
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> was so given to
the studie of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
that hee was tearmed
the <hi>Astrologer,</hi> and from his
Name, those Mathematicall
Tables, so well knowne, are
called to this day, <hi>Alphonsus
his Tables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise that famous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
whom for his merits
of Christendome, may bee
justly called a <hi>Second Charles
the Great,</hi> hee tooke such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the Study of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques,
that even in the

his Tent, sate close at this stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14747:71"/>
having for that purpose
as his Instructor, <hi>Turrianus</hi> of
<hi>Cremona</hi> evermore with him.
I meane not that I vvould
have Princes, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to <hi>Astrologie,</hi> that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling,
and groundlesse
profession of Almanack-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
and quacksalving Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques,
which casteth Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
and necessitates the
actions of men, (more then
God himselfe ever did:) this
studie is to bee avoyded of
Princes especially, because it
is impious, and will both
make them superstitious and
cowards. This deceived <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
who when heereby
(being both sicke in body and
minde, vexed vvith many
cares) hee thought to have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14747:71"/>
prevented death, hee drew
it upon him. And of this
Disease also laboured <hi>Lewis</hi>
the Eleventh, as you shall find
it recorded by <hi>Philip Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
To conclude in a word,
how farre we should wade in
this knowledge, I will make
<hi>Tullies</hi> wordes mine owne;

               </p>
               <p>After this first part of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
I perswade a Prince
to the other Practicall, which
is <hi>Politicall,</hi> or concerning
Pollicie, which to say truth,
ought to bee his onely studie:
For this Politicall part is most
imployed in directing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in their manner of living,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14747:72"/>
and all those things vvhich
concerne the good of the

<hi>Geographer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I presuppose every Prince
to bee by Nature apt to take
advice and wholesome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell:
And a Prince being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
and by Nature apt
and capable of understanding,
hee is to be first grounded in
the Rules and Instructions of
the best Politicians that have
written, whose Bookes teach
him without affection, feare,
or flattery. Excellent vvas
that saying of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King
of <hi>Arragon,</hi> That his dead
Counsellors (meaning books)
were to him better then his
living, who neither mooved
by feare, shame, favour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
or any other affection,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14747:72"/>
would tell him the truth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
and plainly. Hereupon
the best Authours in this kind
are to bee enquired for, and
read, after the Example of
the most able, and who ever
were famous either in peace
or warre. <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> gave

in the time of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
the Romane
Emperour, there
was invented Glasse of that
temper, that it would abide
the hammer, and bee beaten
in length or breadth like lead,
and pliable to bend every
way like paper; and that the
Inventor heereof was put to
death, upon this occasion:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14747:86"/>
When hee had built a most
magnificent Pallace in <hi>Rome,</hi>
which after the building be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fall, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> having paid
him for his worke, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to depart, and never
to look him in the face again.
Hee shortly after having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the way to make Glass
Malleable, or to abide the
Hammer, and came to shew
the same to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
a reward (as <hi>Dio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
for his Invention;<note place="margin">Dio. l. 57.</note> His
whole Shop, saith <hi>Plinie,</hi> was
pulled downe, and laid waste,
lest Brasse, Gold and Silver
should be undervalued in their
price and esteeme. Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
That <hi>Tiberius</hi> did it out
of malice and envie, because
hee naturally hated learned,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14747:87"/>
vertuous, and all ingenious
men.</p>
               <p>More at large, <hi>Petronius</hi>
reporteth this matter after
this manner, saying, There
was a skilfull Crafts-man,
who made Cups, and vessels
of Glasse, of that strength
and firmness, that they would
no more breake, then Pots
of Silver and Gold.</p>
               <p>Now when hee had made
a Viall of this most pure and
solid Glasse, and thought the
same a Gift vvorthy to be
given to <hi>Caesar,</hi> (meaning <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>)
hee was brought with
his present before <hi>Caesar,</hi> who
much commended the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the making, and the
skilfull hand of the Worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
his gift was taken, and
his good-will accepted of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:14747:87"/>
This Work-man, more to
amaze all the beholders by,
and that he might make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a farther way into the
Emperours favour, tooke the
Glasse-viall againe out of
the Emperours hand, and
threw it downe upon the
Pavement, with so great a
force, that had it been made
of Gold or Silver, it had
beene either bruized or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
<hi>Tiberius</hi> heereat, was
not onely astonied, but wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very fearfull. The Maker
tooke up his Glasse againe,
which was a little bruized,
but no where broken; as if,
saith <hi>Petronius,</hi> the substance
of Brasse had converted it
selfe to Glasse: then taking
a Hammer out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
he beat out the bruize,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14747:88"/>
and brought it againe into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
as a Tinker should beat
out a bruized Kettle.</p>
               <p>Which being done, hee
thought that hee had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Heaven, gaining at once,
<hi>Caesars</hi> familiaritie and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
but it fell out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
For <hi>Caesar</hi> demanded, if
any other knew the Art of
making that kind of Glasse,
but himselfe? Hee answered,
None that he knew. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Tiberius</hi> commanded,
That hee should be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for (quoth hee) if this
Art were publikely knowne,
Gold and Silver would be
no more esteemed of then
Clay.</p>

                  <hi>Coelius Rhodoginus</hi> reports

the vanitie of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who

our beds, or be abroad in
the fields, or journeying on
the way; they tell us the
houre of the day, though we
cannot see the clouded Sun.
Before these Water-glasses,
called <hi>Clepsidrae,</hi> were in use
and request. Moreover, <hi>Bells</hi>
call us to Divine Service;
they call for helpe, when
houses in Cities, and Townes
are on fire; or when there is
any mutinie or uproare; they
call the Magistrates of Cities

               <p>But indeed <hi>Paulinus,</hi> that

also Magicall Inchantments,

seen the ruines of an old Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the name whereof An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie

Not farre off, among
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14747:96"/>
many large Medowes, is ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a Marble stone: on this
stone a Peasant or Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

at whose right hand
standeth a leane blacke Oxe,

<hi>Paramatiae;</hi> about this Mare
stand a multitude of people,
and all the Husbandmen of
the Countrie.</p>
               <p>Then the Prince commeth
on forward from the other
part of the Medow, all his
Nobles in Purple accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
him; the Earle of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia</hi>
(who is Steward, and

carrieth the Banner and
Armes of the Country, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
before between twelve
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14747:97"/>
lesser Banners; the other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
follow after. In all
this companie, every one
goeth in an honourable and
respectfull fashion, saving the
Prince himselfe: who goeth
like a Clowne or a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and apparrelled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
for hee weareth an
old side-coat, a Plow-mans
cap, high shooes, and a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
hooke in his hand;
whom, as soone as the other
Country-man upon the stone
hath espied, he cals out aloud
unto him in the <hi>Slavonian</hi>
tongue, (for the <hi>Carinthians</hi>
are all of them <hi>Slavonians</hi>)
Who is this whom I espie
comming in that state, and
so proud a gate towards me?
The standers by answer, That
the Prince of the Country is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14747:97"/>
come. He upon the stone then
replies, What is hee? Is hee
an upright Judge? And seeks
the good and safety of the
Countrie? Is hee of a free
condition, and worthy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
Is he a professour and
maintainer of the Christian
Religion? and will hee be a
defender of the same? All
then answer together, He is,
and will be. I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
by what right hee can
dispossesse and stirre me from
my seate, this same stone?
The Earle of <hi>Goritia</hi> answers,
This place shall be bought of
you for threescore pence,
these Cattle shall be yours,
(shewing him the Oxe and
the Mare) besides, you shall
have also the Princes appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
which shortly hee will
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14747:98"/>
leave off, your house shall be
free, without paying Tribute.
Which words being pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
the Country-man upon
the stone, gives the Prince a
gentle box on the care, and
bids him be a good Judge;
then arising, and taking his
goodly beasts with him, he
yields his place to the Prince.</p>
               <p>The Prince getting up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stone, turnes himselfe
round about toward the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
with his Sword drawne,
which hee flourisheth every
way, and over his head, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
true Justice unto the
people. Then they bring
him fayre water to drinke out
of a Countrey-mans Cap,
meaning, that hee should put
downe the drinking, and use
of Wine. After this hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14747:98"/>
unto a Church dedicated
vnto the Blessed Virgine <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
which standeth upon a
little Mount not farre off,
where solemne Service being
finished, hee casteth off his
Countrey habit, putting on
a princely Robe, and having
feasted royally with his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
hee goeth againe into
the aforesayd Meadowe, and
there sitting in a Chaire of
State, hee administers Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

disposeth of houses and lands.
