         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Modest Plea.</head>
            <p>REport speaks me a Prisoner for my
last <hi>Pamphlet;</hi> and if I knew who
raised it, or would have it so, I would (in
earnest) thank them for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> as the greatest honour they can
do me, to bring my <hi>Innocence</hi> upon the
Stage, and make me suffer in a <hi>Cause,</hi>
which every honest man prefers before his
Being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> I should thank them for assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward the Discovery of the <hi>Kings
Enemies:</hi> which beyond doubt those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are, that will torment themselves for
a <hi>Reflection</hi> that concerns no other,â€”I
say again, there is an appearance of a
<hi>Confederacy;</hi> but I sixe nothing upon Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
whoever says, <hi>There he means mee,</hi>
is in the right, if <hi>he</hi> be one of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators;</hi>
otherwise not. They know
their own <hi>Affections</hi> best, and I my own
<hi>meaning;</hi> which yet I take to be so plainly
expressed, as that no Englishman can
make a Question of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105615:3"/>
This General Rumour has made me
call my <hi>Papers</hi> and my <hi>Thoughts</hi> to shrift,
and neither in the <hi>One,</hi> nor in the <hi>Other,</hi>
do I find any thing according to my
judgement of my Duty that suits not
with the strictest Obligation of it. So
let my Soul find Comfort, as I believe
<hi>the King is betrayed;</hi> and if I had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of His Majesties Ear, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
him with my particular reasons for
that opinion. My expectation was that
some of the Seditious <hi>Stationers,</hi> and
<hi>Lecturers,</hi> of whom I have complayn'd
should have been call'd to accompt; and
not to have been threatned my self, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
for complayning of them. If
there be any matter of exception, I offer
up my whole Life to the Scrutiny of the
whole World, and if from the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Quarrel to this Instant, they
prove me Guilty either of the least <hi>remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
toward the Kings <hi>Cause;</hi> any the least
<hi>complyance</hi> with his <hi>Enemies;</hi> or the least
colour of <hi>Irreverence</hi> toward his <hi>Person,</hi>
I am content to lose my Head for't. I
have now serv'd his Majesty in being, and
his blessed <hi>Father</hi> these One and Twenty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105615:3"/>
years, without either <hi>asking</hi> or <hi>receiving</hi>
any thingâ€”<hi>Let him that charges mee
make the same challenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis a wise <hi>Precept,</hi> That of <hi>Machiavell:
Encourage ACCUSATIONS</hi> and <hi>suppresse
CALUMNIES.</hi> I ask no more, but to
be either followed <hi>home,</hi> or <hi>Let alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to enquire into the Subject
of the Controversie; the <hi>Caveat</hi> it self,
which with great reason is by <hi>some Opposed,</hi>
and with as much by <hi>mee, Defended:</hi> for
<hi>Their DIANA</hi> lyes at Stake; <hi>My Repute;
Safety; Freedome;</hi> and which is more
then All; the Soul of every Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
(the <hi>King</hi> himself.)</p>
            <p>But to be Thristy of my Time and
Paper; where lyes the <hi>Exception?</hi> what
Law does it offend, either of <hi>Honour,
Conscience,</hi> or of the <hi>Nation?</hi> Does it
presume to taxe the <hi>King,</hi> or his <hi>Councill?</hi>
to kindle <hi>Iealousies</hi> betwixt united Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
or to enflame the Rest, into <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience</hi>
and <hi>Distemper?</hi> Does it excite
<hi>Revenge</hi> or <hi>Tumult?</hi> If it does any of
this, I'll bind my self to be his Slave, that
shews me <hi>where:</hi> That is; let it be Try'd by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105615:4"/>
               <hi>Indifferent Iudges,</hi> and taken in <hi>Coherence;</hi>
for to catch here and there a snap, is to
destroy my meaning: and at that rate, ye
may make <hi>Quidlibet, ex quolibet, Treason</hi>
of the <hi>Law,</hi> and pick <hi>Blasphemy</hi> out of
the <hi>Holy Bible.</hi> But <hi>Blam'd</hi> it is, and
<hi>why?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not for the <hi>Preface</hi> I hope; <hi>That</hi> only
advises <hi>Warynesse,</hi> and gives the <hi>Reasons</hi>
for it. There's not a day that passes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
seditious <hi>Lectures</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi> some
<hi>Openly,</hi> others more <hi>Covertly</hi> bidding the
People to prepare for a <hi>Persecution;</hi> and

               <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> MONTH <hi>may
bring forth.</hi> This did he repeat so <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
and with such an <hi>Accent</hi> upon
<hi>MONTH,</hi> that upon my Soul, I
thought it related rather to the Timing
of a <hi>Plot,</hi> then to the pressing of a <hi>Duty:</hi>
for the <hi>Emphasis</hi> was much stronger upon
the <hi>Time,</hi> then upon the <hi>Exhortation.</hi> (This
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105615:4"/>
was a little above a Fornight since, and
in my own Hearing) to which Add; that
the whole Crew are of the same Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>I hope there is no harm in This; and as
little in charging <hi>Tyton</hi> a Stationer, with
dispersing Treason since his Majesties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
for there's a Combination betwixt
the Presse and Pulpit to do mischief.</p>
            <p>Now to the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Book where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I shall omit nothing <hi>considerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Note that to the 17. Page, 'tis a
<hi>Reply</hi> upon I. H. his <hi>Cordiall.</hi> The first
<hi>Two</hi> Pages are only <hi>Prologue;</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi>
is Mr. <hi>Howells;</hi> the <hi>Fourth Mine,</hi> and there
I begin: Telling <hi>I. H.</hi> that as the <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
have liv'd true to their Prince, upon a
Rule of Honour, Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi>
so are they as well dispos'd to <hi>Dye</hi> for him
(if occasion require) <hi>without the Aid of
borrowed</hi> CORDIALS.â€”In the
<hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>Sixt</hi> Pages; I fault his using of
the word <hi>Reward;</hi> as not becoming a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
to his <hi>Prince:</hi> for whether we receive
any thing or <hi>nothing,</hi> our <hi>Duty</hi> is still the
<hi>same.</hi>â€”My Seventh Page only acquits
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105615:5"/>
the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> of <hi>causing</hi> the Kings wants,
or <hi>pressing</hi> them, and fairly checks I. H.
for being over-busy with that Argument.
â€”In the 8 &amp; 9. Pages, <hi>I. H. objects</hi> and
<hi>answers.</hi> I deny his <hi>Twenty Cavaliers,</hi> to
<hi>One</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> side, and (with due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to His Majesties Prerogative, to
bestow where and what he pleases) I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that divers unknown persons are
recommended to his Royal Favour, who
are very unworthy of itâ€”Page Tenth, I
blame the Authour of the <hi>Cordial for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
further into the Kings Actions then
becomes him.</hi>â€”Pag. 11. <hi>I. H. exhorts us to
Patience in expectation of a Reward:</hi> and I
tell him that we never serv'd for <hi>wages,</hi> but
it is our <hi>Duty</hi> to be <hi>Patient.</hi>â€”The
<hi>Twelfth <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>age</hi> carries the best Colour for a
Cavil, but first I'll recite it, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it, to a Syllable.</p>
            <p>We find the <hi>Court</hi> dangerously thronged with
<hi>Parasitesâ€”Knaves</hi> represented to the King for
<hi>Honest</hi> men,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> and <hi>Honest</hi> men for <hi>Villains:</hi>â€”
a watch upon his Majesties Ear, to keep out better
Information;â€”seditious Ministers protected,
and encouraged: <hi>Libells</hi> against the Authority,
and Person of the <hi>King,</hi> dispersed even by his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105615:5"/>
Majesties sworn <hi>Servants;</hi>â€”and to <hi>Discover</hi>
Treason, is of a consequence (in some respects)
more hazzardous, then to <hi>commit</hi> it.</p>
            <p>To this I explain my self; that divers
persons whom I know, of <hi>dangerous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
and <hi>scandalous Report,</hi> are crept
into <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Preferments.</hi> These are
the <hi>[Parasites]</hi> I mean, and when I am
commanded, I shall name them. That
many <hi>[Knaves have been represented for
Honest men]</hi> is evident in several whom
His Majesty hath repulsed, not to insist
upon some others admitted upon mistake.
<hi>[And Honest men for Villains,]</hi> I speak
upon my own experience.â€”</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[A Watch upon his Majesties Ear, &amp;c.]</hi>
That is; Such is the pressing boldnesse
of some people toward the King, that
'tis no easie matter without apparent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
for a poor Cavalier to interpose,
and tell those Truths which the Others
would have concealed.â€”Concerning
<hi>[Seditious Ministers, and Libells]</hi> The
Lectures are supplyed with the <hi>Former,</hi>
and the whole Nation rings of the <hi>Other.</hi>
Their businesse is to enflame the People
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105615:6"/>
against the <hi>Government,</hi> under the Mask
of <hi>Persecution,</hi> and <hi>Popery:</hi> They Pray
for the <hi>Kings Conversion</hi> rather then <hi>his
Establishment;â€”Bishops,</hi> they mention
not at all; unlesse to call them <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Drones;</hi>â€”and Lazy Lubbers.
And who are these <hi>Gospel Ministers,</hi> (as
they stile themselves) but for the greater
part, such as the Law has ejected, and
the whole Kingdome spewed out from
those Livings, which by <hi>violence,</hi> and
<hi>Treason,</hi> they had ravished from Honest
men? These are the men that cry the
<hi>Gospell's Persecuted;</hi> The <hi>Candle-Stick's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</hi>
They Cheat the <hi>Poor</hi> to Gorge
<hi>themselves,</hi> and pay their <hi>Tavern-Scores</hi> out
of the very <hi>Alms-Boxe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is the <hi>Press</hi> less active, or less
<hi>dangerous</hi> then the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> They have
their private Instruments and <hi>Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to disperse their Libels; and I dare
undertake, there may be found among
the Confederate Stationers in this Town,
above a Million of <hi>Seditious Pamphlets.</hi>
'Tis the best Trade they Drive, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
matter of Conscience, who can blame
them for't? Their <hi>Gains</hi> are <hi>great,</hi> their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105615:6"/>
               <hi>Hazzard little;</hi> beside the Pleasure of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing

            </p>
            <p>I was my self upon a search for the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi>
(a virulent Pamplet) which with the
<hi>Printer, Publisher,</hi> and <hi>Stationer</hi> I discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Master <hi>Secretary,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi>
who with great Honour and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sifted the matter, and proceeded in it.</p>
            <p>I found at the same time the first two
Sheets of <hi>The Year of Prodigies,</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture
of a most damnable Design. This
Book is lately Perfected, sought for,
and many Copies taken; yet let me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that <hi>Giles Calvert,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
have certainly a hand in't; and <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
Chapman,</hi> Probably, tho' they absent
themselves. (But to the Book it self.)</p>
            <p>The Author of it ransacks several sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
for <hi>memorable Accidents</hi> and <hi>Prodigies;</hi>
and for Remarques of such and such
Judgments that follow'd them. These
does he match with a most impudent
forgery of the like wonders <hi>here,</hi> to
strike the People, with a superstitious
expectation of the same events. Now
mark how probably the false Prophet
draws the <hi>Prediction,</hi> or the <hi>Portent</hi> to his

in the Delusion.</p>
            <p>To overthrow the Government by

this, by the influence of pretended signs

(in approbation of the Project) they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

            <p>Several of these stories are <hi>lyes</hi> upon
my knowledge; (so far as by particular

without persuing his further falshoods:

            <p>Having passd over my answer to the

to follow Mr. <hi>Howell</hi>'s wandrings, I shall
dispose the rest into a little better Order.

            <p>To sum up the main scope of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
It is by a Prudential <hi>Modesty,</hi> and

Which I have laboured; first by assigning

<hi>Then,</hi> by counselling a Fair, and humble

            <p>Where lyes the Crime of This, I am
to seek; especially proceeding with all

the <hi>Person, Office, Dignity,</hi> and the

It is not lawful for a <hi>Private Subject</hi> to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

            <p>Within these Limits I contain my self:

            <p>And yet some take Exception at this

            <p>Toward the bottome of the Page, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made of the <hi>Kings Proclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Prophane</hi> and <hi>dissolute persons;</hi> which
I advise may not be understood as any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105615:13"/>
sharpness from the <hi>King</hi> upon his <hi>Party,</hi>
but as a <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>prudential zeal,</hi> against
the <hi>vice</hi> of <hi>blasphemy</hi> and <hi>distemper.</hi> Yet
we know very well what art is used to
blast the <hi>Royal Party</hi> with that <hi>Character:</hi>
and that his Majesty can onely by <hi>report,</hi>
take notice of those <hi>liberties,</hi> which no
man is so shameless as to practise in his
<hi>Presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to that passage, which were
I given to <hi>Boast,</hi> should be my <hi>Glory;</hi> but
as 'tis toss'd upon the tongue of fame, tis
that, which I would rather be a <hi>Beast,</hi> then
be the <hi>Author</hi> of. In the Language of
<hi>mistake</hi> it sounds thus much, <hi>That I should
undertake to question the Kings Bounties,
and tax his Sacred Majesty with giving away
forty,â€”threescore thousand pounds in a
morning, while his friends starve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With respect to the first Promoter of this
<hi>Calumny,</hi> I shall be bold to blow it off;
and lay before you the <hi>ground</hi> of this
<hi>reproch,</hi> and thus it runs in <hi>Paraphrase</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are (say I) a sort a people,<note place="margin">p. 29.</note> that
stop the hungry Royalists mouths with
telling us <hi>'tis not time yet.</hi> 'Tis time
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105615:13"/>
enough for <hi>them</hi> to <hi>beg,</hi> though not for <hi>us,</hi>
even before the <hi>King himself</hi> is served,
which is a little preposterous. Again, I
say they <hi>beg,</hi> I do not say <hi>Obtainâ€”great
sums,â€”</hi> that is, the <hi>Equivalence,</hi>
which if the King should grant, 'tis (as I
say a little higher) <hi>but the unquestionable
Prerogative of his own freedom,</hi> so I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
not to restrain his <hi>Royal goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay yet again, it may fall out so that
the thing they beg, may prove worth five
times more then they pretend it is; then
is the Kings <hi>gift</hi> but a <hi>fift</hi> part of what
they <hi>get.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to finish, In this connexion of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
the question is not what the <hi>King
gives,</hi> nor what <hi>they get,</hi> nor is his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
accountable, for their importunities:
But do they deal fairly with us or no?
That's the point, Is it not time for <hi>us,</hi> as
well as <hi>them?</hi> Not that <hi>we murmur,</hi> but
<hi>they trifle</hi> us. When we want <hi>bread,</hi> we
will <hi>starve honourable,</hi> because the Publick
weale will have it so: yet still we shall
subject our selves to <hi>virtue,</hi> not to <hi>delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last 'tis said, we shall have something
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105615:14"/>
too, but have a care of that, for when
the Nation is drawn low, a heavy tax
upon the people would do the King more
hurt, then our relief is worth. Wherefore
though our <hi>necessities</hi> are <hi>great,</hi> yet still our
Loyalty ought to surmount our wants: Let
us not rob the <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>peoples</hi> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to fill our own bellies:<note place="margin">An honest Principle.</note> 
               <hi>Rather,</hi> (say I)
<hi>let us resolve to suffer any thing, for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
then cause him, to suffer in the least for
us.</hi> P. 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This foregoing Caution,</hi> (not to mistake
his <hi>MAJESTY, or in effect our</hi> selves, <hi>is
follow'd with an enquiry into the designs,
and workings of the</hi> Kings enemies, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the</hi> necessity <hi>of</hi> restitution, <hi>or else of</hi>
damnation, <hi>is offered to the judgment of
the</hi> learned; <hi>and</hi> I do now upon my honour,
engage my self to become Presbyterian, if in

            <p>The next and last Chapter treats how
necessary it is for a Prince, to <hi>oblige</hi> the
<hi>generality</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> and of the arts
the Faction uses to put his <hi>Majesty,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:105615:14"/>
and his <hi>Party</hi> upon <hi>necessities</hi> to do the
<hi>contrary;</hi> concluding with a saying of
<hi>Barclay</hi> in his <hi>Euphornio. [Voenalis homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

            </p>
            <p>â€”I was my self <hi>Sold</hi> by <hi>Thomas Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
of <hi>Linn Regis</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> a <hi>Renegado</hi>

of the <hi>Contractors</hi> for my <hi>Head</hi> (for virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
he was so) <hi>Doctor Mills,</hi> that sentenced
me to <hi>Death</hi> without a Hearing, is now
<hi>Chancellor</hi> to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Norwich.</hi> After
my condemnation, I threw a Paper among
them, and told them <hi>that</hi> was my <hi>defence;</hi>
since they would not <hi>hear</hi> it, they might
<hi>read</hi> it. One of the Committee takes the

more conducing to the King's <hi>safety,</hi> then
the discovery of those, of whom his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
stands most in <hi>danger?</hi> That is, first,
<hi>such as have actually betray'd his Majesties</hi>
Counsels <hi>and</hi> Designs.<note place="margin">pa. 46.</note>â€”Secondly,

               <hi>such as have received monyes, possibly for
the Kings relief, and never accounted for
them.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These people are upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
exceeding <hi>dangerous. First,</hi> they are
cast out of <hi>Protection,</hi> and in hourly fear
to be <hi>Detected,</hi> which makes them <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>
Next, they have farther <hi>opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of doing mischief. They appear
<hi>among</hi> us as <hi>friends,</hi> and act <hi>against</hi> us as
<hi>enemies.</hi> It is in short but <hi>this,</hi> the <hi>enemy</hi>
is in <hi>our</hi> Quarters, and has got the <hi>Wo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Let me look back now, or let any man
now answer me; where is that syllable,
to which an <hi>honest</hi> man may not set his
Name? <hi>Many</hi> there are, to which a <hi>wise</hi>
man would not, but want of <hi>skill</hi> may be
born with, where there's <hi>good meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>reverence</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Authority,</hi>

<hi>submission</hi> to all his <hi>Actions,</hi> be an
<hi>offence,</hi> then am I <hi>guilty.</hi> My fault is only
the putting those <hi>Points by</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would wound the <hi>King,</hi> (because,
perhaps they <hi>prick</hi> some of his <hi>Enemies,)</hi>
where is the man that presses <hi>Loyalty,</hi> that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105615:15"/>
streins the knot of <hi>Duty</hi> harder then I do?
And to conclude, where have I <hi>practis'd</hi>
other then I <hi>preach?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet truly, were the <hi>subject</hi> in it <hi>self</hi> not
altogether <hi>blameless,</hi> the <hi>occasion,</hi> and my
<hi>first fault</hi> might excuse me. I did not
lead the Dance, <hi>I. H.</hi> would needs be

it is an <hi>Errour,</hi> either of <hi>Imprudence</hi> or of

            <p>One passage more I remember,
that is, of very pretty insinuation.
Under the name of POLYAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER
is couch'd the <hi>Author</hi> of the
<hi>Dialogue:</hi> whom you must ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to be a man of <hi>Parts,</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</hi>
This <hi>Polyander</hi> gives his
<pb facs="tcp:105615:18"/>
opinion for a <hi>single Person</hi> against
all other forms of <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then he says that</hi> It is requisite, that
this single person, should be attended with
a standing, visible, veteran Army to be
<hi>paid</hi> well, <hi>and punish'd</hi> well, if there be cause
to <hi>AWE,</hi> as well as to <hi>Secure</hi> the People.</p>
            <p>To give <hi>I. H.</hi> his due, the <hi>other
Oliver</hi> could not have given his
<hi>Name-sake</hi> better counsel. The
Book indeed does mightily cry up
the <hi>Royal Prerogative,</hi> and 'tis a
little sharp upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the
thing commonly call'd the <hi>Long
Parliament:</hi> which yet at that
time done, does but proclaim the
Author of it, either a <hi>weak States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
or a <hi>worse Subject.</hi> For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their divisions, it was our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
still to uphold the <hi>weaker</hi>
side, and hinder the <hi>other</hi> from
<pb facs="tcp:105615:18"/>
setling. Neither can any thing be
more unseasonable, then to exalt
the <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> when
a Traitor wields the Scepter: It
does but serve to fix the Crown
upon the wrong Head, to magnifie
the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> when an <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper</hi>
manages the <hi>Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was an unlucky oversight in
Mr. <hi>Howell,</hi> to Christen this vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of his <hi>Cordial,</hi>â€”SOBER
INSPECTIONS. If he had call'd
it any thing else, (except <hi>S. P. Q.
V.)</hi> the Pamphlet might have liv'd
and dyed free from that envy
which commonly attends great
Wits and Undertakings. Not one
of forty, (I dare almost swear)
but would have been content with
the bare <hi>Title-page,</hi> and never have
turn'd the <hi>leaf:</hi> but first to fob

               <pb facs="tcp:105615:19"/>
like a <hi>whipp'd Posset,</hi> that is all

            <p>Now on the other side; I.H.
in his Epistle to the PROTEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOUR
calls this same NOBLE
ASSEMBLY a MONSTER; and
his HIGHNESS, HERCULES,
<hi>for Quelling of it.</hi> Yea, <hi>such a

Monster, that was like to Gourman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize

            <p>Who <hi>This</hi> I.H. was, or <hi>That</hi>
JAMES HOWELL belongs not

acutely; <hi>There are more</hi> I.H's.
<hi>then one;â€”</hi> and so say I, there
may be more <hi>Iames Howell's</hi> too.
But if the person now in question,
should prove to be a kin to the
<hi>Other,</hi> we may be very well excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
if we suspect his <hi>Cordiall,</hi>
and if we rather trust our own
<hi>Eyes,</hi> in our own Concern, then

            </p>
            <p>In that contest betwixt <hi>One</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

had baffled the <hi>Army,</hi> then <hi>Oliver</hi>
had been the <hi>Monster,</hi> but Fortune
<pb facs="tcp:105615:20"/>
would have it <hi>otherwise,</hi> and so
the <hi>Lot</hi> fell upon the NOBLE

never <hi>were,</hi> nor <hi>are,</hi> nor ever
<hi>can</hi> be of That Judgement; we
should do very ill to chuse an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
out of that number; or
to expect much good from a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
that could not help himself.</p>
            <p>But too much time is spent in
<hi>Preamble;</hi> for which, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
whom it concerns may thank
himself: I knew at first who wrote
the <hi>Cordial;</hi> but truly I had no
Ambition to measure Pens with
Mr. <hi>Howell;</hi> and my Remarks upon
the <hi>Mistake,</hi> did not so much as
glance upon the <hi>Author.</hi> No sooner
were the <hi>Inspections</hi> Publick, but
my Stationer comes to me by Mr.
<pb facs="tcp:105615:21"/>
               <hi>Howell</hi>'s Order, with a sleevelesse
Story, <hi>how ingenious a piece that
same Cordial was; how much His
Majesty was pleased with it:</hi> with
great Additions too, in favour of
the person that composed it. Some
part of This, in the second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of my <hi>Caveat,</hi> I barely
mentioned, and so left it.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Thursday</hi> or <hi>Friday</hi> last,
out comes another miserable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
done by the same hand, and
in justification of the Former;
which I must needs take notice of,
for divers Reasons, whereof (I
swear) the Author and the thing it
self are none.</p>
            <p>The Copy was pressed upon my
Stationer, (a very honest and a
Loyal person) as yet unfinished:
who gave me notice of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
but without any thought
<pb facs="tcp:105615:22"/>
of undertaking it. With much
ado, I prevailed with him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the good Gentleman, and
out comes Gravity it self under the
Form of SOBER INSPEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very Title speaks the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
no Physician; and he that
stands condemned to read the
Text, may swear he is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer.
He writes himself <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographer
Royal,</hi> and tells his
Tale to shew his Office: Yes, and
a dainty Tale it is.</p>
            <p>A Toledo Captain <hi>met</hi> Philip <hi>the</hi> Second
<hi>a hunting;</hi>
               <note place="margin">I.H.</note> 
               <hi>and taking him for a Private
person, told him</hi> he was going to Court,
to demand a Reward for his Services. <hi>The
King asked him,</hi> if he had not received his
Pay? <hi>He said,</hi> Yes: <hi>but</hi> 'twas long a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
However, he'd to the King for an
<hi>AyÃºda de costas,</hi> something to drink. <hi>Well
sayes the King; but</hi> in case his Majesty will
<pb facs="tcp:105615:22"/>
give you nothing? why then let him kisse my
Mules Tail, <hi>cryes the Captain. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,</hi>
the King ask'd him his Name, and
bids him bring his Certificat next day to the
Council, and hee'd procure him admittance.
<hi>The Captain appears,â€”</hi> Well Sir, <hi>saies
the King,</hi> What was't you said yesterday the
King should do to your Mule, if so and so?
<hi>(In our Authors own words)</hi> The Captain
being nothing at all danted, said; <hi>Truly
Sir, My Mule is ready at the Court-gate,
if there be occasion.</hi> The King for This,
Orders the Captain 400. Crowns present, and
2000 Ryals Annuity.</p>
            <p>The Condition of the <hi>English</hi> Cavaliers
is much more considerable; <hi>says our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian)</hi>
for the <hi>Spanish</hi> Captain had all his
<hi>Arriers</hi> paid him, which <hi>our</hi> Cavaliers have
not.] pag. 4.</p>
            <p>Most <hi>Logical</hi> and <hi>profound!</hi> for
as <hi>Tenterden-steeple</hi> was the cause
of <hi>Godwin Sands,</hi> even so Good
people Love one another.</p>
            <p>But can the great Defender of
our Cause, spy out no other Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb facs="tcp:105615:23"/>
betwixt the <hi>Captains</hi> case
and <hi>Ours,</hi> then matter of <hi>Pay?</hi>
That want of <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
though the King lik'd it
never so well, ought to have been
<hi>Reprov'd</hi> and <hi>Punish'd.</hi> Suppose
the <hi>bluntnesse</hi> of the man hit the
Kings Humour; Yet was it not the
lesse below his Dignity, even to
<hi>suffer</hi> so exemplary a Boldnesse,
but much more, to <hi>Reward</hi> it:
therein preferring his <hi>Fancy</hi> to
his <hi>Honour:</hi> Not but that <hi>Monarchs</hi>
are <hi>Men,</hi> as well as <hi>Subjects;</hi> and
may be allowed their <hi>Appetites,</hi>
and <hi>Likings;</hi> yet beyond question,
This was an Oversight in <hi>Philip</hi>
to lay himself so open; for
when the Court had once gotten
the length of his Foot; and that
they found there were more waies
then good, to Profit, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb facs="tcp:105615:23"/>
it would have been no
wonder to have seen That Prince
served, and attended by <hi>Tumblers,</hi>
and <hi>Buffons,</hi> in stead of <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentleman hath many
other pretty fragments of Story,
which being exceedingly beside
<hi>his</hi> Purpose, I reckon not much to
<hi>mine;</hi> wherefore let them rest:
But in good manners something
we will afford him in Requital;
which his INGREDIENTS, and
his COMPOSITION put me in
mind of.</p>
            <p>The late Lord <hi>Coring</hi> after a
dear ill-dressed Dinner at
<hi>Bruxells,</hi> sends for mine <hi>Host,</hi> and
treats him with this Complement:
<hi>Friend</hi> (says he) <hi>I do take Thee
for one of the best Cooks in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
'bate but two faults;</hi> The
<pb facs="tcp:105615:24"/>
               <hi>One</hi> is; <hi>Thou hast the worst</hi> Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<hi>in Nature;</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> is; <hi>Thou
putt'st them the worst together.</hi> This
is the Fortune of some <hi>Writers</hi>
too, as well as <hi>Cooks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching our Authors Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Twenty Cavaliers</hi> preferr'd
for <hi>One Roundhead;</hi> I have already
spoken what I thought fit and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
in my Caveat; but since it is
Mr. <hi>Howell</hi>'s pleasure to re-enforce
it, rather then presse the point too
far, we'l grant it: but then, <hi>Twenty</hi>
of Mr. <hi>Howell</hi>'s <hi>Cavaliers</hi> (recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himselfe for One) will not
make half so many of <hi>Mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his Sixt Page, he tells us,</hi> that divers
great Kings have been enforced to raise, and
reward those that were once their very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<hi>FOR A TIME.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105615:24"/>
And why FOR A TIME? (if
a body may ask) But this shall be
discoursed at Length and Leisure.
In short, he tells us what he told
us before, and winds up, <hi>Thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">I. H.</note> he who with a sober and
well-brass'd judgement will examine that
<hi>Cordial,</hi> will find that there is never a
Line, Word, or Syllable therein but
breathes out the spirit of a perfect Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
as above twenty other several <hi>pieces</hi>
of the same Author publish'd upon Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occasions do breathe besides, there is
no fretfull <hi>drug,</hi> or the least Corrosive
<hi>dram</hi> in it: but all gentle <hi>lenitifs,</hi> therefore
he wonders how it should stir up such
<hi>Malignant humors</hi> in any, unlesse it were
in them who having something lying
upon the <hi>stomach</hi> made wrong use of that
<hi>Cordial</hi> to cast it up.</p>
            <p>We will allow the Gentleman
to be a <hi>perfect Cavalier,</hi> a <hi>perfect
Republican,</hi> (if he pleases) a <hi>perfect
Protectorian,</hi> a <hi>perfect Any-thing;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105615:25"/>
rather then disagree about his
<hi>Perfection:</hi> but I would he had
not appealed to his <hi>Pieces.</hi> And
truly if he had spared the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
humours,</hi> and the Queasie
<hi>Stomach</hi> he talks of, it would have
been never the worse for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Cordial.</hi> But now he
finds himself so much deceiv'd in
his Operations, I hope he'l mend.
He sees his <hi>Cordials</hi> prove <hi>Vomits;</hi>
and let me forget my own Name,
as he has done his, if what Mr.
<hi>Howell</hi> gives to move <hi>Choler,</hi> does
not provoke excessive <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
