            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So that this <hi>Information</hi> of mine, ſeems to be altogether <hi>new,</hi> as relating to the Perſon of a <hi>publick Forreign Miniſter,</hi> who under the <hi>Covert,</hi> and <hi>Sacred protection</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rather acted as a <hi>Violator</hi> of that <hi>Law,</hi> than in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his <hi>publick Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The evil Practices of this <hi>publick Miniſter,</hi> I am now by <hi>publick Warrant</hi> to make known to the World for <hi>general Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> by the name of <hi>Franciſco Faria,</hi> particularly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Service of the ſaid <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> as ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in order, by which I came to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of what I here divulge for <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Undeniable Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Know then that I <hi>Franciſco de Faria</hi> was born at <hi>Fernam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buco</hi> in <hi>Brazile,</hi> a Province of <hi>Southern America,</hi> under the Diminion of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the Year 1653, from whence I was by my Parents brought into <hi>Holland,</hi> in the tender year of my Infancy, and continued there till the year 1662, at what time I came hither into <hi>England</hi> from hence having a deſire to ſee the World, I travelled through the moſt conſiderable Parts of it, and by that means attained to the Knowledge of ſeven or eight <hi>Languages,</hi> returning back from <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1678, I was preſently admitted into the Service of <hi>Don Gaſper de Abreu</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49362:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>de Freitas,</hi> then newly arrived at <hi>London,</hi> in the quality of <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> in ordinary from the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to be aſſiſtant to him as his <hi>Interpreter</hi> and <hi>Secretary of Languages,</hi> in regard he was a Perſon that underſtood no other <hi>Languages</hi> himſelf, than the <hi>Portugeſe, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Italian;</hi> In which Capacity, I continued with him, during his Excellencies Stay in <hi>England;</hi> for the Reader is to underſtand, that I had been known to the ſaid <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> formerly, that is to ſay, when I was firſt in <hi>England</hi> fifteen Years before, at what time his <hi>Excellency</hi> was alſo in <hi>England,</hi> but with the Title only of <hi>Envoy</hi> extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary from the ſaid Crown, and then was I a great Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Friend of <hi>Don Chriſtophoro,</hi> the Envoys Nephew, being a Youth of the ſame Age with my ſelf, and upon that Account familiarly and dayly frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaid Envoys Houſe. Whereupon, when the ſaid Envoy came again into <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who then reſided here, and was his old <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> went according to his Obligations to kiſs his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Hand.</p>
            <p>Then it was that the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> enquired of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his Son <hi>Franciſco,</hi> meaning my ſelf, to whom my Father made Anſwer, that I had been a great Travellour, that I was by that means become Maſter of ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, that I had been an Officer in the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Service, and was newly arrived in <hi>England,</hi> thereupon the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> was very importunate with my Father to ſend for me, as a perſon that he thought might be very uſeful to him.</p>
            <p>When I came, the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> tenderly embraced me as one that was heartily glad to ſee me, and preſently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me in the quality before mentioned, by which meanes it will be no wonder, that I ſhould have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being privy to thoſe things of which I here give publick Information, as being Occurrencies that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49362:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could not ſcape my Knowledge, becauſe of the confidence which the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> repoſed in me, and the neceſſity which he had to converſe and diſcourſe with thoſe that did not underſtand his Language. In this Condition I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with his <hi>Excellency</hi> all the time of his abode in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was a Year, or thereabouts. But before his Departure for <hi>Portugal,</hi> which was in <hi>February</hi> 1679 / 80, I was informed by his <hi>Excellency,</hi> from his own Lips, that there was a certain <hi>Juſtice of the Peace</hi> (whoſe Name I could never learn from him) who was a very great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> in the Country where he lived; for which reaſon, there was a <hi>Deſign</hi> laid, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his <hi>Death</hi> by <hi>Aſſaſſination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that, the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> went away, and I heard no more of the Buſineſs till the latter end of <hi>March</hi> or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>April:</hi> at what time, being out of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and preparing for new <hi>Travels,</hi> a certain Perſon came to me by the Name of <hi>Wyard,</hi> who took me into <hi>Greyes-Inn-Walks,</hi> and there telling me I had now a fair Opportunity in my Hands to make my ſelf and my Fortunes for eyer, made me ſeveral Propoſals for the cudgelling, which indeed imported no leſs than the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Nameleſs Gentleman; which notwithſtanding all his Perſwaſions, I abſolutely refuſed, as being an Action that I utterly deteſted and abhorr'd; however, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Thoughts, I communicated the ſaid <hi>Wyards</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to a particular Friend of mine, one <hi>Monſeiur Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some fourteen Dayes after it happened that one <hi>John Arnold Eſq;</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace in the Couuty of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> who was reported to have been very active againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> was really and <hi>ipſo facto Aſſaſſinated</hi> in <hi>Bell-yard</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi> Whereupon the next Day, while the Alarum was hot, my forementioned Friend <hi>Monſeir Camas</hi> came in grear haſt to me, and told me that I muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49362:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be one of the <hi>Bravos</hi> that had committed the Fact, and therefore adviſed me as a Friend, to take ſpeedy Benefit of his Majeſties <hi>Proclamation,</hi> both as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Pardon; but I being altogether innocent of the Crime, by ſeveral Proteſtations, and by giving him a faithful Account where I had ſpent my time all that Day and Night, ſo well cleared my ſelf to my <hi>Friend,</hi> that he remained fully ſatisfyed and convinced of my Sincerity. However, being then reſolved to go for <hi>Flanders</hi> to ſeek Employment, and fearing leſt if <hi>Monſeiur Camas</hi> ſhould make known the <hi>Information</hi> I had given him, in reference to <hi>Wyards</hi> Propoſitions, before I did it my ſelf, I ſhould not only be ſtopped in my Journey, but that worſe might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me, being ill provided for the <hi>Expences</hi> of a <hi>tedious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,</hi> I took the boldneſs to make my addreſſes to the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> as having formerly had the Honour to wait upon his Lordſhip with my <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> as Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter between them, and gave his Lordſhip a full Account under my Hand; dated the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1680, being <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> of all that had paſt between the ſaid <hi>Wyard, Mounſeiur Camas</hi> and my ſelf, this being done, I begun to think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of my <hi>Journey,</hi> but conſidering better with my ſelf, that it would be more convenient for me to ſtand to my own Juſtification, and upon the perſwaſion of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman to whom I had communicated the whole Affair, who told me, I might as well be knocked o'th Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea as here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what I had already declared to her, ſuſpecting that I might as well declare the ſame to others, as being a Reveng very common among the <hi>Partugueſes,</hi> I altered my Reſolutions and continued in <hi>England.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Tryal</hi> of <hi>Giles,</hi> who was after this apprehended for the Aſſaſſination aforeſaid, one Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Cox,</hi> my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Acquaintance, told me that he was going to hear the <hi>Tryal</hi> of one <hi>Giles,</hi> who had Aſſaſſinated a very good Friend of his, one Mr. <hi>John Arnold,</hi> a Country Juſtice; I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49362:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Anſwered him that I had a great Deſire to ſee <hi>Giles,</hi> for that I ſuppoſed, I could do the ſaid Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kindneſs, upon which Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> carried me to wait upon Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> to whom I gave an exact Deſcription of the ſaid <hi>Wyard,</hi> which after I had finiſhed, Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> told me that he had a very ſtrong Suſpicion of a Perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>areamly like to him whom I had ſo deſcribed, but his Name was not <hi>Wyard.</hi> Thereupon I went and viewed the ſaid <hi>Giles</hi> my ſelf, but did not remember I had ever ſeen him before, however, Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> deſired me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to ſome Juſtice of the Peace, and give him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in Writing upon Oath, what I knew concerning the ſaid <hi>Wyard.</hi> Whereupon I made the following Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before Sr. <hi>Phillip Matthews.</hi>

            <p>As to the Lady <hi>Abergavenny</hi> mentioned in my Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I have this to add further, that I do very well remember, that at the time when the five Jeſuits were to be hanged, drawn and quartered, the ſaid Lady came to the Portugal Ambaſſador, and made a moſt dreadful Complaint to his Excellency, to this Effect, how that we were all ruined, if the ſaid five Jeſuits ſhould ſuffer, for to be ſure that the next man that ſhould die would be Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> in regard the five Jeſuits were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned upon the ſame Fact, that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was guilty of, therefore I deſire your Lordſhip by all means to ſee if your Lordſhip can find any way to prevent the Death of thoſe <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which my Lord made anſwer to the ſaid Lady, that he could not Imagine or Find out any way to ſave their Lives, but that they muſt die, for ſaid he, we have uſed all our Endeavours, and made all the Intereſt vve can, and it vvill not be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Then the ſaid Lady made anſvver to my Lord, that then Sir. <hi>George Wakeman</hi> vvould have his Tryal, and vvould be condemned and ſuffer, and then all our Plot vvill be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>My Lord made anſwer in theſe vvords, No <hi>Madam,</hi> vve vvill ſeek to prevent his Death by ſome Friend that vve ſhall make.</p>
            <p>Upon vvhich my Lady <hi>Abergavenny</hi> took her leave of my Lord: I <hi>Franciſco de Faria</hi> vvas Interpreter betvveen them both.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have followed the Series of Relation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, as being Occurances that happend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended one upon another.</p>
            <p>I am now to repeat ſome paſſages which as they come to my Knowledge upon Various occaſions, and at Several
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49362:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
times, require not to be ſo punctually diſpoſed in order as being compleat within themſelves.</p>
            <p>In <hi>January</hi> or <hi>Febuary</hi> 1678 / 9. A Letter vvas ſent into <hi>Portugal</hi> by a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> belonging to the Queens Chappel at <hi>Somerſet Houſe,</hi> call'd by the name of <hi>Paulenio,</hi> to a Friend of his at <hi>Liſbon,</hi> the Letter Containd Words to this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>Our affaires are very well in <hi>London,</hi> vvhere I hope in a little time there vvill be a great alteration, and our buſineſs vvill be at an end in a ſhort time, ſo that I hope this place vvill all become <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentleman that recived the Letter in <hi>Liſbon,</hi> ſhewed it to a Friend of his that vvas an <hi>Engliſh Man,</hi> vvho by that time had intelligence of the Diſcovery of the Plot in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that Gentle-Man vvrites over immediately from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> to a Friend of his in <hi>London</hi> vvhat he had heard by a Letter from a <hi>Capuchin</hi> of <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> upon vvhich the ſaid Gentleman vvent to the King and Counſel, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvhat <hi>Newes</hi> his Friend had ſent him out of <hi>Portugal:</hi> preſently the King and Counſel cauſed the Queens <hi>Confeſſor</hi> to be called, and to be Examined, vvho at that time deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all, proteſted his Innocency, that he never vvrote any ſuch Letter, vvhereupon the King and Counſel diſcharged him, but that very Night there vvas private Intelligence given to the ſaid Father <hi>Paulenio</hi> upon vvhich he Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made his Eſcape for <hi>Flanders,</hi> vvhere he ſtaid till the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugaal</hi> Ambſſador arrived in the <hi>Downs</hi> in his paſſage home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards, vvhom he then met and Embarqued vvith him for <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the <hi>Ruby</hi> Frigat, under the Command of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Allum.</hi>

                        <p>That ſome time after the ſaid Trials, there was a report about the Court and City, that Articles were coming out againſt the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> upon which the ſaid Ambaſſador told this Informant, he would give fifty Guinneys to have a Copy of them before they were made publick.</p>
                        <p>That ſome time before the Ambaſſador acquainted this Informant, that he intended to ſend to <hi>Portugal</hi> for his

Lady, and that this Informant ſhould be her Gentleman Uſher, and alſo continue in his preſent Capacity of <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> and <hi>Interpreter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the ſaid Ambaſſador did in order thereto furniſh his Houſe, and one Day, being very intent upon Work Men, who were putting up ſome <hi>Tapeſtry Hangings,</hi> a very large Pacquet of Letters was brought his Excellency by Doctor <hi>Mendex,</hi> one of the Queens Majeſties Phyſitians, which he had no ſooner read, but he acquainted this Informant, that he muſt forthwith go for <hi>Portugal,</hi> to which this Informant anſwered, that he much wondred at it, and was not a little ſurpriſed to hear it eſpecially, in regard that his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being Ambaſſador in Ordinary, muſt then leave the Ambaſſadage Extraordinary behind him, a thing unuſual. But his Excellency anſwered this Informant, that he muſt go, and that immediately, and would leave Orders to ſell his Coach and Horſes, and other things after he was gone. This Informant ſtill preſſing the Reaſons of ſo ſudden a Departure, was by the ſaid Ambaſſador anſwered, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he thought he ſhould be called before the King and Counſel, upon the Lord <hi>Scroggs</hi> his account, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Francis,</hi> you muſt then go alſo, but I charge you not to ſay, that you went to the ſaid Lord <hi>Scroggs</hi> from me, that <hi>Fryday</hi> on which Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was Tried, but that you went on your own head, and that you went to him from me on the <hi>Saturday</hi> after only, for God above knows, what we do is for the <hi>Catholick Cauſe,</hi> and that God below (pointing to his Chappel, which was under his Chamber, in which we then were) will pardon us, and juſtify us in what we do. At which time there being a rumour that the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> was to go for <hi>Madrid,</hi> to complement that King upon his Marriage, and that he would Embarque for <hi>Liſbon,</hi> and go thence by Land to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Ambaſſador ſaid he would go with him.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49362:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But he then again further charged this Informant to ſay, if he ſhould happen to be examined before the Council, that the Ambaſſador ſent him, and went himſelf to the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> by a Miſtake, as looking on him to be a publick Miniſter of State. Whereupon this Informant having alwayes great Freedom of Diſcourſe with the ſaid Ambaſſador, asked his Lordſhip his reaſons, and why his Lordſhip did direct him to ſay in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner touching the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thereupon anſwered him in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Language with a Proverb of that Countrey, in theſe words, <hi>Chen es muy curioſo, novive muto,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is, <hi>He that is over curious never liveth long.</hi> Whereupon this Informant thought fit to forbear any further Queſtions in that Matter, promiſing to obey his Lordſhips Command about the ſaid Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs.</hi>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49362:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to have them killed; and this Informant hearing the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador uſe at ſeveral times this Sort of Diſcourſe, this Informant told him (as he uſed to be very free with the Ambaſſador) That his Ambaſſy in <hi>England</hi> was about the affair of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that he needed not trouble himſelf with any Body elſe, and that he ſhould let the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Subjects live in Peace, to which the ſaid Ambaſſador replyed, that for thoſe great Miſchiefs thoſe Raſcals had brought upon the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> they deſerved to be killed. And this Informant further ſayeth, that a Month or five Weeks before the ſaid Ambaſſador took leave of his Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittan,</hi> upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Portugal,</hi> the aforeſaid <hi>Franciſco de Faria</hi> brought to the Houſe of this Informant ſome Papers belonging to his ſaid Son, that this Informant might keep them for him, and amongſt the reſt there was one which the Informant ſaw written with the Hand of the ſaid <hi>Franciſco de Faria,</hi> wherein were ſeveral Memorandums written in the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> Tongue, with the Names of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Perſons as may be ſeen by the ſaid Paper, which the ſaid <hi>Franciſco de Faria</hi> took away afterwards out of the Houſe of the ſaid Informant.
