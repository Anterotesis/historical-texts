            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. How the Mighty Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> dealt with other Princes, and how they joined in a Confederacy against him.</head>
            <p>SOmetimes in the famous and rich Country of <hi>Luyslandia</hi> reigned a mighty Giant, by name <hi>Gallieno,</hi> by some called also <hi>Grandissimo,</hi> who for his great Prowess and War-like Exploits became Terrible to all his Neighbours: in so much, that no Man, tho' never so hardy, was able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with him in Feats of Arms, or by plain Force or Policy to Encounter Him. He had already Subdued the fair Countries of <hi>Lothoringia, Alsatia, Millesia,</hi> with part of <hi>Trapezond, Calatonia</hi> and <hi>Inferiana</hi>; and made Inroads into other Places; and was now grown so formidable as all Men stood in great dread of him. This <hi>Gallieno</hi> was moreover a great <hi>Necromancer,</hi> for he had at his devotion many <hi>Familiar Spirits,</hi> who gave him notice of the Strength, and all the <hi>Secret</hi> Designs of other Princes; So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be hid from him that he desired to know. He had also by the same wonderful Art got all his Cities and Castles inchanted, so that no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55462:3"/>
mortal Power was able to take them, and a damnable Spell set round about his Dominions, in so much, that scarce any Enemy could enter them; or, if he did, he could not stay there long, and wish'd afterwards he had never come there at all. After which, having, as he thought, made all things Safe and Sure, he surceased from War, and led his Life in Quiet and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; right-glad of the many Conquests he had made: But it fortuned, that as he slept one night in his Bed, he saw in his Dream many Armed men of several Nations come against him on all sides, threatning him with their Swords, Pikes and Guns, as if they meant to kill him: Whereupon awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and calling up <hi>Mephostophilo,</hi> one of his familiar Spirits, and asking him what it meant, he answered and said unto him, My dread Lord, <hi>This is no Dream, but the very Truth, which I have revealed unto you in your sleep</hi>: There are many Nations who, envying your Greatness, are now bandying against you in Council, to bereave you of what you have got by force of your Arms, and of your own Inheritance to boot. Which as soon as <hi>Gallieno</hi> heard, he sent for all his Under-Giants, and Great Officers, to Surprize their Towns before they could be in a readiness to oppose him, which they did accordingly, especially in <hi>Trapezond,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Regomania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the chief Princes and Potentates, who had joined into an Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation against <hi>Gallieno,</hi> were these, <hi>Austriaco</hi> the Great Emperour of <hi>Trape<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zond, Don Ibero Formalitoso</hi> the <hi>Proud,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bawwaw, Tricongio</hi>; with many other Potentates of <hi>Regomania</hi>; and lastly, the dreadful many headed Monster, called <hi>Hydra,</hi> whose property it was to spit out Flames of Fire in the midst of the Water; I do not mean that <hi>Hydra,</hi> which in times of Yore (as Historical Romances do inform us) was quell'd by the Famous Champion Sir <hi>Hercules</hi>; for this was a Water. <hi>Hydra</hi> of another kind, and living under the Sea, was for that reason of great repute in the Court of the Sea-God <hi>Neptune,</hi> who was a great Friend to it on all Occasions, except when it's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, or the blustering Affronts of God <hi>Eolus</hi> do put him into an ill humour. Now this Monster <hi>Hydra</hi> was mightily afraid of the Great Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> having heard by Tradition, that he was descended of the Race of the most Valiant Knight Sir <hi>Hercules</hi>; but especially since he had by his Necromancy got the trick of spitting Fire on the water, as well or better than it self; Wherefore, tho' this <hi>Hydra</hi> was half <hi>Panim,</hi> yet those Christian Princes were glad of its Assistance against the Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> as dreading his great Prowess, and standing in great fear of his Necromantick Policy: Besides the Monster <hi>Hydra</hi> was Powerfully abetted by one of the Idol-Goddesses they chiefly worshipped, called <hi>Mammoneta,</hi> to which they were particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, and often Sacrificed to her some of their Children and Relations, by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55462:3"/>
exposing them to the Throw in Storms (as their Heathenish Custom was) to the bottom of the Sea for her sake. And yet this many-headed Monster <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> was all this while (as being born and bred in the Sea) more Fish than Flesh: It had the Head and Face of a <hi>Man,</hi> the Beard of a <hi>Goat,</hi> the Neck of a <hi>Bull,</hi> and the Belly of a Hog, but was of the nature of a <hi>Herring,</hi> of which, for the most part it fed; It had also a slight Cross on the Forehead (tho' the mark of it was for the most part half worn out) but no sign at all of <hi>Christianity</hi> any where else. Yet for <hi>Neptune</hi>'s sake. and the assistance they hop'd from <hi>Mammoneta,</hi> even those Christian Princes were right-glad to have the Monster <hi>Hydra</hi> on their Side; and indeed it was no shallow Monster, but as Crafty and Politick as any of them all, and knew how to watch for its Advantage very Sedulously, especially when there was any Mony to be <hi>got</hi> or <hi>kept.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. II. How <hi>Nasonius,</hi> the Famous Knight of the <hi>Hydropick Land</hi> got into high Esteem there; and how he disgusted <hi>Fortuna</hi> in attempting to ravish the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Lady <hi>Victoria.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOW so it fortuned that in times of <hi>Yore,</hi> the <hi>Hydra</hi> Commonwealth had great Wars against their own King <hi>Don Ibero,</hi> against whom they had rebelled; and tho' they had very many Heads, yet, being more <hi>Fishermen</hi> than <hi>Souldiers,</hi> they had never a good one fit to lead an Army, or at least none so good as the noble Kt. <hi>Nasonius,</hi> who in all Justs and Tournaments had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himself right-valiantly, and won much Renown: For which reason those of his Family and their Descendents were, out of meer necessity, by the <hi>Hydropick Commonwealth</hi> chosen to be their <hi>Generals</hi> in War, which they call the <hi>Hydra-holder</hi>: by which means they came to that Power, that one of them attempted to Sear one of the Heads of the <hi>Hydra,</hi> and that was the greatest of them, call'd <hi>Emporiana,</hi> but living under water, it gush'd forth such Floods upon his approach, that it quench'd all his Irons. Now in the time of the War with the Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> it happened that <hi>Hydra</hi> had for its <hi>General</hi> a hardy Knight of the <hi>Nasonian Family,</hi> who was for a particular Reason very visible to be seen, <hi>Height Nasonious</hi>; who had behaved himself
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55462:4"/>
so craftily, that tho many of the Heads hated him for his high and proud Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, yet there was some others that Loved, and more that feared him, the which bred much difference between the Heads; yet all of them having but one Body, they never fell to open VVars with one another. This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Knt. <hi>Nasonius,</hi> being, as great VVarriors used to be, exceeding Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and much given to court fair Ladies, had a long time made Suit to <hi>Dame Fortuna,</hi> not regarding her want of Sight, (a great Blemish in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress) but hoping by her means to get great VVealth, Dignity, and high Preferment, after which he gap'd exceedingly; which gave some shrewd Lavish Tongues occasion to talk at random, seeing him (like the noble Knight Sir <hi>Hudibras</hi>) more to value the <hi>Advantages</hi> than the <hi>Woman.</hi> His Suit had this Effect, That she requited his good VVill with divers Favours, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to do him some friendly O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fices; but being of a Nature very fickle and unconstant, she would not consent to marry any Man, or to hold to him very long; but carelesly scattered her Kindnesses here and there, as if she regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not much to whom she gave them; Nay, it was very hard for any but a very wise Man to enjoy her Friendship any long time, and for that reason it was suspected, that she did secretly affect, if any, the Politick Giant, K. <hi>Gallieno.</hi> Now it happen'd that Dame <hi>Fortuna</hi> had a Relation of hers, call'd the <hi>Lady Victoria,</hi> a Stately and Majestick Dame, of the Noble Race of the <hi>Amazons</hi>: her <hi>Fortuna</hi> (being blind her self) thought might be a fit Match for the Kt. <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and that by this means she might requite his Love to her self; and therefore she broke her Mind to him on this manner: 

<q rend="margQuotes">Noble Knight, tho' I find in my self no inclination to marry any Man living, and experience my Humour to be such, that I shall never be constant to my Husband, and therefore desire you to Court me no more upon that score; Yet to make you some amends for your Kindness, I let you know that I have a Beautiful and Stately Kinswoman of mine, hight <hi>Victoria,</hi> descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the warlike-Race of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> and sought to by a great many Great Kings and Princes, whom, if you can by Gentle and wise Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and fair, and valiant Carriage win to affect you; I, for your Love to me, give my Consent; and when you have her, you may be sure to have me for your Friend.</q>

To whom the Noble Kt. <hi>Nasonius</hi> being indeed the very Pink of Courtesie, tho' his Nature and Education did not enable him to express it but with a very <hi>ill grace)</hi> with an Obeisance so low, that his Nose almost toucht the Ground, did with much Courtesie answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Excellent Lady, or rather Goddess! I esteem my Self much bound to you for this your Grace and Favour; I have heard much of the incompar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perfections of the most accomplish'd Lady <hi>Victoria</hi>: Indeed I have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55462:4"/>
never had the Luck to see her, though I sought after her much; which I impute to the <hi>Necromancy</hi> of the wicked Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi>: For when I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to wait upon her, and let her know how passionately I doated on her rare Perfections, as soon as I came near the Place where she used to be, he did by his <hi>Enchantments</hi> raise from <hi>Hell</hi> such a <hi>Smoak</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> that I could not come at her sight, and sent down such Showers of <hi>Hailstones,</hi> as big as <hi>Bullets,</hi> as no mortal Man might abide them; So that I was still forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to retire, and was divers times in danger of my Life, had I not <hi>ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>: To avoid which, if you please to bring her near my Tent in this time of Truce and Peace with him, I will be ready to receive her; For you know it is the Fashion of Knights never to Court any <hi>Amazonian</hi> Lady but in their Tents.</q>

Dame <hi>Fortuna</hi> lik'd well of what he said, and persuaded the fair Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> to come with her into the Field, not far from his Tents, and seeing him come to meet her, civilly withdrew her self. But <hi>Nasonius</hi> no sooner cast his Eye upon <hi>Victoria,</hi> and saw he had her now at an advantage, and in his Power; but he was so enamour'd of her, that, neglecting all Courtship, and decent Treaty, contrary to the Laws of <hi>Chivalry,</hi> and fair Carriage becoming a Knight, he most dishonourably set upon her by <hi>Surprize,</hi> and attempted to <hi>ravish</hi> her even in the open Field: Who, tho' being an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazonian</hi> Lady, she stoutly resisted him, and had she but foreseen such a Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and had been arm'd ready for him, she could easily have beaten him (for unfair Fighters are generally Cowards) yet having laid unworthy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon her, he kept her as his Prisoner, falsely pretending she was won by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Arms,</hi> and could his disobliging Persuasions have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, he would have kept her still as his <hi>Concubine.</hi> But she in great disdain refused it, and writ to her Aunt Dame <hi>Fortuna</hi> on this wise.</p>

            <p>WHen Dame <hi>Fortuna</hi> had perused this lamentable Letter of her Beloved Niece <hi>Victoria,</hi> she was so inrag'd that none came in her way but had some mischief or other happen'd to them: Some had their Necks broken, some were burned or drowned, some were hang'd, some died of sudden Diseases, others lost their Wits, and others their Estates by Casualties, &amp;c. At length rushing into <hi>Nasonius</hi>'s Tent, who was imperiously Proud, and puffed up with the imprisonment of <hi>Victoria,</hi> she thus accosted him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Base</hi> Varlet, <hi>and no</hi> Knight! <hi>How hast thou abused my kindness, in using</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria <hi>so dishonourably, and now triumphest that thy wickedness took Effect! Hear then what I say unto thee, and what my Sisters the Fates have decreed concerning thee. Though I cannot altogether recall my words by which I promised thee good luck in divers things; Yet this Curse shall go along with it,</hi> That thou shalt never have Success but in ill things, and by means of ill Men, which shall at last turn to thy greater infamy with all truly Noble and disinterested Persons, and bring thee in the End to the greatest Shame and utter Destruction. <hi>As for the renowned Giant</hi> Gallieno, <hi>to overcome whom thou bendest all thy small and borrowed Power, he shall perpetually prevail against thee, and thy</hi> dishonourable Associates: <hi>And either force you to truckle to his great Might, managed by the wisest Policy, and sue for Peace, or else utterly subdue you. And so fare thee ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With that she flung away out of his Tents, and left him in Melancholly Damps, and an unspeakable disturbance of Mind, which (as some Authors write) made him, as his Custom was, groan backwards, which left an ill savoured Scent behind it.</p>

            <p>AS soon as Dame <hi>Fortuna</hi>'s Passion was over, and that having vented her angry Freaks, and recover'd her Wits again, the want of which had caused many disasters to sundry Persons; she set her self to consider by what means she might be revenged on the <hi>Recreant</hi> Kt. <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and set her <hi>Niece</hi> at Liberty; and nothing seem'd to her more proper and effectual than to stir up the Mighty Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> to undertake the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi>'s Quarrel, and to redeem her from her thraldom; and therfore she caused a Letter to be writ to him after this manner.</p>

                  <p>THis is not the first time the ignoble wretch <hi>Nasonius</hi> has stain'd his Knightly Honour by foul Actions, tho' this is the foulest he ever did.

Besides that, by a just Title that Lady should once have been Spouse to my self. Doubt not then of my performing your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest both for her sake and my own; Only because you know how <hi>Nasonius</hi> is supported by the ignoble <hi>Hydra,</hi> and other Powerful Associates; therefore, after I have deliver'd her, you must give me time to take my full revenge of the <hi>Hydra</hi> and Him; For I must not wrong the regular Methods of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which I have very severely observed, by entring on any rash Action: As for your assistance, I do not desire you to strain your Nature for my sake, but as far as in you lies to stand by an indifferent Spectator. I know the Fates, to whose decrees you are subject, may sometimes make you look askew upon me, to teach me to acknowledge, and to submit to their Sovereignty. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I shall hope for this favour from them and you too, That I be never crost in my well laid designs, but in such circumstances that all the World may see, that 'tis not through want of Wisdom or Conduct, but by an over-ruling Providence, to which all Human Power and Prudence is subject; That highest point of Honour, I must confess, I do value my self upon, and would not willingly forfeit it, and while I preserve that Temper, I fear not any great opposition from your Self or the Fates either, who are still wont to be favourable to those who are wary and prudent.</p>

            <p>After King <hi>Gallieno</hi> had dispatch'd away this Letter to Dame <hi>Fortuna</hi> by his trusty Servant <hi>Mephostophilo,</hi> he call'd unto him one of his greatest and most valiant Under-Giants hight <hi>Grandorsio,</hi> and thus said unto him; Go <hi>Grandorsio,</hi> and according to the Orders I shall give thee, take <hi>revenge</hi> of the <hi>Recreant</hi> Knight <hi>Nasonius,</hi> who, (as thou remembrest well) attempted to ravish the excellent Lady <hi>Victoria</hi>; Beat him wherever thou dost find him. But, above all, be sure that thou dost rescue that Lady, and bring her hither to my Court, for which I do give thee my full Power and Commission; I shall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55462:6"/>
send my other Commanders against the rest of the Associates, but I make schoice of thee for this Exploit, knowing right-well how much both the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra, Don Ibero,</hi> and <hi>Nasonius</hi> himself do stand in dread of thy Prowess.</p>
            <p>Right-glad was the valiant Knt. <hi>Grandorsio</hi> of this Commission, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returning his most humble Thanks to K. <hi>Gallieno</hi> for honouring him with such a wish'd Command, and assuring him of his utmost devoir, he addressed himself to this Noble Expedition; and finding out <hi>Nasonius</hi> in the Head of the <hi>Hydropick</hi> Army, he set upon him with such Courage and Conduct, that he put him to the Rout, took his Tents, and by that means, got the Lady <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria</hi> into his Power, and set her free; who in recompence of that favour took a stately Belt, which according to the fashion of the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Ladies she daily wore, and girt it about him, saying thus unto him; <hi>Wear this, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned</hi> Grandorsio, <hi>for my sake, and be thou ever Victorious against this Monster of Men</hi> Nasonius, <hi>for know that there is that hidden Charm in this Belt, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has freed a distressed</hi> Lady, <hi>and shall wear it, shall be sure to prevail still against his Enemies in the</hi> Field.

So putting the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> into a Coach, lin'd with Crimson Velvet, inlay'd with Oriental Pearls, and most costly precious Stones, and hung round with Ensigns taken from the Enemy; he accompanied her to <hi>Tutelia,</hi> where the mighty Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> kept his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Court; whither she was very desirous to, both to render her Thanks to her Great Deliverer, as also to have the sight of the most Magnanimous, and most Magnificent King living.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. How this <hi>Amazonian</hi> Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> arrived at King <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Court, and after what a Noble manner she was courted by him.</head>
            <p>AS soon as the Heroick King <hi>Gallieno</hi> heard of the Delivery of the fair Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> and that she was coming to his Court, he was right-glad thereof, and went in great Pomp himself to meet her, and conduct her to his Stately Palace: At their first encounter, he alighted out of his Coach of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bony, and taking her by the Hand, led her into it: Twenty thousands of his Royal Guard gallantly attir'd, and arm'd at all points, were rank'd on both
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55462:7"/>
sides the Coach, and accompanied her to the Royal City <hi>Tutelia</hi>; into which, when he was about to enter, Command was given, that all the Bells should ring: The Streets were cover'd with rich Tapestry, bestrow'd with the most choice Flowers, the beauteous Daughters of the Spring, no less delightful to the Eye, than Odoriferous to the Smell: The Guns were discharged ten seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times; the Conduits ran with Wine: The Altars sent up the sweet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes of Incense to Heaven; and in a word, all the Solemnities were used, that might express a most affectionate Welcome.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> was entertained in a Majestick Palace, curiously adorn'd with the most costly Furniture in all <hi>Luyslandia,</hi> and accompanied by all the Princesses of the Blood, and Ladies of the Court: whose attire was so quaint and admirable, and their Demeanour so Charmingly civil, that the <hi>Noble Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi> surprized with wonder, thought her self happily translated from a kind of <hi>Hell</hi> of misery, to the Joys of <hi>Heaven</hi>: where K. <hi>Gallieno</hi> coming to visit her, would have seated her in a Chair of State next himself; but she modestly refused, and humbly requested she might first perform the Duty to which she was oblig'd both by Gratitude and Honour; and so falling on her Knees, she began this Oration. <hi>Invincible Monarch! How much is your Servant</hi> Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria <hi>oblig'd to you for your Goodness and Valour in freeing her from the slavish thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in which she was detain'd by the unworthy Knight</hi> Nasonius! <hi>For not to speak of his former rude Behaviour (which is shameful to remember) a Dungeon had been as welcome to any Noble Personage, as were their following Civilities to make amends for that basest of Injuries.</hi> I had no Company but that of <hi>ill-bred Boars,</hi> and which was worse of all, that of <hi>Nasonius</hi> himself, whose ill-humour'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, even, when he was in highest Mood, bred in me an unspeakable abhorrence. Not one action did I see; not one discourse did I hear amongst them to divert my Grief, that had the least <hi>resemblance</hi> of a <hi>Gentlewoman</hi>: Their Mirth was unsavoury Taunt, their Wit dulness it self, their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rustick, their Language harsh, and grating to a Ladies Ear; Their Carriage Brutish, and their very Eloquence <hi>Hoggish</hi>: Besides the hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of further rudeness from their <hi>Bear-like Natures.</hi> But oh! how quite contrary do I find every thing here! Wisdom polisht and mixt with Sweetness, Civility, Decency, grateful Conversation, noble Receiption, and highest Magnificence: Accept then, <hi>Glorious Monarch,</hi> the humblest Thanks of your ever indebted Servant <hi>Victoria,</hi> with her firm Vows never to forget such invaluable Obligations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55462:7"/>Having thus said, the Noble <hi>Gallieno</hi> rising up, took her kindly by the hand, and told her, That such actions were their own reward, and that whilst she staid there, she might command all, and use the same freedom in every thing, as if she had received no benefit from him at all: for that he sought not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> but <hi>Glory,</hi> and plac'd his greatest Glory in performing honourable and valiant Actions, especially to those noble Personages who were injured by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Men, and sought to him for Redress.</p>
            <p>The next day King <hi>Gallieno</hi> gave order for Knightly Exercises of <hi>Justs</hi> and <hi>Tournaments</hi> in which the war-like Lady took especial Content. At night <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera's</hi> were shewn, sung with most ravishing Musick, the subject of which were the <hi>Lawless Imprisonment,</hi> and the <hi>coarse Entertainment</hi> of the Lady <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> in her unjust Confinement in the <hi>Hydropick</hi> Camp, representing the rustickness of her <hi>Jaylours,</hi> and her <hi>Noble Sufference</hi>: And lastly, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance by the valiant Giant <hi>Grandorsio.</hi> To close all the Solemnity, Balls too were prepared: But the Heroick Lady, not much delighting therein, excused her self with much civility, as not being the Custom of her Country, or suitable to her Genius or Education.</p>
            <p>Some days after King <hi>Gallieno</hi> call'd together an assembly of all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Princesses, and Nobility of his Court, and invited thither also the fair <hi>Amazonian</hi> Lady <hi>Victoria</hi>; every one wondring what this august meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of so many great Personages should mean; when the King taking the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> by the right hand did in the hearing of them all deliver his Mind on this manner. 

<q rend="margQuotes">Incomparable Lady, I understand that your self, for your excellent Beauty, and Heroick Endowments, have been sought to by all the greatest Princes and Potentates in the World for their Spouse: wherefore my request is, that you would please, in the presence of this Great, and Honourable Assembly, to declare your Mind freely, which of them you think most worthy to be your Husband: in doing which, I desire you to set aside entirely that small Title, that some may judge I have to your Affection, since I wholly quit all the obligations it may be conceived you owe me, leaving you fully to your own Choice, nor would I yet have your self, or any others, deem that this frank proposal of mine springs from any indifferency towards your Person, or signifies any sleightness of Affection to so excellent a Lady, fit to be a VVife to the greatest Monarch in the VVorld; but because I esteem it honourable not to restrain you in the least while you are in my hands, much less to force you unlawfully as did the Recreant Knight <hi>Nasonius</hi>: For I should have courted you for my self, but that I fear'd my applications might have been lookt upon by you, or interpreted by others as a kind of over-awing you from following your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55462:8"/>
own inclinations: In which Point of Honour I am so tenderly sensible, that it would damp all my felicity in enjoying you, should I apprehend, that my procuring that Deliverance, or any involuntary Tye upon you, had the least share in a determination, which ought to be the most free and unforc'd of any Action in the VVorld. Please then to speak your Mind freely, as if you had the sole Command over me and all my Actions and Dominions: Assuring you of my faithful Promise, that (how highly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I wish it may be my Lot to be your choice) whoever renders himself worthy of you, I will with all disinterested freedom render you back to be his Spouse.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> after some short Pause, with a lowly Bow, full of Respect and gracious Demeanour, replied in this wise. 

<q rend="margQuotes">Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Monarch! This Modesty of yours where you may command is the highest Complement, and most Eloquent Courtship, that is possible to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. VVhom can I better chuse than my Noble Deliverer, to whom I owe my Safety, my Liberty, and my self; I resign my self therefore wholly into your hands, and submit my self intirely to your disposal, as your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and loyal Spouse. Hoping that your unparalell'd VVorth, most civil Courtship, and highest Merit, will screen the Blushes of my Modesty, and keep the World from censuring me as too easily won: Nay further, I must confess I had been yours long since, had I not been surpriz'd by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous incivilities of the <hi>unmanly</hi> Knight <hi>Nasonius,</hi> you having just Title to me by your high Wisdom and Conduct, with which you manage your Affairs both at home and in the field: Only I beg this Boon of you, That when ever you go to the Campaign, I may still be with you, and wait upon you: For I know that my presence join'd with his unworthy Guilt, will so terrify <hi>Nason.</hi> that he will not dare to approach where I am; but he shall saunter up and down year after year, with an Army at his heels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing worthy a Captain, which will expose him to ridicule, and lose him that little Credit he has got among the <hi>Boorish,</hi> Heads of the <hi>Hydra.</hi> Indeed, I should have ask'd the leave of <hi>Fortuna,</hi> upon whom I have some kind of dependance, before I had made this final Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but I have partly her Good-will already; and shou'd she be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of humour (to which she is now and then obnoxious) and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle frown upon us for a while, I know your wisdom is such as can reclaim her, and recover her Friendship.</q>

Which said, she immediately gave him her <hi>fair Hand,</hi> in Token of her <hi>faithful Heart,</hi> which he graciously took, and seal'd the Contract with a kind Salute, which done, K. <hi>Gallieno</hi> added these words.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Herald</hi> having receiv'd his Commission sets forward on his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: And first he went to the Court of the great <hi>Austriaco,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Regomania</hi>; and when he came to deliver his Message, he found him play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lesson upon the <hi>Lute</hi>; and he was so attentive to his <hi>Musick,</hi> that tho' the <hi>Herald</hi> repeated his Embassy twice or thrice over, he hardly heard him; and when with much ado he rightly understood him, he told him he was a <hi>troublesome</hi> fellow to disturb his <hi>Recreation,</hi> and, That as for the Lady <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> she was such a ticklish Mistress, and had so often deceiv'd his Expectation and scorn'd his Courtship when he fought against the <hi>Half-Moon</hi> of the great Emperor <hi>Magog</hi>; and on divers other occasions had so taken his Master's part, that he did not think it worth his intermitting his Musical Recreation, nor his wearying himself with so long a Journey, much less to meddle with <hi>fighting</hi> for her; in which kind of harsh and untuneable Musick he had no Skill. And so without any kind of respect due to such publick Messages he bid him be gone, and that neither his Master nor he shou'd trouble him any more with such Impertinencies.</p>
            <p>Next he went to the great King, <hi>Don Ibero Formalitoso,</hi> and requested one of his Court-Officers to acquaint his Majesty, that there was an <hi>Herald</hi> come from the mighty Giant <hi>King Gallieno,</hi> who demanded Audience, but the strutting Courtier drawling out every Syllable with a most formal Gravity, answer'd him, that his Illustrious Majesty was playing at <hi>Shuttle-cock,</hi> with some Court Ladies, and was yet in <hi>Querpo,</hi> and that it was against the highest Punctilio's of Honour to disturb so great a King in his Pastimes, especially being <hi>de Scompuesto.</hi> After many tedious delays, he obtain'd Audience, but not till <hi>Don Formalitoso</hi> was accoutred in his Royal Habiliments, and seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Solemnity in his Chair of State with all the Lords of his Court attending him. To whom when the <hi>Herald</hi> had declared his Message, and deliver'd his Letters; <hi>Don Ibero Formalitoso</hi> with his hands on his sides, and a

Mien overlooking all the Company, proudly answered, That it was very easie for him with a puff of his Breath to blow King <hi>Gallieno</hi> out of <hi>Tutelia</hi>; but that it did not become the High Majesty of the great King of <hi>Iberia</hi> to gad out of his Country upon any account whatever.

            <p>From thence he went to the noble Duke of <hi>Bawwawia,</hi> whom he found in Company of the rest of the <hi>Associates,</hi> as <hi>Tricongio,</hi> &amp;c. Who were all assembled together to consult how they might quell the mighty Giant <hi>Gallieno.</hi> But they were so high in their Cups, and so distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with <hi>Drinking,</hi> that he did not think it seasonable to deliver such an honourable Embassy to Men whose reason was totally drown'd in Wine. Wherefore he staid two or three days longer, hoping by that time he might take them in some <hi>Lucid Interval,</hi> but he still found them in the same pickle: So that a Friend of his advis'd him, That if he would needs stay till they are all <hi>perfectly</hi> Sober, it was his best course to hire a House, to save the charges in an Inn. Yet he obtain'd of his Friend to acquaint them in the Case they were in, on what Message he came. When one of them, who scarce half understood it, taking it to be some high Compliment sent them by the Persons mention'd; to shew he was a generous Foe, and a Man of <hi>Honour</hi>; after two or three <hi>Yawns,</hi> having a well-fill'd Glass in his Hand, began a <hi>Health</hi> to King <hi>Gallieno,</hi>, and his <hi>Fair Lady</hi>; which they all took down very glibly: But not a Man of them remembred what they had done or said, the next Morning. At last he heard that they were all to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble again the Morrow after at Nine; at which time he hop'd it would be a proper season to deliver his Embassy. But they no sooner me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but they leapt on their Horses (with great troops hallooing and hooting after them) to hunt the wild Boar for nine or ten days. So that the <hi>Herald,</hi> fearing that the time allow'd him for his return would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps'd; and knowing, that to Lovers, Delays are tedious, would not stay to wait their coming back, but thought sit to haste homewards, taking the <hi>Hydra</hi> in his way. Where, when he arriv'd, he found some of the <hi>Heads</hi> counting their <hi>Money</hi>; others adjusting their <hi>Book-Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>; some chaffering for <hi>Merchandize</hi>; others ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55462:10"/>
were of <hi>divers</hi> Sentiments. Many cry'd out, Let King <hi>Gallieno</hi> keep <hi>Victoria,</hi> if he will, what is that to us? This Fighting does but spoil our <hi>Trade,</hi> and our <hi>Markets.</hi> But the generality of the <hi>greatest Heads</hi> said, they were busie, and his Errand foolish; For he mistook them, They were not <hi>Land-Rats</hi> but <hi>Water-Rats</hi>: But if King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> who has such a rare Talent at cutting Rivers through the dry-land, wou'd but be at the Charge and Pains, to make the Sea Navigable as far as <hi>Tutelia,</hi> he shou'd then see what they would do; but, that sure, he could not think them such Fools as to run <hi>Knight-Erranting</hi> to free <hi>Fair Ladies:</hi> not they: Let such light Ware sink or swim, or hang, it is all one to them: <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> is all they care for; and that if they could be sure to lose nothing by King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> or to gain any thing by him, they were his humble Servants.</p>
            <p>He had also a particular Audience of <hi>Nasonius</hi>; who, when he had heard the Message, and read the Letters, answered surlily, That <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> might have kept her self well with him whilst she was well, and not to have run to the <hi>Luyslandian</hi> Court to learn to <hi>cut Capers</hi>: And for his part, he was not in an humour to run as far as <hi>Tutelia</hi> to fetch back such a <hi>Baggage.</hi> And lastly, That since he could not keep her while he had her, he had set up his Resolution, never hereafter to venture him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in any Battle to catch her again; but would continue his Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>stand still,</hi> and <hi>look on,</hi> and let them fight who were so fool-hardy.</p>
            <p>The well bred <hi>Herald</hi> wondred at his Incivility, and much more at this strange resolution of a Knight who profest himself a <hi>Warriour,</hi> and a <hi>General.</hi> So parting thence, he posted to the Court of <hi>Tutelia</hi>; and gave an account very particularly of his sleeveless Embassy, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Answers,</hi> or <hi>No Answers</hi> of the several <hi>Associates:</hi> which made the two Royal Lovers smile, and gave the whole Court plentiful occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of divertisement, to see what valiant, gentile, pretty-humour'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies he had to deal with. And now all rubs being smooth'd, Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was made for solemnizing the Marriage the Week after; which was celebrated with all the Gallantry imaginable. The Particulars of which were so extraordinary, that it would over-task the best Wit in the World to express them to the Life, in their due order as they were perform'd. Only I cannot omit the <hi>Epithalamium</hi> made by <hi>Philopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> and sung by a Consort of most harmonious Voices, which was this,</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. How <hi>Nasonius</hi> treated with the Great <hi>Lucifero</hi> about driving his Father <hi>Eugenius</hi> out of his three Kingdoms and get them to himself. And how all the Furies of Hell, were let loose, and sent into <hi>Utopia,</hi> to stir up the Subjects to Rebellion.</head>
            <p>MAny days together lasted these Nuptial Solemnities, and never was there seen such Universal rejoicing and Feasting through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Luyslandia,</hi> as was at that Season. But it pass'd far otherwise in the <hi>Hydropick</hi> Country, and least of all with the discomfited Knight <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonius.</hi> He had suffered the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> to be taken from him by plain force: He had utterly lost his Honour as well by getting her unlawfully, as by not being able to keep her. He saw that King <hi>Gallieno</hi> was like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach daily upon the <hi>Hydropick</hi> Territories, and that little help was to be expected from <hi>Don Ibero,</hi> whose best Politicks were meer folly, his Souldiers half starv'd for want of Meat and Cloaths, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d their Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations nothing but empty Braggs, and haughty Bluster. He knew well much assistance might come to him from the War like Dukes, <hi>Bawwaw, Tricongio,</hi> and other Potentates of <hi>Regomania,</hi> had he but Money to hire and pay their Souldiers. But where was that to be had? Himself had lost his own Patrimony in <hi>Luyslandia</hi>; and was but a pitiful poor Knight himself, or, as some Authors write, but a kind of better sort of <hi>Burgher,</hi> living mostly upon his Pay as a Souldier, allow'd him by the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>; and so could spare nothing out of his own Purse. He had an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Father-in-Law, whose Daughter he had Married hight <hi>Eugenius</hi> King of <hi>Vtopia, Carduana,</hi> and <hi>Lyramia</hi>; a <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>mild</hi> Prince, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whose Kingdoms he had a long time gap'd, and had by the assistance of the Idol <hi>Mammoneta,</hi> by his private Emissaries sown much discontent, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>issatisfaction towards him amongst his Subjects, and dispos'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them to <hi>Rebellion</hi>: To which <hi>many</hi> of them, especially those of the <hi>Panym Party</hi> were prone enough of themselves, seeing how much their <hi>immedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te</hi> Predecessors had thriven by driving that <hi>Devillish Trade.</hi> The only difficulty that stuck with him was how he might go about it with Security that he should not miscarry in the attempt, in regard that King <hi>Eugenius</hi> was of his own nature <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>Merciful,</hi> and never bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55462:11"/>
his Subjects with Taxes, for which reason he had a very great Party Faithful and Loyal to him. Wherefore <hi>Nasonius,</hi> to get rid of this Perplexity, call'd his best Friend, <hi>Sodomicus</hi> to him; and asked hm by what means, (good or bad) he might be certified aforehand, of the success of his undertaking; not doubting but that if it took effect he could do well enough; for then he could either by dissimulation gull the credulous People of <hi>Vtopia,</hi> who were of such an unwary and silly Humour, that they would easily believe all that was told them that sounded maliciously, and even lov'd to be deluded: Or else he could by Authority crush, or put to death all that durst oppose, or approach to him. He told him too, that he had already consulted the Star-Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard <hi>Sydrophell,</hi> but that he answer'd, he could see no <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of Astrology that cou'd give him any certainty of it; and to tell you true, added <hi>Nasonius,</hi> I had as live hear him tell me of <hi>Pigs,</hi> and <hi>Sows,</hi> and their <hi>Sties,</hi> as talk to me of <hi>Bulls,</hi> and <hi>Bears,</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> and their <hi>Caelestial Houses.</hi> Now to acquaint you, whom I dare trust with my true Thoughts, I had rather apply my self to the <hi>Black Art,</hi> as the surer way, but that I fear it may be against the Rules of Piety.</p>
            <p>At this <hi>Sodomicus</hi> cou'd hold no longer. <hi>Piety</hi>! said he, Are you yet such a <hi>Puny,</hi> such a <hi>Novice</hi> in Politicks, as to stand upon the weak sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of that sneaking Vertue, <hi>Piety</hi>?

Do we not see how the good-natur'd Puppies the <hi>Vtopians</hi> do whine after us, and court our Friendship. Or does any Monarch in the World for that reason refuse to treat with our Ambassadors? I tell you, <hi>POWER</hi> is all in all: Get but <hi>Power,</hi> and let the demure Gentlewoman <hi>Piety</hi> go hang her self.

At these Words, <hi>Nasonius</hi> embracing him affectionately, cried out in a kind tone. <hi>Sodomicus</hi>! Better half of my self! Thou hast spoken my very Thoughts, and prevented my declaring that which I would have said, but (pardon my diffidence) durst not openly and abruptly discover. Hereafter therefore assist me with thy Advice, in the pursuit of that glorious
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55462:12"/>
End, and thou shalt see that I will in all things follow thy Counsel. There are, said <hi>Sodomicus</hi> in the Hellish Country of <hi>Laplandia,</hi> certain old Haggs, who have infinite familiarity with the Infernal Spirits, and have often sold Winds to our Country-Men for old Rags, and mouldy Crusts: Over these Beldams there is one of incomparable Skill, hight <hi>Crampogna,</hi> her I would have your <hi>Highness</hi> send for immediately; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her profound Advice, and know of her the Event of your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Nasonius</hi> heard this, without further pause, he presently dispatch'd a Vessel with a Messenger, and such Presents as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd would be most acceptable unto her, requesting her attendance on him. The <hi>Witch</hi> answer'd, I will be there before thee. And so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado, embarking her self in an <hi>Egg-Shell,</hi> or as some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors say, in a <hi>Rotten-Orange-Peel,</hi> or as others say, getting a stride up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Broom-staff,</hi> she arriv'd in the <hi>Hydropick</hi> Land in the space of two Hours, and signified to <hi>Nasonius</hi> in his Dream, That he shou'd meet her the next Evening in a Fog, near the side of a stinking Fen, well known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. As soon as he came to the place, he saw the grisly Hag with <hi>Hollow Eyes, Dishelveld Hair, Lank Cheeks,</hi> and <hi>Shrivell'd Chaps,</hi> who <hi>chatter'd</hi> out this <hi>Rhime.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Thou art too great,</l>
               <l>With me to Treat;</l>
               <l>Send for my Lord <hi>Lucifero,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And all things well with thee will go.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <hi>Nasonius,</hi> though he was couragious enough in bad things, yet at first was something stumbl'd at this sudden Proposal; but being over-shooes in Impiety already, he resolv'd to wade through: And bade the Witch send for him, or call him up. Whereupon, turning her self nine times round one way, and as often back again, and repeating a long ribble-row of Prayers backwards; at length, in a kind of Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Amazement she yell'd out,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Brimstone I smell,</l>
               <l>The Breath of Hell;</l>
               <l>He comes, he flies,</l>
               <l>Through Earth, through Skies.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Draw near, draw near,</l>
               <l>Appear, appear,</l>
               <l>Not with a Look that may affright,</l>
               <l>But with a Shape that may delight.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Upon which words appear'd <hi>Lucifero</hi> with Horns on his Head, and a cloven Foot, but in all other appearances, a most accomplish'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55462:12"/>
The first word he spake, he bid <hi>Nasonius</hi> not to fear, for he was his Friend, and knew well his Design; which was to drive his pious Father out of his three Kingdoms, and get them for himself. Know then, continued he, that it was <hi>I</hi> that <hi>inspired</hi> thee with this Thought, and I will <hi>carry</hi> thee <hi>through:</hi> only thou must wed spiritually, or take to Wife I mean <hi>Concubine,</hi> (for we hate all Marriages) my eldest Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ambitiosa Superba</hi>; That is, thou must give thy whole Heart to her, hold to her constantly, and follow all her <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Inspirations,</hi> which done, she with her <hi>Maids of Honour</hi> will easily bring that design of thine to Perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nasonius</hi> thank'd him for the high Favour in dignifying him with the <hi>Honourable Title</hi> of his <hi>Son</hi>; professing that he had ever lov'd and <hi>ador'd</hi> that <hi>Goddess,</hi> though (hindred by some <hi>foolish Christian Principles,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd by Education, or taken up upon the Paroll of <hi>Preachers</hi>; which from hence-forward he <hi>utterly abjurd)</hi> he had not till now made his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate applications to her great Father, and espous'd her: Humbly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by his good leave a sight of that <hi>high-spirited Princess.</hi> With that, <hi>Lucifero</hi> gave a dreadful stamp with his <hi>Cloven-Foot,</hi> which made the Earth tremble, and crack asunder, when out of the Breach issued forth an <hi>horrible Cloud</hi> of <hi>Blewish Smoak</hi> which <hi>darkned</hi> all the <hi>Sky,</hi> and that once dissipated, there appear'd the stately Lady <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> with a train of Black-Brow'd <hi>Furies,</hi> or <hi>Fiends</hi> attending her: Her self was clad in a gorgeous Robe, with many great Crowns dangling about it, spurning many lesser ones, and trampling them under her Feet. Her lofty Head seem'd to reach the very Skies, and her grasping Hand seem'd to pull down Heaven it self. But, after a while descending from her height, approaching <hi>Nasonius,</hi> she took him kindly by the hand, with these words: Here take me, and with me the Glory thou affectest, and the <hi>three Crowns</hi> thou so much desirest. Acknowledge the great Honour I do thee, and see thou observest me in all things, and so shalt thou be sure to be great as far as thy <hi>Cursed Fates</hi> will permit thee. See here my Train, my Maids of Honour, who will assist in accomplishing thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and going before thee into <hi>Vtopia,</hi> so prepare the Minds of those sottish People, who are far the better half at my Father's Devotion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that thou shalt have little to do but to gather the Fruit, and reap the rich Harvest which they shall prepare for thee.</p>
            <p>Then calling 'em forth one after another first stept out the proud Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Rebelliosa,</hi> of so way-ward, and ungovernable a Humour, that she would scarce obey even great <hi>Lucifero</hi> himself, but that she knew he would only command her such things as were most agreeable to her own
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55462:13"/>
Inclination. To whom <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> said, What wilt thou do for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted Servant <hi>Nasonius</hi> to obtain him his <hi>Father's</hi> three Kingdoms? I will, answer'd <hi>Rebelliosa</hi> with a lofty tone, fill the <hi>Hearts, Heads and Tongues</hi> of the <hi>Vtopians.</hi> with <hi>Murmurs</hi> and <hi>Discontents</hi> against their kind and lawful King <hi>Eugenius,</hi> so that they shall be ready to rebel, and drive him out, when ever they shall get an Opportunity to do it with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Fear not thy success, great part of that Nation are my <hi>sworn Slaves</hi> already. 'Twas I who <hi>inspir'd</hi> them to make <hi>War</hi> against his Father <hi>Eusebius.</hi> 'Twas to me they <hi>Sacrificed</hi> a <hi>Hundred Thousand</hi> of that <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Sect</hi> call'd <hi>Loyallists,</hi> for which I rewarded them afterwards with Riches and Preferments. Lastly, 'Twas I, that, to crown my trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Exploits, inspir'd them to <hi>cut off his Head</hi>; and the same Fate, if it suit with thy Policy, shall betide his Son.</p>
            <p>This said, <hi>Rebelliosa</hi> retir'd and there came forward next a monstrous deform'd Hag, whose ill-contriv'd Shape much resembled that of a <hi>Chymera,</hi> as the Poets describe it: Her Eyes squinted contrary ways; Her Feet interfer'd with one another, and all her Parts hung loose, as if they were inartificially tied on with Points, without any Natural Contexture or Coherence. Of whom, when <hi>Nasonius</hi> had demanded her Name; my Name, said she, with a confident look and tone is <hi>Alethia,</hi> I am Truth it self, and cannot lye. But <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> interrupting her, and turning to <hi>Nasonius,</hi> said, Believe her not, my Friend, her Name is <hi>Fictitiosa,</hi> she is the <hi>Spirit of Lying,</hi> and her Nature such, that she cannot say true, but only when she is to answer my dread Father <hi>Lucifero,</hi> or my self. Then turning her self to the Fiend <hi>Fictitiosa,</hi> she demanded of her what she would do to get her truest Gallant <hi>Nasonius</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's three Kingdoms? I will said she, spread thousands of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Lyes against <hi>Eugenius,</hi> his <hi>Queen,</hi> and their <hi>Son</hi> all over <hi>Vtopia,</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect his Subjects, and make them hate him; I will inspire the <hi>Pamphlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, News-Writers, Lampooners,</hi> and others of the <hi>State-Scribblers</hi> with the <hi>Genius</hi> of forging 'till almost all the Land be possest with the <hi>Spirit of Falshood and Lying</hi> Nay, the <hi>Pulpits</hi> out of which they preach the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their God, and the <hi>Preachers</hi> themselves shall be deeply tainted with my venemous Infection.</p>
            <p>After her came out a third Fury, which look'd like a Fool, or meer Ninny, in a long mothly Coat, with a Niaisy Countenance, a gaping Mouth, her Head hanging down, and a great Bibb on her Breast to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her Slaver, staggering and stammering still as she walk'd and spoke. And what, said <hi>Nasonius,</hi> Can this silly thing do in my behalf? As much replied <hi>Ambitiosa,</hi> as any of the rest. She is the <hi>Spirit of Folly,</hi> and her name
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55462:13"/>
               <hi>Fatuitosa Credula,</hi> let her self speak, and tell thee what she will perform; I will, said <hi>Fatuitosa,</hi> so besot and infatuate the People of <hi>Vtopia,</hi> that they shall give full Credit to all <hi>Fictitiosa</hi>'s Lyes, tho' never so monstrous and incredible; by which means I will make them <hi>Abdicate</hi> their <hi>Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary King,</hi> tho' were they not absolutely my Creatures, they might easily see that it would breed endless Distractions. I will stir them up to make War against the Powerful and Politick Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> tho' to their vast Charge, and the <hi>utter destroying</hi> their <hi>Traffick and Comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, I will so totally and perfectly dose their Reason, and common Sense, that they shall magnify and adore thee <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonius</hi> all the while thou doest impoverish, abuse, and ruine them, and (which I esteem my chief Master piece) they shall thank thee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with thee, not for any real Benefits they have receiv'd from thee, but meerly because thou hast <hi>beggar'd and ruin'd them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At these last words <hi>Nasonius</hi> took the Jest to fully, and relish'd it so feelingly, that, (tho' it were a thing unusual with him) he could not refrain from shewing his high Contentment with a pleasant Smile. Till, as he was going to return an high complement to <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> for such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table assistant, by telling her, That the very <hi>Folly</hi> of <hi>Lucifero</hi>'s Courtiers out-witted, and over-reached the highest <hi>Wisdom</hi> of Mortals; there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a fourth Fury with a surly Countenance, that came in stamping and staring, cursing the <hi>Earth</hi> for bearing her, the <hi>Air</hi> for giving her Health, and the <hi>Sun</hi> for lending her Light. <hi>Nasonius</hi> all amaz'd at such an uncouth kind of <hi>Fiend</hi> intreated of <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> the Knowledge of her Name and Nature. Her Name, replied <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> is <hi>Diabolica,</hi> and she is the Spirit of <hi>Ingratitude.</hi> She had that particular Name given her as an high Reward for her great Merit; for she was the forwardest to oppose that cursed Angel <hi>Michael,</hi> when he endeavoured to debauch our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Angels, from joining with us in Rebellion, by alledging the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (forsooth) we owe to God, as being our Creatour, and who gave us our Being, and all the Good we had; and who is in greater Esteem with my Father <hi>Lucifero</hi> than she? <hi>Nasonius</hi> being a Gentleman well-bred, and full of Courtesie, thought it was his Duty, and would be grateful to Lucifero, to pass upon such an high Personage, and so great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of his a special Complement. Whereupon approaching to her with a low Bow, and kissing his Hand, he was about a very formal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his Respects to her; But she, with her Fist gave him such a sound
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55462:14"/>
Cuff on the Ear, that (being but <hi>limber Hamm'd</hi>) his <hi>Proboseis</hi> well nigh toucht the Ground; so that he had much ado to recover himself. To take off his trouble and fear, <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> told him, it was <hi>Diabolica</hi>'s Nature to render <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Good</hi>; and that had he not followed her inspiration for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in being <hi>ungrateful</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> who had done him so many <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> she had certainly done him some great Mischief for his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: But she bid him rest contented with that Fury's candid dealing: For had she <hi>saluted</hi> or <hi>kiss'd</hi> him, she would most certainly have <hi>kill'd</hi> him.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Nasonius</hi> had certainly well recover'd himself, and come to his Senses and Wits again, <hi>Diabolica</hi> thus accosted him; Fond Mortal! who could so think, that I, who am <hi>Ingratitude</hi> it self could be won or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blidg'd by any Courtesies. Thou might'st have known by thy self, who art one of my greatest Devotes, that Civilities and Kindnesses are not the way to oblige me, and had not thy great Merits in being ungrateful to thy <hi>obliging Father</hi> represt my fury, this had been thy last day, and all thy ambitious Projects had vanish'd to Smoak: But for following my Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations I have both spar'd thee, and will reward thee. Perhaps thou think'st that my Sisters have left nothing for me to do for thee; but thou art much mistaken. Thy Father <hi>Eugenius</hi> has hugely obliged many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages of the <hi>highest Rank,</hi> and the <hi>chief Officers</hi> in the <hi>Army,</hi> nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>whole Army</hi> it self, by being so <hi>good</hi> a <hi>Master</hi> to them; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less these be taken off, and rendred ungrateful, they will give thee such disturbance as will quite ruin all thy Undertakings; but I will take such order, that they shall all of them either <hi>desert</hi> or <hi>oppose</hi> him; for I will infuse such a <hi>subtil Poyson</hi> into the wretched Souls of those <hi>most oblig'd</hi> to him, that most of them, nay, his <hi>own Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as his <hi>own ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Children,</hi> shall be the <hi>first Traytors</hi> to him, and his <hi>bitterest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nasonius,</hi> upon hearing this comfortable News, taking fresh Heart, blam'd himself for being so foolishly unmindful of her <hi>Genius,</hi> and humbly ask'd of her, (for he was deadly afraid of the t' other Cuff) if it wou'd not disoblige her, to return her his humble Thanks. If thou wilt oblige me replied <hi>Diabolica,</hi> be sure thou never repentest thy <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> to thy <hi>Father</hi> or others, but continuest it unto the end. But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, be sure thou dost not shew the least Gratitude to the <hi>Vtopians,</hi> though hey foolishly serve thee against their own Interest: But both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige those who have first and most assisted hee, and do all thou canst to requite the Kindnesses of that <hi>Sottish Nation</hi> with their <hi>utter ruin.</hi> Huff their <hi>Nobility</hi> as occasion presents, and <hi>imprison</hi> them <hi>Lawlessly; Pay not</hi>

their <hi>Souldiers,</hi> nor any who are so foolish as to trust thee with their <hi>Goods, Stores,</hi> or other <hi>Commodities.</hi> Regard not the <hi>Seamen</hi> though most useful to thee, nor pay 'em their Wages: Only give the <hi>Fops</hi> good Words, and some little Pittance to keep up their <hi>Folly</hi> to trust and serve thee further. Give the <hi>Royal Assent</hi> to no <hi>National Bills,</hi> that may in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wise serve to support or secure their pretended <hi>Rights, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi>; nor to any others that do not strengthen thy <hi>Power,</hi> enable thee to crush their <hi>Persons,</hi> and drain their <hi>Pockets.</hi> Thou must also use thy utmost endeavour to procure an Act to <hi>Endenise</hi> all the <hi>Rascally Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse</hi> of thy Noble Allies, especially our beloved <hi>Hydropicks</hi> and vagrant <hi>Luyslandian Panyms,</hi> by which means they will <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> out of the foolish, and tame <hi>Vtopians Mouths; Rob</hi> their <hi>Cloaths</hi> from their <hi>Backs,</hi> and reduce <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>Posterity</hi> to utmost <hi>Beggary</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi> They have made themselves thy <hi>Slaves,</hi> use them accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nasonius</hi> was about to assure her of his doing his utmost to follow this Advice, when there steps forward another <hi>Fury</hi> in a Rich Gown of Cloth of Silver, richly Embroider'd with massy Gold, studded all over with Faces and Stamps of divers sorts and figures; who said, I am the great Goddess <hi>Mammoneta,</hi> chief Idol of the accursed Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> What I will do for thee thou shalt know when thou comest to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the Heads of the <hi>Hydra,</hi> whom I will require to serve thee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for their own Interest. At this, <hi>Lucifero</hi> put in; see, said he, that thou Sacrificest the Wealth of <hi>Vtopia</hi> to my best beloved <hi>Hydra,</hi> and in all things seekest her Advantage. For know that none are so dear to our Deity ever since they in the <hi>Indies</hi> formally <hi>renounc'd</hi> and <hi>Crucify'd</hi> God, and chose to adore my Slave <hi>Mammoneta</hi> in his stead for their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess: which binds me to requite their highly <hi>Meritorious Apostacy</hi> with temporal Wealth.</p>
            <p>When he had thus said, there came forward two He Fiends, of which one was a bold, brisk <hi>Blade,</hi> clad in a <hi>long Gown,</hi> with a <hi>short purple Cloak</hi> over it, and a <hi>Square Cap</hi> like a <hi>Judge,</hi> and seem'd to be a <hi>Devil</hi> of great <hi>Authority.</hi> The other in a <hi>black short Vest,</hi> between a <hi>Cassock</hi> and a <hi>Jump,</hi> a little formal <hi>narrow Band,</hi> and a <hi>Black Velvet Cap,</hi> with another of <hi>white</hi> underneath turn'd up over the <hi>Edges</hi> of the other, with a <hi>Lace,</hi> who walkt gravely and demurely with his Eyes lift up to Heaven, as if he were in some divine Contemplation, and in the height of Prayer; with a <hi>little Bible</hi> in his Hand, making shew by his gestures and actions as if his Prayer ended, he were about to <hi>hold forth.</hi> These are, said <hi>Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> two of my chief, and most useful Servants, by name <hi>Injurioso,</hi> and <hi>Hypocritico</hi>; the former my <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the latter my <hi>Chaplain</hi>: who, at

the inspiration of <hi>Mammoneta</hi> (which Idol, being of the same Religion with the <hi>Hydra</hi> the adore) will, to give thee Title, wrest both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> and make both the <hi>Bar</hi> and the <hi>Pulpit</hi> be at thy Devotion. Speak both of you in your Turns, continued he, and declare what you will do for my best beloved Son <hi>Nasonius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will I do? says <hi>Injurioso</hi>; Why I will inspire the <hi>Judges</hi> and the <hi>Lawyers</hi> with such <hi>Quirks</hi> and <hi>Quillets,</hi> that they shall <hi>Torture</hi> and <hi>writh</hi> the Laws of the Land with their Face backwards, till they come to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thee their rightful Monarch: I will teach them how to make out <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Abdication in despight of all those Antiquated Rules of Common Sense and Reason, which foolish Mortals follow'd hitherto: By which means they shall satisfy those who are unskilful; or else they shall <hi>punish imprison,</hi> and <hi>adjudge</hi> to <hi>Death</hi> those overwise Fools who dare declare themselves for <hi>Eugenius,</hi> or Speak, Write, Print, or Publish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in his Favour.</p>
            <p>And I, said <hi>Hypocritico,</hi> with a grave and goodly look and tone, do <hi>Prosess verily</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> that I will inspire all those <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> who do bear a servent Devotion to the Goddess <hi>Mammone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These Goblins disappearing, <hi>Lucifero</hi> turning himself to <hi>Nasonius,</hi> said these words, Thou seest my dear Son, how by the Care of <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osa,</hi> and her Maids of Honour and my willy Servants, <hi>Jujurioso,</hi> and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

  <q rend="margQuotes"> My entiire Friend!

  <q>I have already dispos'd 'em to thy Mind and they shall be ready to assist thee.

                  <hi>High and Mighty Lords</hi>! 'Tis not unknown unto you how the mighty Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> encroaches daily upon us and our <hi>Associates</hi> in Arms, and how necessary it is to strengthen our selves against him; and I am sure no way is so effectual to do this, as to get the whole Power and Riches of <hi>Vtopia, Carduana,</hi> and <hi>Lyrania</hi> to joyn in our Assistance. This, if we can compass, the <hi>Giant</hi> will be reduced to the stature of a <hi>Dwarf</hi>; and (as our Ingenious Emblem long ago foretold) <hi>Our Holland Cheese will darken and Ecclipse the lustre of his rising Sun.</hi> You know how averse my Father <hi>Eugenius</hi> is to joyn with the <hi>Associates,</hi> being resolv'd by preserving a Neutrality, and keeping his Country in Peace to advance the Trade and Riches of his Kingdoms, which with his giving Freedom from Persecution to tender Consciences, will bring the Traffick to them, and half ruin us.

  his <hi>Chief Commanders,</hi> to give him such advice as should dis-affect his Subjects in <hi>Vtopia,</hi> and dispose 'em to <hi>Rebellion.</hi> But for all that, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things go on but slowly, I have, to tell you true, (which is not to go further than this Assembly) crav'd aid of our Common Lord and Master <hi>Lucifero</hi> who has sent his Furies and wicked Spirits into <hi>Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> to invite them to Rebellion, and so infatuate them that we may do what we list wish them; and instead of their spoiling our Markets, we may make our Markets of them. And now the Deed is brought to perfection, so that there needs no more but my Presence to accomplish that glorious and profitable Work. Now because I cannot go thither with an Army (as is requisite) without your Mony, Ships and Souldiers, my request is, that you would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish me with such a Competency of all these as may suffice to gain that incomparable advantage to our common Cause, assuring, that as things are, and will be ordered, we shall find no opposition.

way, they could quickly check his towring 'Thought by chopping up a Peace with the mighty Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> and leave the Associates in the Lurch; as by the Advice of <hi>Mammoneta,</hi> they had done formerly.</p>
            <p>Sending therefore for <hi>Nasonius,</hi> They told him, that he could not fail by their assistance of getting vast Riches in <hi>Vtopia</hi>; and therefore, it was but Reason they should share with him in his opulent Aquisitions; and that otherwise their Goddess <hi>Mammoneta,</hi> whose Dictates their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion oblig'd them to obey in all things, had advis'd them not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in the Matter.

            <head>CHAP. IX. How the <hi>Panym</hi> Knight <hi>Refugio</hi> was sent into <hi>Lyrania</hi> against King <hi>Eugenius.</hi> And how <hi>Nasonius</hi> himself went thither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and what succeeded.</head>
            <p>NOW the Country of <hi>Lyrania</hi> did, for the most part remain sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast to their Allegiance to King <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and the Noble Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Tarcon</hi> had raised him fifty thousand Souldiers, but undisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd, and ill arm'd: Wherefore by the Friendly assistance of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> King <hi>Eugenius</hi> though fit to send over thither, and try his Fortune there, though that Country was far too weak to resist the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Vtopia,</hi> not having Conveniences and Necessaries to maintain a War comparable to what was found in <hi>Vtopia.</hi> He kept his Royal Court at <hi>Lyrapolis,</hi> and was now about to assault <hi>Walkerburga,</hi> whither the greatest part of the Rebels, who were almost all <hi>Panyms,</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken themselves. Now, this place he could easily have taken, but the Besieged being obstinate, he was loath to assault it, well knowing that the <hi>Lyranians,</hi> who used to spare none in their just Anger, were so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged against them, that they would certainly have put them all to the Sword; which he (whose Piety towards his misled People often much hindred his Policy) had too much Compassion to permit; hoping that overtures of Mercy, and their own Famine, and other hardships would in time reclaim them, and bring 'em to their Duty; and they were many of them starv'd, and the rest about to yield, when they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by Sea with all Necessaries, which <hi>Eugenius</hi> being destitute of Ships, could by no means hinder.</p>
            <p>After this, the <hi>Panym</hi> Knight <hi>Refugio,</hi> than whom few were more in savour with <hi>Nasonius,</hi> was sent over to <hi>Lyrania</hi> with an Army of Seven and Twenty Thousand Souldiers to make Head against King <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>; to whom the <hi>Vtopian Hydra</hi> (for Money was yet plentiful there) gave a noble, but very foolish Gratuity of an Hundred Thousand Pounds: Thus encourag'd, he went forward on his Expedition; And when he Landed, he encamp'd at <hi>Lutosia,</hi> where he staid so long in <hi>Dirt</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:55462:21"/>
and <hi>Mire,</hi> not daring to Fight with King <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that far the better half of his Souldiers <hi>breath'd</hi> out their Souls <hi>backwards</hi>: But they all embrac'd their Death as the greatest Honour that could befall them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was <hi>Regis ad Exemplum.</hi> Our Seamen at the same time had as great Calamity befell them as the other, tho not so <hi>slovenly:</hi> For, a strange <hi>Giddiness</hi> seiz'd their Heads on a sudden, which made them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirious, and fall down as if they had been Epileptick; and three days after they dy'd of this Malady, and a third part of them perish'd. This Disease being so <hi>sudden,</hi> so <hi>Mortal,</hi> and so strangely <hi>unusual,</hi> and indeed scarce ever heard of before, <hi>Lucifero</hi> fear'd it would be look'd on as a Judgment from Heaven, and therefore took Care that <hi>Fictitiosa</hi> should give it out, and <hi>Fatuitosa</hi> make it believ'd, that their Meat was poyson'd by Treachery: But though all the Industry imaginable was us'd to discover the Poysoner, and find out the Poyson, yet not one grain of it could be found, and though such a vast quantity as could taint so much Meat was inconceivable, for all the three Nations could not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish half so much, much less could any Art apply it so undiscernably, yet still, (so had <hi>Lucifero,</hi> and his <hi>Furies</hi> handled the matter) that it pass'd for current Sense in <hi>Vtopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Disaster had happened to the Knight <hi>Refugio, Nasonius</hi> himself pass'd over into <hi>Lyrania,</hi> with a right puissant Army, and march'd towards <hi>Eugenius.</hi> But whilst he lay near a River called <hi>Vnda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which he was to pass the next day, going to Bed, not without some Sollicitous and frightful Fancies in his Head; he dream'd a Dream which (though no Authors write of, yet may be probably conjectured to have wrought a <hi>Coronation Effect</hi> with him. He dream'd that while (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the charge <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> had given him) he unadvisedly came too near the Enemy, a Bullet of <hi>Six Pound weight</hi> granted upon his <hi>Shoulder.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which awakening in a <hi>Fright,</hi> and great Anxiety, cryed out, <hi>Treason, Treason. Sodomicus,</hi> who lay in the next Room to him, rush'd in sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and asked what the matter was. Oh! said he, I have had such a fearful Dream, that I'm afraid it portends some ill luck to Morrow: For methought, a <hi>Six pound</hi> weight Bullet hit me on my <hi>Shoulder,</hi> took away part of my <hi>Cloaths</hi> and <hi>Shirt,</hi> raz'd the <hi>Skin,</hi> and that had it gone but a little deeper, it had put an end to all my Glory, with my Life. Take Courage, said <hi>Sodomicus,</hi> for I dream'd that <hi>Ambitiosa</hi> had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you in your Sleep, to assure you, that she had taken Care to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some of <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Army to <hi>Treachery,</hi> and some to <hi>Cowardise,</hi> and promised you that to Morrow you should win the Day. Neither think I that your Dream is to no purpose; doubtless it was inspired
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55462:21"/>
to hint to us what Politick use we may make of it. I will take orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to make it pass for a <hi>reallity,</hi> and cause the Relation of it to be writ and sent into <hi>Vtopia,</hi> and to make it believ'd there in good earnest: Then what sport shall we have to hear how the <hi>whining Puppies</hi> will bemoan their <hi>good King,</hi> who undergoes such <hi>Hazards,</hi> and suffers so much for his <hi>beloved People.</hi> This will have a twofold good effect; one is, that you will be look'd upon as a Person, over whom Providence, (as it shews by this miraculous escape) has a peculiar Care, which will gain you u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Credit with the bigotted Generallity, The other is, that kind Pity will so soften the <hi>Hearts</hi> of those silly Whelps (whose <hi>Heads</hi> are soft enough already,) that they shall give you what Money you shall ask, and contentedly <hi>beggar themselves</hi> to <hi>enrich us.</hi> And as for carrying it well with the People here, 'tis but conjuring your <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> to say as we say, for some Gratuity: And <hi>tearing,</hi> and <hi>beblooding</hi> your <hi>Shirt</hi> in that part to delude the <hi>Landress,</hi> and all will pass current; or put case that any do distrust it, yet who dares contradict it, or rob you of the Honour you assume of suffering for the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nasonius</hi> smil'd at the Project, and approv'd of it exceedingly: So into <hi>Vtopia</hi> the News was sent, and had all the effect they expected. For, the sottish <hi>Vtopians</hi> with one Voice, Magnify God's Merciful Providence in averting so miraculously the <hi>Chymerical</hi> danger. And now, who was so ill-natur'd as not to be willing to give even half they had to assist this good King, who had so profusely expos'd his Sacred Person, and had incurred such imminent danger of losing his Life for their Sakes? Whereas, has they not been Infatuated beyond measure, they could not but see plainly, that all that little that he did, or suffer'd (had his hurt been real) was the least he could do to uphold his Grandeur and Ambition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nasonius</hi> was mightily pleas'd with the Project of <hi>Sodomicus,</hi> but much more encouraged by the Promises, which both <hi>Lucifero,</hi> and <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosa</hi> had given him of their particular assistance in the present Action; but yet, (as if he would have a trick beyond the Devil) to make <hi>sure work,</hi> he sent several, who, under the notion of Deserters, and flying to the assistance of their <hi>Old Master, Eugenius,</hi> discover'd to him how all matters stood in his <hi>Father</hi>'s Camp, and withal, knowing that there was a dearth of Money in <hi>Lyrania,</hi> he sent great Sums by the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Deserters, with which they should not fail to corrupt, what Counsellors and Officers they could, still making promise of greater Sums: Thus having all the assurance that could be, he commanded the old <hi>Panym</hi> Knight <hi>Refugio</hi> to pass the River <hi>Vndana</hi> at such a place,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55462:22"/>
where he knew the beat of of the Battle would fall upon him; <hi>Refugio,</hi> as presaging his end, was utterly against this Undertaking, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd; and no sooner could he and his Forces pass The River, but they were so briskly received by certain <hi>Luislanders,</hi> and Loyal <hi>Vtopians,</hi> that it gave no small hopes of Victory to the Party of <hi>Eugenius</hi>; and it was remarkable, that about thirty <hi>brave Vtopians,</hi> who had followed their Lawful, injur'd Prince through all Fortune, made a Vow among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to put an <hi>end</hi> to this unnatural War, if possible, by cutting of the <hi>False Nasonius</hi>; and accordingly they furiously broke through all the Troops to find him, but instead of him, discovered <hi>Refugio,</hi> well and stoutly guarded, but they forced their way, and one shot the old <hi>Panym</hi> in the Head, who fell from his Horse into a <hi>filthy Ditch,</hi> where lying unregarded, he breathed his last; a fit end for him, who spent his very last days in the most <hi>dirty Actions,</hi> and in playing the most shameless, treacherous, and faithless Pranks. But while these things were in acting, <hi>Nasonius</hi> sent over a strong Body of Rebellious <hi>Vtopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who came upon the corrupted Officers, and the main strength of the <hi>Lyranians</hi>; but the <hi>Lyranians</hi> having for many Ages been subject to the <hi>Vtopians,</hi> and beaten, as it were, into a habit of running away from them, could not so quickly conquer those deep-rooted Fears, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently betook them to their Heels, and fled as so many Hares before Hounds. <hi>Eugenius</hi> grieved, and enraged at such Cowardise, did all he could to turn and rally them, and to that end, often put his own Life in imminent danger, but nothing would prevail with them, but they still ran, and had left him to the Mercy of the Enemy, had not some gallant <hi>Luislanders,</hi> and Loyal <hi>Vtopians</hi> come to his Succour, who seeing all lost by such matchless Treachery and Cowardise, not without much ado was perswaded, and prevailed with <hi>Eugenius</hi> to go off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve himself for a further Tryal, and better Fortune. And now <hi>Naso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who had carefully observed all from a Hill on the other side the River, seeing the danger over, and the Day his own, took the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to pass the Water after his Army, to reap the Fruite and Glory of the Victory.</p>
            <p>Having then thus obtained the Victory, <hi>Nasonius</hi> march'd to <hi>Lyrapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> where he was highly welcom'd by all the <hi>Panym</hi> Party, and King <hi>Eugenius</hi> and turn'd to King <hi>Gallieno</hi> to <hi>Tutelia.</hi> Now might <hi>Nasonius,</hi> had he not sauntered at <hi>Lypapolis,</hi> but pursued the Enemies with his Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men while they were in that distraction, have cut them off in Parcels, and hindred their rejoyning: But <hi>Fatuitosa</hi> envying that she could have no influence over <hi>Nasonius,</hi> to govern whom even uninspired by others,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55462:22"/>
she made account she had the best Title, gave him a Draught of her <hi>Poppy</hi> with a dash of <hi>Lethe</hi> in it, knowing it would easily work with his Temper so fitly disposed for it; which so <hi>doz'd</hi> and <hi>infatuated</hi> his Reason, not us'd to be over-burthened with any <hi>Politick Considerations,</hi> that neglecting his manifest and best advantage, he thought of nothing but of the high and mighty <hi>Encomiums</hi> which the <hi>Panyms</hi> at <hi>Lyrapolis</hi> gave him: Which gave the Noble Giant Duke <hi>Tarcon</hi> a fair oppotuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to rally his Army again to breed him further trouble. However, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was weary with hugging himself for the Victory which Chance, Folly and Treachery had given him, he march'd forward with his Army towards the strong City <hi>Shannonopolis,</hi> whither great part of <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Army had retired, and laid Siege to it.</p>
            <p>There govern'd at that time in it a noble <hi>Luislandian</hi> Under-Giant, called <hi>Pandaro,</hi> who boldly set open the Gates, and suffer'd six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the unpolitick <hi>Nasonians</hi> no enter, but assoon as they were got in, he had prepared such volleys of Cannon and Musquets to welcome them, that they cut of great Multitudes of them; and the resolute, and valiant <hi>Lyranians</hi> set upon the rest (dismay'd by such an expected and rude Greeting), with that Fury that few of them escaped. Nor could they be relieved or seconded; for <hi>Nasonius,</hi> by a fineness of Policy peculiar to himself, (For the Dose given him by <hi>Fatuitosa</hi> had not yet done working) had left his main Body on the other side of the River; so that it could afford them no help, but they were exposed to be massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred in the manner aforesaid. After which defeat, the Garrison rush'd out to their Astonishment, and fell upon <hi>Nasonius</hi>'s Army, and killed many more of them, and put the rest to a disorderly Flight, which the Poet elegantly describes thus in an apt simile.</p>

            <p>But <hi>Nasonius,</hi> whose chiefest Policy was shewn upon such occasions, made as much haste away as if his Life had been concern'd, and blamed the slowness of his Horse, though he had been a <hi>Pegasus</hi>; never looking behind him till he came to the Sea-side, and there finding a little Vessel, he got over to the happy and safe Shoar of <hi>Vtopia.</hi> Those who write thus of him, do seem to doubt whether a <hi>Coronation Accident</hi> might have befallen him upon this occasion: Because, (say they) his precipitate haste gave him no respite for a decent and leisurely Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation. But to speak impartially, this is too great an Injury to the known Courage of <hi>Nasonius.</hi> For, to say the truth, he had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to fear any thing, but the dishonour of staying, when he saw no good could be done: And therefore he posted back, that he might prevent the news of the Defeat, and make it thought that (his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions inviting him home) the ill Success light, assoon as he had left them, and only by reason of his forced Absence, which none can blame for bad <hi>Policy</hi> in such a <hi>Warriour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was the upshot of those two famous Expeditions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Panym</hi> Knight <hi>Refugio,</hi> and <hi>Nasonius</hi>; in which this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did forfeit more of his Honour, by this defeat and sudden retreat (when his Presence was most needful to retrieve the disgrace that had happened, by his Conduct, and Valour, had they avail'd any thing) nay, and lost him more Men too in that Siege, than had the <hi>Eugenians</hi> in the famous Battle at <hi>Vndana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But things went yet worse with <hi>Nasonius</hi> and his Party, in <hi>Inferiana</hi>; for the valiant and Politick Giant <hi>Grandorsio,</hi> charmged and assisted by the Enchanted Belt, which the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> had given him, set upon the <hi>Hydropick,</hi> General <hi>Valdectius,</hi> in the Field of <hi>Florus</hi>; kill'd Twelve Thousand of his Men, and made him run away <hi>thirty Miles</hi> to save the rest. Which made the Giant <hi>Grandosio</hi> still more famous, and redoubted, and caused the routed <hi>Panym Valdectius</hi> to cast out most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Complaints and Lamentations in his Letters to <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and the <hi>Hydra,</hi> cursing grievously the <hi>frowardness</hi> of Dame <hi>Fortuna,</hi> who by her <hi>unkindness</hi> and <hi>Partiality</hi> had brought him to such <hi>Disgrace,</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</hi>

How <hi>Nasonius</hi> himself went into <hi>Inferiana</hi>; and how <hi>Gallieno</hi> took <hi>Petrana,</hi> even before <hi>Nasonius</hi>'s Face, and of his other Successes there. How <hi>Lyrania</hi> was totally subdued by the Knight <hi>Ginglero</hi>; and how the Green-headed Knight, <hi>Sabau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diero</hi> broke Truce with his Vncle, the great Giant <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eno.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEn the next Spring approach'd <hi>Nasonius</hi> having (as was his Custom) sleec'd the sheepish <hi>Vtopians</hi> of vast Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, went over into <hi>Inferiana</hi> to fight the Battles of the <hi>Associates,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed their <hi>Generalissimo.</hi> At his arrival they had a very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Consultation, how they might utterly subdue the great Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> and assault him both by Sea and Land: So that now their fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardly Party ceased not to make boasts that they would carry on their Conquests as far as <hi>Tutelia,</hi> and that in despight of <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Power, <hi>Nasonius</hi> would fetch away the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> by plain force of Arms: Which great huff, instead of causing the least Fear in <hi>Luyslandia,</hi> gave great matter of Divertisement and Laughter to the <hi>Tutelian</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>But before <hi>Nasonius</hi> took his leave of <hi>Vtopia,</hi> he call'd his Admiral, the <hi>Panym</hi> Knight, <hi>Tornano</hi> unto him, and thus bespoke him. Thou knowest, dear <hi>Tornano,</hi> how I have always treated thee with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Respects; nor has any Man more oblig'd me than thou hast by thy faithful Service: But now the time is come, that thou must go beyond thy former self in Fidelity, both in executing my Commands, as also in keeping the Orders I shall give thee, severely secret, which shall be both for thy safety at the present, and (when time serves) for thy higher Advancement: None knows better than thy self, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> would quickly land my Father <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess me of my Throne, did not my Power at Sea bridle and restain him: So that should I lose my Fleet in a Sea-Fight, I should be in great danger of losing all. My Request therefore is, that when the Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, thou wouldst hover a loof with thy Squadron, which will keep the rest from being too rash; by which means, the Brunt of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55462:24"/>
Fury will light most upon the Ships belonging unto the <hi>Hydra</hi>: For (besides the Politick Consideration now mentioned) I am (to tell you true,) much incensed against that Commonwealth, and not without just reason, for attempting to take away from me the Office of <hi>Hydra-holder</hi>; or, at least, to abridge the Authority of it, and make it insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, Which is an affront so little suiting my Honour, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming so <hi>great</hi> a Monarch, that I can in no wise brook it; as I have wrote to my dearest Friend <hi>Sodomicus,</hi> and ordered him in soft terms to tell them so much. Wherefore, I would at once revenge my self, and by preserving my Fleet, and weakning their Power at Sea, make them rather Court me for my assistance, than that I should sue or truckle to them. <hi>Tornano</hi> was heartily glad to hear the Proposal; for he had no Maw to encounter the <hi>Luyslandians</hi> at Sea, having been so rudely beaten by them the Year before, on the Coast of <hi>Lyrania.</hi> Besides, 'tis said he had a <hi>Fair Lady</hi> with him on Board, in whom he took especial Delight, and he fear'd the roaring of the Cannons might maker her <hi>Head-Ake</hi>: Wherefore he readily consented to the motion; only he as'd how they might be secured against being Impeach'd for <hi>Treason</hi> by the <hi>Hydra,</hi> and <hi>Vtopian Sea-Officers,</hi> if he should refuse to Fight in such a Juncture. To which, <hi>Nasonius</hi> answered, Feign what <hi>plausible excuse</hi> thou seest fit, and I will give <hi>private Orders</hi> to those that shall Examine the Matter, that they shall <hi>acquit</hi> thee from Blame. Which, when <hi>Nasonius</hi> had promised by the most <hi>Sacred Oaths,</hi> and (which was more binding, and more sacred with him than all the rest) by the Word of a King; the thing was agreed upon.</p>
            <p>This done, <hi>Nasonius</hi> addressed himself for his Expedition, and met the <hi>Associates</hi> in <hi>Inferiana,</hi> where they had very long Consulations how they should bring the Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> on his Knees, and the <hi>Idea</hi> each of them had with much hammering fram'd of this Project had such a gay appearance to their wise Fancies, considering it Speculatively, that they made account it was as good as done already. But while they were talking so long about what they should do (their <hi>many Heads</hi> being of so <hi>many Minds</hi> and opinions, and never a good one) the Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Politick Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> (who had but <hi>one Head</hi> worth them all) did his Business, without talking; and with a right puissant Army Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd <hi>Petrana,</hi> the strongest City and Fort in all <hi>Inferiana.</hi> The sudden and unexpected News of this Siege broke off their Consultations, e're they were full ripe; and made them all distractedly do, they knew now what, nor how: And such Power had the sound Dose, given 'em by <hi>Fatuitosa,</hi> over their stupified Senses, that they had neither once thought
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55462:24"/>
of possessing themselves of the Passages to <hi>Petrana,</hi> nor of preventing the Giant <hi>Grandorsio</hi> from intrenching himself, so as to cover the Siege. So that all <hi>Nasonius</hi> could do, was to March that way with his Army, and stay a great way off: As if it had been Honour enough for him to come so near <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Army, as but to hear the frightful noise of <hi>Bombs,</hi> and <hi>Cannons,</hi> which fir'd and batter'd <hi>Petrana</hi>; which was not done neither without mature Advisement, and a deep reach of Policy; which made 'em conclude, that it was more adviseable to avoid the <hi>Hellish Fire</hi> and <hi>Smoak</hi> that the Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> (wo fought still in a Spell, or, Circle of Flames) us'd to spit, and sputter round about him. So <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trana,</hi> which they foolishly boasted, and thought <hi>Impregnable,</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Luislandians</hi>: However, <hi>Gallieno</hi> was sure to pay for that his bold Rashnness, in presuming to take the Town without <hi>Nasonius</hi>'s leave; and was never securely Victorious, if words would do it: For <hi>Nasonius</hi> gave out that he was resolutely determined to revenge himself by Battle. But the Giant <hi>Grandosio</hi> had by his Necromancy so order'd things, that <hi>Nasonius</hi> could not for his Heart tell how to come at him, or how with any Safety, to attack him. And thus continued both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, till the <hi>Nasonians</hi> forced thereto by <hi>Grandorsio</hi>'s Stratagems must needs decamp and be gone: Which, <hi>Nasonius</hi> with all the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces likely to ensue, thought it his best Policy to retire to <hi>Holoo,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending he had no more to do since <hi>Grandorsio</hi> would not Fight, though indeed it was to save his own Credit, which was like to suffer some disparagement, had he staid and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en Present. The <hi>Nasonian</hi> Army therefore was left under the Command of the <hi>Panym</hi> Knight <hi>Valdec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to bring it off as well as he could. But they no sooner began their Retreat, but the Giant <hi>Gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orsio</hi> fell on their Rear, and gave 'em such a <hi>Kick oth Breech</hi> for a Farewel, as killed of them near three Thousand Men.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the Campaign, and this was the Issue of all the vast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and glorious Braggs of entring <hi>Luyslandia,</hi> taking <hi>Tutelia,</hi> and fetching thence the Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> which was sufficiently redicul'd by the <hi>Luyslandians,</hi> who were now asham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Mirth was heightned, even to loud Laughter, that the <hi>Nasonian Star-Gazers</hi> had undertaken to demonstrate by the unerring Arts of <hi>Astrology,</hi> that this <hi>Campaign</hi> ws to be the very last Period of all the Glory of <hi>Gallieno,</hi> and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal time that <hi>Luyslandia</hi> was to be <hi>subdued</hi> and <hi>destroyed.</hi> But since no more was to be done, who could help it? So, the <hi>Associates,</hi> after they had had another grave Consultation what plausible Excuses it were best
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55462:25"/>
to give out to palliate their unwise Conduct, and ill Success, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves, and <hi>Nasonius</hi> return'd into <hi>Vtopia.</hi> Where, no sooner arriv'd, but he found the Complaints made by the <hi>Hydra,</hi> and the <hi>Vtopian</hi> Sea-Officers against <hi>Tornano</hi> were very high, and heavy. They alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this backwardness had cost the <hi>English</hi> many rude Blows, but had cost the <hi>Hydra</hi> Eighteen or Nineteen Ships, for which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Vengeance and Justice against him. <hi>Tornano</hi> put in his <hi>Plea,</hi> which was bandied to and fro, till the severe heat by degrees some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cooling, his Tryal came on, and as <hi>Nasonius</hi> had promised (tho' with much regret of the <hi>Hydra)</hi> he was acquitted. To comfort <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonius,</hi> and to keep up his Heart for his ill success in <hi>Inferiana,</hi> Dame <hi>Fortuna</hi> granted him the happy reduction of <hi>Lyrania</hi> by the <hi>Panym</hi> Knight <hi>Ginglero.</hi> Not for his own sake, whom she mortally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but for <hi>Ginglero</hi>'s, as being of all the <hi>Panym</hi> Officers the most Courteous, Civil, and of best Conduct. This Knight led his Armies through the Land of <hi>Lyrania,</hi> and took divers of their Towns and Forts: At length they came into a pitch'd Battle. The <hi>Lyranian</hi> Army was at that time Commanded by the Politick and Valiant <hi>Luyslan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Giant hight <hi>Rutheno,</hi> who with the Noble <hi>Gigantick</hi> Knight, <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> so encouraged the <hi>Lyranian</hi> Soldiers that they thrice beat back the <hi>Panym</hi> Army, and now were the Horse coming up to secure an intire Victory under the Leading of the Giant <hi>Rutheno,</hi> when, a Cannon Bullet did unfortunately light on that noble Giant, and bereaved him of his Life; which so daunted his Army (his Valour giving Heart and Courage to them all) that the <hi>Panyms</hi> got the Victory, killed many of the Army, and the rest retired into the strong City of <hi>Shannono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi>; but the Places being Fifty Miles from the Sea, so that no Relief or Provision could come to them by Sea or Land, they, with the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of King <hi>Eugenius,</hi> Capitulated, but upon such good terms that he by yielding to it as he did (according to his usual Piety (both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd all his Subjects in <hi>Lyrania</hi> from utter Destruction, and withal, it was stipulated that they should have all their Liberties, Immunities, and Priviledges restored to them. And moreover, that as many Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as would, should be transported into <hi>Luslandia,</hi> of which there went twenty Thousand. All which was advis'd by the Wisdom of the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> who consider'd that the Loyal <hi>Lyranians</hi> that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated, would still retain the same Principles, and be ready to serve King <hi>Eugenius</hi> upon any fit Occasion; and withal, that this new Army of valiant Souldiers, when well cloath'd and paid, (all which in great pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t they wanted in <hi>Lyrania</hi>) would do <hi>Eugenius</hi> and himself
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55462:25"/>
more Service in <hi>Luyslandia,</hi> than they could ever have done had they remained in <hi>Lyrania</hi>: which they performed accordingly, as shall be seen hereafter.</p>
            <p>About this time, or rather before, it the Green-headed Knight <hi>Sabau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diero</hi> was prevailed upon by the <hi>Associates</hi> to rise up in Arms with them, against the Noble Giant <hi>Gallieno. Nasonius</hi> promised him whole <hi>Indies</hi> of Money, and that he would maintain too at his own cost, many Troops to assist him. The <hi>Associates</hi> also unanimously promised him, that in the winding up of the War, when they came to <hi>divide the Spoil,</hi> they would add some part of <hi>Luyslandia</hi> to his Dominions; having very politickly <hi>divided</hi> it among 'em, e're they had got <hi>a foot</hi> in't. This Project was carried so secretly, that never was any mystery of State so carefully conceal'd. However, the <hi>Necromantick</hi> Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> had not only by his <hi>Familiar Spirit</hi> got light of it, but had moreover by a strange Charm got an exact <hi>Copy of their Agreement.</hi> Upon knowledge of which he sent the Valiant Giant <hi>Sabaudocrato</hi> into his Country, e're he was ready, who took all <hi>Montania,</hi> otherwise call'd <hi>Sabaudia,</hi> and was about to fall into <hi>Alpiana,</hi> when <hi>Sabaudiero</hi> confident of the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sility it should take Air, sent Ambassadors to King <hi>Gallieno</hi> falsely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing he was his most humble Servant, and meant nothing but Peace and Amity towards him.</p>
            <p>Now did many sober Men admire at this strange action of <hi>Gallieno,</hi> as breeding himself causeless, and needless Enemies, when he had so many already: For one could imagine that <hi>Sabaudiero</hi> should be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and ungrateful to his Uncle, the great King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver favoured him, and had formerly assisted him against his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects, as without any cause given him to joyn with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who sought nothing but his desctruction; which made Men think it very harsh in King <hi>Gallieno</hi> to invade his Nephew's Dominions, and to refuse to withdraw his Armies till <hi>Sabaudiero</hi> had put two of his chief Cities, as Cautionary Towns, into his Hands: 'Till at length, King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> when he saw his time, shewed the Copy of <hi>Sabaudiero</hi>'s Agreement with the <hi>Associates</hi>; to let the World see how false and hollow-hearted he was, to pretend Peace by his Ambassadors, and yet at the same time to have conspir'd against his Uncle, his Friend, and his Ally, to bring him, if he could, to utter Ruin. But, it was the Luck of this ill-contriv'd <hi>Association</hi> to be supported by the violation of all the nearest <hi>Tyes</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and all <hi>Laws,</hi> both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane.</hi> Yet did the Noble <hi>Gallieno</hi> so moderate his Resentment, as not to let <hi>Sabaudocrato</hi> destroy all his Country, as he could easily have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55462:26"/>
done. pitttying the folly of his Youth, too easily led aside by his Secra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, who had a great Ascendant over him, and had received, as 'tis said, for such treacherous Services, an hundred Thousand Pound from the <hi>Associates,</hi> but chieftly from <hi>Nasonius,</hi> who was still very profuse in laying out the easy got Money of <hi>Vtopia</hi> upon Projects of his own, for which, they that gave it, never intended it. Wherefore the <hi>Luy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slandian</hi> Army continued still in <hi>Montania</hi> and <hi>Alpiana</hi>; took, and Garrison'd divers of the principal Cities and Forts: But of this; more heareafter.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. Of the <hi>Annus mirabilis;</hi> Or the Campaign of the Year, when the <hi>Associates</hi> with their utmost efforts intended to invade the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> on all sides, and to destroy both Him, and his, Root and Branch, and also of the infallible Prognosticks of his Ruin.</head>
            <p>ALL Men, though never so dull, are taught Wisdom by their frequent Misfortunes; and by their often experiencing what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned them; they learn how to prevent them for the future. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these subtil Politicians, the <hi>Associates,</hi> though they were but bad Reflecters came at length, with much ado, to discover, after <hi>Gallieno</hi> had with many repeated Victories beat it into their Heads, that <hi>two</hi> things especially had given him great Advantages over them, <hi>(viz.</hi>) his being <hi>early</hi> in the Field, e're they were ready; and his <hi>Carrying the War</hi> still into his <hi>Enemies Countries</hi>: Hereupon, after many Consultations, they fully and und unanimously resolved to bereave him of both these Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and get them to themselves. But, as nothing is more rediculous than an <hi>Ape,</hi> because it is like a <hi>Man,</hi> and yet is not a Man, so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so mirthful and pleasant as Mimical and <hi>Ape-Politicians,</hi> who would seem such by imitating the true ones, and yet are Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at all. However, they muster'd up, and encreased their Forces, and bent their utmost Endeavours, both to be before-hand with <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eno</hi> in the earliness of their Preparations, and also to enter <hi>Luyslandia</hi> on all sides, as well by Sea as by Land; and teach him to let the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55462:26"/>
of others alone hereafter, and to study his best Arts to defend his own Country.</p>
            <p>It was agreed amongst them, than an hundred Thousand Men, led by <hi>Nasonius,</hi> should invade his Territories bordeering upon <hi>Inferiana</hi>; that the <hi>Regomanians</hi> should fall into <hi>Alsatia</hi>; that <hi>Don Ibero Formalitosa</hi> should enter <hi>Luyslandia</hi> on the side of <hi>Calatonia</hi>; that <hi>Sabaudie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o</hi> should make Incursions into <hi>Delphicoris,</hi> where his Frontiers were least Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and lastly, that <hi>Nasonius</hi> and the <hi>Hydra</hi> should make a <hi>Descent</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Coasts, take his Sea-Port Towns, burn his Ships in their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and pillage and spoil all the Country before them. So that now <hi>Nasonius</hi> did not doubt but that <hi>Victoria,</hi> seeing her Gallant so beset on every side, would of her own accord come over to him, and renounce her Faith and Troth to King <hi>Gallieno</hi> for ever. To facilitate these great Undertakings, they had prevail'd with <hi>Don Ibero,</hi> to create the valiant Duke of <hi>Bawwawia</hi> Governour of <hi>Inferiana,</hi> who had formerly won much Credit by fighting so successfully against the Half-Moon of the great Emperor <hi>Magog,</hi> who accepted his Proffer; though some Men too severe, said, that in doing so, he sold all his Wit and former Reputation to the <hi>Iberians,</hi> in taking upon him so troublesome and hazardous an Employ, insomuch that he had left little or none to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as the Event shew'd: For he has made no Figure at all of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, nor done any thing worthy the least note ever since he became <hi>Formalitoso</hi>'s Underling. However, this served to keep up the drooping Hearts of the <hi>Inferianians,</hi> ready to sink under the ill Success, and bad Conduct of <hi>Nasonius.</hi>

            <p>As <hi>Astrologers</hi> consort it with <hi>Thieves</hi> to know what they have stollen, that they may get Credit by telling how it was lost, and how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve it: So it is a common thing with all <hi>Politicians</hi> to give half light of any Success they think themselves assured of, to some <hi>Star-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Conjurer,</hi> or <hi>Apocaliptical Fortune-Teller</hi> of some Reputation with the Common-People, that when they <hi>read</hi> it foretold, and afterwards <hi>see</hi> it come to pass, they may conceit it was laid by Divine Providence, and that that Person who is to bring it about, is highly in Heaven's Books; in that God would deign to signifie it thus to the admiring World before-hand. Now, <hi>Nasonius,</hi> who was the very <hi>Idea</hi> of deep Policy, knew right-well of what Consequence such a Prediction would be, and therefore resolved to send for his Astrologer <hi>Sydrophell,</hi> who had heretofore done him great Service in the same kind when he first intended to invade his Father <hi>Fugenius</hi>'s Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sydrophell,</hi> when the Messenger came near hand, was sitting in a dark
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55462:27"/>
brown-Study what he should say in his next Almanack, by way of Star-Prophecy, and yet not lose his Credit by being quite mistaken. He saw no symptoms of Hope to prognosticate good luck to <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and was to hearty to the Cause to tell bad: Wherefore he left off that Quest, and betook himself to invent some neat and profitable sleights of gulling the Credulous People, and to make 'em believe he knew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most any Event by consulting the twelve Signs of the <hi>Zodiack</hi>: As by <hi>Aries,</hi> how may <hi>Cuckolds</hi> should be made next Year, and who in particular. By <hi>Taurus,</hi> who was the first <hi>Bull</hi> that leap'd their <hi>Heifer.</hi> By <hi>Gemini,</hi> who should have <hi>two Children</hi> at a Birth, or meet with double-hearted People. By <hi>Cancer,</hi> who should deceive them with false Pretences, and delude them by <hi>Crawling backwards,</hi> while they <hi>seemed to go forwards.</hi> By <hi>Leo,</hi> who should be a <hi>valiant</hi> Souldier, and come to high Preferment for his feats in Arms. By <hi>Virgo,</hi> who should be <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi> that Year, and whether the Person courted for a Spouse, be a <hi>Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. He was got thus far in his Caelestial Speculation, when the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger from <hi>Nasonius</hi> knock'd at the Door, and summoned him at at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him; where, when he was arrived, — <hi>Sydrophell,</hi> said <hi>Nasonius,</hi> Thou knowest, that formerly I caused an hint to be given thee when I had assurance of it my self, of driving my Father <hi>Eugenius</hi> out of his Kingdom; and thou didst acquit thy self well in prognosticating it very exactly, both to my great credit, and advantage, and thine own. Now I have such another Job for thee: Ask me no questions, nor hint thou heardst any thing from me for thy Life. I do tell thee, and assure thee, that the <hi>Luyslandian</hi> Tyrant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> will be quite pull'd down this Summer; and therefore Prognosticate it boldly. Let me alone, replied <hi>Sydrophell,</hi> I will make it so credible, and so plain to all those silly Fools that understand nothing, by the Position of the Planets, and the unintelligible <hi>Schemes</hi> I shall erect, that none of them all shall in the least suspect that I needed any Sublunary Advertisement of it; nor is it for my credit they should. So, with a lowly bow he departed, blessing his kind Stars, which had shined so propitiously upon him, as to offer him such pregnant occasions to make himself more famous than <hi>Booker, Lilly,</hi> or any of the rest of that Canting Tribe; for now he made account that not only his Almanacks, that related such grateful News, but that when his Predictions succeeded, all his future Writings would be snatcht up faster than they could be Printed. To work then he went, and foretold the doleful downfal of King <hi>Gallieno</hi> with so much Asseveration, that if their were any Truth in Heaven, that poor King was by the <hi>Nasonian</hi> Party given for lost
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55462:27"/>
already: And to make this the more credible, the <hi>Panym</hi> Star-gazer, Monsieur <hi>Helmontius,</hi> who had fled from <hi>Luyslandia</hi> to the <hi>Hydra,</hi> did (as we may suppose) by the same Inspiration, in which case it is no wonder if good Wits Jump) with all imaginable assurance Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the same. How exactly their <hi>Star-Prophecies</hi> were fullfilled, will be seen in the Sequel.</p>
            <p>The Spring was now come, and <hi>Nasonius,</hi> (as was his custom) having again drain'd a Mass of Money out of the Pockets of his poor Slaves the <hi>Vtopians,</hi> took the Field very early with an hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of Associate Souldiers at his Heel, and was now tickled with the Conceit how he should firk King <hi>Gallieno</hi>: But when it came to the Tryal, instead of his invading <hi>Luyslandia,</hi> King <hi>Gallieno</hi> came himself into <hi>Inferiana,</hi> and laid Siege to the strongest City and Fort that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd there, call'd <hi>Sambrina,</hi> e're <hi>Nasonius</hi> once thought or dreamt of it. It was very obvious to imagine that King <hi>Gallieno</hi> would set down before that Place, and it had been easy for <hi>Nasonius,</hi> he being first in the Field, to have possessed himself of the Posts and Avenues which gave the <hi>Luyslandians</hi> passage thither: But, as if the senceless Spirit <hi>Fatuitosa</hi> had intended to make a property of him, and his <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates</hi> too, it never once entred into their heads in all their Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to provide against so great a Mischief. However, when the Siege was already laid, then, (as if he awak'd out of a Dream, with some sudden noise) he began to bustle up, and bestir himself, and march'd directly thither with his whole Army in a most formidable manner, threatning to fight the Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> and raise the Siege im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: But the politick Giant <hi>Grandorsio</hi> had by his Skill in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> so postured his Army to cover King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> who, with another Army push'd on the Siege: That <hi>Nasonius</hi> and his great Officers could not for their Lives tell how to come at them with any Safety, or how to set upon him without hazarding their whole Army. So they very soberly <hi>stood still,</hi> and <hi>look'd</hi> on, whilst King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> and his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did, with incredible Valour and Dexterity make themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>Sambrina.</hi> Some were of opinion, that this was an high point of Policy thus to <hi>stand still,</hi> and <hi>view,</hi> that by making their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, how wisely King <hi>Gallieno</hi> went to work, they might learn to take his Towns afterwards. Others said, they came to bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that the Town was surely taken, because they were very nigh, and saw it with their <hi>own</hi> Eyes. But the <hi>Nasonians</hi> imputed it to the <hi>Luy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slandian Witches,</hi> or to King <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Skill in <hi>Conjuration,</hi> by which he caused a Storm upon the River <hi>Mahaignia</hi> which sunk some of their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55462:28"/>
Bridges and Boats, by which they should pass, and by some Charm had so stupified their bethinking Faculties, that they had forgot to provide or look afterward to make more. But the wisest saw, and said plainly, that all those were but Pretences, and that had they pass'd the River, and attack'd the Giant <hi>Grandorsio,</hi> in all liklyhood it had cost <hi>Nasonius</hi> the greatest part of his Army. So King <hi>Gallieno</hi> being now possessed of that strongest City and Castle, feasted his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> and the next day he sent an <hi>Herauld</hi> to <hi>Nasonius,</hi> offering him Battle within two days, if he pleased to accept it. <hi>Nasonius</hi> return'd him this Politick Answer, <hi>That he would fight when himself saw fit.</hi> Well then, said <hi>Gallieno</hi> smiling, I see <hi>Nasonius</hi> has nothing to say to me, so I will leave him to the Mercy of <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorsio</hi>; and immediately returned to <hi>Tutelia,</hi> with his Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> now more than ever endear'd to him by seeing his Warlike Courage and Conduct. The Congratulations of his Subjects, and triumphs they had prepared for him were very Noble and Magnificent: But the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble King <hi>Gallieno</hi> would needs divest himself of that Merit, and give the Honour of that Action to the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> who was in his Company all the while he took it: And to that end he caus'd a large <hi>Medal</hi> to be Coin'd, representing <hi>Nasonius</hi> with his Army <hi>looking on,</hi> whilst <hi>Gallieno</hi> with his, <hi>took Fambrina,</hi> with this <hi>Motto</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XII. How <hi>Nasonius</hi> and the <hi>Hydra</hi> fought against <hi>half</hi> the Fleet of King <hi>Gallieno;</hi> together witht the Reasons given by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> why King <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Fortune should for the time receive some small Check.</head>
            <p>ABout this time <hi>Nasonius</hi> and the <hi>Hydra</hi> with a vast Fleet of near an hundred Men of War, prepared to infest King <hi>Gallieno</hi> by Sea, fearing he should Land the good King <hi>Eugenius</hi> in <hi>Vtopia,</hi> where those of his Subjects who had remain'd Loyal, and others who became so, by seeing their past Errors, and present miseries, were ready to joyn and receive him: But <hi>Fatuitosa</hi> had so besotted <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that when <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Forces came to the Sea-Coast, they weakly imagined they were drawn thither, meerly to hinder their making a Descent upon <hi>Luyslandia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the Project was about to be put in Execution, Dame <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna,</hi> who was never constant in any thing, an had ow'd King <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> a Spite, for a long time, for engrossing the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> (for her fickle nature hated that either <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Success</hi> in <hi>War</hi> should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent) and withall, enrag'd that his Providence and Forecast made him so perpetually Victorious, went to the Throne of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and to the <hi>Fates,</hi> and complained heavily that her Deity would become neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and Providence it self grow into Contempt, if humane Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Policy should render the Designs of Mortals thus continually successful; wherefore she earnestly besought them for <hi>Hers,</hi> and their <hi>own</hi> Honours sake, to give some Check to the too contant Successes of King <hi>Gallieno.</hi> The matter was debated in the <hi>Senate</hi> of the <hi>Gods,</hi> and it was unanimously voted, that it was unworthy the Caelestial Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and would seem as if they were Envious of <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s high Merits should they hinder Wisdom and Valour from having their due Rewards and Successes. Especially since <hi>Gallieno</hi> did humbly attribute all his Victories to the Overseers of the World, and never failed to give Thanks accordingly: But <hi>Jupiter</hi> standing up, (which made all the rest with a reverent Silence expect his final Determination) deliver'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:55462:29"/>It is decreed by the <hi>Fates,</hi> and I have signed the Decree, and bid it stand irrevocable that <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s well meant, and wisely laid Designs shall in this juncture receive some small Check. Not for his <hi>own</hi> sake, (for none but <hi>Fortuna</hi> who is blind her self, could think his Merit ought not to be cherished with deserv'd success) much less for King <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s, whose magnanimous Patience, and Heroick Vertue, under so many afflictions, as well as his noble hearted <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to his People, tho' <hi>Rebellious,</hi> gives him a most deserved Title (besides that of Justice) to regain his <hi>Hereditary</hi> Right: But for the sake of <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Vtopia,</hi> and to punish their Crying Sins of <hi>dis-allegiance</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi> by the <hi>same Man,</hi> whom of their <hi>own</hi> Head, but not by <hi>me,</hi> they have fondly set up to be <hi>their</hi> King, which makes 'em incapable of so great a Mercy, as the restoring to them so <hi>Fatherly</hi> and <hi>good</hi> a Prince. Now, that you may see how just this Decree of mine is of denying 'em. yet as a deliverance from their Oppression, I will make known to you how obstinately and willfully blind, both <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and they are, in their wicked and malicious Errours; and what I have done to signifie my displeasure at their <hi>disloyal,</hi> and <hi>ungrateful</hi> Proceedings; enough to make any repent of their Sins, but such as are hardened in them: I will not speak of the <hi>prodigious Mortallity</hi> of their <hi>Souldiers</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> nor of their <hi>Seamen</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> nor divers other such; but I will recount some of those disasters which pointed at their particular Persons. I sent an horrible <hi>Tempest</hi> at <hi>Nasonius</hi>'s first setting forth; by that first inauspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Omen</hi> to deter him, and them, from proceeding on their <hi>Cursed Design,</hi> and could in Justice have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owned them all, at that time, but that I meant he should be a <hi>Scourge</hi> to 'em, till they saw their Fault, and became Penitent; but it wrought no effect with either. Well! by my Permission they possessed themselves of their <hi>Father</hi>'s <hi>Throne</hi> and being settled, fell a building a <hi>Hamptonia</hi>; but down it came. They did the same at <hi>Nothinghamia,</hi> but that <hi>fell down</hi> too; this could not be imputed to Treachery, Negligence, or a common Casuallty; for, none can but know that Kings (their Lives being endanger'd by the Insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their Dwelling-Houses,) would make choice of the best Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and Workmen; and that those Workmen would use their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Care that their Work should be most firm, when they are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by such great Personages: Yet in despight of their best choice of Artificers, and these Artificers best Circumspection, both those works suffered a shameful Miscarriage. Now these Instances pointed personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and his <hi>unnatural Tullia</hi>: For they cannot name, nor did any one ever hear of any other in the whole Nation, who was going
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55462:29"/>
to build in two places, have had such a disaster light to them in both. Was it possible then to impute these ill-boding Accidents to any thing but an over-ruling Providence, plainly telling them (in such Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as the Soveraign Governours of the World do generally use) that is, (speaking to them by Deeds) that let 'em use their best care, and exert their utmost art, nothing <hi>they build shall stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This working nothing with 'em; I took more severe ways, and sent the dreadful Fire at <hi>Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Regalis,</hi> they removed thence to <hi>Nottinghamia</hi>; but the Judgment of <hi>Fire</hi> pursued them thither also; and yet no will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Malice, or Treachery could be alledg'd; nor could there be want of particular Care to avoid such disasters in the Courts of Princes. Did they ever hear of any other Person in the whole Kingdom, to whom the like Mischiefs happened, as first to be <hi>burnt out</hi> of one house, than to be like to be <hi>burnt,</hi> a short time after in another? Or any in the World, of what Rank soever, (much less of Princes) to whom the <hi>falling</hi> and <hi>burning</hi> of <hi>two</hi> of their Houses did ever happen? 'Tis the common Sentiment of all Mankind, who have any (even unnatural) Religion at all, that when humane Care and Prudence have done their utmost, and yet their Intentions meet with disasters, that 'tis then to be imputed meerly, and particularly to the Will of the <hi>Supream Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Yet they continue to shut their Eyes against such manifest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and carelesly huddle up the Consideration of them under the common notions of Casualties; not regarding the Particularities now mention'd. which were far from being common, being indeed till then unheard of. But, did these Men regard any Principles, they might know that what they call Casualty, is with me Providence, and Design; and if it be incredibly particular, it argues some particular Design of mine: And what could that be but to make them, and the World to take notice, by those Events so stangely remarkable, how highly I am displeased that they dare presume with <hi>another Man's Money,</hi> and on <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man's Ground,</hi> to <hi>build,</hi> or to <hi>live</hi> in Houses which are <hi>none of their own</hi>; and that I declare my self by such signal and peculiar mischances, relating to their very Persons, That <hi>my dread anger is kindled against them for their unjust Vsurpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceeded further, and hinted plainly my just Indignation at their audacious and vain-glorious <hi>Coronation,</hi> and their ill-plac'd <hi>Crown,</hi> and not to speak of the <hi>ridiculous slur</hi> put upon <hi>Nasonius,</hi> by Dame <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> offended at their unnatural Intrusion into their <hi>Father</hi>'s Throne; I took order, that the Ship call'd the <hi>Crown-Frigat</hi> should be <hi>sunk,</hi> and that other called the <hi>Coronation,</hi> should by a strange disaster in Calm
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55462:30"/>
Weather be suddenly <hi>plunged to the bottom</hi> of the Sea: Thus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to them, and threaten them, that when they think themse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves safest, and furthest out of danger, all their <hi>Vsurped Glory</hi> should in a moment <hi>sink</hi> into the deepest <hi>disgrace,</hi> never to rise again. And now, what could I, in Wisdom, have done more to inform that infatuated Nation of my Resentment against their <hi>illegal Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Rebellious Selves,</hi> unless I had come down in humane shape (as I did before <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s <hi>Flood</hi>) and told 'em to their Faces of their deep ingrafted Sins? And had I done so, there would not have been wanting <hi>Wolvish Lycaons</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>worry</hi> and <hi>murder Me,</hi> as they did my annointed Vicegerent <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius, Eugenius</hi>'s Father; and would have done the same to <hi>Eugenius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, had he not providently withdrawn himself for his Security. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, seeing if <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s wisely projected designs be not cross'd, he will certainly do that <hi>unmerited</hi> kindness to the <hi>Vtopians,</hi> as to restore their good King <hi>Eugenius</hi>; and I will take order that it suffer some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat at the pesent, to such a degree as to hinder it. Now, let <hi>Naso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> their <hi>Scourge,</hi> still <hi>harrass, impoverish,</hi> and <hi>bring</hi> 'em to the very <hi>brink</hi> of Ruin. Let the War they maintain to keep him out, <hi>take</hi> their <hi>Ships, spoil</hi> their <hi>Traffick,</hi> make <hi>dear</hi> their <hi>Forreign Commodities,</hi> and all their <hi>Provisions</hi> too: Let it <hi>empty</hi> their <hi>Purses,</hi> and <hi>lose</hi> the <hi>lives</hi> of some hundred Thousands of the <hi>Vtopians</hi>; for, till they <hi>repent,</hi> and heartily <hi>desire</hi> to <hi>restore</hi> their King, the Justice of the Goddess <hi>Nemesis</hi> cannot be satisfied, nor my dread Anger appeased, nor they deserve the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Blessing of good <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s <hi>Restauration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to let you further see, how just this Decree of mine is; it is not Ignorance in the <hi>Vtopians,</hi> which makes 'em thus Rebellious, but willful Mallice against their <hi>own</hi> Consciences, and against their <hi>own</hi> Knowledge. To shew which, I will not alledge how they Sin against my Divine Law, and their own humane Laws (for all such Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have trampled under Foot) but I will challenge them with their own Thoughts, and bring <hi>themselves</hi> to witness against themselves. Not one <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>Lawyer</hi> in the Naton, but would six Years ago, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Hesitation, have condemned any Man as guilty of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by the Laws of the Land, who should have asserted it was <hi>Lawful upon any occasion whatsoever,</hi> to have invited a Forreign Prince to <hi>invade</hi> King <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Kingdoms, and no less Treason to have <hi>deserted</hi> him, <hi>run over</hi> to, or <hi>sided</hi> with the <hi>Invader,</hi> much more to have <hi>Abdicated</hi> their Lawful King, who still <hi>challenged</hi> his right, and only retired to a place of safety, till he might try their Temper, and receive their Proposals. Again, not one <hi>Divine,</hi> or <hi>Preacher,</hi> (no not <hi>Scoto Apostato</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:55462:30"/>
himself, but would, at that time have maintain'd, and undertaken to prove it out of my written Word, to be divine Law, to pay <hi>indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Allegiance to him. Nor do the <hi>Lawyers</hi> either, pretend to have any <hi>New Light,</hi> to understand the Law of the Land better <hi>now</hi> and <hi>formerly.</hi> Nor do those <hi>Mercenary Pastors</hi> pretend to any <hi>New Revelation</hi> of my Divine Will, or <hi>better</hi> means of Interpreting <hi>Holy Writ</hi> than they had before, when they taught out of it the contrary to what they now profess, Preach, and Practise: And, that both Lawyers, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers held thus formerly, and hold, and teach the quite contrary now, without any pretence of new, or better light, is known to their whole <hi>Abdicating Senate,</hi> and to the generality of sensible Men through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Nation: So it is every way most manifest, that nothing but a <hi>Rebellious Spirit, Slavish Fear,</hi> or <hi>Sordid Interest,</hi> are the only Rules of their new Interpretations, both of Law, and Gospel. Most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then do they deserve to be punished by that which was their Sin, their setting up an <hi>Vsurped Power.</hi> Decreed therefore it it is, and that irrevocably, that <hi>Eugenius</hi> shall not come yet to deliver them, but they shall still reap the <hi>harsh Fruits</hi> of that which they have <hi>so wickedly sown,</hi> in despite of my Divine Commands, their own Laws; nay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their own Consciences and Knowledge.</p>
            <p>The King of the Gods having thus finished his Speech, which was received with an universal approbation, and applause of the Inferiour Deities, he immediately dispatch'd <hi>Mercury,</hi> his Messenger, to <hi>Eolus,</hi> commanding him to hinder the better half of the Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Fleet from coming up to joyn the rest. Now, had King <hi>Gallieno</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Sea-Giant <hi>Thalassarchus,</hi> to set upon <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>'s Fleet assoon as possibly, presuming his whole Navy was got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by that time: That while he kept them in play, King <hi>Eugenius</hi> with his Army might be safely transported into <hi>Vtopia.</hi> The noble Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, though not half the number of his Enemies (no more of his Ships but four and forty being yet got together) yet mindful of King <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s precise Order, he thought it became not his duty to gloss upon his Commands, but to obey them literally, struggled against the Wind, and made towards them. Indeed, King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> who was now far off in <hi>Inferiana,</hi> having Intelligence that the Wind had been contrary, sent him three several Expresses not to Fight, till the whole Fleet was come up; but by the peevishness of Dame <hi>Fortuna,</hi> who (for the reasons above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) waited all opportunities to do him some displeasure, they never came to the hand of <hi>Thalassarchus.</hi> Wherefore, not regarding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding inequality of their number, he like a brave and couragious

Giant, boldly set upon them; and notwithstanding their Odds, had rather the advantage during the Fight, having shatter'd some of the <hi>Nasonian</hi> and <hi>Hydropick</hi> Ships, far more than they had done any of his. But, while he retreated the next day, hoping to meet, and joyn some of his other Ships, and prudently designing by that advantage of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to draw them nearer the <hi>Luyslandian</hi> Coast, and Ports, where he might with more safety renew the Fight; <hi>Neptune,</hi> by an order from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> put back the Tide an hour, so that he could not pass the <hi>Cape</hi>; by which means sixteen of them were in part burnt by the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships of the Enemies, lying on the shoar, and so not able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. But <hi>Fatuitosa</hi> taking delight to make Fools of those who would needs be so, inspired them with such <hi>Carelessness,</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> that they never minded the making use of that Advantage but were fully satisfied with the <hi>imaginary</hi> Conceit of having beaten the <hi>Luyslandians,</hi> now resounding all over <hi>Vtopia</hi>; that they never dream'd of making any further Conquests, till too late: For the Politick Giant <hi>Gallieno</hi> had by this delay so Fortified all the Coasts, that having lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Many Impartial Considerers denied that <hi>Nasonius</hi> had the Victory, because (say they) to conquer, is to have the better in Fight, which he had not, and the disadvantage was meerly accidental; which put those <hi>Luyslandian</hi> Ships out of capacity of Fighting, and so it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no Mastery, or Valour to do them a Mischief, and therefore was a disadvantage, and loss to them indeed, but no <hi>true named</hi> Victory, nor any gain to the Enemy.</p>

King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> and his own Immortal Glory. Long, very long had this mighty Project amused all <hi>Europe</hi>; huge preparations of Cannons, Mortars, Bombs, and other formidable Military Engines had marched with great Solemnity from <hi>Thamopolis,</hi> and were Embarqu'd. Many hundreds of Transport Ships, and <hi>Well-boats</hi> were taken up, and made ready. Nay, all that the Wit of Man could invent, or such a noble Exploit could need, without sparing any Cost (for <hi>Vtopia</hi> had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney enough) was put in a readiness. The Souldiers were not only furnished with <hi>Arms,</hi> and all things necessary nay, (which was to them a special favour and encouragement) with <hi>Money</hi> too; but as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port went, with ten thousand Arms to equip the <hi>Panyms</hi> in <hi>Luyslan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> who were to rise up and joyn with them. The <hi>Panym</hi> Knight, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanglus,</hi> Eldest Son to the Knight <hi>Refugio,</hi> who was to command this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Army, looked as big as <hi>Alexander,</hi> hugely proud of this blessed occasion to signallize his matchless Valour, and to <hi>equal</hi> (for none could <hi>outdo</hi> them) his Father's <hi>unparallelled</hi> Performances at <hi>Lutosia.</hi> What <hi>Gazet</hi>? What <hi>Couranto</hi>? What News-Letter, nay, what Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was there on this side the World which did not ring with the loud and astonishing sound of this renowned Enterprize. The <hi>Nasonian</hi> Courtiers were all turn'd <hi>Astrologers,</hi> and prognosticated the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Downfall of King <hi>Gallieno,</hi> from the success they promised them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of this undertaking; which was so sure, and the Grounds of it so firmly and wisely laid by the <hi>unerring</hi> Politicks of <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and the Certainty of it Seal'd by the universal approbation of all the Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates met in a general Consultation for that purpose, that it was beyond the casual condition of bearing any Wager (though at never so great odds) to which few or none of their other designs, but were liable. Besides, the profound Secrecy of it, gave it the revered Esteem, of a wonderful Mystery.</p>
            <p>The most searching Wits of <hi>Vtopia</hi> were too shallow to found the dark bottom of it, and were at a deadly plunge how to frame the least Conjecture where this <hi>iresistable Thunderb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

foolish Fiend her self, went often beyond her Commission, and so infatuated <hi>Nasonius,</hi> the whole <hi>Junto</hi> of <hi>Associates,</hi> and the <hi>Vtopian</hi> Council, and <hi>Generalls</hi> too, that the so much bragg'd of Design va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in a Mist; and the brisk Invaders came back greater Fools than they went forth. However, some <hi>Nasonian</hi> Counsellors were sent down to them, to remove, by their wise Advice the Impediment, that render'd their attempt abortive. But all the effect that appear'd of their Consultation was this, that after some dodging (as the manner was) to cozen the People, it should be given out, that they would out again when the Wind served, and pursue their Project: 'Till at last, Mens Expectations being wearied, and in tract of time, pretty well cool'd, instead of setting Foot on the Enemies Country, they went to visit their Friends in <hi>Inferiana</hi>; and very fairly, easily, and prudently too (there being no danger, nor any to oppose 'em there) they land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Ostelia</hi>; which put their Friends to great Confusion, brought a cruel disgrace upon <hi>Nasonius,</hi> gave occasion of much mirth to the <hi>Luy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slandians,</hi> and as much regret to the wiser sort of <hi>Vtopians</hi> to see their expectations still fool'd, and such vast Sums still thrown away to do just nothing. In a word, this grand design, as it was conceived and born in a Mystery, so it died as Mysteriously too. The reason of its miscarriage being so carefully hush'd up, that to this day few know certainly the occasion of it. Some undertake to clear <hi>Nasonius</hi>'s Credit, and Conduct, by alledging that he never meant or designed <hi>any thing</hi> in his Life but to March to and fro with a great Army at his Heels, to shew his Greatness, and <hi>get</hi> Money of the <hi>Vtopians,</hi> in neither of which Projects did his Policy ever fail him, and that all the rest was but pretence, which some unwise Criticks mis-understanding to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, do frame thence a rash and censorious Judgment, that his designs suffer defeat; which (things being rightly understood) is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>About the same time the young Knight <hi>Sabaudiero,</hi> assisted by <hi>Naso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s Money, picked dexterously out of the <hi>Vtopians</hi> Pockets, and by twenty Thousand Souldiers of <hi>Austriaco,</hi> and <hi>Don Ibero,</hi> did on a sudden invade that part of <hi>Luyslandia</hi> which border'd on his Country; where, when he had entred, he plunder'd and burnt <hi>Country Towns,</hi> and <hi>Villages</hi> most valiantly, tho' they were strongly Fortified with <hi>Hedges, Ditches,</hi> and <hi>Mud-Walls,</hi> while there was as yet, none there to resist him: Especially the <hi>Panym</hi> Knight <hi>Caprea</hi> out of his innate hatred to all that's Sacred, sparing not either <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; not caring what Credit he lost his Master <hi>Austriaco</hi> by such Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55462:32"/>
so he might gratify the Licentious Humour of his barbarous <hi>Regomanians</hi>; though (as is said) against the will of <hi>Sabaudiero,</hi> who tho' he wore the fine <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Feather,</hi> yet his Officers valued not his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but did in that, and all things else what themselves listed.</p>
            <p>As a left-handed Fellow, though unskillful, puts a very good Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster out of his Play; so this Left-handed Policy of <hi>Sabaudiero</hi> gave some small trouble to King <hi>Gallieno</hi>; who, governing all his actions by Wisdom, and expecting that others too, would (to some degree at least) do the same, could never have thought that <hi>Sabaudiero,</hi> who had now a good Army in the Field, would not have rather attempted first to have clear'd his own Country of Enemies, e're he had Invaded that of another. This being no wiser than for a Man, when he knew his own House was on Fire, to neglect the quenching of it, and run to set fire to that of his Neighbour, and all this to satisfie the <hi>Braggadocio</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the <hi>Iberian</hi> Officers: But, assoon as the news of this impotent Invasion allarmed the Giant <hi>Gallieno,</hi> and that he sent the Giant <hi>Sabau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docrato</hi> with Forces to drive 'em out; they shew'd their chief Policy and Valour in running away as fast as they could (as Thieves out of a House, when they perceive the Lord of it is awake) e're they could come up to them; carrying some inconsiderable Booty along with them, tho' not of worth to countervail the tenth part of the wise Expedition. Nor had they ability, leisure, or wisdom to stop the Passages, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring his Potent Enemy from following him to the Heart of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with such Force (as appears by his flight, and the sequel) as he was not able to resist: There (if not restrained, by King <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Noble Mercy) to take quadruple Satisfaction.

And moreover to comfort 'em, and secure 'em for the future, he fortified their great Towns, and the Passages into his Country on that side.

            <head>CHAP XIV. How <hi>Nasonius</hi> thought to surprize the Giant <hi>Grandorsio</hi>'s Camp at <hi>Steenkirkia,</hi> and how he succeeded. And of his attempt on <hi>Ipresburga;</hi> as also of his noble Enterprize to Besiege <hi>Dunkirkia</hi> Together with what happened in <hi>Regomania.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOW did the hopes of doing any good upon the mighty Giant <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieno,</hi> rest upon the puissance, and policy of <hi>Nasonius,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bawwawia,</hi> who had a great Army in <hi>Inferiana</hi> yet entire; for they were very moderate Men in their way, and had no such vast designs as to Besiege any of King <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Towns, which might les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen their Armies, or impair the number of their Men, and <hi>Grandorsio</hi> had sent many of his to other Places: Yet it was necessary for <hi>Naso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> especially having this seeming advantage, to do something at least to uphold his Credit, much sunk last Year by doing nothing at all. Long time he had watched his opportunity, and at length thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he had caught it: For being informed by some of his infatuated Scouts, that the Giant <hi>Grandorsio</hi> lay negligently, and weakly incamp'd near <hi>Steenkirkia,</hi> he betimes next Morning drew forth his Army, and marched without beat of Drum, or sound of Trumpet, not doubting but that now he should take him napping, rout him Horse and Foot, and revenge the disgrace he had formerly done him, by forcing from him the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Lady <hi>Victoria</hi>: But arriving at the place, the Giant (to his great surprize and dis-satisfaction) having had timely notice of this design by <hi>Mephostophilo)</hi> had so postured himself, and so conveniently disposed his Army, that they might regularly come up to relieve those that went before, and received him so warmly, that the <hi>Fool-hardy Vtopians,</hi> who bore the brunt of the Charge, were after a sharp Conflict, totally defeated.</p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Nasonius</hi> himself did that day signalize exceedingly his Valour, by standing <hi>half a Mile off</hi> on the top of an high Hill, and thence, as the Gods used to view the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Trojan</hi> Hosts when they fought, did very attentively behold all that pass'd: and As if he had taken a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Felicity in seeing the Towns of the <hi>Associates</hi> taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Armies routed, while he, as if he had been unconcerned, and only came
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55462:33"/>
as a curious Spectator, <hi>stood still,</hi> and <hi>looked on.</hi> Those that fell, were all <hi>Vtopians,</hi> or those whom they had hired; For, tho' being the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallisimo,</hi> it lay in his Power to send the <hi>Hydropick</hi> Souldiers to relieve them; yet, mindfull of his Promise to <hi>Lucifero,</hi> which was to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the foolish <hi>Vtopians</hi> to preserve his darlings the <hi>Hydropicks,</hi> he very fairly let above ten Thousand of them be knocked o'th' Head, without coming himself, or sending any Souldiers of the <hi>Hydra</hi> to assist 'em. Some imputed this strange Carriage of <hi>Nasonius</hi> to want of Courage, orthers, to his defect in Conduct; but, others, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to these two Qualifications, (which they are far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to him) attributed it, as the main motive to his following the faithful advice of his Spouse <hi>Ambitiosa,</hi> charging him not to come too near the Armies of the Necromancer <hi>Gallieno,</hi> and to the Inspiration of the Arch-Fiend <hi>Diabolica,</hi> to be most ungrateful to those to whom he was most obliged.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Nasonius</hi> having staid long in one place, began to want Forrage, the reason of their continuing so long in the same spot was very Politick, for they were ashamed to go back, and durst not go forwards; and therefore, out of a deep reach of Wisdom, they judged it best to sit still. There was a part of the Country which was very plentiful, having never yet been harrassed by the Armies, which they had a Months Mind to be nibbling at: But they knew not how to move, lest the Giant <hi>Grandorsio</hi> getting light, by his Familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, of their Intentions, should (as his wicked manner was) set upon their Rear, and pluck some Feathers out of their Tail. However, <hi>Grandorsio</hi> himself, had an Eye upon that commodious place; and by his Sorceries cast them into such a dead Sleep, that he decamped with his Army, and took Possession of it, e're they so much as dream'd of any such matter: But, when he was gone, they march'd on valiantly to the place he had left, and resolved to cry quits with him, by taking the strong Town of <hi>Ipresburga,</hi> and it was their peculiar manner of Conduct, to have oftentimes done great matters, but that something or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther still hindred them: So, understanding that <hi>Grandorsio</hi> was now a great way off, they with good resolution marched towards it, not doubting but 'twas their own; insomuch that Letters were by way of anticipation sent into <hi>Vtopia,</hi> that it was actually taken. But, so it unluckily happened, that another of King <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Giants, <hi>Nicobelgus</hi> by name, having by Sorcery, (for they were all great Conjurers in their way) got notice of their Intentions, came just in the nick, and frustrated their Expectations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55462:34"/>At this time the <hi>Panym</hi> Knight, <hi>Misanglus</hi> who (as was said) had put to Sea formerly to make a Descent upon <hi>Luyslandia,</hi> and had shamefully miscarried in his project, that they might make a shew of doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, landed his Army in <hi>Inferiana</hi>: Upon which, <hi>Nasonius</hi> set up a firm Resolution, being joyned with the Forces under <hi>Misanglus,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege, and take the famous and strong Town of <hi>Baldwinopolis:</hi> For this purpose he caused great Cannon, Bombs, and all sorts of Warlike Provision to be brought from <hi>Mosana,</hi> overthwart <hi>Brabantia,</hi> and in <hi>Inferiana.</hi> This set up afresh the Courages, and Hearts of the <hi>Naso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>; not doubting but the Wisdom and Policy of their <hi>Generalissimo</hi> was such, that all this formidable preparation could not be made for nothing, and made 'em Cock-sure that <hi>Baldwinopolis</hi> was as good as their own. But so short-sighted were their Politicks, that they did not yet well know, or soberly consider the strength of the place they were to attack, nor what the Enemy could do to hinder their approaches to it; much less had they compared these (as wise Leaders ought) with their own Force. Wherefore, after they had vapoured a long time and (as it was their main Policy to trump one sham-pretence after another to keep up the drooping Hearts of the Party) had fill'd the easy deluded <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topians</hi> with assured hopes of such huge Importance; and that the <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopolitans</hi> had, upon that Prospect, lent great Sums of Money. They upon <hi>second</hi> Thoughts (for otherwise they generally acted upon the <hi>first</hi>) very fairly let the Project fall easily by degrees, and only gave out, they would at least <hi>Bomb</hi> it, and Fire it; But, when they came to execute even that, they found all too late; that King <hi>Gallieno</hi> had by his Necromancy raised such inchanted Forts in their way, that it was impossible for them to come within five Miles of it; Besides they were afraid the Wizard <hi>Grandorsio,</hi> who lay behind 'em, would play them some Legerdemain Trick, if they offer'd to move far either one way or the other.

In this Conflict, the <hi>Lyranian</hi> Souldiers (who, as was formerly said, were transported into <hi>Luyslandia</hi> upon the Capitulation of <hi>Shannonopolis</hi>) won much credit for their coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Behaviour, breaking down all before 'em.

            <p>It past after the same unfortunate manner, or rather much worse with the <hi>Regomanian Associates,</hi> Needs they would (as it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed amongst 'em) invade the Territories of King <hi>Gallieno</hi> on that side, and destroy <hi>Alsatia:</hi> But having appointed three or four solemn <hi>Drinking</hi> Matches (which out of Devotion to God <hi>Bacchus,</hi> they would not omit) they had not leisure to come into the Field till the Campaign was almost at an end; and when they did (as if the fumes of the Wine had not been yet well evapourated, they took such <hi>broken</hi> Measures, that when they made account to pass into <hi>Luyslandia,</hi> where the great Giant <hi>Allemano-Mastix</hi> had strongly posted himself, they lost many Men in attempting it, and were forced with shame and loss to retire. After which, that Politick Giant led 'em such dances, ad made 'em reel from one end of the <hi>Rhenusia</hi> to the other, till their Heads were giddy, and quite ravell'd all the Designs their muddy Policy had laid. In the mean time <hi>Allemano-Mastix</hi> waiting his opportunity, took their Towns, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and plundered their Villages, and put all the large Country of <hi>Wirtemania</hi> under Contribution. But the Campaign now drawing to an end, and the <hi>Associates</hi> thinking it a great Dishonour to them all, that the avow'd Project of invading <hi>Luyslandia</hi> should come to just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. They (poor dull Gentlemen!) held a Consultation, as their Courants tell us, for a whole day together, what they should do, and the Result of it was, the Besieging the Castle of <hi>Ebrenburga,</hi> defended by no more than three hundred of King <hi>Gallieno</hi>'s Soldiers. Mean while the Politick Giant <hi>Allemano-Mastix,</hi> having defeated their Army beyond the <hi>Rhenusia,</hi> and taken the Duke of <hi>Wirtemania</hi> Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hasted to raise the Siege.

could, and yet for all his haste, there wanted but little of his being intercepted in his Flight, by the vigilant <hi>Allemano-Mastix,</hi> which had cost him the loss of his Army, and brought him <hi>Prisoner</hi> to <hi>Tutelia,</hi> to bear his Fellow-General, the Duke of <hi>Wirtemania</hi> Company, in their Land of Captivity.</p>

<q rend="margQuotes">Dread Sire! whilst you take care even of the minutest matters, relating to your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Dominions, I wonder you should be so regardless of my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and your Son-in-Law, <hi>Nasonius,</hi> as to suffer that damn'd Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancer <hi>Archimedes,</hi> to command your Spirits to his assistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and to blast all his designs, and undertakings?</q>

               <hi>Nasonius,</hi> whose Mind was uneasy, and who was never very Courtly, received her Message with a kind of sullen Reservedness.

            <p>As for the Forts, <hi>Mendixia,</hi> and <hi>Furnium,</hi> they were neither great nor strong; nor had the powerful Necromancer <hi>Archimedes,</hi> set any Spell, or Charms upon them; only in whose hands soever they were, they afforded some advantage to annoy the other, and to secure, or hinder Forragers; some thought that <hi>Grandorsio</hi> did design to flight them, others said, that he kept them only as a Bait for <hi>Nasonius,</hi> but however it was, they were but weakly Garrison'd.

               </gap>ing at any time, upon the use of a certain Call, consisting of some odd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, Necromantick Words, which she had taught him.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Nasonius</hi> had repeated his <hi>Beadroll,</hi> the <hi>Witch</hi> was forced to appear, but she seemed to come in no very good Humour, and our Knight remmembring the Affront he had before put upon her, now set himself all he could to <hi>Light a Candle to the Devil,</hi> and to entertain her with the utmost Courtship of a Froglander; and thus he began. 

<q rend="margQuotes">My dearest <hi>Crampogna,</hi> I hope you can pardon a thoughtful Man, who did not entertain you and your last Message in such manner as I ought; it was the trouble of my Mind, which diverted my Thoughts, not any want of respect to you, whom I highly honour, and next to <hi>Lucifero</hi> adore. Forgive my neglect, and be the same kind <hi>Crampogna</hi> to me as formerly. I have a <hi>bold,</hi> and <hi>cunning.</hi> Enemy to deal with, but I have a gallant Army, advise me what to do.</q>

The Witch pout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly replied, 

<q>You know you are much better at <hi>Shiting</hi> than <hi>Fighting,</hi> and if you had taken the course, by all manner of <hi>Lies,</hi> and <hi>Slanders,</hi> to <hi>beshite</hi> your Enemies, it would have stood you in more stead, and done them more disgrace than ever you are like to do by drawing your <hi>Sword</hi>; but something you must do with all these Forces, and that you may be sensible that I am more kind than you deserve, I will give you such advice, that if you be quick in pursuance of it, it will put <hi>Grandorsio</hi> into such a Rage, that he will go near to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his whole Army; but be sure you warp not from it, for if you
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55462:38"/>
do, mischief will befall you.</q> 

At this his heart leapt for Joy, and with a thousand Thanks he could not forbear embracing the ugly Hag, who put a stop to his Courtship, by thus proceeding in her Discouse. 

<q rend="margQuotes">There is (quoth she) a certain place yclepied <hi>Vivaria,</hi> by nature strong, but still more strong, by reason of certain Charms laid upon it by the Conjurer <hi>Archimedes,</hi> which are still in force. Thither go and encamp and I will use all my Arts further to secure you, so that <hi>Grandorsio</hi> shall not attempt any thing upon you, but to his Damage, but be sure to keep you there.</q> 

As <hi>Nasonius</hi> was about to make his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, he heard a rumbling noise, and therewith came so violent a Wind, as made the Vault shake, and the Earth tremble under him, and while he stood agast, expecting the Issue, the Witch insensibly slipt away and left him alone.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Nasonius</hi> came to himself, he made haste away to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and marched directly to <hi>Vivaria,</hi> and there, according to the old Haggs advice, Encamp'd, which when <hi>Grandorsio</hi> heard, it put him into a strange fit of Passion, for he designed to have Encamped there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But, assoon as he could get his Forces together, away he led them to <hi>Vivaria,</hi> intending by any means to set upon <hi>Nasonius</hi>; but though his Rage was great, and his Arts many, yet so strong were the Enchantments, which guarded the place, that he could by no means come at him, or do any harm to his Souldiers, but if he approached too near, received harm to himself. By chance, a certain Spirit gave notice of all this to the Necromancer <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concerned for his old Friend, and Acquaintance <hi>Grandorsio,</hi> and to prevent the danger, if not too late, he immediately dispatched away to him a certain Mercurial Devil, who always attended him, hight <hi>Mephostophilo,</hi> who in a trice flying though the Air, came to <hi>Grandor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi> meditating a rash attempt, and deliver'd him the following Letter from the Conjurer.</p>

               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:55462:38"/>Upon receipt of this Letter, <hi>Grandorsio</hi> altered all his Measures, and having dispatched away <hi>Mephostophilo</hi> with (as is said) a very kind An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer (for the Letter is unfortunately lost) he gave up all thoughts of setting upon <hi>Vivaria,</hi> and set all his Wits on work how he might draw him and his Army out of that unapproachable Place. To this end he considered that there was a certain place called <hi>Episcopatum,</hi> which was of great consequence, though not very strong; thitherwards <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorsio</hi> marched with his whole Army, making a feint, as if he would Besiege it; at this the <hi>Associates</hi> were all alarm'd, and <hi>Nasonius</hi> to prevent the danger, sent a considerable Body of Men from his Camp, who marching another way, got into the Town to secure it. And now <hi>Nasonius</hi> thinking all things safe, and wanting Provisions, sent a strong detachment under the Command of <hi>Signieur Cabbagio,</hi> who marched many Miles, with Commission to steal Turnips, and Roots, (and a few Sheep, and Oxen if they could get them) for Sauce. <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorsio</hi> being aware that he had weakened his Army with two such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Detatchments, now sent away in good earnest a brisk under-Giant hight <hi>Villerio</hi> to besiege <hi>Huana,</hi> whilst he himself lay in wait to set upon <hi>Nasonius,</hi> if he should offer to march forth to the relief of it. This <hi>Huana,</hi> though no great Town, was of some strength, but the more considerable, for that the taking of it would leave <hi>Episcopatum</hi> naked, and open the passage to the last Barrier of the <hi>Hydropick</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which so affrighted the Heads of the <hi>Hydra,</hi> that they plied hard with all the <hi>Associates,</hi> and all with one consent pressed <hi>Nasonius</hi> not to suffer a place of such consequence to be ravished from them. Thus being overcome with their complaints, and clamours, he rashly forsook his impregnable, <hi>inchanted Camp,</hi> at <hi>Vivaria,</hi> and marched with all the Forces he had to relieve <hi>Huana,</hi> which was just the very thing <hi>Grandorsio</hi> hoped, and wished for: But, whilst he, and his <hi>heartless</hi> Forces made their <hi>slow</hi> Marches, <hi>Villiero</hi> followed his Business so close, that he became Master of <hi>Huana,</hi> before <hi>Nasonius</hi> drew near it, and sent his spare Forces to reinforce <hi>Grandorsio</hi>; the tidings of this being brought to <hi>Nasonius,</hi> his Countenance changd, and his Heart so fail'd him, that stout rubbing, and the help of the Brandy-Bottle, were scarce able to keep him from fainting away, but being somewhat come to himself, he gave Orders to march immediately back again to his Enchanted Camp at <hi>Vivoria.</hi> But when he heard that <hi>Grandorsio</hi> had posted himself in his way, so that he could not return thither, without hazarding himself, and his whole Army, he bitterly curs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for not following the Witches Counsel; and all his Counsellours, who had advised to the making so great a Detachment, to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Army; though some say, that none gave such Counsel, but that it was purely his own silly Contrivance, and that none ought to share with him in the Glory of it: All these things concurring with his further Fears, put him into such a vehement Passion, that scarce any durst, or car'd to come near him, and that working violently <hi>downwards,</hi> it so <hi>strongly</hi> perfumed his Tent, that when it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken by <hi>Grandorsio,</hi> the peculiar <hi>Scent</hi> thereof, presently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to whom it belong'd. But to make what amends he could, for this fatal Error, he chose a Place the most like to <hi>Vivaria,</hi> as in such a streight he could find, and caused his <hi>Pioneers</hi> to fall to work, and called on all his <hi>Devils, Witches,</hi> and <hi>Conjurers,</hi> to set their <hi>Spells,</hi> and <hi>Charms,</hi> whilst he with a select Party rode out, to discover which way <hi>Grandorsio</hi> was bent; but <hi>Grandorsio,</hi> who knew that the <hi>Pioneers,</hi> and <hi>Conjurers</hi> would quickly so guard the Place, as to be a mighty Annoyance to him, was coming in all haste to prevent it; which, when <hi>Nasonius</hi> perceived, he turned his Horse-Head, set Spurrs to his Sides, and rode faster than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any Man for a Wager, and would have thought <hi>Pegasus</hi> too slow, had He been under him, and before he, and his swift followers could well reach the Camp, they all bawled out, like so many <hi>Strenters, The Enemy comes, The Enemy comes, To Arms.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55462:39"/>
upon occasion he might give orders, or send Recruits. He could scarce slip away from danger before the <hi>Luislanders</hi> came on with Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but were so stoutly received by the <hi>Vtopian, Iberian,</hi> and <hi>Rego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manian</hi> Forces, who had the advantage of Ground, and resolutely maintain'd it, that the Field was covered with the dead Bodies of the <hi>Luyslanders,</hi> and for several hours it was doubtful, which way the honour of the Day would go; but <hi>Grandorsio</hi> still sending fresh and plentiful Supplies, and <hi>Nasonius</hi> not taking sufficient Care to relieve his <hi>wearied</hi> Men, the <hi>Luyslanders</hi> began to break into the Camp. The <hi>Hydropicks</hi> all this while, instead of assisting their Associates, had kept themselves together in a safe place, wisely leauing <hi>Fools</hi> to <hi>Fighting,</hi> and now like Crows, who 'tis said, smell Powder at a distance, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending danger to come on, they thought it was their time to be gone, and accordingly away they went, making the best of their way. <hi>Nasonius</hi> endeavour'd to perswade them to stay, but they thanked him kindly, and told him, that they thought it greater Wisdom to provide for their own Safety, whilst the Armies continued Fighting, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their Retreat, than to take his Counsel, and stay to have their Brains knocked out. <hi>Nasonius,</hi> who was always careful to avoid dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and lov'd Fighting as little as themselves, (though it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary he should sometimes make a Bluster, and Shew) that they should not be judg'd wiser than he, without taking any <hi>Care,</hi> or leaving any <hi>Orders,</hi> for his <hi>Army,</hi> immediately fled away as fast as the best of them, and never made stop or stay, till he had rode twelve Leagues, and passed two Rivers, and then dark night putting a stop to his Carrier, he put into a <hi>Barn,</hi> and cover'd himself all over Head and Ears in Straw, setting a watch to observe if any of the Enemy came after him. The Noble Duke of <hi>Bawwawia</hi> maintained the Fight after this for about the space of two hours, till a Loyal Subjet of the injured <hi>Eugenius,</hi> for his Master's sake then in the Service of the Mighty <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieno,</hi> the valiant <hi>Lyranian Lucanio,</hi> with his Horse, broke in like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the Enemy, seized all their Cannon, and turned it against them, and trampled under Foot, or cut down all before them. And now all the <hi>Associate</hi> Forces could do, was to shift the best for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they could; but the Duke of <hi>Bawwawia</hi> causing a Bridge to be broken down to hinder the pursuit of the Victorious Enemy, it prov'd fatal to a great part of his Forces, for Thousands were slain like Sheep by the River side, and such as attempted to get over, not being able to climb the high Banks, were drown'd, till the vast number of dead Bodies making a firm Bridge, afforded a way for the poor remainder
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55462:40"/>
to run over, and save themselves. In this Battle many great Persons of the <hi>Associates</hi> were made Prisoners, and many brave Persons slain on both sides, amongst whom, none is to be more lamented than the gallant <hi>Lucanio,</hi> who, after his wonted Generosity, neglecting himself to take care of the Prisoners, and Wounded of the Enemy, his own Wounds ranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled, and killed him. The <hi>Luyslanders</hi> lost many at the beginning of the Fight, but in all, first and last, not so many by two thirds as the <hi>Associates,</hi> whose Army was wholly broken, and had been totally and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, what remained of the <hi>Associate</hi> Army, was so dispersed all manner of ways, that it was some Weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nasonius</hi> could by any shifts get so many together as might seem to <hi>counterfeit</hi> any thing like an Army. But, while he lay thus trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the grumbling of the Gizzon, and conjuring up all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of Hell to assist him for his Revenge, <hi>Gallieno,</hi> with the Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> were singing divine Hymns of Thanks to the Caelestial Powers, and great Entertainments were made at <hi>Tutelia,</hi> and over all <hi>Luyslandia</hi> great Demonstrations of Joy were every where solemnly expressed for so signal a Victory.</p>

            <p>LEt us for a while leave <hi>Nasonius,</hi> picking up his scatter'd Forces, and revolving ten thousand Projects, in his Brain, how to do nothing, and see what better Fortune the <hi>Associates</hi> met with elsewhere: Youth is forward, rash, and greedy of Glory, and in <hi>Montania</hi> their Forces were thought to be much the stronger, not only as having the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in number, but also, as consisting for the most part of stout, and well-disciplin'd Men; this pricked on <hi>Sabaudiero</hi> to do something, both for his Glory, and in revenge of his Losses; and after a serious
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55462:40"/>
Consultation, where there was scarce one wise Head among them, and that least set by, it was resolved to besiege <hi>Pineria,</hi> a Town strong, and of great Consequence. And now without delay their Forces were drawn about it; but the great Necromancer, <hi>Archimedes,</hi> had been there before, and raised certain small magical Forts, which so guarded <hi>Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> that till one, or more of them were taken, they could not come at it without running a desperate hazard: And therefore that they might seem to act like wise Men, they resolved in the first place to attack the Fort called <hi>Pontilla,</hi> which they did with great Fury, and renewed f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om time to time with great Resolution; but on the other hand, the Fort was as bravely defended by some select Men put therein, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Valour or Industry wanting on either side, there were Mines against Mines, Charms against Charms, (for in those strong Countries they are all addicted to Necromancy) and vehement assaulting, and as stout repulsing: But in the end, their Charms being countercharm'd, the Fort wofully batter'd, and they over-power'd with numbers, they found they could no longer maintain it, and yet resolved so to quit it, that it should do the Enemy no good, nor they suffer the least in their Honour and Reputation. And accordingly they secretly convey all their Cannon, Ammunition, and Provision into <hi>Pineria,</hi> and then they had but one trick to try more, and that was a certain <hi>Spell,</hi> or <hi>Charm</hi> left them by the famous Necromancer <hi>Archimedes,</hi> with this strict charge, that they shoul never use it but in their last neccessity; and this they thought the time, now the Fort was no longer tenable; and therefore they set it on work, when presently all the Fortification fell a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and suddenly flew up into the Air and vanished, whilst the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged under coverture of the Cloud, safely retired to <hi>Pinera,</hi> to re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force that Place, and desend it against the threatning Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sabaudiero</hi> was somewhat surprized with the Novelty of the thing as having not often seen such <hi>Conjuring Tricks,</hi> but withal, proud that he had Conquer'd such a <hi>Devilish place,</hi> he swore he would now have <hi>Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> or make it fly away after <hi>Pontilla.</hi> They made themselves Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the place; for they took it for granted, that <hi>Sabaudocrato</hi> had not sufficient Forces, and consequently that he durst not adventure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. The noise of this Siege slew abroad into all Countries, and the <hi>Associates</hi> mightily comforted themselves, that some considerable Feats would be done on their part, which they hoped would force <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieno</hi> to recal many of his Forces out of <hi>Inferiana,</hi> by which means they might become an <hi>equal,</hi> if not an <hi>over-match</hi> for those which should be left. But the foolish <hi>Vtopians</hi> were so taken and besotted with this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55462:41"/>
small Prank, that therewith they more than balanced all their Losses in <hi>Inferiiana,</hi> and elsewhere, and conffdently reported <hi>Pineria</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, before any direct Assault was made upon it; and these <hi>Whimsies,</hi> and <hi>Conceits,</hi> working in their <hi>giddy Brains,</hi> they magnified the rash Youncker <hi>Subaudiero,</hi> as if <hi>Orlando Furioso,</hi> or <hi>Garagantua</hi> had been meer <hi>Weaklings,</hi> and <hi>Pygmies</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>All this time the wily Giant <hi>Sabaudecrato</hi> lay lurking up and down in secret and safe Retreats, as well to conceal, and augment the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Army, as to give Encouragement to the unadvised <hi>Associates,</hi> to fatigue, and breake their Forces against a strong and resolute Garrison; but he no sooner had tidings that <hi>Pine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ia</hi> was really in danger, but he fliely fell down to the relief of it, before they were well aware. His unexpected coming, somewhat allarmed them all, and various were their Opinions of it; some concluded him rash and unadvised, who had been hitherto thought cunning; some said he was a crafty Fellow, and that they ought to beware of him, but these were despised, and branded as <hi>Cowards</hi>; some said it was only a <hi>sham,</hi> or <hi>bravado,</hi> and that he would as quickly be gone again; but a Counsel of War being called, after a short debate (they never making the least question of their superiority in number, and force, nor staying for any Intelligence to know how strong he was) it was unanimously resolved to break up the Seige for the present, and go to meet him, concluding, that if they could fight him, and beat him out of the Field, then the Garrisons, and strong holds having no hopes of Relief, would more easily submit to them: But in the mean time they never thought what the danger might be on their part, in case they were beaten, for they would not spoil their <hi>fine Thoughts</hi> with such a <hi>melancholly Conceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Associates</hi> drunk with assurance of Victory, if they could but find their Enemy, march'd away with all the briskness and jollity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but far they had not gone, when contrary to their Expectation he appeared in Sight; for he was as ready for them, as they for him: And now they too late perceived their Errour, for they might plainly see that he was equal, if not Superiour to them in number of Men: But however, their Souldiers being <hi>well disciplin'd,</hi> and of late somewhat <hi>flushed,</hi> and <hi>eager,</hi> they presumed of the advantage in the <hi>Stoutness</hi> and <hi>Valour</hi> of their Men, and therefore resolved to give Battle; nor did <hi>Sabaudocrato</hi> at all decline it. Both sides seeming thus eagerly bent upon it, the Generals drew up their Forces in Battle-Array, in a large Plain, where all advantages for Ground, Numbers, and all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (except Brains) were so equal on both sides, that there was likely
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55462:41"/>
to be as fair a Tryal of Skill, as had been known in many Ages. The on set was fierce on both sides and for sometime it seem'd doubtful, which way the victory would incline: After some time the Left wing of <hi>Sobaudocrato</hi> made the Right Wing of <hi>Sabaudiero,</hi> where the <hi>Altia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were, to give way: but to make amends for that, the Left Wing of <hi>Sabaudiero,</hi> where the <hi>Iberians,</hi> and <hi>Regomanian</hi> were, made the Right Wing of <hi>Sabaudocrato</hi> to go back in some disorder, so that still there seem'd to be no great odds; but <hi>Sabaudocrato</hi> wisely foreseeing the Danger, and knowing where his Battle was weakest, had so post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good Knight <hi>Prioro,</hi> that he might in time of need come to their Succour, which he did just in the nick of time, and thus re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing, and rallying them again, the <hi>Ibe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But still to increase their Sorrow and Shame, Misfortunes and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Losses attended them in all places; the great <hi>Allemano-Mastix,</hi> had been a sore scourge to them upon the flood <hi>Rhenusia</hi>; but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and (if possible) drive him away, they had sent the puissant Knight <hi>Rabadenero,</hi> who was a villanous <hi>Fighting Fellow,</hi> and had done <hi>Wonders</hi> against the <hi>Half-Moon</hi>; but he finding that the Scene was alter'd, when he came against the brave <hi>Luyslander,</hi> posted himself securely, and would by no means be drawn to sight, for which, many commend his Wisdom (of which he had scarce ever before given any Testimony) for that he was inferiour in number, and had to do with equally disciplin'd Men, <hi>Allemano-Mastix,</hi> covetous of Glory, had an aching Tooth to try what this mighty Man at Arms could do, and would sometimes make him fair offers, sometimes ravage his Country before his Face, and was always by one means or other provoking, or tempting him to Battle, but <hi>Rabadenero</hi> would by no means be drawn to run the hazard.</p>
            <p>Whilst the eager <hi>Luyslander</hi> was working his Brains to compass his design, it came into his Head that there was a fair City hight <hi>Necariana,</hi> Dedicated to the God <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which God, the <hi>Regomanians</hi> adore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, for that he was both a <hi>Stout Fighter,</hi> and a <hi>Good-Fellow</hi>; in this City the <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> or Feasts of their beloved God were kept, in which there was no great store <hi>Victuals,</hi> but a World of <hi>Drink</hi>; and to that end and purpose, a vast Vessel was <hi>made,</hi> or rather <hi>built,</hi> at the publick Charge, which might contain Wine enough to serve all the Comers to the Feast, from all Quarters; this Vessel was in all those parts known by the name of <hi>Decumandolium Necarianum</hi>; and upon the Front, or head thereof, was written in Letters of Gold, this Motto, </p>
            <l>EX LVXET POCVLA SACRA</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55462:42"/>For this, or the like Reason, I suppose, that when they were mellow with their Festival Cups, their dull Souls were enlightned, or their Eyes saw double, which they took to be a great advantage, and therefore hated Sobriety, because it always bereav'd them of half the Goods they had, or which at least they thought they had, whilst their Brains swam in Liquor. <hi>Allemano-Mastix</hi> concluded with himself, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer this <hi>Sacred Place,</hi> and the <hi>Consecrated Vessel</hi> to be taken, but would rather fight it desperately at any disadvantage; and therefore to draw them to a Battle (for otherwise he valued not the place) he went and Besieged <hi>Necariana,</hi> giving out, that if he took it, he would break the <hi>Decumandolium</hi> all to pieces, so that they should not be able to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Feast of their <hi>darling</hi> God <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The noise of this Siege presently slew through all <hi>Regomania,</hi> and all Persons were mightily concerned for their <hi>Holy City,</hi> and impatiently urged <hi>Rabadenero</hi> to relieve it; but he knowing his own want of Forces, and with whom he had to do, could not be prevail'd on; but that he might let them see it was not his fault, he earnestly sollicited all Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, for Supplies, but they came so slowly, that it had been to as much purpose, if they had not come at all; for a great part of the Inhabitants fled away at first, carrying their Riches along with them, and though many stayed, and a great number of Souldiers were put in to defend it, yet they drank so plentifully of the <hi>Sacred Liquor,</hi> out of the <hi>mighty Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> that they had little mind to defend their Works, but easily quitted them upon every Attempt and in the end, suffer'd the City to be taken by Storm, making either none, or a very mean defence, whereupon, the <hi>Luyslanders</hi> committed <hi>great Slaughter,</hi> (as is always done, where a Place is taken by Assault) got <hi>great Riches,</hi> and broke the <hi>huge Vessel,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanly letting all the <hi>Sacred Liquor</hi> run about; there were some few who fled into the Castle, but being threatned with an Assault, they submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon easy terms, and thus <hi>Allemano-Mastix</hi> became wholly Master of the place, to dispose of at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Regomanians</hi> were enrag'd at the taking their <hi>Holy City,</hi> and the affront offer'd to the God <hi>Bacchus</hi>; and <hi>Rabadenero</hi> being now reinforc'd with his late Supplies, resolv'd to give Battle to <hi>Allemano Mastix,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge this Injury. But he led them a wild-goose Chase, while they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed stamping, and swearing, and knew not where to find; and yet durst not march very fast, lest they should fall into some of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscades, and so make the matter still worse, for they were as afraid of his <hi>Craft,</hi> as they were of his <hi>Valour</hi>; and thus both Parties standing on their Guard, and seeking their advantage, they were both too wary to do
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55462:43"/>
any thing further; and therefore we will now leave them playing at Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peep, and return to great Giant <hi>Grandorsio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Matters stood thus with the <hi>Associates,</hi> and their Heads and Hearts were full of Troubles, the restless Giant <hi>Grandorsio</hi> was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how he might further distress, and vex them; and vvell remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that he had been much annoyed by a strong Enchanted Fort, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Caroloregium</hi> he thought this his time to be revenged of it, and well knowing that none now durst appear to interrupt him, or were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hinder his Design, he marched thither, and sat down before it. The nevvs of this bold Attempt made the <hi>Associates</hi> at their  Wits end, and though they could do nothing, yet to set as good a Face on the matter as might be, they met to consult what to do; <hi>Nasonius,</hi> who was always forward, and though <hi>Bashful</hi> in the Face of an Enemy, yet bold as any whatsoever, when they were far enough off, made this Proposal, That he might gather together all the scattered Forces, and drain all that could be spared out of Garrisons, and go and raise the Siege: They replied, that they were not at present, able to bring such a considerable force into the Field, as might venture to encounter <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorsio,</hi> and a miscarriage in the Attempt might be the loss of their other Garrisons. <hi>Nosonius</hi> insisted upon it as his <hi>Priviledge</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi> that no Town ought to be taken, but that he with an Army ought to <hi>stand, and look on,</hi> or at least be <hi>within hearing.</hi> Answer was made, that he had forfeited that Priviledge, by not being present at the taking of <hi>Huana,</hi> when he had an Army, and might have been there, and looked on his <hi>Belly full,</hi> if he durst. Great wrangling there was, and many things were argued to and fro, but in the end it was very gravely concluded, that it was not safe for them to attempt any thing, but they would trust to the strength of the Place, and leave <hi>Grandorsio</hi> to do what he could, whom in the bitterness of their Soul, they bloodily cursed, whilst he, like the Fox, fared the better for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caroloregium,</hi> was a Place strong, both by Nature and Art, it seemed to be Dedicated to <hi>Mars,</hi> as thriving best in the time of <hi>War,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving few Inhabitants besides Souldiers; it was not easily to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, as being Scituate at the meeting of two Rivers; and in the open part, in a great measure guarded by a wonderful <hi>Enchanted Pond, or Lake</hi>; many mighty <hi>Spells</hi> had been formerly set upon it by the great Necromancer, <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and the haughty <hi>Don Ibero Formalitoso,</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no small value upon it, had put in the choicest of his Souldiers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, and commanded all his Conjurers to use their utmost Skill to strengthen it against all attacks, so that by many it was thought impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55462:43"/>
But all this could not discourage the hardy and daring <hi>Grandorsio</hi> from his Undertaking; yet in pursuing his Design, he met with many difficulties, and was longer held in play, than some, who thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wise, layed wagers he would. When his Men drew near the Lake, strange and terrible <hi>Flashes</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> would rise out of the Water, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably <hi>Scorch</hi> and <hi>Burn</hi> them, when they endeavoured to fill it up with Billets, either the flashing Fires in a Moment consumed them, or the Lake swallowed them up, so that they thought it had no bottom. <hi>Grandorsio</hi> being thus at a loss, sent to his old Friend, that <hi>Devil</hi> of a <hi>Conjurer, Archimedes,</hi> who, by the Messenger, sent him this Answer, that he should mind his Batteries, and his Bombs, but not trouble himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lake, nor any way concern himself as to it, for he would take Care of that in a very short time, to his Satisfaction, that he should be able to walk over it dry-shod. Having received this Answer, he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more pains that way, but with his Batteries and his Bombs, so pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Town, that he scarce gave the Besieged any Rest; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, they were not wanting to themselves, but returned Cannon for Cannon, and with continual Firing, gaul'd, or cut off the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, and as opportunity served, made sudden Sallies and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Works, as well as Persons of the the Besiegers. <hi>Grandorsio</hi> seeing their Resolution, and knowing that none could appear in the Field to disturb him, made slower approaches, and with greater safety to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Men: But in the end, with his <hi>Flying Fireballs,</hi> he so burnt the Town, that it was little but a <hi>heap of Ruines,</hi> and the Besieged were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to secure themselves by retiring into certain <hi>Enchanted Cells,</hi> made by Magick Art, adjoining to their Walls and Fortifications; and to their farther grief, the roaring Cannon had frighted a part of their Wall, so that there appeared a Breach, whereat several Souldiers at a time might enter. While <hi>Grandorsio</hi> was about this Work, the Conjurer <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> was not idle, or forgetful of his Promise, for being one of general Acquaintance, and having dealings with all sorts of Devils, he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain Subterranean Spirits, who made such Cavities and Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances under ground, that suddenly, to the amazement both of Besiged, and Besiegers, the <hi>Pond</hi> or <hi>Lake</hi> appeared dry. Nevertheless, the Besieg'd still seem'd obstinate, and all their Charms and Conjurations did not yet fail them; for violent <hi>Flashes</hi> of <hi>Lightning,</hi> and certain <hi>Fiery Spirits</hi> seemed to guard the <hi>Breach,</hi> that none could enter; but in the end, their Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es being daily made wider, the way to them laid plain and open, and there being no hopes of relief, they Capitulated, to whom, <hi>Grandorsio</hi> granted very honourable Conditions, which being accepted, and sign'd
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55462:44"/>
on both sides, they marched forth, carrying the unwelcome News to the Duke of <hi>Bawwawia,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Associates,</hi> and <hi>Grandorsio</hi> put in what Forces he thought fit, employing many to remove the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, rebuild the destroyed Habitations, and repair all damage done to the Fortifications, in which work he sent to <hi>Archimedes</hi> for his Direction and Assistance, so that in a short time he made it stronger than it was before.</p>
            <p>It is to be observed, that, contrary to the relation of all Histories, and all Countries known to us, that the <hi>Giants</hi> in these Countries generally beat the <hi>Knights,</hi> and that the <hi>Giants</hi> are courteous, sweet-humour'd, and chearfully undertake the Protection and Relief of <hi>wronged Ladies,</hi> and all <hi>distressed Persons,</hi> but the <hi>Knights,</hi> except some few, are proud, surly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, and set upon mischief. Such difference is there in the <hi>unknown</hi> parts of the World from the <hi>known.</hi> But to return to our Business, it is doubtful whether the taking this strong-hold caused greater Joy in <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telia,</hi> or grief of Heart at <hi>Sennopolis.</hi> The <hi>Associates</hi> having gotten no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing all this Campaign, but <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Confusion,</hi> hung their Heads, and knew not how to look on each other; their only Comfort was, that the Season of the Year for Action being past, <hi>Grandorsio</hi> had dispersed his Forces into their Winter-Quarters, and was gone to the mighty <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> to give him an account of all Transactions, and consult what was to be done for the future; whereupon, the <hi>Associates</hi> met at <hi>Sennopolis,</hi> and held serious Consultation how they might repair their broken Fortunes. Some said, that their <hi>Moneys</hi> were spent, their <hi>Souldiers</hi> Slain, their <hi>Towns</hi> taken, and that if <hi>Sabaudiero</hi> made a Peace, they were all undone, and that therefore it behoved them to take Care of themselves: At this <hi>Nasonius</hi> rose up in a Rage, asking if they intended to betray him, who had fed them with such Sums of Money as they had never before seen, and urged their Promises, and solemn Oaths, that no Peace should be made without his Consent. It was replied, that he himself upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, never stood upon such <hi>Formalities,</hi> and therefore it was unreasonable for him to press any such thing upon them, unless he could produce his <hi>Charter of Priviledge, that he alone was not to be bound by any Promises or Oaths. Nasonius</hi> smelt that their design was to get more Money, and therefore in a calmer Stile, answered thus: 

<q rend="margQuotes">That it would be an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Shame to give over thus, that there was no want of Men, which they could raise abundantly, and that he had made so many <hi>Beggars</hi> in <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topia,</hi> that he did not question, but that in a short time he should out of them raise a <hi>formidable Army,</hi> and that if Money was wanting, they should be supplied to their Hearts desire, for <hi>Vtopia</hi> was not yet above half drained, and he was resolved not to leave <hi>one Penny</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55462:44"/>
rather than any <hi>Associate</hi> should want; and that at present to secure <hi>Sabaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero,</hi> he would send him more Money than his barren Dukedom ever afforded him, and make him think himself the <hi>Richer</hi> for his <hi>Loss.</hi>
               </q>

At these Golden Promises they began all to prick up their Ears, and talk complyingly; and so, some Pittance at present being distributed among them, and an agreement made, what share he would afford to every one, they came to a Resolution, that they would all raise more than their former <hi>Quota</hi>'s, and try their Fortune<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the next Year with greater Forces and Courage than ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nasonius</hi> could scarce sleep for thinking what large Promises he had made, which it was not possible he should perform, unless he could most shamefully gull the <hi>Vtopians</hi> out of their Money, of which he was somewhat doubtful at this time, because by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his great Losses, and ill Conduct, he must return to them under some kind of Disgrace but that he might consult what to do, he repaired to <hi>Holoo,</hi> where he found his damn'd Mistress, <hi>Ambitiosa,</hi> newly returned from the Revels at the <hi>Plutonick Court.</hi> To her he made a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>lamentable</hi> Complaint of his <hi>Misfortunes,</hi> expostulating with her, why she had deserted him at such time; as he most needed her Advice and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. Quoth she, There are certain <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> (unknown to you) which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensably required my Presence there; but withal, she told him, that his Misfortunes befel him through his own Rashness, and Inconsiderateness, in that he had not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Counsel; but (said she) if you will yet follow my Advice, I will do all I can for you. This somewhat cheared his Spirits, and after a seeming passionate Salute, he intreated her to open her Mind. 

She bade him to make haste to <hi>Vtopia,</hi> without any the least Fear: 

<q rend="margQuotes">for said she, I have sent before you, <hi>Fictitiosa,</hi> and <hi>Fatuitosa,</hi> and before you can possibly get thither, the one will have framed so many Lies in your behalf, and the other made them believed, that when you come, you shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Ringing of Bells, roaring of Cannons, making of Bonfires, and all the Windows of their Houses set with glaring Farthing Candles, as if they were all in a Flame, so that you shall return in such a <hi>Triumph,</hi> as the most Famous <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> never knew or heard of. But when you come thither, above all take care to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress the <hi>Bethlehmites</hi> of <hi>Dom. Com.</hi> give them Offices, Places of Profit, large Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, larger Promises, stick at nothing: I have prevailed with <hi>Mammoneta</hi> and <hi>Fatui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosa</hi> so to bewitch them, that they shall not only afford you Supplies beyond your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, but contrive such Tricks, and find out such <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>means,</hi> as shall make all the <hi>Moneys</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> run into your <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
               </q>

               <hi>Nasonius</hi> overjoy'd with these Promises and Prognosticks, after a plentiful return of Thanks, in the kindest Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions his sowr Nature could squeeze forth, took his formal leave, earnestly begging that she would not be long after him, to advise and assist him in any difficulties, that might arise, and then in all haste departed for <hi>Vtopia,</hi> to put her advice in Practice.</p>
            <p>What is to ensue, History cannot at present inform us, it belonging to Astrology, or rather, it being wrapt up in the Shady Leaves of Destiny. To prejudge of which (leaving the Foppish Almanack-Makers to <hi>fool</hi> weak People with their silly Predictions from the Stars) we may frame a more solid Prognostick from the immense Riches, vast Power, and highest Wisdom of King <hi>Gallieno</hi>: The former of which can never be exhausted by the Wars, whilst the multitudes of Ships he has taken from the <hi>Vtopians,</hi> (reckoned to be above Two Thousand Five Hundred, since the War began; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps near as many from the <hi>Hydra,</hi> and the great Contributions he raises upon his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Countries) bring him in such huge supplies, besides his own vast Revenues. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from his Power, which encreases daily, He having raised for the next Year, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Sixty Thousand Souldiers, besides Recruits, and knowing <hi>how to use</hi> the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

he still obtains, as well <hi>as how to get them.</hi> And lastly, from his Wisdom which lays all his Designs in the best Methods, out of a true and exact a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all that his Enemies can do; His intelligence of what they aim at, and his proportioning the Causes, he lays to the effects he intends, in comparison of which; the best Policy of the <hi>Associates</hi> is meerly Childishness: Every Man of good Sence, being able to discern that their Projects are laid in no steady Tennent and carried on disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and distractedly; as if they proceeded from Men meerly awaked out of their Sleep, or half frighted out of their Wits by the Surprizes he gives them.
