            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN it was but noyſed abroad, after my returne from my laſt impriſonment, <hi>that I was writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Independency,</hi> it would exceed beliefe if. I ſhould relate the indignation of all that party, and their ſeverall expreſſions of the ſame againſt me, ſo that at that time there were no leſſe nor fewer ignominious calumnies caſt upon mee, nor more variety of viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent cenſures given out againſt me, then were uttered by them all to my diſparagement, upon the late comming forth, but of the Title and Frontiſpice of the enſuing Diſcourſe, many of them affirming, <hi>that I was a vaine glorious wicked fellow, that I was mad, that I was a baſe rogue, and that I deſerved hanging, and that I would never be quiet till I were hanged,</hi> with innumerable other unchriſtian expreſſion of like nature. So that it ſeems, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>piaculum</hi> by farre now to write againſt the Independents and Sectaries then <hi>ſcandalum magnatum</hi> was a few yeares ſince.</p>
            <p>Truly at that time, I could ſcarce paſſe by any of them (as I cannot at this day) without ſome contumely or other, all which I beare with patience. And amongſt others, I could never meet my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> but he would alwayes after his ſalutation, in a deriding and ſcornefull manner, aske me, <hi>when my Book came forth,</hi> telling me <hi>that he expected ſome Monſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeemes, he thought I was bringing forth ſuch a prodigious brat as he not long after laid at my doore, which though it were a Monſter indeed borne with teeth and nayles, and did nothing but ſcratch and bite me, yet comming from his loynes my Brother
<pb facs="tcp:48122:9"/>
and quondam Fellow-ſufferer, I gave it entertainment, and for the love I beare to him, I have ever ſince danled it upon the knee of my election: Now as ſoone as I had ſatisfied his expectation, and ſent him my Booke ſo long looked for, he very liberally expreſſed his thankes for it, and his opinion concerning both it and my ſelfe, and that with many opprobrious words; amidſt others he aſſerted, <hi>I was craſed in my braine, and that I had need of ſome hellebore,</hi> and ſpake of me <hi>as an Apoſtate and a Perſecutor,</hi> who before he new my differing opinion from him, both prayed for me, and immoderately prayſed me, ſuch is the uncertainty of all that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne, there being no ſtability in any creature; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>hee triumphed that he would give me a ſpeedy anſwer,</hi> making nothing of what I had written (as it is uſuall with all the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents to vilipend and ſlight whatſoever the Presbyterians ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake or write) and meeting with an other Independent not many dayes after, he told me <hi>that there were twenty pens at worke againſt me, and that I ſhould have my hands full.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was ſome moneths before I heard from any of them in print, yet all that <hi>interim</hi> they <hi>whetted their tongues againſt me like ſo many Razors, Swords and Arrows to wound me in my reputation;</hi> yea, there was ſcarce a weapon in all the <hi>arſenall</hi> of calumny that they uſed not againſt me.</p>
            <p>Now after ſome moneths one <hi>Hanſerdo Knollys</hi> comming to me, told me <hi>he had writ a moderate Anſwer unto my Booke,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning <hi>that the Preſſes were all ſhut againſt them</hi> (though the whole Kingdome know, and their daily ſcriblings in print can witneſſe the contrary; whereupon, to take away (if it were poſſible) all occaſion of their calumnious tongues, I writ unto Reverend and Learned Maſter <hi>Cranford,</hi> intreating him <hi>that hee would for the ſtopping of all their mouths licenſe his Booke,</hi> which he willingly, to pleaſure me condeſcended unto, <hi>giving his reaſon withall in writing under his owne hand why he made ſuch a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> the which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> concealed, <hi>wherein he dealt not candidly,</hi> for it gave great occaſion to the Sectaries to traduce Maſter <hi>Cranford</hi> not a little. And after this was printed, came forth an other Pamphlet by one <hi>I. S.</hi> called <hi>Flagellum Flagolli,</hi> or Doctor <hi>Baſtwicks quarters beaten up,</hi> which was the cauſe of the Title and Inſcription of this Booke; and I being not many weeks after at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> ſome asking me there <hi>why I had not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:9"/>
               <hi>unto them,</hi> I anſwered not in a triumphing manner (as my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> relateth) but merrily, yet in reſpectful terms, <hi>that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood my Brother</hi> Burtons <hi>Booke was comming forth againſt me, and when once that appeared I would anſwer them altogether.</hi> This is all as I remember was ſpake by me.</p>
            <p>Now they having their Emiſſaries and Liſners in all corners, it ſeemes ſome of them over-heard that which was ſpoken by me, which they related to my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> in other language then I uttered it, the which provoked him a freſh (as he ſaith, page 1.) <hi>in ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:48122:10"/>
purpoſe. Now <hi>I</hi> ſhall referre theſe two Queſtions or Queries to the judgement of all ſolid Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether or no my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> be found in the way of Righteouſneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether Independency be the way of Righteouſneſſe?</p>
            <p>And to begin with the firſt; in the ſecond page of his Booke he promiſeth me, <hi>that I ſhall not find with him ſo much as a white staffe to lift up against me,</hi> and yet in the ſeventh pag. he comes out againſt me with <hi>Phocions black Hatchet,</hi> which is his Pole-axe, with which he fals upon me ſoule and body, cleaving both my head and heart, ſparing no part of me; and in the ſame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond page he promiſeth me that he will anſwer me <hi>in the words of truth and ſoberneſſe, and in the ſpirit of meekneſſe and love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are his words; who would not thinke, that ſhould heare him ſpeak, but that he herad the ſweet voice of <hi>Iacob?</hi> yet if hee looke but into his Booke, before he commeth halfe way to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, he will ſoone ſee the rough hands of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and well perceive that he anſwers me in the words of error and paſsion; and in the ſpirit of bitterneſſe, inſolency, and hatred, and that he hath learned that Leſſon well <hi>Calumniare audacter, aliquid haerebit, calumniate boldly, ſomething will ſticke,</hi> which he hath done with as much acrimony, as I thinke any man ever did againſt <hi>a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and quondam Fellow-ſufferer,</hi> all which <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>hard and harſh termes; I</hi> can no leſſe then ſpread before the Lord, the Righteous judge ever remembring <hi>Regium est male audire cum bene feceris.</hi> Now whether or no my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> in breaking thus his promiſe with me in all reſpects, and dealing ſo unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and injuriouſly with mee, though he come out in his beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Gray Head, be found in the way of Righteouſneſſe, and be one of thoſe men <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of, I referre it to the judgement of the Learned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But before I paſſe on to my ſecond Querie,</hi> I <hi>ſhall take liberty to make uſe of ſome of Reverend and Learned Maſter</hi> Calamies <hi>words for the more corroborating the judgement of the Reader concerning this firſt queſtion: He in</hi> his just and neceſſary Apology against my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> unjuct invective concerning Truth ſhut out of doores, page <hi>2. hath this expreſsion concerning my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Burton. His words <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> are ſwords and ſpeares, rather then words. Hee fights with his heeles, rather then with his head,
<pb facs="tcp:48122:10"/>
and kicks rather then argues, and whips rather then anſwers. Scarce any man ſince <hi>Montagues</hi> Appeal hath written with more bitterneſs. I may ſay of him as Dr <hi>Rivet</hi> doth of Biſhop <hi>Montague, Non poteſt vir ille ſine convitiis quenquam a quo diſſentit vel in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſsimis nominare,</hi> Rivet. Apol. this man cannot ſo much as mention any one from whom he differs in opinion, though it be but in the ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt matters, without reproach. And as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid to <hi>Diogenes,</hi> when hee trode upon the pride of <hi>Plato,</hi> thou treadeſt upon my pride with a greater pride: So <hi>(ſaith Maſter</hi> Calamy) doth Mr <hi>Burton</hi> tread upon me, and whatſoever is blame-worthy in me, with a pride more then epiſcopall; and ſurely if to be railed upon and reviled be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring a man into diſcredit, then I muſt be eſteemed as the dung, off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſcouring, and filth of the world, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus that learned man truly ſpake of my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> whoſe faculty chiefly lies in abuſing moſt men that differ from him, though but in the leaſt things.</p>
            <p>But what Mr <hi>Calamy</hi> ſays of him, may alſo truly be ſaid of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis</hi> and all thoſe of that fraternity, <hi>whoſe words are ſwords and spears, who all fight rather with their heels, then with their heads, and kick rather then argue, and whip rather then anſwer.</hi> Whether therfore ſuch men as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices, though they come to us in gray heads, <hi>be found in the way of righteouſneſſe,</hi> when their dealings are ſo palpably unjuſt, and their opinions ſo ſchiſmaticall, hereticall and erroneous, I leave it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all ſuch as know what the way of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now I come to my ſecond quaerie:</hi> viz. Whether the way of Independency be the way of righteouſneſſe?</p>
            <p>My brother <hi>Burton</hi> writing in the name of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, pretends unto the people, and would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, <hi>that they are all Dependent upon Gods Word for all their proceedings,</hi> and affirmes moreover in the fifth page, <hi>that all their new gathered Churches and ſeverall Congregations are all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent one upon another,</hi> both which aſſertions of his are moſt falſe, as will evidently appear to all thoſe that know their practices and will vouchſafe but to read the inſuing diſcourſe, where they ſhall find, <hi>that they have neither precept nor preſident for their way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency in all Gods holy Word, and that there is not ſo much as one example in all the ſacred Scriptures for any of their new practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein they differ from us;</hi> and which is more <hi>that they all of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:11"/>
               <hi>them withhold the truth from the people in unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> How then can the way of Independency bee the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when it is a deviation from that way, as by their practices will be evidenced; therefore for the confirmation of what I have now ſaid, <hi>I</hi> will briefly examine ſome of their proceedings, and firſt whereas my brother <hi>Burton</hi> affirmeth <hi>that all their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are Dependent one upon another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſay is moſt falſe. For all their proceedings in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall congregations are carryed on in an arbitrary way; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they publiſh in their writings and pretend to the people (as all the learned and thoſe that are acquainted with their method well know); So that it lies in any one of their Churches breaſts, and is at their pleaſure, whether they will ſo much as confer or conſult with each other; and if they do at any time vouchſafe one another that courteſie, yet it is ſtil voluntary whether they will give each other an account of either their cenſures or proceedings (for they all pretend as abſolute a ſoveraignty and juriſdiction within themſelvs ſeverally as any free-ſtates or common-wealths) &amp; have no authority one over another, neither can they appeal for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe if wronged, one to or from another: And if any Member in any one of thoſe Churches, or any one of thoſe Churches divided amongſt themſelvs, or upon ſome eminent received wrong ſhould fondly complain to another neighbour Church, that Church hath no power to relieve them no more then one private man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve another if he ſhould be appealed to by another; And if that Church ſhould deſire an account of the other Churches procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that Church may refuſe it, if it pleaſe them. But if to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their deſire, that Church ſhould vouchſafe to condeſcend ſo far unto the other Church, as to give them a reaſon of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; all this is but <hi>gratis,</hi> and out of their good nature; they have ſtill no power to call that Church in queſtion that hath done the wrong, if that Church ſtands upon its points and priviledges, and ſaith <hi>that they have nothing to do with them.</hi> And what then is to be done in this caſe? Then forſooth, <hi>they will withdraw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from that Church, which,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is the higheſt cenſure any one Church can proceed to againſt another Church.</hi> Is not this, I pray, fine Dependency? What more unrighteous dealing can be found in the world then this of the Independents, <hi>to profeſſe themſelves Independents, and yet to pretend a Dependency?</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:48122:11"/>
when that comes to the tryall, <hi>they have no more reall Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy one upon another, then we have with them?</hi> Yea, what a great unrighteouſneſſe is this to pretend a Dependency one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a communion amongſt their new gathered Churches, when it is well known <hi>there is no more union and communion, nor true friendſhip amongst them then was between Herod and Pilate,</hi> they refuſing the right hand of fellowſhip each to other in many of them? Yea they are deadly enemies one to another, as can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be proved (although they all agree together to perſecute the Presbyterians, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did well accord to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Chriſt); For I my ſelfe have heard the Independents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt the Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, and See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and many other of the new fraternities, proclaming them all Sectaries: And on the other ſide, I have heard thoſe ſeverall ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties rail againſt all the Independents, eſpecially thoſe <hi>Homothu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madon</hi> diſſenting brethren in the reverend Aſſembly, ſaying, <hi>that they had a better and a more charitable eſteem of any of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſters then of them, and they do unanimouſly accuſe all the Miniſters of New</hi>-England <hi>of as great tyranny as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:</hi> And it is well known, that many of the Independent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations here amongſt us have their different laws and cuſtoms, every one of them diſſenting more or leſſe from each other in their ſeverall new gathered Churches; yea they are ignorant of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers practices: For my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> know not <hi>that the women in ſome of their congregations have their voices there;</hi> and yet it can be proved, <hi>that they alſo have Peters keyes at their girdles as well as any of their Preſbyters:</hi> And therefore their new Churches <hi>are not Dependent one upon another,</hi> as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> aſſerteth Page the fifth, when as they all of them exerciſe an abſolute ſoveraignty amongſt themſelves Independent: What unrighteouſneſſe then is this in my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and in all the Independents to affirme <hi>that in all their Churches there is a Dependent Independency, or an Independent Dependency,</hi> which is but a contradictory bull at beſt, at the baiting whereof a man, if he regarded not miſpending his time, might make far better ſport, then he did ſome years ſince, in baiting the Popes Bull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The truth is, as their Religion is but a meer Babell, ſo all their language is confounded, and they are divided in their opinions,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:12"/>
               <hi>principles and practices, they being all really Independent: And therefore</hi> whether the way of Independency be the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where they are ſo unrighteous in all their proceedings, and when they ſay one thing and do and practice another, and when they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the truth from the people in unrighteouſneſſe, as all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Predicants do, <hi>I refer it to the wiſdome and judgement of the godly and conſciencious Reader. But the unrighteouſneſſe of their way will yet more perſpicuouſly appear if we but look into ſome other of their practices, which I ſhall by and by inſtance, the very conſideration of the which (the better to ſtirr up thy attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) makes me boldly to conclude of them all,</hi> That whatſoever they pretend and whatſoever ſhews of ſeeming holineſſe they hold out to the world, they are unſound, root and branch; and neither the godly party, nor the praying people, nor the only Saints, but the moſt phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall brood that ever yet appeared in the world, and more injurious to Chriſt the King of his Church and to his royalty, and to all his holy, faithfull Miniſters and Servants, then ever the Pope or any of the Prelaticall party were, and more malicious and treacherous to the Saints, and truly godly and precious ones, and more oppoſers of all Reformation, then ever the Cavaliers were; and many of them greater enemies to Church and State, and the welfare of both, then either Strafford or the Prelate of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the Independent government, as it is moſt certain it hath neither precept nor preſident for it in all Gods holy Word, ſo it is far more tyrannicall and lordly then that of the Pope or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <hi>tending to nothing but an Anarchy and confuſion in Church and State:</hi> And therefore that they with all their trumperies and deſperate practices, with all their unrighteous dealing, ought to be abhorred and abominated, whatſoever ſeeming ſanctimony they make ſhew of, by all ſuch as truly fear God and wiſh the peace of Zion and the good of the State and Kingdomes in which they live.</p>
            <p>Now they that have a deſire to ſee this charg made good againſt them, ſhall find it with the whole impeachment fully proved and made evident in the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>But in the interim it will not be amiſſe to produce ſome few inſtances more of their practices <hi>for the proving of their Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency not to be the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a man but look upon their ſuperlative pride, eſpecially the
<pb facs="tcp:48122:12"/>
conceit they all of them have of their own holineſſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity we ſhall find that it exceeds that of the very Scribes and Phariſees, for all the Independents and Sectaries ſtile themſelves <hi>the holy people, the godly party, the praying people, the generation of the just, the Saints;</hi> yea eſteeming the very retrimentitious part of them (to ſpeak in their own dialect) Saints, calling their moſt blaſphemous opinions and practices, <hi>the infirmities of the Saints,</hi> in the mean time excluding the moſt godly Presbyterians from thoſe titles, <hi>calling them the Antichriſtian brood, the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt and his Kingdome, the ſons of Beliall, and what not?</hi> all which dealing with their brethren is not the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: yea in their very prayers to God, they like the Phariſees boaſt of their own knowledge, ſlighting and vilifying all their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian brethren, diſdaining ſo much as to pray for them; yea in their publike Aſſemblies, and in their publike prayers they have been heard contemptuouſly to ſpeak of thoſe in authority aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that they were not worthy of the prayers of the Saints, and it is well known that many of them will neither publickly nor privately joyn with their Presbyterian brethren in any duty of piety accounting them all as an Antichriſtian and unſanctified ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men, and all this out of a ſtrong and confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of their own holineſs &amp; out of an uncharitable opinion of their brethrens impurity, then the which ſtrain of pride, the very Phariſees never exerciſed a greater; all which practices of theirs ſufficiently declare, <hi>that the way of Independency is not the way of righteouſneſſe:</hi> for greater unrighteouſneſſe there cannot be then this, as will by and by appear.</p>
            <p>But I will now come to ſome inſtances.</p>
            <p>Not long ſince at a great entertainment and feſtivity on the Lords day, when they were all met together, one of the <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumadon</hi> brethren, a great man amongſt them, beginning the duty of the day, in his Prayer before his Sermon, ſpeaking unto God by way of complaint againſt the Presbyterians, ſaid unto Him with many tears, <hi>Lord, they</hi> (meaning the Presbyterians) <hi>hate us becauſe we know more of thee then they do; but we beſeech thee Lord give us ſtill to know more of thee, and let them hate us more, if they will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before <hi>I</hi> come to ſpeak of this their prayer, and of ſome other paſſages of their other good prayers, I ſhall take the liberty
<pb facs="tcp:48122:13"/>
here to ſay ſomething of the difference between theſe mens practices, and the old Puritans of ENGLAND; and ſo much the rather <hi>I</hi> do it, becauſe they would perſwade the world that there is little difference between them and the old Puritans; yea one of their Itinerary Predicants not long ſince preaching in a publike Aſſembly, affirmed that there was no other difference between the Independents at this day and the old Puritans of ENGLAND but that the Independents were over-grown Puritans; which <hi>I</hi> conceive, he meant in this ſenſe, that the Independents outſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them in all duties of piety and charity, and in all comely, ſeemly, orderly, and temperate walking in an unblameable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation before God and men: This, <hi>I</hi> ſay, <hi>I</hi> conceive to be his meaning by the word <hi>overgrown:</hi> for <hi>I</hi> would not willingly put a worſe interpretation upon his expreſſion, and underſtand by <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown,</hi> that he meant they were become monſtrous (Which notwithſtanding too too many of them are); therefore if his words be taken in the better ſenſe, by <hi>overgrown</hi> he underſtands <hi>that the Independents have attained unto a higher degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then ever the old Puritans had attained unto, and that they now walke more cloſely in the way of righteouſneſſe then ever they did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will firſt therefore ſet down ſome of the practices of the old Puritans, with the paths and wayes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they walked in, omitting many things for brevity ſake though worthy of eternall memory and our everlaſting imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For the old Puritants of ENGLAND, as thoſe that have read their writings and knew their practices and were familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, they can teſtifie of them, <hi>that they were an humble, ſelf-denying people, ever groaning under that burden of the remnant of ſin,</hi> crying out with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> they never dreamed of a perfect holineſs, nor never thought themſelves more holy then others; or preſumed to call themſelves Saints; and if that title had at any time been given unto any of them by ſuch as truly honoured them for their ſingular graces, you ſhould ever hear them complain of their imperfections, and with the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>counting all things loſſe for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, eſteeming all their righteouſneſſe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:13"/>
               <hi>but dung, that they might win Christ and be found in him not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their own righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now they that are acquainted with the Independents doctrine, words, and practices, hear them talk of nothing but of their own ſanctity, and of their perfection, ſaying <hi>God can ſee no ſin in them;</hi> and although ſome of them do not profeſſe ſo much in words, yet in deeds they allow of that doctrine, proclaming themſelves <hi>to be the only Saints, the holy people, and the godly party, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the juſt, and ſeparate from their brethren as impure crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> Therefore the Independents do not walk in that old way of righteouſneſſe the old Puritans of ENGLAND walked in, who made no ſeparation in the worſt times from the publike Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, or ever refuſed to pray with their Chriſtian brethren; and therefore in this point they have not outſtripped them nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown them; from which <hi>I</hi> boldly conclude, <hi>that herein that Predicant did abuſe the world,</hi> in ſaying <hi>that there is no difference between the Independents and the old Puritants of</hi> ENGLAND; For the old Puritans were <hi>humble, ſelf denying men,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents are <hi>phariſaicall boaſters of their own holineſſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity;</hi> and therefore in this, <hi>their way is not the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but a great aberration from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> though never ſo learned, and never ſo ſufficiently furniſhed with all accompliſhed abilities of divine knowledge, which many of them by their indefatigable pains, ſtudy, and induſtry, and by their prayers unto God night and day, and by their continuall waiting upon the Ordinances, and Gods bleſſing upon all their endeavours, had attained unto, ſo that they were taken notice of by all men, both in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities and amongſt all the learned, to be incomparable men, many of the which I could name, yet not any one of them ever preached either in publike or private without great ſtudy and prayer, yea and without a ſpeciall call; and they alwayes with Saint <hi>Paul, exerciſed their Miniſtery in fear and much trembling,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. ver. 3. ſaying with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> Thoſe holy and godly Puritans, though tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently learned, yet were always converſant in all holy duties, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in preaching and prayer with fear and trembling, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves never ſufficiently enough provided for, for thoſe duties. And truly Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> example is worthy alwaies to be
<pb facs="tcp:48122:14"/>
looked upon, who though he were immediately inſpired by God himſelfe and had alwayes the aſſiſtance of his ſpirit, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more learning then all the Independents put together, yet he preached alwayes <hi>with fear and trembling, and cryed out who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we compare the Independents and their Predicants with the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> we ſhall find the old Puritans al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and in all things imitating the example of holy <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles in their Miniſtery, which they had a command to follow, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. ver. 17. who intruded not themſelves raſhly upon the Miniſtery, as the falſe Apoſtles and Seducers uſually did, and as all the Independents and Sectaries daily do; they cryed out <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things? and how can any preach except he be ſent?</hi> Rom. 10. ſaying <hi>No man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as</hi> Aaron, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 4. Thoſe old Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were all men of Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> ſpirit, <hi>they durſt do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a call, nothing without great ſtudy, nothing without their parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and books,</hi> imitating Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this, who would alwaies have his parchments with him (that is his books) <hi>bring me my parchments, ſaith he;</hi> they preached not <hi>without fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;</hi> this was the continuall practice of the old Puritans, they could never be ſeen in a Pulpit before they had ſome dayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themſelves by prayer and ſtudy; and yet after all this, they would then cry out, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> Whereas all the Independents and Sectaries aſſert, <hi>that every man may preach, and every man of them is ſufficient, and many alſo hold that women may preach;</hi> yea and to manifeſt that <hi>they are all ſufficient for theſe things, and for the diſpenſing of the great myſteries of Heaven, which the very Angels deſired to pry into,</hi> they run through Town and Country, and whereſoever they come get up into the Pulpits and preach with ſuch impudencie, impiety and blaſphemy, as it is not lawfull to name, their very doctrines being ſo deſtructive to all piety, goodneſſe, and good manners, and Ruffian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like they go in their hair and apparrel, and ſo inſolent and proud they are, that one would rather take them for Luciferians then Saints; and ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming expreſſions they have in their prayers to God, as would terrifie a truly conſciencious and godly man to hear them, as not long ſince one of them in <hi>London</hi> publickly ſpeaking unto God in his prayer, ſaid, <hi>Right Honorable Lord God,</hi> which kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb facs="tcp:48122:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as they are blaſphemous, ſo ridiculous expoſing Religion and the ſacred Ordinances of God to ludibry and deriſion. But yet this is the dayly practice of the Sectaries through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, far different from that of the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore in this point of fear and reverence, and of an holy awe of Gods divine Majeſtie and a reverend adoring of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and myſtery of the Goſpell, <hi>the way of the Independent</hi>s <hi>is not that either of the holy Apoſtles or of the old Puritans,</hi> there being as vaſt a difference between them, as between <hi>light and darkneſſe;</hi> and therefore <hi>the way of Independency in this particular alſo is not the way of righteouſneſſe, but the way of rebellion and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> had all of them a reverend opinion of all in authority, and did ever beleeve <hi>that there was no power but of God, and that all powers were ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>and they beleeved that every ſoule ought to be ſubject to the higher power, and that whoſoever reſiſted the power reſisted the Ordinance of God, and for that their Rebellion they ſhould receive to themſelves damnation, and they ever believed that every ſoule ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto authority, not onely for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake;</hi> this was the Doctrine of the old Puritans of <hi>England;</hi> and their practice in yeelding continuall obedience to them, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them is knowne to all men; yea, they did acknowledge, that as all power was given unto Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. ſo they did beleeve that all power in Church and State was derived from him, as the head of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie and power, who had ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. 16. <hi>By me Kings raigne, and Princes decree justice; by me Princes rule and Nobles, yea, all the Iudges of the earth,</hi> &amp;c. this doctrine the old Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans of <hi>England</hi> had learned and taught and were obedient unto, as having precept upon precept for it, as from the words above quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the thirteenth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo out of 1. <hi>Pet. chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 13, 14. who ſaid <hi>ſubmit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as ſupreme, or unto Governors, as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evill Doers, and for the prayſe of them that doe well; for ſo is the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and Eccleſiaſticall, being commanded <hi>to obey them that have the rule over them, and to ſubmit themſelves unto them, as who wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched over their ſoules, as thoſe that were to give account, &amp;c.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſticall the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> did beleeve it was that Presbyterian Government that is now contended for by all the Presbyterians, as is to be ſeene at large in the learned Workes of that ever to be honoured Maſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> in his diſputations againſt Biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> who for his zeale to that government was called the Father of all the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans. They alſo did beleeve that all government, both Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall and Civill, was radically, originally, and inherently in God, and Chriſt, and from them derived <hi>to the Kings, Princes, Nobles and Iudges of the earth, and to all the true Miniſters of the Goſpel in his Church,</hi> who all have their authorities immediatly from God, and by whom alone according to the Holy Scripture they rule and command; they never durſt be ſo blaſphemous as to rob God of his honour and glory, and the Kings, Nobles, and Judges of the earth, and the Miniſters of the Goſpel of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall powers, ſaying, that Kings and Nobles, and the Rulers of the earth, and Miniſters in Chriſts Church and Kingdome were the creatures of the people, and that the people were the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord, both of Kings, Nobles, Parliaments, and Miniſters, and that the authority which they exerciſed was inherently in the people, and that they might give it and depoſite it into whoſe hands they pleaſed, and where they luſted, and call any of their Rulers and Governours to an account, and appoint them their times and ſeaſons when they ſhould meet, and tell them what they ſhould doe, and diſplace them at pleaſure as they ſhall thinke fit; all theſe Leſſons of Blaſphemy the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> were ignorant of, which learned neſcience of theirs is commendable: They had beene better taught from all the Holy Prophets, and bleſſed Apoſtles, who both by precept and example have inſtructed the people of God in all ages to yeeld obedience to thoſe that were Governors over them, as wee may reade through all the Holy Scripture of the Old Teſtament, where we find what reverence even Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithfull, ſhewed unto all Kings, under whoſe government he lived in the time of his Peregrination, and where wee reade alſo what reverence <hi>Ioſeph</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:48122:17"/>
and ſupplications private and publick, ever with tears prayed for all in authority; I affirme that this practice of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents is not onely one of the higheſt ſtrains of all unrighteouſneſſe, and contrary to the practice of all the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> but contrary to all the practice of all the Saints that ever yet lived in the world, and contrary to all the commands of God both in the Old and New Teſtament. For we have read how earneſtly <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed for the rebellious <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> wiſhing himſelfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be blotted out of the book of life then that the Lord ſhould deſtroy them; and ſo did <hi>Paul</hi> wiſh for his Countrymen the Jews: <hi>Samuel</hi> alſo when the people deſired him to pray for them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. v. 23. <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I ſhould ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord in ceaſing to pray for you</hi> &amp;c. So that the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet makes it a ſin in either Miniſters or people not to pray for their brethren, and eſpecially thoſe in authority: for this was the practice of all the Prophets; <hi>the Lord told a heathen King that Abraham his ſervant ſhould pray for him; yea father Abraham prayed for the very Sodomites, and the Kingdoms in which they dwelt,</hi> Gen. 18. And the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were in captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> had a command from God himſelfe <hi>to pray for the welfare of very Babylon and the Princes of the ſame;</hi> and we have read what ſupplications <hi>Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah</hi> put up in behalfe of thoſe heathen Princes under which they lived, as well as for their own Countrymen. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives it in charge to all Miniſters and people, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>to pray for all men,</hi> ver. 1, 2. <hi>I exhort</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that firſt of all ſupplications, prayers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men: For Kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a peaceable and quiet life in all godlineſſe and honeſty: For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> So that here there is not onely an exhortation to all Chriſtians in generall, but in ſpeciall to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>to pray for all men:</hi> but primarily for thoſe in authority; and reaſons &amp; grounds are alſo given by the Apoſtle of incouragement to this duty: <hi>viz. becauſe that it is a good and acceptable thing in the ſight of God, tending alſo for the peace, quiet, and tranquillity of them all;</hi> and which is more, <hi>to all godlineſſe, which is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all peace; and therefore that they ought to pray for thoſe in authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this exhortation of the Apoſtle, all the old Puritans of
<pb facs="tcp:48122:17"/>
               <hi>England</hi> did ever moſt diligently obſerve and follow, praying for them that were in authority night and day; whereas the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were never in private heard pray for either <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or the <hi>Scots,</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> How wicked a thing therefore is it in the Independents and Sectaries, and what a part of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is it in them, dayly to omit this duty, who will neither pray with their brethren nor for them, but ſeparate from all their ſocieties as from a people unholy? yea how impious and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a thing is it in them, againſt both God and all authority, to ſay, and that in a diſdainfull manner, even in their publike meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places and congregations, <hi>that neither the Parliament nor Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly are worthy their prayers?</hi> yea it is well known and can be proved, <hi>that they pray againſt them and the King himſelfe,</hi> and that not onely privately, but in their congregations publikely.</p>
            <p>Surely if either the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> or the <hi>Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were as bad as the <hi>Kings of Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>perſecuting Jews,</hi> yet they ought to be prayed for; For we have a command to pray for all men, yea for our enemies, and thoſe that perſecute us and revile us; and we have Chriſts example for it, who ſaid, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe that perſecuted him, which Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> imitating, ſaid, <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to their charge;</hi> ſupplicating likewiſe for his enemies. And ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for all thoſe that forſook him when he appeared before <hi>Nero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when the Independents and Sectaries tranſgreſſe thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt precept upon précept, and againſt the example of all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets, and Chriſt himſelfe, and his bleſſed Apoſtles and Martyrs, and dayly by theſe their practices fight againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and are in every thing ſo unlike the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> it is manifeſt <hi>that they have not outgrown them in this point of duty, and that the way of Independency is not the way of righteouſneſſe, but the way of error and open rebellion againſt God;</hi> ſo that thoſe glorious titles they aſſume unto themſelves, <hi>of being the onely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and praying people, and the Saints, and but the old Puritans of</hi> England <hi>overgrown,</hi> do not belong unto the Independents and Sectaries when they are ſo like the devill in all their practices: For it is ſufficiently known &amp; can be abundantly proved, <hi>that many of the Independents &amp; Sectaries wil neither pray with the Preſbyterians nor for them, no nor for King and Parliament, nor for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:18"/>
               <hi>nor for the Scots;</hi> yea if need be, it can be proved, <hi>that they have prayed, and that publickly, againſt them all:</hi> yea their dayly Pamphlets witneſſe what good affection they have towards them all, whoſe chiefe imployment it is (except it be now and then by the way of ſlattery when they coaks the Parliament a little to gain their favour, that by their party in the houſe they may do the more miſchiefe againſt the Presbyterians); <hi>I</hi> ſay, except it be at ſuch a nick of time, the whole imployment of all the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries generally is abominably to abuſe them and to raile and revile <hi>both the Houſe of</hi> LORDS <hi>and</hi> COMMONS <hi>and the Aſſembly, and the Scots, and the City, and for the King they cannot hear of his very name with patience;</hi> I can ſay thus much of them, and men alſo of good rank and reputation, that I never have heard more reviling ſpeeches in my life againſt any men then they have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my hearing, and in the audience of many, and that at the <hi>Parliament</hi> door; affirming openly, <hi>that they were more tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call then either</hi> Strafford <hi>or the</hi> Prelate, <hi>and greater perſecutors then thoſe of the High Commiſſion Court,</hi> and this was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral language of all the Sectaries through the Kingdome, within this twelve Moneths, indeed ſince the recruiting of the Houſe and ſince by that means they have ſtrengthned their party, and they have of late ſhewed leſſe favour to the Presbytery and the City, they have not been altogether publickly ſo boyſterous in their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet notwithſtanding privately amongſt themſelves they can ſpeak daggers both againſt many worthy Members in the Houſe of Commons, and againſt many of the Lords, and againſt the City, and againſt the Scots, and eſpecially againſt the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; all the which they traduce at pleaſure, with moſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Houſe of Commons, if at leaſt they do not humor them to their deſires and deſignes; yea many of their printed Pamphlets can witneſſe for me that I wrong them not, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others thoſe that were writ by <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> who is but the mouth of the reſt, who dares ſpeak out what the other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries dare but mutter, and therefore he is adored and exceedingly animated and countenanced by them all, and ſuperlatively cryed up as the onely man of courage and animoſity amongſt all thoſe of that fraternitie, and he makes all the Lords but Prerogative and King creatures, and the very Houſe of Commons but the creature of the people, who may call them to an account when they
<pb facs="tcp:48122:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pleaſe, and therefore (for all their flatterie in their <hi>Petition)</hi> it highly concerns the Great Councel and the whole kingdom, time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look into their proceedings, &amp; their clandeſtine machinations, leſt that in recruting of the Parliament they doe ſo ſtrengthen their faction, that in <hi>fine</hi> they deſtroy not only the Parliament it ſelfe, but the whole Kindome, and make themſelves ſoveraigne Lords indeed (as they pretend they are) over both the King and Parliament, and all the people, and ſo become really our Lords and Maſters, ſo that whereas formerly this nation was called the Popes and Prelates Aſſes, we may now juſtly be called and termed the Independents Mules, a monſtrous brood indeed; for it is ſufficiently knowne, and can be proved, and that by good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that it is their maxime, that the Saints only ought to rule the world, and to have the ſword in their hand, aud they prove this their Doctrine out of the 149. <hi>Pſame,</hi> where the Prophet ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. &amp;c. <hi>Let the Saints be jeyfull in glory, let them ſing abroad upon their beds; let the high prayſes of God be in their mouth: and a two edged ſword in their hand to execute vengeanee upon the Heathen, and puniſhments upon the people, to bind their Kings with chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of Iron, to execute upon them the judgement written; this honour have all his Saints; prayſe yee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this place of Holy Scripture they ground their opinion, that the Saints only ought to rule the Earth; now they account none Saints but themſelves, and all the Presbyterians enemies of Jeſus Chriſt; yea, they have beene heard ſay when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, where they may ſpeake freely, that they ſee no reaſon why the Saints may not compell any nation by the ſword to come under obedience to Chriſts Kingdome. So that howſoever they challenge liberty of conſcience now, ſaying that conſcience is a tender thing, and that it ought not be forced; yet if they but once get the day, they will give no toleration I beleeve to any Presbyterians; yea, I am moſt aſſured, had but the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment voted for Independency as they did for the Presbyterie, they would have found Scripture enough then by which they would have proved that the Chriſtian Magiſtrate might have forced any to come under obedience to Chriſts yoake, and then the example of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would have beene exceedingly urged by them all, who ſeeking a through Reformation, would not ſuffer ſo
<pb facs="tcp:48122:19"/>
much as the language of <hi>Aſhdod</hi> to be ſpoke within his juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but conſtrained them all to imbrace the true Religion, and ſweare by God, that is to ſet up Gods true worſhip; this example of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> I am confident would have beene urged, and that eagerly by them all, who at their firſt comming over from their pretended baniſhment (I meane the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Brethren, and thoſe of <hi>New-England)</hi> as long as they had any hopes of ſetting up their Independency were very frequently heard ſpeake of a through Reformation, and alwayes commend noble <hi>Nehemiah</hi> for his zeale that hee would not ſuffer any falſe worſhip in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> but ſince they perceive their hopes are fruſtrate, now they labor for a toleration of all Religions, which both God, noble <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> &amp; all the Holy Prophets, Chriſt and his bleſſed Apoſtles continually were diſpleaſed with, and denounced judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; all which holy Lawes now they deſire may be diſpenſed with to gratifie them with a ful toleration of all religions, or at leaſt with an indulgence for their new-fangled Independency, which by all their indeavours they make way apace for: and howſoever it was thought a thing worthy of death in <hi>Strafford</hi> and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that they but laboured to alter the Lawes of the Land, and the Religion that was eſtabliſhed by publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and for the which they both ſuffered, the very Sectaries and Independents themſelves being the principall Agents to bring them both to their end, who by their tumultuous and diſorderly running up daily to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> were never ſatisfied in craving juſtice at the Parliament againſt them, ſaying, <hi>that as reſolution was the life of action, ſo execution was the life of the Law and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and would never be contented and appeaſed till they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their deſires againſt them, and only for this very cauſe as they pretended, that they indeavoured to alter the Lawes of the Land, and the Religion eſtabliſhed by publick authority; and many of our Fugitives were as eager in that buſines as any of the reſt, ſome of them ſtanding upon the Scaffold to ſee the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, and rejoycing at the juſtice done upon them; and yet behold the very ſame men, are all of them guilty of the very ſame crime that they dyed for; yea, of a farre greater; for the Prelate and the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> were adjudged for but indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to alter the Religion and Lawes eſtabliſhed in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but all the Sectaries and Independents they have really
<pb facs="tcp:48122:19"/>
altered Religion, and have ſet up many new Religions, and that without any authority; yea, they have altered both Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, rejecting all the Holy Scriptures, and making nothing of the glorious Word of God, as can be proved, and they have not only eſtabliſhed by their ſole authority divers Religions amongſt us that were never knowne before, but they proclame all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians enemies of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſons of <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and eſteeme of them as ſo many Infidels in no wiſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with in holy things. And for the fundamentall Lawes of the Land, they not only ſpeake againſt them as a yoake of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and bondage unſupportable to be borne, but they write whole bookes againſt them, deſiring they may be altered, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all men injoy their lives and eſtates by them; yea, they write not only in general againſt all the laws of the land, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very Ordinances of Parliament, daily publiſhing Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets againſt all their proceedings, and eſpecially they have taken great paines to diſmount the Ordinance of Tythes eſtabliſhed both by Law and a particular Ordinance of Parliament, they would faine ſtarve the Presbyterians, preaching and practiſing hourely againſt the Covenant, and many knowne Ordinances: for whereas it was by Ordinances injoyned that none ſhould preach publickly, but ſuch as were authoriſed, and thought fit for the ſoundneſſe of their Doctrine, and for the ſufficiency of their parts and abilities; and that nothing ſhould be printed but by authority; notwithſtanding theſe Ordinances, the Sectaries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents both preach &amp; print whatſoever they pleaſe to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the people, and for the perverting and corrupting of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and diſturbance both of Church and State; and whereas by an Ordinance of Parliament, the manner of government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the three States, King, Peers and Commons, hath been againe and againe confirmed, &amp; eſtabliſhed with the ſitting of the Reverend Aſſembly of Divines, and the ratifying of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and for the eſtabliſhing of the Presbyterian government, nevertheleſſe they write againſt them all, eſpecially the King, Peers, and Aſſembly, making nothing of them; no nor of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Parliament to their faces; firſt the King, then the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and then the Houſe of Lords, ſlighting their authority and power, affirming that they could not ſo much as commit any freeborne ſubject to priſon which every Juſtice of peace or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable may doe; yea, it is well knowne that in inſolency they have exceeded all Delinquents that ever appeared before the great Councell of the Kingdome; ſo that it may be ſpake to the honour both of <hi>Strafford</hi> and the <hi>Prelate</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that they both of them behaved themſelves with far greater modeſty and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards both Houſes then many of the Sectaries have done, for they ever yeelded due honour and reverenciall reſpect unto them all, both with bowed knees, and gracefull and ſeeming lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; which thoſe paultry Fellowes out of an inſulting impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency denied them, deſpiſing Dignities and Dominions; and theſe creatures have had their complices to applaud them in theſe their Rebelliouspractiſes, yea ſome of them have beene ſo bold as to petition the Parliament in their behalfe, though they could not be ignorant how unchriſtianly, unreverently, and undutifully they behaved themſelves before them, which was the greateſt affront that was ever offered to any Parliament, and the greateſt breach of the priviledge of Parliament that hath beene knowne in any nation; and yet all theſe things have beene perpetrated by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents and Sectaries, all which graceleſſe proceedings the old <hi>Puritans</hi> of <hi>England</hi> abhorred, as the way of unrighteouſneſſe. This alſo can be proved that many of their Independent itinerary preachers run from place to place, preaching againſt the Nobility and Gentry, againſt the Citie, and againſt the Reverend Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, againſt the Directory, againſt Tythes, againſt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; yea againſt all that is called authority, and againſt all our gallant, renowned, and valiant presbyterian ſouldiers, ſaying in their Sermons, <hi>come out yee old baſe drunken whoremaſterly rogues,</hi> ſhew what you have done for the ſafety of the Kingdome, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all the glory of thoſe noble victories to their owne party.

to the State then ever the Cavaliers were, yea, greater enemies to all Reformation in Religion then ever appeared in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were hatcht, and which is not the leaſt thing of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and wonder in all theſe creatures, they are fledge in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe as ſoone as they are diſcloſed. Truly, theſe their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes <hi>manifeſt unto the whole world that they are not the onely Saints, nor the old Puritans of</hi> England <hi>over-growne;</hi> for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious that all of them abhorred all theſe their ungodly proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>and therefore the way of Independency is not the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but the open way of ſinne, hereſie, and apparent Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I will yet in a few things more</hi> compare the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> and the Sectaries and Independents together, before I come to ſpeake of the prayer of that <hi>Homothumadon</hi> brother, I firſt made mention of. <hi>It is well knowne, that the old Puritans of</hi> England <hi>were all of them very zealous for the ſanctifying of the Lords day, and their whole imployments on that day ſufficiently declared to all thoſe that were familiarly acquainted with them,</hi> that they were heavenly minded men, and ſuch as were truly morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and dead unto the world, who denyed unto themſelves uſually thoſe ordinary neceſſaries on that day, that at other times they would more freely partake in; <hi>they dreſſed but little meat on that day, no more then very neceſſitie called for, not out of any penuriouſneſſe, but for this end,</hi> that their ſervants might be eaſed from all toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing workes, that they might the better attend upon the duties of the day; and they were eſpecially carefull, that both they and their children, with the ſtrangers that were within their gates, ſhould ſanctifie that day; <hi>they left none of them to ramble whether they pleaſed, they had well learned that Leſſon,</hi> that they and their men-ſervants and maid-ſervants, with the ſtranger within their wals ſhould keepe holy the Sabbath day, <hi>and did both by themſelves and with their families take order,</hi> that no duty of the day ſhould be omitted, <hi>the whole day being taken up either</hi> in prayer or medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or reading of the holy Scriptures, or hearing the Word, or repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sermons, or ſinging of Pſalmes, or inſtructing and catechiſing their Families, or in the works of charity, or viſiting the ſick, or in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conference, or in reading godly books, or in performing of ſome duty or other that might bring glory to God, and honour to their holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>and their houſes were generally ſo well ordered, and all</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:21"/>
               <hi>things carried in ſuch comelineſſe and decencie, as he that had beene brought up in profane company, and had accidentally lighted into owne of their houſes, would as much have wondred</hi> to ſee the excellent carriage of all things there, as the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> did to behold the ordering of <hi>Solomons</hi> houſe. <hi>I may truly ſpeake this to their immortall praiſe,</hi> that I never ſaw in their Families the leaſt diſorder on thoſe dayes; <hi>nor never ſaw a Feaſt on that day, though at other times they were very free in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, and much given to Hoſpitalitie, and nigardly in nothing, and commonly they cauſed their Table-cloath to be ſpread on the Saturday before they went to bed, and they were carefull that all that were well in the Family ſhould go to Church with them, and they had a ſingular care that all their ſervants might have no hindrances or impediments by any worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments</hi> that might in the leaſt diſturbe them or dictract them from the duties of the day; <hi>all theſe things I can witneſſe with thouſands more beſides my ſelfe,</hi> were the practices of the old Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans of <hi>England,</hi> and this was the way of Righteouſneſſe that they walked in, for the ſanctifying of the Lords day.</p>
            <p>Now if the practice of the Independents and Sectaries about this buſines and point of obedience be looked into, there will be found a vaſt difference betweene them and the old <hi>Puritans</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> for it is well knowne <hi>that they ordinarily make all their greateſt entertainments on that day, as that I ſpake of before</hi> for inſtance, (and many more that I could mention) <hi>where the whole Church was feaſted to no ſmall diſtraction to their poore and godly ſervants, that were taken up with more attendance that day, then</hi> Martha <hi>was on an ordinary day in entertaining of Chriſt himſelfe,</hi> which not withſtanding hee then blamed in very godly and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Martha,</hi> who had learned to give Chriſt an honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of her faith concerning her beliefe in him; and doubtleſſe if <hi>Martha</hi> were then blamed by Chriſt, and had from him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe for her too much care about many things in entertaining himſelfe; I beleevee the Independents and Sectaries will receive but little thankes at his hand for profaning his owne day, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others to doe the ſame, and for their thus breaking and viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his holy Lawes, and hindring of his ſervants by their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe entertainments, from the duties of pietie and holineſſe that he requires at their hands on thoſe dayes, and he will ſay to them
<pb facs="tcp:48122:21"/>
at the laſt judgement, as for theſe their diſorderly walkings, ſo for their new and needleſſe traditions, <hi>who required theſe things at your hands?</hi> nay, did I not forbid theſe things will the Lord ſay? Truly it is moſt notorious that the Sectaries and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are very looſe in the ſanctifying of the Lords day; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of them before they fel into the way of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie were very conſcionable obſervers of that day, and were greatly diſpleaſed with the King for granting but a toleration for ſports on that day, and could then ſay, <hi>that very ſinne alone had beene enough to bring downe the judgements of God upon the whole Land, yet ſince they turned Sectaries, they can now not only feaſt and ryot on that day, but if need be work on the ſame in their ordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as can be proved, and many of them that were then great zealots for the performances of all duties of holineſſe that day with all their Families, now regard not that day no more then an other,</hi> nay, <hi>they let their ſervants and children goe whether they pleaſe, leaving them all to the liberty</hi> (as they ſpeake) <hi>of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> and it is ordinarily obſerved, that all the Independents and Sectaries in the Armie, and through the whole Kingdome will frequently journey on that day, and for the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Predicants, they are trundled about on the Lords day in their Coaches with foure Horſes, needleſſely diſquieting both men and beaſts that they have a command to give reſt unto. A Tumbrell or a Dung-cart were fitter for theſe proud and profane Fellowes to be carried about in; and if they will not leave theſe their licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious courſes, and ſurceaſe thus to profane the Lords day, <hi>I ſee no reaſon but that the Magiſtrate ſhould take ſome order with them, and puniſh them for profaning it, it being not only againſt the Lawes of God, but contrary unto the Lawes of the Land.</hi> It may be that is one of the Lawes that the Sectaries would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated and made null; for moſt certaine it is <hi>their practiſes are both contrary to that Law, and the knowne Law of God, and the practiſe of all the old Puritans of</hi> England, <hi>and therefore the way of Independency in this point alſo is not the way of Righteouſneſſe, but of profaneſſe and licentiouſneſſe, neither are they overgrowne Puritans in this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſeeing I have upon this occaſion, began to compare the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> with the Independents and Sectaries, who their Predicants aſſert are but the <hi>old Puritans over-growne,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:22"/>
               <hi>that is, Chriſtians in all respects, tranſcending them in all duties of piety and godlineſſe, and in all offices of Love and Charity towards others, and in the whole frame of their lives and converſations, and for their uprightneſſe and honeſty in their dealings, and for their ſincerity in all their actions, and for their moderation in the temperate uſe of all the creatures, and for their humble walking towards others.</hi> I ſhall briefly here ſet downe the practices of the old Puritans concerning ſome of theſe particulars, and paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel them with the proceedings of the Independents and Sectaries of our times.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently knowne, that the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> ever loved and honoured all the Orthodox, faithfull, painefull, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Preachers of the Word of God through the Land, whether Conformiſts or non-Conformiſts, and they never thought they could yeeld them reverence enough, and were willing at any time to the uttermoſt of their abilities to relieve and ſupply them with all neceſſary accomodations, for the ſupport of themſelves, and their Families, and they were ſo farre from taking from them any thing, or hindring them of their dues, either in reſpect of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or maintenance; that they would run and ride in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe for the maintaining of their reputations and livelyhoods, <hi>and if at any time they had beene oppreſſed by the power and tyrannie of the Prelates in any Court, or by any wicked enemies of the Church, they had the aſſiſtance, and ever the good word of the old Puritans, and their prayers, and their purſes to ſupport them, and ſustaine both them and their Families; they were never knowne to deſert them, or to give them an ill word;</hi> and this was the carriage of the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> towards their godly and painfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of all ſorts, and they never favoured any hereticall, and ſchiſmaticall Teachers, and this was that way of Righteouſneſſe they walked in.</p>
            <p>Now if we looke upon the practices of the Independents and Sectaries they are chiefeſt enemies of all the painefull and godly Miniſters through the Kingdome, and the only friends of all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, ſchiſmaticall and hereticall Preachers, ſo that it is well knowne, they doe not only reproach, and abuſe them in words, calling them <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, the limbs of Antichriſt, and the Devils Miniſters, and a thouſand ſuch ignominious names, but ſo perſecute them in word and deeds that they cannot ſafely dwell
<pb facs="tcp:48122:22"/>
by them where there is any number of the Sectaries; yea, there is ſcarce a Committee through the Kingdome where they have not perſecuted their moſt faithfull Miniſters, yea <hi>it is their chiefe deſigne to take away their Tythes from them, and to deprive them of their Livings, by which they ſhould ſupport themſelvs, and their poor Families, and they have made the lives of many of them ſo irkeſome unto them, and ſo wearied them with their calumnies and carriage towards them, that though they highly honoured them before they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sectaries, yet after that, they became their mortall enemies,</hi> and for no other reaſon but that they continued ſtill to preach thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox doctrines they had formerly taught, &amp; inveighed againſt the dangerous and blaſphemous opinions that were now preached up every where by the Seducers of theſe times, &amp; for this cauſe alone, and for no other ground they have wearied many of them out of their very lives, and forced others to leave their places of their habitations; many preſidents of this kind I could produce, but one I cannot but inſtance, and that is of one Maſter <hi>Beton</hi> of <hi>Rye,</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> a moſt painefull, orthodox, and laborious Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and a man of no ſmall fame, as well for his godly life, and diligence in his Miniſtry, as for his ſingular knowledge in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and all the orientall tongues, and yet this man every way ſo unblameable and accompliſhed, did the Sectaries joyning with all the Malignants of that place, drive from his habitation there. The ful ſtory of that particular buſineſſe would make a pretty larg book, which would ſad the hearts of all ſuch as are truly godly, to hear <hi>that any that pretend unto Chriſtian Religion ſhould practiſe ſo contrary unto all Chriſtian principles and the practice of the old Puritans of ENGLAND;</hi> and yet what thoſe Sectaries of <hi>Rye</hi> with their complices have done againſt that godly and learned Miniſter, is generally practiced by all the other Sectaries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents through the Kingdome, as can ſufficiently be proved, <hi>who generally implacably hate thoſe that they have formerly loved, and have ſtill a cauſe to honour; as who next under God have been a means of their converſion, if ever they were really converted:</hi> So that in theſe their proceedings, <hi>they are not the old Puritans of ENGLAND overgrown, which walked in the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in honouring their faithfull Miniſters according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. <hi>and</hi> Heb. 13. Which way the Independents do not walk in, but in the contrary way of malice and hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:48122:23"/>
them, as all their practices proclame: Therefore inthis reſpect alſo <hi>the way of Independency is not the way of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as for their charity and practice of love, and their integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſincere dealing towards their brethren, the old Puritans of</hi> ENGLAND <hi>were famous for their re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame and traduce them, and to hinder their preferment; yea and they will do it to ſuch alſo as they ſeem to be very loving, and ſhew an outward kindneſſe to: <hi>And yet at that very infrant of time they moſt faune upon them, they will fearfully betray them; yea it is well known,</hi> that ſome of the Independents have betrayed their own fathers, their masters, their moſt familiar friends and acquaintance after they have turned from the Treſbyterian way to that faction, eſpecially they uſe exceedingly to hate ſuch as they profeſſed greatly to love, if they have found them rigid, <hi>as they ſpeak,</hi> or unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their Religion, and would not connive at their Independent wayes.</p>
            <p>I could ſay much upon my own experience, how many of the Sectaries ſeemed not a little to honour me, and ſpake as well of me as of any man living, before they ſaw they could not prevaile with me to be of their mind, nor to favour them in their erroneous opinions; but as ſoon as they perceived <hi>that I was immoveable in my reſolution, their love turned into implacable hatred,</hi> as it is well known. And I am confident there might be thouſands of preſidents produced of the like nature, many of which I know; yea <hi>I</hi> may truly ſay this, that I have not known any Presbyterian now living that was formerly familiarly acquainted with any that afterward turn'd Sectary or Independent (notwithſtanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever courteſies they had formerly received from them) that have not either betrayed him or done him ſome ill office after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or at leaſt would never do him the leaſt kindneſſe, though he were in need, or ſhew him any favour; So that in this point of love and charity, <hi>they walk not in the way of the old Puritans, who were kind to all men and ſincere towards thoſe they had famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:23"/>
               <hi>converſed with, it never being known that they betrayed any of them or did them any ill offices;</hi> and therefore in this point alſo, <hi>the way of Independency is not the way of righteouſneſſe nor the way of the old Puritans of ENGLAND, but the way of treachery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe and unrighteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to inſtance the practices and wayes of the old Puritans in a few things more, and then to compare them with the wayes of the Independents and Sectaries.</p>
            <p>The old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> as all can witneſſe that knew them, <hi>were all of them generally men no way addicted to the pleaſures of the world, and in their apparell and outward garbe commonly they were ever out of faſhion: It</hi> was, to my knowledg, counted a great ſin amongſt them, <hi>to exceed in apparrell, or to be faſhionably clad, or to go with long hair, or Rufſian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like, or to be ſeen in gorgeous attire;</hi> You ſhould rarely or ſeldome behold any gold or ſilver lace on any of their apparrell, except they had been of noble Parentage, or of ſome very great and rich Families, or in ſome eminent place of authority, <hi>and that was alwayes very sparing;</hi> and for cuffs at their hands, not one of a thouſand of the old Puritans were ever ſeen in any; and if they at any time upon any feſtivity, or at any ſolemn entertainment, or upon ſuch like occaſion appeared in any, <hi>they were commonly ſuch little ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones as a man could ſcarſe diſcern them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if you look upon all the Independents generally through Town and Country, though they were never born to any eſtates, nor were of any repute, <hi>till that out of the ruines of the Kingdome by their Sectariſme and indirect dealings they have attained to ſome wealth; You ſhall find them the only gallants of the world, ſo that one that ſhould meet them would take them for Roarers and Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans rather then Saints;</hi> Yea you ſhall find them with cuffs, and thoſe great ones, at their very heels, and with more ſilver and gold upon their clothes, and at their heels (for thoſe upſtarts muſt now be in their ſilver ſpurs) then many great and honourable perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have in their purſes; ſo that thoſe that behold them, if they knew them not, <hi>would take them to be the Gentry and Peers of the Kingdome rather then a company of obſcure fellows,</hi> in ſo much that ſome taking notice of the great change in this Kingdome ſaid not long ſince, <hi>that Gentlemen and Noblemen were become beggers, and beggers were become Lords and Gentlemen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:24"/>
Truly the like pride in apparell was never ſeen amongſt ſuch as made profeſſion of Religion before theſe our times; <hi>Whereas the old Puritans of ENGLAND, both men and women, were all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly cladd and attired, and went very plain, and thought it rather a ſcandall to Religion to be attired or cladd in the leaſt manner after the faſhion of the Court, then for an honour to their profeſſion;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> have known them blame thoſe that abhorred all pride as much as any men did, and onely for that they went handſomely cladd and apparrelled, although it were onely for the gracing of their profeſſion, as they then told them, for the which they were at that time ſufferers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that if thoſe people were now alive, thoſe old Puritans, and ſhould ſee our Sectaries and Independents who predicate themſelves to be</hi> the onely Saints, <hi>thoſe good old Puritans would lift up their hands with admiration, and ſay, as one of</hi> New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>ſaid not long ſince ſeeing a brother of his coming over thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very gallant whom he had known live in a meaner condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that in beholding him he thought he ſaw one of the ſeven won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the world, and profest that he believed they would ere long grow mad with pride in Old ENGLAND, ſaying moreover that in his time (he having then been but ten years in New England) he that ſhould have been ſeen go in thoſe faſhions the Sectaries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents uſually and daily now go in, would have been thought to have had little Religion in him, and he exceedingly marvelled at the liberty all thoſe of the Congregationall way now take, <hi>ſaying,</hi> that he much ſuspected their ſincerity that now made that a vertue and counted that an honour to Religion which the old Puritans of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> deemed a diſhonour to God, and a diſgrace and diſhonour to their holy profeſſion. <hi>So that in this point alſo,</hi> the practices and way of the Sectaries is not the way of the old Puritans of England and the way of righteouſneſſe, <hi>it being the way of vanity and the world, and contrary unto the command of the Apoſtle Saint</hi> Paul <hi>Rom. 12. ver. 2, 3, 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again whereas the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> had their fare, diet, and houſhold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtuffe, how rich in eſtate ſoever they were, according to their ſeverall degrees, were it a Yeoman or but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gentleman, or a Knight, they ever obſerved their rank; whatſoever, I ſay, or how great ſoever the eſtates of each of them were; the Yeoman had his houſe furniſhed and fared like a Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:48122:24"/>
and not like a Gentleman; the Gentleman he alſo fared like a Gentleman, and had his houſe furniſhed accordingly, and not like a Knight; the Knight in like manner fared like a Knight, and had his houſe furniſhed according to his rank, and not like a Lord; All the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> every one of them out of conſcience obſerved and kept their rank, <hi>and lived and fared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that degree and order God had placed them in this world, and uſed their ſuperfluity for the clothing of the naked, and feeding of the neceſſitated, and relieving of the poor,</hi> many of the which rich Yeomen, Gentlemen, and Knights <hi>I</hi> could name, ſome of the which to my knowledge layed by yearly out of their eſtates and revenues ſome two hundred pounds, ſome three hundred, yea ſome five hundred pounds all their life time, <hi>which they ſent to the godly Ministers here and there diſperſed through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be diſtributed amongst the poor and neceſſitated Chriſtians in thoſe parts, and this was the practice of the old rich Puritans of ENGLAND;</hi> yea, <hi>many of them maintained a preaching ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Minister in ſome blind corner of the Kingdome at their own charges;</hi> others of them <hi>alwaies entertained one ſilenced Miniſter or other, or took poor neceſſitated Christians children into their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and bred them as their own:</hi> I can ſpeak much to the praiſe of God and to many of their immortall honours upon my own experience concerning <hi>the charity of the old Puritans of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,</hi> who ever kept their ranks, whatſoever their wealth and riches were, and would never exceed in houſhold-ſtuffe, in fare, or diet, whatſoever their hoſpitality was; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was many times very great; and this order and decency they obſerved out of conſcience, and that they might the better relieve the neceſſities of others; <hi>and this was the way the old Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans of ENGLAND, to my knowledge, walked in, and this was the way of righteouſneſſe as approved on and commanded by God himſelfe, and yet the old Puritans of ENGLAND knew their Chriſtian liberty and what right they had to the creature, as well as any Sectary or Independent in our times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we compare the Independents and Sectaries, in reſpect of this cuſtome, with the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> we ſhall not find them <hi>the old Puritans of ENGLAND overgrown,</hi> that is, <hi>to exceed them in all theſe graces of charity, wiſdome, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, frugality, and orderly walking every one according to</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:25"/>
               <hi>that rank and ſtation God hath placed them in:</hi> for the Sectaries have all of them changed this ancient cuſtome and way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and are all run, as in their opinions, into the way of error, ſo in this, into the by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>path of luxury and ſenſuality: So that the Sectaries generally, although the greateſt part of them through the Kingdome as it is well known, are ſuch <hi>as are but newly ſprung up out of the ruines of the State, and that were never borne to any thing,</hi> yea many of them, before the troubles of the Kingdome, <hi>having ſcarce bread to put in their mouths;</hi> yet now are grown to ſuch a height of pride and luxury and ſumptuoſity, that you ſhall find their houſes furniſhed rather like Noblemen and Peers, then ordinary men; and ye ſhall ſee more plate in their dwellings, and all things with more bravery and elegancy, <hi>then in the pallaces of the Grandees of the Earth;</hi> and their fare and dietis ſo delicious, and ſet out with ſuch curioſity of cookery and all things corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to it, in reſpect of all ſorts of wines and dilicacies and whatſoever rarities the ſeaſons and time of the year will afford, as they exceed the very Princes of the world, by report of thoſe that have been at their entertainments; ſo that <hi>Dives</hi> in all his glory exceeded them not. Yea, it is well known and can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>that many of them that were never born to three halfpence a year of inheritance, nor never were worth any thing but what they have got in theſe troubleſome times by the ruines and miſeries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that theſe very fellows <hi>are taſters to all the Noblemen and Peers of the Kingdome:</hi> And their very Predicants are grown ſo dainty that they muſt be ſerved before the Lords and mighty rich men in all markets; for they will outbid the greateſt of them for the ſatisfying of their pallates: So that whatſoever rarities, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeverall ſeaſons of the year, whether from ſea or land, are ſtirring, they are ordinarily the men that have the firſt <hi>guſto</hi> of them; So that they exceed the daintyeſt and moſt delicate Dames and Ladies, by the relation of thoſe that are acquainted with their diets; ſo that all fine things are taſted and eat in their houſes before they are ſo much as heard of in Noblemens Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whereas the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> denyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all theſe things, who were uſually, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>the firſt that were laſt ſerved.</hi>

            <p>This I have heard affirmed by great Gentlemen and travellers, very gallant men, that were ſometime very intimate with the
<pb facs="tcp:48122:25"/>
Sectaries and Independents, whoſe familiarity they made uſe of onely to pry into their ſeverall humours, and whom the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had ſome hope to have gained to their party; and therefore <hi>ſpared not in their entertainments;</hi> theſe very Gentlemen, <hi>I</hi> ſay, have aſſerted unto me, <hi>that whatſoever things were thought ſome ten years ſince to be rarities in all Princes, Dukes, Marqueſſes, and Noblemens houſes, and were rarely to be found in any other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they met dayly with them in every ordinary Independent and Sectaries houſe upon all occaſions;</hi> So that they vowed unto me, they thought them the onely <hi>Helieogabaliſts</hi> in the world, and the greateſt <hi>Senſualiſts;</hi> and they obſerved that generally there was more luxurious entertainments now amongſt them in theſe times that called for mourning and faſting, then ever were in the richeſt Subjects houſes in the times of the Kingdomes proſperity; So that if ever there were a generation of men in the world that in their fulneſſe of bread and in their felicity forgot the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they were the Independents and Sectaries who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes feaſting, which was one of the principall cauſes, as they profeſt unto me, that made them beleeve <hi>they were not the onely Saints, their actions being ſo unſaint-like;</hi> which made them alſo pry farther into their dealings and proceedings, which they found <hi>to be altogether contrary unto the royall law of Love:</hi> for as they ſaid, all their charity was ever limited within the confines of their own fraternity, and to ſuch onely as were either of their party or they had hopes to gain; in all which things they are different from the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND, who walked in that way of righteouſneſſe which teacheth every man a moderation and right uſe of the creature, and to keep within their bounds, and to extend their charity towards all, especially towards the poor and indigent;</hi> and not to ſpend all upon themſelves in luxury and vanity, and that at ſuch times as call for mourning and faſting, and when there are ſuch multitudes of diſtreſſed godly families as are drove from houſe and home and have been made a prey to the ſpoilers, whom the Sectaries will ſee lie famiſhing in the ſtreets, rather then they ſhall receive the leaſt reliefe from them, unleſſe they will become of their fraternity, which many of them to my knowledge out of meer neceſſity were forced to be, or elſe they could not have had the leaſt reliefe from them, <hi>which is not the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and that way God hath chalked out through his holy Word
<pb facs="tcp:48122:26"/>
for all his Saints and Servants to walk in, ſaying, that they ſhould always have the poor amongſt them, and that their charity ſhould be extended to all; and therefore commands all his ſervants <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. ver. 48. <hi>to be perfect as their heavenly father is perfect,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 44, 45, 46, 47. injoyning them, <hi>That they ſhould love their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and bleſſe them that curſe them, and do good to them that hate them, and pray for them that despightfully uſe them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them.</hi> And telling all his ſervants, <hi>That by their ſo doing, they ſhall ſhew themſelves to be children indeed of their heavenly father, who makes his Sun to riſe on the evill and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the just and on the unjuſt;</hi> ſaying, <hi>If you love them only that love you, what reward have you? Do not even the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans the ſame? And if you ſalute your brethren only, what do you more then others? Do not even the Publicans ſo?</hi> And then the Lord ſet before all his people his own example for their imitation, <hi>to teach them to do good unto all;</hi> and this <hi>was the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe the old Puritans of ENGLAND walked in, doing good to all;</hi> which the Sectaries have quite forſaken: For it can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently be proved, <hi>that all their charity is confined to thoſe of their ſeverall ſects:</hi> So that if at any time they have been ſent unto and ſolicited by ſuch as knew how wealthy they were, and able to relieve others, and how ready alſo and open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hearted and handed they had formerly been (which was their praiſe and honour) to the relieving of any that were in neceſſity, eſpecially if they were godly; thoſe men, <hi>I</hi> ſay, having no ability to relieve them, they being themſelves poor, yet with ſpeciall recommendations, as perfectly knowing them to be ſuch as feared God, ſent them to ſuch of the Sectaries as they knew were very able, and at that time very free to all thoſe that were neceſſitated of their own party, yet could not obtain the leaſt reliefe from them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of others, though withall they made known unto them, that thoſe they commended unto their charity had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved many, and were now brought to that great poverty, that they had not bread to put in their own mouths nor their childrens bellies, through the cruelty &amp; robbery of their barbarous enemies, and were eſcaped only with their lives; <hi>I</hi> ſay, notwithſtanding all the importunity of thoſe that ſolicited thoſe Sectaries, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great indigency and preſent neceſſity they were all in, they could not extort the leaſt reliefe from them, it being
<pb facs="tcp:48122:26"/>
replyed and anſwered, <hi>that they had enough to relieve of their own,</hi> telling them, that they ſhould go to thoſe that were of their own party, and to the Collectors in every pariſh; ſaying, that they muſt have a care of ſuch as were in Church fellowſhip with them; and thus they have ſhut up all bowels of compaſſion to all thoſe that are of a different opinion from themſelves, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all thoſe that are of the Presbyterian way, as can be proved by innumerable witneſſes. Yea, they are come to ſuch a height of indignation againſt the Presbyterians, and ſo far they are from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving any of them, as they will wiſh their ruine, <hi>and this is the way the Sectaries now walk in, which is not the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe nor of the old Puritans of ENGLAND;</hi> for the way of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> is, <hi>that they ſhould love their enemies, and do good to them that hate them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all the Independents ſay that the Presbyterians hate them, for ſo in their very prayers they intimate to God himſelfe, that I may now returne to that prayer I formerly mentioned made by the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Brother at the great Veniſon Feaſt on the Lords day in one of the grand Sectaries houſes, where all their Church was entertained: He in his prayer ſpake unto God in this manner, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they (meaning the Presbyterians) hate us, becauſe we know more of thee then they doe; we beſeech thee Lord give us to know yet more of thee, and then let them hate us more if they will,</hi> &amp;c. Here we ſee they complaine unto God himſelfe (though falſely) that we hate them; now if they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the way of Righteouſneſſe that God hath appointed them to walke in, they ſhould doe us good and pray for us, and not be ſo uncharitable as to pray againſt us, and to requite evill for evill, which is the way they walke in, and which was not the way of the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> who had better learned their Leſſon of love and charity. But now to conſider this prayer a little, and ſome other of their expreſſions, and the high prayſes that upon all occaſions they give of themſelves, by all which it will yet the better appeare that they are not the old <hi>Puritans of</hi> England <hi>over-grown in goodneſſe, and exceeding them in ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and in all points of piety, godlineſſe, and charity, and in truth and righteouſneſſe;</hi> for this very prayer of theirs, with their other ſpeeches and practices, proclame to the world the quite contrary; for I affirme, firſt that the old Puritans never
<pb facs="tcp:48122:27"/>
magnified their owne graces: And ſecondly, that both this prayer and many of their other prayers to God, &amp; prayſes of themſelves, are both untrue, Phariſaicall and uncharitable; for the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians doe not hate them, as they falſely accuſe them, but it is they that hate the Presbyterians, as all their words and actions, and Pamphlets can teſtifie. The Presbyterians as they are bound, hate all falſe wayes, but they hate not the perſons of any, that is the practice of all the Sectaries, as it is well knowne. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Brother ſaid, that they knew more of God then the Presbyterians, it is moſt falſe; for all the workes and writings of the Presbyterians in all the Reformed Churches can prove and witneſſe the contrary, ſo that the Sectaries are all of them beholding to the learned Workes and Writings of the Presbyterians for all that is in any of them worthy the name of knowledge, out of whoſe learned Bookes they have ſtole it; and I undertake it, and ſhall ever by the grace of God be able to make it good, that in all their preachments they deliver nothing that can deſervedly be called truth, but it hath beene taught by the Presbyterians before they were borne, and that far better then any of them can teach it; and it is moſt certaine that there is more knowledge in ſome one of <hi>Calvins</hi> Workes, as that of his <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi> then is in all the Independents and Sectaries put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which very Booke alone, with the Holy Scripture had it beene diligently read and ſtudied by the people, the Independents and Sectaries, with all their plots and devices could never have gained an hundred Proſelytes. Yea, if young Divines would but well reade and ſtudy learned Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> Workes, and but <hi>Gualter Tigurinus</hi> his Writings, with <hi>Peter Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Zanchius,</hi> paſſing by thouſands of other moſt learned and orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, I ſay if they would but diligently reade and ſtudy theſe I have now named, the Independents would never be able with all their skill to ſeduce any one of them. Or did but ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now adayes, reade but <hi>Calvins Inſtitutions,</hi> and but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Perkins</hi> upon <hi>Iude,</hi> with the Holy Scripture, they would quickly relinquiſh all their Independent companies, and their new gathered Churches, and would ſoone perceive that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries know not more of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt then the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians doe; and if poore deluded ſoules would but carefully and ſeriouſly reade the learned Writings of our owne countrey
<pb facs="tcp:48122:27"/>
men, as the Workes of Reverend Maſter <hi>Richard Rogers,</hi> of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dod,</hi> Maſter <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham,</hi> Maſter <hi>George Walker,</hi> Maſter <hi>Bolton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Iackſon</hi> of <hi>Woodſtreet,</hi> Maſter <hi>Scudder,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bal,</hi> or any one of a thouſand of our godly Divines that have writ before theſe Sectaries appeared in the world, they would find that for all both Theoricall and Practicall Divinity, they knew as much of God, yea farre more then any Independents and Sectaries in the world: And yet this is the daily language of the Sectaries, both in their prayers and in their prattle, that any one of their congregationall way, knowes more then a thouſand Presbyterians; yea, they have beene often heard ſay, that every boy and woman in their ſociety can confute any Presbyterian; and upon all occaſions they ſay that they never heard ſo much of Jeſus Chriſt before theſe Sectaries appeared, affirming, that free grace was never ſo richly taught, as it is now by the Independents, when notwithſtanding it is moſt certaine that for all ſaving knowledge whatſoever can be taught or ſpake concerning the knowledge of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein conſiſts life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17, it hath beene a thouſand times better taught, and farre more orthodoxly by the Presbyterians then the Sectaries can teach it; and therefore when they ſay, that never ſo much of Jeſus Chriſt and of free grace was taught before theſe times, it is not only injurious to all the Proteſtant Divines at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and exceedingly derogatory to them all; but to all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets and bleſſed Apoſtles which have taught us as much concerning God and Jeſus Chriſt, as in the wiſdome of God himſelfe was thought fit for mortall men to know of God and Chriſt, whether wee ſpeake either of <hi>the divine Eſſence of God, or of the perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, or of the glorious Workes, names, titles and attributes of God, or whether we ſpeake of both the natures of Ieſus Chriſt, the divine and humane nature, or of the hypoſtaticall union of them both, or of what Chriſt hath either done or ſuffered for us, or of his offices, either Kingly, Prieſtly, or Propheticall, or of whatſoever is neceſſarily to bee knowne for our ſalvation:</hi> I ſay and affirme, that whatſoever is requiſite for our learning, is abundantly and clearly ſet downe in the Holy Word of God, by the holy Prophets and bleſſed Apoſtles, and hath faithfully and orthodoxly beene taught and delivered by our holy, godly, painfull, and learned Presbyterian Miniſters in all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:48122:28"/>
Churches beyond the Seas, and in theſe Churches of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that far better, and more ſoundly and ſolidly then ever it was or can be taught by any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries; for it is well knowne, that our religious Presbyterian Miniſters had as much of the aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit, as ever any Sectaries had, and far more learning then they are either ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, or can attaine unto; and therefore it is not truly nor humbly ſpake by the Independents, continually to ſay they know more of God then they, and to aſſert that Jeſus Chriſt, and free grace was never ſo much, and ſo well taught, as by the Sectaries; and yet theſe are their daily brags and boaſts, and by the which they with-draw multitudes of ſimple people to their Predicants and Tub-men, and then under pretence of preaching Jeſus Chriſt and free grace, they teach their errors and hereſies, and vent all their blaſphemous doctrines, and deſtructive opinions amongſt them to the deſtroying of their poore ſoules. But ſhould I grant unto theſe men (which were wickedneſſe in me to doe) that they did truly and indeed preach Jeſus Chriſt and free grace, yet to ſay that they preached them more clearly, more fully, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ever they were formerly taught, is not farre from blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and exceedingly injurious and derogatory to the holy Scripture; for all knowledge that wee are to take notice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and Chriſt, is ſhut up and contained in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, out of whoſe confines we are not to ſeeke for any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning either God or Chriſt; for wee have a ſpeciall command given us by Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and we are ſent to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets by Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Luke</hi> 16. 29. and in the 8. of <hi>Iſaiah, wee are ſent to the Law and the teſtimony,</hi> ſo that they that ſpeake <hi>not according to that word, it is becauſe there is no light in them;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Galat.</hi> 8, 9. ſaith <hi>that if an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach us any other doctrine concerning Ieſus Chriſt then that which wee have heard, and learned in the holy Scriptures, we ſhould count him accurſed;</hi> and therefore if the Sectaries and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents teach but according to the holy Scripture, then all they teach concerning Chriſt and free grace was taught long before any of the Sectaries were borne, and all they ſay boaſtingly vaunting of this their owne knowledge and preaching, and of theſe their new wayes, they are not the way of Righteouſneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:48122:28"/>
which teaches all men meanly and humbly to think of themſelves, <hi>and in honour to prefer others before themſelves,</hi> Rom. 12, ver. 10. <hi>and in lowlineſſe of mind, to eſteeme others better then themſelves, Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 3, 4. and this is the way of Righteouſneſſe God hath appointed his people to walke in, and this was the way the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> kept in, who never boaſted they knew more of God and Jeſus Chriſt then their Chriſtian Brethren, as the Independents and Sectaries daily doe, which is the very height of Phariſaicall pride in them to aſſume theſe Prerogativesunto themſelves, and to receive them from others as to be the only <hi>Teachers and Preachers of Ieſus Chriſt and free grace, and to be the moſt illuminated and eminent Saints and ſervants of Chriſt, and the moſt excellent lights,</hi> which titles are given lately to the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> diſſenting brethren by one of the Sectaries in a frothy Pamphlet, called <hi>Independency no Schiſme,</hi> in a pretended anſwer to Maſter <hi>Iohn Vicars,</hi> who hath writ nothing concerning them but what is <hi>Vox populi,</hi> and moſt of it knowne to all men to be true: Yea, they are growne to that height of pride and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie that they vent their ſingular knowledge of divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries above others, as we may ſee in Saint <hi>Dels</hi> Epiſtle to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before his Sermon, (where he ſpeaketh) <hi>of the great familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he hath with Ieſus Chriſt, and of ſome rare knowledge that hee hath received from him of the mind and boſome of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. theſe are his own words, and he eſteems of his Presbyterian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren as of the off-ſcouring of the world, ſaying, <hi>that he was counted worthy to be taken into ſome Fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings, and to endure the contradictions of ſinners, and oft times to encounter the rage and madneſſe of men, yea and to fight with men after the manner of beaſts, altogether brutiſh and furious.</hi> This high eſteeme S. <hi>Del</hi> hath of himſelfe, and counts all his Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian brethren, though in all mens judgements that know them he writes againſt, far more pious and orthodox then himſelfe, but brute beaſts. Now becauſe theſe men talke ſo much of their ſingular knowledge before their Presbyterian Brethren, and of that great familiarity they have with Chriſt, and what tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent knowledge they have received from the mind and boſome of the Father, it will not be amiſſe here to recite ſome paſſages of that ſeraphicall Doctors Sermons, he preacheth in the Army.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:29"/>
If this be the knowledge the Sectaries vaunt ſo much of, and if theſe be the things they pretend they have received <hi>from the mind and boſome of the Father,</hi> I muſt confeſſe in theſe their notions they out-ſtrip the knowledge of the Saints of old, and of all the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and of the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> who were ignorant of them all, which was a learned ignorance in them, knowing that God the Father taught a far different do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to his people, as I ſhewed a little before, and ſhall more fully declare in the inſuing Diſcourſe. But this I will againe and againe aſſert, that neither the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> nor our godly Presbyterians now, are inferiour to any of the Sectaries for an holy and conſcionable outward walking in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or in the knowledge of God or of Jeſus Chriſt, or in any kind of knowledge that may truly be called learning or ſcience, whatſoever the Independents and Sectaries may glory and boaſt of themſelvs; &amp; I do farther aſſert that al the godly Presbyters in the church of <hi>England</hi> do preach Jeſus Chriſt, faith &amp; repentance, and free grace, and that in every Congregation upon all occaſions more orthodoxly, ſolidly, ſincerely and learnedly, with all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall divinity, then ever any of the Sectaries did or can doe; and therefore they do not know more of God then the Presbyterians doe, as that <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Brother phariſaically and falſely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and all the Sectaries with him vaunt. So that I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why wee may not here make uſe of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words concerning this buſines, who in the ſecond of the <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. v. 7. 12. 18. <hi>Doe you looke on things after the outward appearance</hi> (ſaith he)? <hi>if any man truſts to himſelfe that hee is Chriſt's, let him of himſelfe thinke this againe, that as he is Chriſt's, even ſo are wee Chriſt's. For we doe not make our ſelves of the number, or compare our ſelves with ſome that commend themſelvs, but they meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves amongſt themſelves are not wiſe (or underſtand not) for not he that commendeth himſelfe is approved, but whom the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth.</hi> So that it ſeemes by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, not only in this Epiſtle but in others, that the falſe Apoſtles and Seducers of his time had ſome high eſteeme of themſelves, and of their own holineſſe, knowledge and abilities above others, yea above the Apoſtles themſelves, as the Independents and Sectaries of our times have of their great piety and ſufficiencie above their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

as all their words, Pamphlets and Vindications daily wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in which they ſlight all that oppoſe their novelties, and ſtile them vaine men, and ſuch as neither know what to ſay, norhow to hold their peace, vilifying them all as the off-ſcouring, and things of nought, which practice of theirs when it was blamed in the falſe Apoſtles as ſinfull, it cannot be prayſe-worthy in the Sectaries now in our times, who walke in that way of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe thoſe falſe Teachers then did, and contrary to that rule preſcribed by God, <hi>which is to preferre others before themſelves in honour,</hi> which way the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> walked in, and not in the way of the falſe Apoſtles, and the Sectaries of our times; for they kept the road way, and the royall way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>eſteeming of their brethren better then of themſelves.</hi> But the world was never without ſuch a ſort of men: for <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaks of the like, <hi>There is a generation of men</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and how lofty are their eyes, and their eye-lids lifted up?</hi> and of ſuch creatures Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, <hi>ver.</hi> 22 which made him compare himſelfe with them after this maner; <hi>are they Hebrewes?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo am I; are they Iſraelites? ſo am I; are they the ſeed of</hi> Abraham? <hi>ſo am I; are they the Miniſters of Chriſt?</hi> I ſpeake (ſaith he) <hi>as a foole, I am more,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the holy Apoſtle laughs at theſe ſeducers and vaine boaſters, and to make them more aſhamed, he compares himſelfe with them, not fearing to be counted a Jeerer and ſcorner of piety and religion, though hee made himſelfe merry with them, whom he knew very well for all the ſhewes they made of being the Miniſters of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that they were a company of Impoſtors, and therefore aſſimilates and likens them to the Devill; for the which if he had lived in our times hee would have been termed a boyſterous and froward ſpirited man, ſhameleſſe, deſerving the name of <hi>Creten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> againſt whom there would have come out many vindications, telling him that it became not the gravity and wiſdom of old age, and an old profeſſor of Religion to charge, and that publickly, his brethren of unworthy double dealing, and unfaithfulneſſe, though they were all guilty of thoſe crimes. And therefore I ſee no reaſon why any godly conſcientious man ſhould now fear to uſe the ſame method with the deceivers and ſeducers of theſe our times, that <hi>Paul</hi> did with thoſe in his dayes, and to laugh at them; for it would be an abuſe of gravity to ſpend it upon them who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

glorie of their parts, knowledge and ſanctity, as the ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, as by the Apoſtles expreſſions through all his Epiſtles is manifeſt, ſeeing it is well known that the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Sectaries of our times in their words and very prayers, and in all their vindications &amp; Pamphlets confeſſe, that they <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from us as an unholy people, &amp; that they know more of God then the Presbyterians, and that all their brethren are the only protious and holy people, and the godly party, the Saints; and for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Paſtors they account them the only Preachers of Ieſus Chriſt and of free grace, the moſt illuminated and eminent Saints and ſervants of Chriſt, and the moſt excellent Lights,</hi> all which their expreſſions move mee without feare of being counted a jeerer and ſcorner of piety and religion (which from my ſoule I reverence and honour in all in whom I truly ſee and diſcerne thoſe graces) to make uſe of the Apoſtles example, and to laugh at their grolleries, and imitate him in comparing the Presbyterians with the Independents and Sectaries, which I am confident I may doe without any juſt offence, and therefore with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> I ſay unto all the Sectaries and Independents, whether people or Miniſters, <hi>doe any of them looke on things after the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? if they truſt to themſelves that they are in Chriſt, let them alſo thinke this againe, that as they are in Chriſt, even ſo are the Presbyterians Chriſt's; are they beleevers? ſo are the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; are they Iſraelites? the people that wrestle with God day and night by prayers and ſupplications, and by groanes of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and teares prevaile with God? ſo doe the Presbyterians; are they the ſeed of</hi> Abraham? <hi>the children of the faithfull, and doe they walke in</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſteps? ſo are the Presbyterians as well the children of the faithfull as they, and walke as carefully, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouſly, and unblamably in all manner of converſation before God and towards all men; and therefore in nothing inferiour to them, if the Sectaries and Independents be really and indeed ſuch as they pretend to be; are the Independent Predicants and Pastors, Ministers of Christ? I may truly ſay the Presbyterian Ministers are more, as having had the honour of the converſion of them all, the ſeale of true Ministers, if they were ever truly converted, and of many hundred thouſands beſides, and they are more orthodox Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; yea, ſuch as ſtood to their Miniſtry faithfully, and indured the heate and brunt of the day, when all the Miniſters of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:31"/>
               <hi>for the moſt part either ran away, or hid their heads, or moſt baſely temporized, as the whole Kingdome knows.</hi> So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they can ſpeake of themſelves, in reſpect either of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, graces, or priviledges, or in regard of gifts or indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Presbyterians with far greater reaſon, and with farre better right, and without any vaine gloriation (giving the praiſe of all they have unto God) may challenge unto themſelves, and may truly ever ſay, <hi>doe the Independents and Sectaries hope to bee ſaved? The Presbyterians beleeve, that through the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, they alſo ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Act. 15. 15. <hi>God having put no difference betweene them and his choſen people the Iewes, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying their hearts by faith, verſe</hi> 9. So that I ſay, whatſoever the Independents and Sectaries can vainly glory in, or boaſt, of the Presbyterians can truly in all humility, and with farre better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpeake of themſelvs, yea and truly apply it unto themſelves; ſo that there is no juſt ground why all the Sectaries ſhould thus daily brag of their gifts and graces, and of the ſingularity of their parts, and priviledges, and of their familiarity with Jeſus Chriſt, and of their holineſſe and piety, appropriating all thoſe prerogatives to themſelves, and excluding all their Presbyterian brethren from partaking in them, making them all no ſharers in them, procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them all the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſonnes of <hi>Belial.</hi> I ſay and aſſert, that I can ſee no reaſon why they ſhould thus make impropriations of all the priviledges and immunities of the true Saints unto themſelves, and confine all the graces of God to their owne party, and rob all their brethren of all their Chriſtian excellencies, as they in the Army ſpoyle and rob all the Presbyterian ſouldiers of their due honour and prayſes in all thoſe glorious victories God had crowned that whole Army with, and aſcribing all the glory and honour of them all to themſelves, which they call the godly party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſay,</hi> I canſee no good reaſon of all theſe their practices; for <hi>thus did not the Saints of old, thus did not the old Puritans of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>aſſume to themſelves to be the only people of God, preferring themſelves before their brethren upon all occaſions; they walked all of them in the way of righteouſneſſe that God had appointed them to walk in,</hi> which was, <hi>to give every one their due, and to love as brethren,</hi> Rom. 12, which was not to ſeparate from the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of their brethren, <hi>counting themſelves more holy then they,</hi>

               <hi>for the which they have neither precept nor allowable preſident in all Gods holy Word;</hi> and therefore I may truly conclude of them <hi>they are not in this their practice the old Puritans of ENGLAND overgrown, exceeding them in vertue or in the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they went in,</hi> though they come to us in gray heads, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto us in moſt glorious gravity and in the beauty of old men. For in all theſe proceedings that I have now named, and in many more that I could enumerate, <hi>they are not in the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in the paths of the Saints of old, and in the way of the old Puritans of ENGLAND and like them,</hi> but they may be truly compared, whatſoever they glory of themſelves, <hi>to the enemies of the true Saints,</hi> I mean <hi>the Seducers in all ages, and with the Jeſuites and all Popelins,</hi> whoſe actions and examples they better know how to imitate, then the actions and lives of the <hi>Saints of old, and the old Puritant of ENGLAND,</hi> for they tread rather in the ſteps of the Jeſuites, as the following particulars and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of all thoſe juglers and impoſtors will manifeſt.</p>
            <p>For firſt, as the Jeſuites and Papiſts ſeparate from all our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies <hi>counting themſelves the onely Catholicks, and all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations Hereticall and all us Heretiques.</hi> Even ſo do the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries deal with us, <hi>they ſeparate from our Churches as prophane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, eſteeming themſelves the onely Saints, and their new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations the only Churches in which Chriſt is ſet up as King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne.</hi> And as the Jeſuites and Papiſts magnifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Maſters <hi>for the onely ſeraphicall Doctors, and in all their writings boast of their eminent learning, and ſlight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn all the Proteſtant writers as nothing; ſo do the Independents and Sectaries highly magnifie themſelves, and eſteem of all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians as the off-ſcouring of the earth, making them, the ſillyeſt creatures of the world in compariſon of themſelves,</hi> as in all their Vindications and forthy Pamphle s dayly appeareth; yea, they write againſt them with more then an epiſcopall pride; So that in all theſe their dealings they are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nſt pardon me <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> if I ſhall aſſay, according to an old Proverb, with one ſtroke of Phocions hatchet, to cut in two the long thred of your Alcibiadian fluent and luxuriant Rhetorications. <hi>Thus he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſeems to deſire that he and <hi>I</hi> may try out the truth of what <hi>I</hi> have written by the dint of the ſword of the Scripture: and I ſay as <hi>David</hi> did in another ſenſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 9.) <hi>There is none like that;</hi> but he immediately forſakes that weapon and betakes himſelfe to <hi>Phocions hatchet,</hi> and that is his Pole-ax. Truly I exceedingly pity him, <hi>who ſtrives to maintain a way that brings him into ſuch a ſtraight that he cannot cut in two the arguments brought againſt him without a hatchet:</hi> whereas the Sword of the holy Scripture is ſharp enough <hi>to cut in two with one ſtroke any erroneous arguments:</hi> For <hi>the Word of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper then any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and spirit, and of the joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is a diſcoverer of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. But he knowing very well, <hi>that with the ſword of the ſpirit</hi> (which is the Word of God <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 17.) <hi>though it be a two-edged ſword,</hi> &amp;c. that he could never cut in two with that weapon my arguments, the truth and ſtrength of them being drawn out of the Word of God upon which I have grounded all my aſſertions, which is a ſure unmoveable and impregnable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; therefore laying aſide the ſword of the Scripture, <hi>he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours with an unknown hatchet</hi> (a deſperate carnall weapon) and to pleaſe himſelf he aſſays <hi>to chop, hack and mangle my arguments,</hi> which he is never able to cut in two with all his ſtrength and ſtrokes. Surely none but a bad cauſe, and an unwarrantable way had need to make uſe of ſuch a weapon.</p>
            <p>Now for the Presbyterians, as their way is warrantable being grounded on the holy Scripture, the good Word of God, the practice of the Apoſtles, and all the Churches conſtituted by them; ſo <hi>the weapons of their warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4. And for my part, I am reſolved never to uſe any other but that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly weapon (the ſharp ſword of the ſpirit) for the hewing and pulling down of all the ſtrong holds of the Independents and
<pb facs="tcp:48122:33"/>
               <hi>Sectaries, and for the dividing and cutting in two all their errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions,</hi> and by the help of my God and through the power of his might and by his aſſiſting grace I ſhall never doubt, but by the dint of that ſword ever be able to try it out with my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all thoſe of his fraternity, and to oppoſe any adverſaries of the truth, and to make no long work of it, and alwayes to be ſufficiently armed to maintain it and all the wayes of God which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſuffered for, and still continue to hold forth and perſevere to walk in.</p>
            <p>Now before <hi>I</hi> conclude, <hi>I</hi> cannot but ſpeak ſomething upon this occaſion concerning <hi>Phocion</hi> whom my brother <hi>Burton</hi> makes mention of, that <hi>I</hi> may informe the Reader a little of the truth of that ſtory, and to ſhew that he is miſtaken concerning that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbiall ſpeech; but how fitly it belongs unto my brother <hi>Burton</hi> the ſequell of the diſcourſe will declare. Now he repreſents this <hi>Phocion</hi> to the world as if he had bin ſuch another creatures as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> was, and that as he had his club by which he did many pretty feals, ſo he ſpeaks of <hi>Phocion</hi> as if he had had his hatchet likewiſe. But <hi>Eraſmus</hi> a man better skill'd in all Hiſtories and in the Annals of the times, then my brother <hi>Burton</hi> or any of his way, who are for the moſt part ſtrangers and enemies to all good litterature, out of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſetting down the truth of that ſtory, <hi>deſcribes</hi> Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion <hi>to have been ſome Sectary in Philoſophie, but yet ſuch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall and worthleſſe one, that</hi> Demoſthenes <hi>speaking of him, ſaith, That</hi> Phocions <hi>Arguments were ſo far from having any ſtrength or validity in them to perſwade any man to imbrace his doctrine and opinion, that by the weakneſſe of them and the contradicting of himſelfe and the fond handling of the controverſie, he affirmeth, that</hi> Phocion <hi>was his own executioner, and the only hatchet of his own Arguments, and who oppoſed, yea overthrew his own principles: Phocion (ſaith</hi> Demoſthenes) <hi>is his own hatchet to deſtroy and cut in ſunder his own Arguments.</hi> The words of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> relating that ſtory are theſe, <hi>In adagiis</hi> Eraſmi <hi>printed</hi> Hanoviae M. D. C. XVII. <hi>fol.</hi> 485. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> (ſaith he) Phocionem <hi>appellare ſolet ſuorum Argumentorum ſecurim.</hi> Thus <hi>Eraſmus</hi> expreſſeth him ſelf touching that buſineſſe. And this is the true ſtory concerning that matter in <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who makes <hi>Phocion the hatchet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of his own Arguments.</hi> Now my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Phocion,</hi> as if indeed he had been armed with ſuch a weapon to
<pb facs="tcp:48122:33"/>
incounter his enemies withall, which was nothing ſo. But the ſtory may truly be verified in my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> who is indeed like <hi>Phocion</hi> and is his own executioner and the very hatchet of his own arguments, that really divides the head and heart of all his own and of all the Independents doctrine; ſo that <hi>I</hi> may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of him, <hi>that he hath not onely ſorely and deſperately wounded his own cauſe, but abſolutely murthered and taken away the life of Independency;</hi> Yea, whiles with this hatchet he came out againſt me <hi>to cut in two the long thred</hi> (as he ſpeaks) <hi>of my Alcibiadian fluent and luxuriant Rhetorications, and to wound me ſoul and body,</hi> he hath wounded himſelfe and all his brethren <hi>under the fifth ribb;</hi> and that when he ſeemed in love to take them all by their great white basket-hilted beards to kiſſe them; &amp; that which I now ſay of him, I am confident that all thoſe that ſhall vouchſafe to read the inſuing diſcourſe without prejudice, and ſee what <hi>I</hi> have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to him and all thoſe of his ſociety, will ſay.</p>
            <p>It is uſuall with all the Independents to ſay of any Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians that write againſt their wicked practices and novelties, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do it with moſt ſingular reaſon, wiſdome, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and with all evidence of demonſtration, that by their writing againſt their wayes they not only wronged themſelves and the Presbyterian cauſe, and that very much, but that they have been a great occaſion of increaſing Independents and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their party, when notwithſtanding it is well known to the judicious and learned that they have given the Sectaries a fatall blow by diſcovering the vanities and errors of their wayes to all men. But what the Independents and Sectaries falſly vaunt in this point, (as they do of their graces and vertues) may truly be ſaid of Maſter <hi>Knollys, I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any men have wronged their cauſe, and advanced their adverſe party, they have done it; as <hi>I</hi> am confident all they will ſay that ſhall deliberately read the following diſcourſe; for there they ſhall ſee how they not only upon all occaſions contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and through their ignorance and temerity overthrow their own principles, and are enemies to their own cauſe; but how they like the <hi>Midianites</hi> deſtroy one another with their own ſwords, and at that time when they thinke mortally to wound their adverſaries and utterly to vanquiſh them and to obtaine the victory.</p>

               <hi>All that I have more in this place to add, is this,</hi> That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all men ſeriouſly to look about them: and as they will not be deterred by any art of perſwaſion when either their lands or estates are queſtioned from ſearching into their evidences and the laſt wills and teſtaments of their fathers, Parents, and friends that gave them their inheritances, ſo they ought not by any perſwaſions of men to be diſſwaded now to ſearch the good will and teſtament of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father and all the evidences of holy Writ, and to ſee what all their adverſaries can pretend againſt their right &amp; juſt title to them. <hi>Let them ever make thoſe living Oracles</hi> Act. <hi>7. their Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, they will adviſe them for their preſent good and ſhew them the right way to their eternall &amp; everlaſting Patrimony the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory.

Now I have made good proviſion of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of your way not many weeks ſince, being in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall</hi> ſpeaking to a Reverend Presbyterian Miniſter in a vapouring manner, ſaid, <hi>that the Independents were exceedingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to me and Reverend Mr.</hi> Edwards, affirming, <hi>that we bred more Indpendents then any two of the Kingdom beſides; and this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to be true, not only becauſe I know the honeſty of the man, but becauſe I find it printed by one of your brethren, that Biſhop</hi> Wren <hi>was not more miſchievous to the Prelacy, then Master</hi> Edwards <hi>hath beene to the Presbytery,</hi> and becauſe Maſter <hi>Weld</hi> a

wonderfull learned man writ unto me not long ſince, <hi>wondring who hired me to make ſo many Independents,</hi> (whoſe worthy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles may happily within theſe few weeks ſee the light) and in this regard I doe perſwade my ſelfe that thoſe Independents did uſe ſuch words as theſe to that Miniſter in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Miniſter alſo related unto me moreover that they ſaid that they underſtood <hi>that I was preparing ſome phyſicke for them, which they doubted not but would be very operative for the breeding and increaſing of Independents, and for the ſtrengthning of more, and therefore they ſaid they were reſolved as ſoone as ever it was made ready for uſe, they would beſtow an hundred pounds upon that and Maſter <hi>Edward's</hi> Bookes, for to ſend through the countrey for the breeding of Independents, and contented not themſelves barely to ſpeake the words, but bound themſelves by a ſolemne proteſtation, that they would doe it;</hi> and therefore that I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>might farther make them beholding to me, which is alſo ſome requitall for all your former courteſies, I have provided phyſick in a very great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and challenge your promiſe; for I preſume that they were but the mouth of their brethren, there being one of your <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> in the company at that time, a man that cannot deny what was promiſed. Now if you be honeſt men indeed, and men of your word, I expect performance according to your promiſe; I will ſee you ſhall have reaſonable penny worths only I muſt tell you, that I will take order, <hi>that the phyſicke be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtributed, and ſent through the Kingdome into all parts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your engagement for the breeding of Independents, that it be not embezeled;</hi> I will undertake that it ſhall carefully be ſent to whatſoever places you ſhall appoint; therefore if yee be Saints indeed as yee pretend, ſtand to your word; for I have good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, and doe not you pretend excuſes for the declining of the buying of my phyſick; for then I will conclude you are but a company of Bragadochoes, neither would I have you as formerly you uſe, to diſparage it, finding fault with it, &amp; my method, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſpenſation, ſaying, <hi>that it is nauſeous, and that in my rules and directions I am full of tautologies and extravagancies, and that it is poore ſtuffe procuring rather vomiting then ſweating, and that their tender stomacks and conſcences cannot digest ſuch phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,</hi> complayning moreover <hi>that it is very deare;</hi> I would not have you now pretend any of theſe things, <hi>I</hi> ſay it is not for your honour, ſeeing you have paſſed your promiſe to buy it, and to
<pb facs="tcp:48122:36"/>
ſend it through the countrey, for the breeding of Independents; for you ſhould have conſidered all theſe things before your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which being paſſed you cannot now with honeſty revoke.</p>
            <p>But as for the tautologies and often repetitions you ſo blame in my method, and ſo much ſpeake of, you of all men ought to excuſe them, <hi>you your ſelves ſo often uſing them, having little elſe in all your writings but tautologies, and vaine repetitions;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially you ought not to blame them in me, when thoſe of your partie have occaſioned them by your frequent objecting the ſame things from ſeverall mouths and pens; for I had to deale with your whole Armie, and with three of your Generals at once, who had read without doubt what each other had writ againſt me, and therefore they picking and chooſing through my booke what they thought they could beſt deale with, they might have ſet upon thoſe parts of my Book that the others had ſaid nothing againſt, but <hi>they making the ſame cavils that the others had done, they put mee upon ſeverall anſwers.</hi> But were it ſo that they had none of them ſeene what each other had writ, yet they treading in the ſame ſteps, and anſwering after their manner to the ſeverall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they oppoſed, <hi>I was ſeverally to reply to all their cavils, that are materially made to the ſeverall Arguments, which I have faithfully done;</hi> and for my part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thought it no burthen, being ever willing, yea reſolved is often and as frequently as I find poyſon laid by any deſtructive creature, to preſcribe an Antitode to it in the ſame place; and for farther anſwer to your meager and ſlender detractions, take notice, <hi>that I value not what you or any Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries can ſay concerning my tautologies, if handling the ſame thing often be thought a tautologie with you;</hi> for this is my reſolution, <hi>that whereſoever, and as often as I find an adverſary hath a tongue to ſpeake againſt the truth, or a pen to write againſt it, were it an hundred times in the ſame place, or in the ſame page, I will</hi> (God aſſiſting me) <hi>anſwer them upon the place I find them, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, I will never refer the Reader to what I have ſaid before in any other place concerning that point;</hi> for I for my part think it a kind of lazineſſe to ſpare any paines in ſo weighty buſineſſes and things of ſo high concernment as theſe are; yea, I think there is but little zeale in that man that ſhall hear the truth, either often blaſphemed or ſpake againſt, <hi>that will not as often ſtand up in defence of it, and contend for it</hi> (according to command, <hi>Iud.</hi> 3.) to his uttermoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yea it would be a means to perſwade unſtable men, that
<pb facs="tcp:48122:36"/>
there were ſome ſtrength in the Arguments of the enemies, or that they are more diligent to ſow errors &amp; tares, then I ſhould be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to root them out &amp; oppoſe them, if I ſhould not as often reply as they cavil, and object; &amp; therfore for my particular it never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles me what any of youcan ſay to me about my tautologies, which are not vaine repetitions to any that love often to heare the ſame truth well confirmed; for allthis will but witneſſe and declare to all men, <hi>that I am a carefull man to uphold the truth, and to reſiſt gain-ſayers; beſides, any man may ſooner reade a reply many times, then turne to an other place, where it was formerly ſpake of, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to;</hi> withall, there will in a ſeverall anſwer to the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in an other place be found ſome variety, both for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and language, which many times begets other excellent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which more and more confirmes men in any truth.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this hath ever beene Gods owne method, which they that are taught of him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. ought to imitate, often to repeate one and the ſame Law; as what he taught his people in <hi>Exodus,</hi> he often reiterates in the ſame Booke, and not in that only, but in <hi>Leviticus</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi> and repeats the whole Law againe in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and that often, to the end they might remember it, &amp; the ſame may be ſaidof al the holy Prophets through the whole Bible, who often reiterate &amp; repeat the ſame things <hi>that the people may not pretend ignorance;</hi> and this I ſay is Gods own method, and therfore worthy of our imitation; yea and Chriſt himſelf uſed this method in his preaching, and dictating unto his Apoſtles by his Holy Spirit, who writ foure Evangels of what he hath both done and ſuffered for us, often repeating the ſame thing; yea, all the holy Apoſtles and pen men of holy Writ uſed the ſame method, as is to be ſeen through the <hi>Acts,</hi> &amp; all their holy Epiſtles, repeating the ſame things according to their ſeveral occaſions, as when either the ſame errors ſprang up in other places, or began to increaſe where they were ſo wen, and ſtarted up; yea, <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth of himſelfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>that to him it is not grievous, but for them ſafe, to write the ſame things.</hi> The ſame method did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> uſe, as yee may ſee in his ſecond Epiſtle; and therefore it is no error in me often to repeate the ſame things, and to inculcate and reinforce the ſame Arguments, eſpecially if it be occaſioned by your ſelves, that by this meanes the truth for which I contend may be the more confirmed, and errors may be the more confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and overthrown. But withall let mee ſay thus much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:48122:37"/>
you by the way, <hi>that although I am conſtrained through your vaine tautologies often to handle the ſame truths; yet it is with ſuch variety, and in ſo diverſe a way, manner and ſtile, as it will not bee grievous or tedious to all thoſe that ſhall reade it with honeſt hearts,</hi> where they will well perceive that what I have anſwered more briefly in one place I have more fully handled in an other; that (if it be poſſible) I might give full ſatisfaction to all docible and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men that will be ſatisfyed, either with Scripture or reaſons.</p>
            <p>Now if in this diſpute there be any expreſſions that may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe any of you, you of all men may well excuſe them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how great your provocations of me have beene; eſpecially, if you conſider that all this contention is for the defence of the truth of God, which yee all have ſought to corrupt, and adulterate with your traditions; in whoſe quarrell, and for the maintenance of whoſe honour it becomes every man to be more zealous, and fuller of animoſity then for his owne; and therefore if I take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeake more freely in ſhewing the vanity, impiety and wickedneſſe of the Deceivers and Impoſtors of theſe times in which we live, it is but to uſe the ſame method the holy Prophets and bleſſed Apoſtles have uſed againſt the falſe teachers of their times, who have expreſſed themſelves in language equivalent to whatſoever they ſhall find in any part of my Booke. Yea, you your ſelves if you but looke upon my Brother <hi>Burtons Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or upon any of his Pamphlets, or indeed upon any of your own ſcriblers in maintenance of your owne vaine errors and novelties, or upon <hi>Iohn Goodwyn,</hi> your famous <hi>Cretenſis,</hi> or the laſt <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that came out againſt Reverend Maſter <hi>Edwards,</hi> you ſhall find them as full of unſavoury expreſſions, as ever people writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any men withall, writing alſo with ſuch elated ſpirits, and with ſo courſe language, as is poſſible for any men to vent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withall, they ordinarily <hi>beginning and continuing their Pamphlets with pride, and ending them with curſing,</hi> as in that late <hi>Vindication</hi> appeareth, where the Author page the firſt, ſaith, <hi>I thought it might not be amiſſe</hi> (ſpeaking of learned Maſter <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) to ſpend an houre or two upon this vaine man.</hi> Here wee find the height of pride, inſolency and diſdaine, and in the 30. page he hath theſe words concerning the ſame man. <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke turbulent and violent ſpirits;</hi> here he ends with curſing cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely, whereas there is no more turbulent and violent ſpirits now upon the earth then this of that Author, and all thoſe of your fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
<pb facs="tcp:48122:37"/>
as all their practices, and noyſome, fruitleſſe, and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ſcriblings can witneſſe, who daily write againſt their Chriſtian Brethren for their zeale to the truth, with a greater ſpirit of pride, inſolency and elation, and with more contempt and diſdaine, and that out of ſelfe conceitedneſſe then ever the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates did, continually ſlighting, under-valuing and contemning thoſe men they are not worthy for any merit or true learning to be compared with, or named the ſame day they are mentioned; and therefore if I in Gods quarrell and cauſe be a little more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and uſe a little more tartneſſe (which I ſhall ever wave in my owne) it may with any good nature eaſily plead excuſe.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude my Epiſtle, I ſhall deſire you all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider three paſſages, omitting many; I ſhall here ſet before your eyes the one out of Maſter <hi>Knollys his Anſwer,</hi> the other out of <hi>I. S. his Flagellum,</hi> the third out of my Brother <hi>Burtons Vindiciae;</hi> that you may take notice of the vanity and futility of theſe men, and how much they have wronged your cauſe before you reade the inſuing Diſcourſe. Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> thus ſpeaks, upon the Frontiſpice of his Booke: <hi>A moderate Anſwer unto Doctor</hi> Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks <hi>Booke, wherein the manner how ſome Churches in this Citie were gathered, and upon what termes their Members were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſo both the</hi> Doctor <hi>and the</hi> Reader <hi>may judge, how neere ſome `Beleevers who walke together in the Fellow-ſhip of the Goſpel, doe come in their practiſe to theſe Apoſtolicall rules, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the</hi> Doctor, <hi>as Gods method in gathering Churches, and admitting Members.</hi> Theſe are Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his own words, and in the nineteenth and twentieth page he more fully there te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies his good liking of that method for gathering of Churches that I out of the Word of God propounded, and would perſwade the world that their Congregations were gathered after that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or manner, or came very nigh unto it; by all which his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and by that their practice he declares, <hi>that in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have writ nothing but what is agreeable to Gods Word.</hi> I appeale now therefore unto you all, whether this man deſerves not condigne puniſhment, <hi>that will goe about, undertake and endeavour to confute that Booke which he in his judgement allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, and according to which he pretendeth he practiſeth,</hi> andall this for the deluding and miſleading of unſtable ſoules, to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both of Church and State. I am moſt aſſured, that thoſe that are rationall amongſt you, and not blinded with paſſion, will ſay
<pb facs="tcp:48122:38"/>
that Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> is not only an unworthy trifler, but that hee goeth contrary unto his owne Principles, and ought deſervedly to be ſeverely puniſhed for his thus wickedly miſpending his pretious time and abuſing the ſimple people: For if I have writ nothing concerning the gathering of Churches, <hi>but what he in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beleeveth and practiſeth;</hi> then how unexcuſable is that in this man that will ſpeake againſt what his owne ſoule dictates unto him to be according to GODS holy Word? By all which it is manifeſt, that he is not onely a vain jangler, but hath loſt the day, and wronged that your cauſe, the defence of which, notwithſtanding, he entred into the field to vindicate and maintain againſt all the Presbyterians. And that which I have ſaid of him, may deſervedly be ſpake of <hi>I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> For <hi>I. S.</hi> in the 13. Page of his <hi>Flagelli,</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>If it were granted</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that many Churches did aggregate and unite in the beginning, yet would not this example be bindingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidential,</hi> &amp;c. and ſeems there to prove it by arguments; and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> in the 9. and 10. pages of his Pamphlet aſſenteth unto <hi>I. S.</hi> his doctrine, as you may ſee at large if you look into it, in which you ſhall find alſo, that he acknowledgeth <hi>there were many congregations of beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, and at that time, when according to his own reckoning, there were but three thouſand beleevers in that Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His words are theſe, ſaying,</hi> that though they wanted a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place ſo spacious as wherein to break bread, or to receive the Lords Supper altogether, ſo as they were conſtrained to ſever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into divers companies in ſeverall private houſes to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, &amp;c. <hi>So that by the learning of all theſe your great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions you will in the ſequell of this diſcourſe evidently perceive,</hi> that they have utterly overthrown your doctrine of Independency and of the Congregational way, and that whiles they all came out to maintain it: <hi>For Mr</hi> Knollys, <hi>as I ſaid even now,</hi> he fights againſt the light of his own underſtanding, and oppoſeth that truth which he in his judgement alloweth of. <hi>And for</hi> I. S. <hi>and my brother</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>they have ignorantly murthered your cauſe: For all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention hitherto, both in the Synod, between the reverend Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters there and the</hi> Homothumadon <hi>diſſenting brethren, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the Independents and Presbyterians through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hath been</hi> concerning the Church of Jeruſalem and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of beleevers in that Church, which the diſſenting brethren with
<pb facs="tcp:48122:38"/>
all the Independents in <hi>England</hi> hold were never at firſt and laſt more then could all meet in one place or Congregation to partake in all acts of worſhip; <hi>and they aſſert moreover</hi> that that Church ought to be a patern for all Churches to the end of the world in reſpect of its government; <hi>and do peremptorily affirme,</hi> that the example of that Church is bindingly preſidentiall to all ſucceeding ages for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>which is the opinion not only of</hi> the Homothumadon <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting brethren but of all the Sectaries that I know, yea the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Presbyterians do all beleeve,</hi> that the Church of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem the Mother-Church is to be a pattern of Government to all Churches in all ſucceeding ages to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the example of the Church of Ieruſalem is not bindingly preſidential,</hi> wickedly comparing it to the confuſed chaos that indigeſted <hi>moles</hi> in the firſt creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that he makes the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> an imperfect patern. So that by his doctrine, it is left arbitrary for any Church or State to ſet up what kind of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they pleaſe. Now whether or no this opinion of his be not contrary to all divinity and the judgement of all orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, yea to the very tenent of all the Independents, I leave it to the conſideration of all thoſe amongſt you that can judge of things that differ: So that you may ſee that this Champion alſo of yours hath abſolutely overthrown your own principles when he came out to maintain and defend your cauſe.</p>
            <p>My brother <hi>Burton</hi> alſo hath given a fatall blow to that cauſe he came out ſo deſperately to maintain: For all the Independents through the world, that ever I heard of, with all the <hi>Homothu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madon</hi> brethren in the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> by all their arguments have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto laboured to evince, <hi>that there were no more beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem then could all meet in one place or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to communicate in all ordinances,</hi> acknowledging, <hi>that if it could be proved there were more Aſſemblies and Congregations of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in that Church, that then they would yeeld the cauſe; and they spake according to reaſon.</hi> For if there were many Congregations of beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and all thoſe made up but one Church, and were all under one Presbytery, as they muſt of neceſſity be if they made all but one entire Church, then the doctrine of the Congregationall way falleth to the ground or vaniſheth: for if there were many and ſeverall Congregations there that had not an abſolute authority and juriſdiction Independent within themſelvs reſpectively, but were ſubordinate and ſubject to another authority
<pb facs="tcp:48122:39"/>
above them, then of neceſſity that tenent of the Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall way is but a meer chimera or whimſy of your own heads, as all the learnedſt of your tribe do acknowledge.</p>
            <p>Now when my brother <hi>Burton</hi> hath not onely granted there were many Congregations of beleevers in that Church, but by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments proved it; he hath utterly, I ſay, loſt the field before he entered into the combat, as will yet more perſpicuouſly appear in the following diſcourſe: but by that I have now ſaid, you may ſee how unhappy you are in all theſe your Champions and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals that give as great wounds unto your cauſe as any adverſaries you have in the world now living ever gave.</p>
            <p>That which I have now to ſay in the firſt place to all your leaders and guides, is, earneſtly to intreat them as they look for true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in life and death, and as they deſire the peace of the Church, and quiet of this diſtracted State and Kingdome, they would now no longer <hi>withhold the truth from the people in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> which hitherto they have done; but that they would unfainedly bewaile the errors of their wayes; and repent of their ſeducing and miſleading of the poor people; let it be enough that they have ſo highly provoked God and cauſed the enemies to blaſpheme our Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the ſecond place I deſire all you that have hitherto been miſled and carryed about with every wind of their new doctrine,</hi> that now you would more ſeriouſly prove and examine all things <hi>(according to the Apoſtles rule, 1</hi> Theſſ. <hi>5. 12.)</hi> and hold faſt that which is good. Lay not out your time and moneys for that which will profit you nothing, but whiles it is called to day, ſet your ſelves ſeriouſly upon the work of examining all thoſe new doctrines that have been taught you: <hi>ſet before your eyes the example of the noble</hi> Bereans, <hi>ſearch the Scriptures whether things be as they have taught you, and if you pleaſe diligently to read what I have writ out of a zeal of the glory of God, and out of love to your ſelves, and a true deſire of your eternall felicity,</hi> If any of you that have erred from the truth ſhall be converted by it, let him know, that he that converteth the ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins, <hi>James 5. 19. 20.</hi>

Neither is it beyond the ſea, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, who ſhall goe over the ſea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it: But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayſt do it. See <hi>(ſaith the Lord)</hi> I have ſet before thee this day life and good, and death and evill.</p>
            <p>Now if in the dayes of <hi>Moſes</hi> the truth was ſo near unto them that the Lord ſays there unto his people, that he had ſet it before their eyes, yea that it was in their hearts; ſo that they had then no need to run from land to ſea, and from ſea to land to finde it: how much more obvious is it now, may every rationall man conclude when it is ſo gloriouſly ſet forth, and that through the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the New Teſtament? And how inexcuſable will all ſuch be found that complain the truth is not yet clear unto them? So that it may be an aſtoniſhment to all men to hear any that have read the holy Word of God ſay that they are yet in the dark &amp; the truth doth not appear unto them: And yet ſuch men there are who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the world and profeſſe it, <hi>that they are expectants and ſeekers:</hi> and many have often ſaid unto me when I have been in familiar diſcourſe with them, <hi>That as yet the truth was not made out unto them concerning the Preſbyterian way, and therefore they could neither communicate with our Aſſemblies nor yet joyn with thoſe of the new gathered churches.</hi> Now that all thoſe who have wandred and ſtrayed from the old way, and thoſe that are at a loſſe and ſeek it, may find it and the truth, which they have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God <hi>to buy and purchaſe,</hi> and that they may all clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive that they are in the by-path of error that are ſtill Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and doubting about the way: I ſhall at this time endeavor to be their guide, nothing doubting but by the grace of God and his ſpeciall aſſiſtance if they will bring docible hearts and willing minds to follow the thred of his Word, and be directed by that unerring line of the ſame, they may ſpeedily be led and come into the right way, <hi>and find the truth and with it peace and comfort to their own ſouls in life and death.</hi>

            <p>Thoſe that call themſelves by the name of Independents and have ſeparated themſelves from our Congregations and Aſſemblies, counting us <hi>ſuch Saints as Job would not ſet with the doggs of his flocke, calling us the ſons of Belial, proclaming us to be the enemies the Lord Ieſus Chriſt and his Kingdome</hi> (for this is their language concerning us all) thoſe I ſay pretend that they have both the Word of God and the example of the Primitive Churches, eſpecially that of Jeruſalem for the maintenance of their Independency and for theſe their unbrotherly proceedings, whoſe opinion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this:</p>
            <p>That the Church of Ieruſalem that Mother Church conſiſted of of no more beleevers at any time then did ordinarily meet altogether in one place and Congregation to partake in all acts of worſhip; and they teach withall, that this Church conſiſting of no more, had an abſolute ſoveraignty within it ſelfe Independent without reference to any other Church, and from the which there might be no appeal for the redreſſe of any conceived wrong; and they moreover affirm that
<pb facs="tcp:48122:41"/>
the conſtitution of this conceited forme of government, is the true Gospel forme of Church government, and is for ever to be a patern to all Churches in all ſucceeding ages to doe the ſame and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ſame authority within themſelves ſeverally that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this Church did, though they conſiſt but of twenty or thirty Members apeece, yea fewer.</p>
            <p>This is the opinion of all the Independents, ſaving my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> who in this differeth from all his brethren, beleeving, yea acknowledging that there were many Aſſemblies of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by which he hath overthrowne their opinion, whiles notwithſtanding hee labours with all his might to maintaine it, as will appeare in its due place; whereas all the other Independents, (as I ſaid before) confidently aſſert, that there were no more Beleevers in that Church, at firſt and laſt, then could all meet in one Congregation to communicate in all the Ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Presbyterians on the other ſide, and that upon very good grounds, as will in the ſequell of this diſcourſe appeare,</hi> hold and beleeve that there were many Congregations and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, and that all thoſe ſeverall Congregations made but one Church within its pracincts, and were all under one Presbyterie; and that the government of this Church conſiſting of many Congregations combined together under the government of a Colledge of Presbyters is a paterne of government to all Churches in ſucceeding ages to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd of the world. <hi>And this I thought fit to ſpeak concerning the firſt queſtion or controverſie betweene the Presbyterians and the Independents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is concerning the gathering of Churches and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Members into Church fellow-ſhip &amp; communion, which the Independents hold and teach muſt be upon theſe conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt that</hi> they that are to be admitted, and before they can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church, they muſt walke ſometime with them. <hi>In</hi> New-England <hi>they make ſome walke ſeven yeeres before they can be received, and this is their firſt condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, before their admiſſion,</hi> they muſt make every one of them a particular and publicke confeſſion of their faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they must bring in the evidences of their converſion, declaring the time when, the place where, and the occaſion how they were converted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:42"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they must all and every one of them enter into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular explicite Covenant.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>they must come in and be admitted by the conſent of the whole Church, Nemine contradicente;</hi> ſo that the refuſing of any of theſe hinders their admiſſion, and the gathering of Churches after ſo faſhion (as the French men uſe to ſpeake when they learn Engliſh) is the onely way as they all affirme of ſetting up Chriſt as King upon his Throne, and this is the opinion and doctrine of all the Independents concerning the gathering of Churches, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending withall that they have the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for this their paterne and plat-forme, which is nothing elſe but to abuſe the Scripture, as will afterwards appeare.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterians on the contrary ſide <hi>hold and beleeve, that for the gathering of Churches, and for the making of any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any Church, and for the admitting of them into Church Followſhip and Communion, no other conditions are to be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them by the Miniſters for their reception into the ſociety of the Church, or to be required at any peoples hands, but thoſe that Chriſt the King of his Church (whoſe voyce is only in Church matters to be liſtned unto and heard) hath propounded,</hi> viz. <hi>Repentance, Faith and Baptiſme.</hi> And this is the beliefe and opinion of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans concerning the admiſſion of Members, and gathering of Churches, affirming that the Independents have neither Precept nor Preſident for all their new conditions in the whole Booke of God, and therefore that they ought to be rejected as their owne inventions, and as the vaine and wicked traditions of their owne braine, as will clearely in the following diſcourſe be evidenced to all men. And this is briefly the ſtate of the queſtion and difference betweene us.</p>
            <p>Now before I ſet downe the ground, and ſeeming warrant they pretend for this their fond opinion of Independency, by which they have brought trouble and confuſion upon this whole Church and Kingdome; I thinke it fit I ſay before the handling of the whole buſines to ſay ſomething concerning the ſorts of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents I have to deale with, and againſt the which all my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments doe militate; and I find two ſorts of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; the firſt are thoſe which for diſtinction ſake I call <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothumadons;</hi> the other <hi>Burtonians.</hi> Now the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Independents, that at this day ſwarme through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:48122:42"/>
(if their owne brags may be beleeved) are the univerſality of all the Sectaries, who generally hold that, There were no more beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and in all other the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches within their reſpective Precincts, then could all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily meet in one Congregation to partake in all Acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and from thence out of this their imaginary opinion they forme all their ſeverall Churches, calling their Aſſemblies the Churches of the Congregationall way, and to this their opinion they ſticke and cleave immoveably. The <hi>Burtonian</hi> Independents, of which my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> is the <hi>Corypheus,</hi> and <hi>Anteſignanus,</hi> and from whom they have received their doctrine, they hold and beleeve that there were many Congregations and Aſſemblies of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but deny that thoſe ſeverall Congregations were Churches properly ſo called.</p>
            <p>This I ſay is the opinion of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and his diſciples.</p>
            <p>So that my firſt Brigade of Arguments and Forces that I have drawn out of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſts, Chriſts and his bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and ſeventy Diſciples quarters, and that before Chriſts death, with all thoſe I have taken out of the ſtrong garriſon of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> after Chriſts aſcenſion, and have brought into the field to diſpute this controverſie and queſtion they militate againſt the whole Army of the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Sectaries, that under the command of <hi>Hanſerdo Knollys</hi> and <hi>I.

That there were no more Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem at firſt and laſt, then could and did ordinarily all meet together in one place or Congregation to partake in all acts of worſhip.</hi>

            <p>The other companies that I have taken out of the Apoſtles quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after Chriſts death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion militate againſt all the <hi>Burtonian</hi> Independents, in the head of which Army he himſelfe comes out into the field as their Generall maintaining, <hi>that thoſe ſeverall Aſſemblies in the Church of Ieruſalem were not Churches properly ſo called:</hi> And he <hi>Goliah</hi>-like appears armed with his ſword and Phocions hatchet which is his pol-ax, bidding defiance to the whole hoſt of Presbyterians, preſuming to make good this ground againſt them all: <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>Now before I come to tell how the other Advocates argued their cauſe, I will ſet downe the Greeke words in Roman cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that the moſt unlearned may reade them, and I will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards give the true and genuine interpretation, and ſenſe of them, and ſhew how both theſe Advocates, and all the Independents and Sectaries are miſtaken in that witneſſe and teſtimony which indeed is the onely evidence they build their whole new Babel upon, and ſhew withall how they with violence force that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſpeake otherwiſe then hee meaneth, and that the words taken according to the originall, and according to all ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bring in no ſuch evidence, nor carry no ſuch ſenſe or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as they put upon them; for the words in the originall make not ſo much as mention of a place, howſoever it crept in, in our Tranſlation. All this by Gods aſſiſtance I undertake to make good, and to evince this alſo, that they lay that foundation of their new Fabrick onely in the ayre or chimera of their owne braine. But for the words in Roman characters, they are <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothumadon epi tò autò.</hi> And now I will relate how <hi>Philip Nye</hi> a very buſie Advocate pleaded the cauſe of Independency, and what his teſtimony was, who being deſired by the Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to bring in his witneſſe out of the holy word of God, for the proving of their aſſertion, hee flyes to the ſame place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaying, <hi>they were all with one accord</hi>

And thus did theſe brave Pleaders all and every one of them argue their cauſe, giving in their reaſon alſo into the Court for the corroborating of their witneſſe, ſaying, <hi>that the Holy Ghoſt had from firſt to laſt as on purpoſe ſhewed this, as if his ſcope had beene before, to prevent and preclude all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the contrary.</hi> Thus they: This place of Scripture with this their reaſon to ſpeake the truth, is all the ground, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for ſubſtance, that all thoſe reſtleſſe ſpirited Rabbies have for this great warre and contention betweene us, and for the proving of their doctrine of Independency, and that their tenent of the congregationall way, by which they have brought this diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and confuſion into the whole Church and State, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and miſleading of many thouſand poore ſoules, to the utter ruining of many of them, and for the ſetting of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes on fire, which with all their teares, if ever the Lord ſhould give them repentance not to bee repented of they could never quench: and for the better deceiving of the people they have ſo accuſtomed their mouths to <hi>Homothumadon epi to auto,</hi> that very <hi>Sagomour Will that has no more</hi> Greeke in him then a Horſe, upon every occaſion comes out with his <hi>Homothumadon epi to auto,</hi> and all of them in this great and weighty buſines which concernes not onely <hi>the peace of the Land, but is of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting concernment to us all,</hi> they continually triffle and abuſe the holy Scripture, dealing with us as Cats uſually doe one with an other, who when they have ſpent all their ſtrength with fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when they can neither ſcratch nor bite any longer, then they ſpit one at another, and make ugly faces; even ſo doe theſe men with us, when they have tormented themſelves, &amp; ſpent their Forces in wrangling, having never an Argument left to maintain their groundleſſe, wicked and dividing opinion, then they ſtand ſtaring on us, &amp; as a laſt refuge come out with their <hi>homothumadon epi to auto</hi> and thus ſpit a little Greeke in our faces which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded people not underſtanding, beleeve that it is an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt gotten on the Independents ſide.</p>

whole Army lies here and depends upon this Fort, I meane theſe words of the heavenly Charter, I will take the more paines for finding out of the true meaning of them, that ſo I may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcover unto the world the wickedneſſe and vanity (for it is no better) of all theſe <hi>Homothumadon</hi> impoſters; and ſo much the more willing I am to make ſome ſtay in explayning the mind and true ſenſe of the ſame, becauſe they are as it were the Key and inlet for the opening, and the better making way for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the whole Diſpute; ſo that every man that is but of ordinary capacity, by the very light of his naturall reaſon may from the unfolding of them be ſufficiently able to diſcerne the juglings of theſe ungodly men.</p>
            <p>But firſt I ſhall give you in <hi>the anſwer of thoſe reverend Iudges ſitting in the Court,</hi> I meane the reverend Aſſembly, where this cauſe was fully heard and debated, where the <hi>Homothumadons</hi> had liberty fully to ſpeak for themſelvs, &amp; to bring in whatſoever made for their cauſe, howſoever they have falſely given out to the contrary</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now for anſwer to their reaſon above mentioned, the Reverend Aſſembly replyed,</hi> that they inclined to beleeve that the Holy Ghoſt intended rather to ſhew the early accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Ier. 32. 39.</hi> of giving one heart, and one way by his ſo frequent mentioning Homothumadon &amp; epi to auto as adjuncts of the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church meetings; then (as our brethren ſuggeſt) to prevent and preclude all reaſonings againſt this aſſertion of theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> that the beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were no more then could meet in one place: <hi>and there is moſt excellent reaſon for this reply &amp; anſwer of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend &amp; learned Aſſembly to their wicked cavil, for ſo I may truly cal it, for it is nothing elſe but to abuſe the Holy Scripture, and for no other end but to deceive the people, that they may the better make merchandiſe of them,</hi> which is one of the horridſt impieties in the world, which all the homothumadon Miniſters and Predicants, and Itinerary Preacers are moſt deeply guilty of, who make a prey of the people where ever they come, and moſt abominably cheate them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſilly women.</p>
            <p>Now if we do duly examine the words of the Text and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in their native ſenſe and true meaning, it will moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appear that the Anſwer of the learned and reverend <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> was grounded upon moſt excellent and ſolid reaſon, <hi>which all the ſlight of all the</hi> Homothumadons <hi>and their cunning craftineſſe</hi>

               <hi>whereby they lie in wait to deceive ſimple ſouls, will be made more oriently appear in all its colours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt therefore I will ſet down the Text it ſelfe in its originall language, and then give the true interpretation of it in our tongue, <hi>Acts</hi> the ſecond <hi>v.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. The Tranſlation is this, <hi>When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord upon that,</hi> viz. occaſion or deſigne: For this is as much as the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> do ſignifie, being taken both adjectively and relatively in that place, and therefore under reformation be it ſpoken, it is not rightly tranſlated in our bibles; for unleſſe we do conſider the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with reference to ſome ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or ſome thing going before, <hi>there can no ſenſe be made of them,</hi> nor no man mortall can tell the meaning of them, no more then any man can divine or judge what one that commeth abruptly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his company and having interchanged no diſcourſe with him doth mean and underſtand, if he ſhould barely ſay <hi>upon this or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that.</hi> Now all the conteſtation is about theſe words <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as for the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> we all agree it ſignifieth with one <hi>accord.</hi> Now the Independents by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> underſtand <hi>in one place,</hi> which <hi>epì tò autò</hi> never ſignified in the world: for if we will ſtand upon the words, they have a far other meaning then the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> brethren give of them, as will by and by appear: for as for the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> taking it not as a prepoſition in the Greek tongue, as all the learned in that language know, it often ſignifies <hi>time,</hi> and of this I could produce many examples; as if one ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or writing Greek ſhould ſay, <hi>ſuch a thing happened in my time, or in my dayes,</hi> he would expreſſe it by <hi>epì</hi> and ſay <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> may with far better ground and by far far greater reaſon be interpreted for <hi>time</hi> in that text then for <hi>place,</hi> in regard there was no mention made of <hi>place</hi> before, but of <hi>time;</hi> for it is <hi>in terminis</hi> ſaid, <hi>When the day of Pentecoſt was fully come, they were all together with one accord</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>viz.</hi> at that inſtant of time or upon that very day; this interpretation <hi>I</hi> ſay doth farre better come up to the ſenſe and meaning of that text then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in one place:</hi> for both <gap reason="foreign">

So that there being mention of <hi>time</hi> before, they are to be interpreted rather of <hi>time</hi> then <hi>place:</hi> but that is not the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> whereſoever we meet with them they do for the moſt part ſignifie ſome deſigne, purpoſe or reſolution, whether it be taken in a good ſenſe or a bad; as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is taken for a conſpiracy and an evill deſign of the Kings and Rulers; but in the ſecond chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> ver. 1. it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a good deſign in the Diſciples; for when the day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt</hi> was fully come ſaith the Scripture, they were with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>viz.</hi> upon this occaſion they were met together with this deſign, purpoſe and reſolution to conſecrate the day to Gods ſervice and to celebrate the feaſt to his name; and this is the true and genuine meaning of the place: <hi>viz.</hi> that the diſciples were all met together upon the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> upon this deſigne with full purpoſe and with an unanimous conſent and reſolution to keep that day and celebrate the feaſt unto the glory of God: and this was a good deſign and purpoſe in them which is ſignified by the words <gap reason="foreign">

not imply a convention or meeting together of the perſons of all the Kings and Princes in the world in any one place; for that they never did nor could do, there being an impoſſibility of it both in reſpect of time and place: no place being able to contain them all, ſo that I ſay by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>For whereas God the father had appointed Chriſt to be King over the Nations to govern them by the Scepter of his Spirit and by the Rod of his Word, they all conſpired with one accord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his ſpirituall government over their ſouls, and would not have him to rule over them; And therefore the holy Ghoſt expreſſes this their conſpiracy, wicked deſign and evil purpoſe by the words <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which intimate as much as if the ſpirit of God had ſaid this was the deſign reſolution and the determinate counſell of all thoſe wicked Kings and Rulers to reject the government of Chriſt over them, not meaning or underſtanding there by <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>But before I come to that, ſhould I for diſputation ſake grant unto the brethren that by</hi> epi tò autò <hi>in that text</hi> were meant in one place, as they would have it; <hi>becauſe we cannot conceive if there be a meeting or convening of the perſons of any people together, but it muſt be in a place or at a place as we uſually ſpeak: would it therefore follow</hi> that becauſe any one place or room will hold a hundred and twenty names, <hi>for they ſay there were then no more in that company,</hi> to partake in all acts of worſhip, that it will hold hundreds of thouſands, or that all the beleevers in Ieruſalem did then meet there, or that there were no more beleevers then in that Church then could meet in one Congregation, or that for ever after there were no more Chriſtians in Ieruſalem then did ordinarily meet in one Congregation? <hi>I am moſt aſſured that there is not any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Independent but upon due deliberation would ſay,</hi> that he that ſhould ſo conclude ſpeaks againſt the very light of all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that dictates the contrary: <hi>and therefore he would not make that inference the</hi> Homothumadon <hi>brethren make:</hi> viz. that there were neither then in Ieruſalem nor at any time after, more beleevers in that Church then could all meet in any one Congregation to partake in all acts of worſhip.</p>
            <p>But now to ſhew the vanity and wickedneſſe of theſe men and
<pb facs="tcp:48122:48"/>
that it may appear they in this may be rightly called <hi>Homothuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> in that they do with one accord and with one unanimous conſent conſpire together to trouble and diſquiet the whole Church of God, and to diſturbe the peace of the three Kingdomes, and are reſolved to perſiſt <hi>epì tò autô</hi> in that their wicked deſigne and that with one accord; I ſhall here lay down ſome reaſons, which all that will vouchſafe to read the enſuing diſcourſe, ſhall ſee more fully ſet down afterwards.</p>

the ſecond Chapter and firſt Verſe, were Chriſts apoſtles and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ſuch as had followed him from the beginning of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, and were indeed all Miniſters of the Goſpell and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Word and men of great eminency and fame and renoun, and therfore by a great elegancy are called <hi>Names, the number of the Names</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) which kind of expreſsion in the Holy Scripture, is ever uſed for to expreſſe men only of tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and deſert for their rare vertues and endowments, as is manifeſt out of the <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 4. and all theſe were taken up in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, as the occaſion required, and were by themſelves; but may any rationall man conclude from thence, that there were no more Beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> would not this be thought an odde kind of arguing, if one ſhould thus diſpute againſt the Independents, thoſe <hi>Homothumadon</hi> brethren, <hi>all the Independent Predicants, and their Itinerary Preachers, thoſe eminent and learned men, thoſe names are all <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Now by the holy Scripture we are truly informed there were millions of true beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at that very time, and that they were the Miniſters only that were preſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the day of Pentecoſt, and that the other Beleevers were in their other meeting places: yea, beſides thoſe that I have now named, it is ſaid in the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>that</hi> (at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of time) <hi>there were dwelling</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem, Iewes, devout men out of every nation under heaven,</hi> that is true Worſhippers, and Beleevers: here therefore muſt needs bee an innumerable company of theſe, and all theſe were then Inhabitants in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> ſo that the Holy Scripture doth by many witneſſes prove there were more then a hundred and twenty Beleevers, or more then a hundred thouſand in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at that time, how therefore with any honeſty can the Independents conclude from <hi>Epi to auto,</hi> that there were no more Beleevers then in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> nor ever after, then could all meet in one Congregation? If this be not to fight againſt God, there was never any fighting againſt him. But ſhould I yeeld unto them, which I cannot doe for many reaſons,
<pb facs="tcp:48122:50"/>
that there were no more Beleevers at that time in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then did or could all meet in any one place; will it follow in any ſound underſtanding that they could ever after all ſtill meet in one Congregation, when they were infinitly daily increaſed? I trow not; for ſo to ſpeake, and ſo to argue and conclude, would be but to prove fighters againſt all reaſon; yea againſt God himſelf (as I ſaid before) and to deny the expreſſe Scriptures, as will forthwith appeare; for in the ſame Chapter when there were but three thouſand new Converts added to the Church, it is ſaid that then that company could not all meet in any one place to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in all acts of worſhip, but for want of a place ſpacious enough for to breake bread in, they were forced then to meet in divers places, and to divide themſelves into ſeverall Aſſemblies and Congregations, and that in ſeverall houſes; for ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>verſe</hi> 46. <hi>and they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe;</hi> that is, <hi>in many ſeverall houſes,</hi> they had their meetings to communicate in; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at that very time there were many Congregations of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſo that they could not poſsibly meet altogether in one place. And here by the way it is good to take notice, not onely that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which the Independents confeſſe to be the firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, and that when there were but three thouſand new Converts added to the Diſciples, but that all theſe were ſpeedily and readily received into Church-fellowſhip, and that by the ſole and alone authority of the Apoſtles, ſo that it was not required at their hands, that they ſhould firſt walke ſometime with the Church before their admiſsion, or that they ſhould make a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeſsion of their faith, or bring in the evidences of their converſion, or that they ſhould enter into any particular explicite Covenant, or that they muſt have the conſent of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could be received into Church-fellowſhip; nothing I ſay of all this was either practiſed in this Mother-church, or any Daughter-church in the Primitive and pureſt times; but theſe two truths are moſt certainely evident out of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>The firſt, that all Chriſtians in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were admitted into Church-fellowſhip upon <hi>their repenting, beleeving and being baptiſed, without any other conditions,</hi> and that upon offering themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:51"/>
The ſecond truth is this, that there were many congregations and Aſſemblies of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at that inſtant time, which is abundantly proved out of the teſtimonies and reaſons above ſpecified, and thoſe expreſſe words, where it is <hi>ſaid that they brake bread from houſe to houſe; therefore there were many Congregations then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will farther more illuſtriouſly yet appeare, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the divers other additions of Beleevers, and that daily unto the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> for in the laſt verſe of this chapter it is ſaid <hi>that the Lord added daily unto the Church ſuch as ſhould bee ſaved;</hi> here we find additions upon additions of Beleevers, and that daily, indefinitly ſet downe, as if they could not eaſily have been told, which addeth no ſmall Emphaſis unto the expreſsion; and all theſe were admitted into Church-fellowſhip without any of thoſe conditions the Independents require of all their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in theſe our times; for it is ſaid <hi>the Lord added daily unto the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> and therefore hee did it onely upon his owne termes of <hi>Repentance, Faith and Baptiſme.</hi> Now what underſtanding man can eaſily beleeve <hi>that when there was ſuch daily increaſe of Beleevers made, that they could all ſtill meet in any one place or Congregation to partake in all Ordinances?</hi> But if wee looke into the fourth chapter, we ſhall find an other new Addition, and that of <hi>five thouſand men more, beſides women;</hi> for ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>Howbeit, many of them which heard the word beleeved, and the number of the men was about five thouſand.</hi> Now if when there were but three thouſand, they were then forced for want of a convenient place ſpacious enough to communicate in, <hi>to divide themſelves into divers ſeverall hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> how impoſsible a thing was it <hi>for them all daily then to meet together in any one place or congregation, may any one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,</hi> when there were not only daily additions of Beleevers, but five thouſand men more added unto the Church at one time? without all controverſie <hi>it was impoſſible that they could all then meet together in any one place;</hi> and for farther confirmation of this truth, and for the putting of this controverſie for ever out of doubt, the Holy Ghoſt ſaith in the fifth chapter, verſe 14. <hi>And Beleevers were more added unto the Church, multitudes both of men and women.</hi> Marke I pray the expreſsion, <hi>multitudes:</hi> Now by <hi>multitude,</hi> all men know is to be underſtood, and that in all
<pb facs="tcp:48122:51"/>
Languages, a very great Aſſembly or congregation, or company; whereupon the Scripture ſaith, <hi>follow not a multitude to doe evill,</hi> ſo that by multitude is ever underſtood <hi>ſome vaſt Aſſembly or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of people;</hi> and here the Scripture ſaith, ſpeaking in the plurall number <hi>that multitudes, and that both of men and women were added to the Lord,</hi> that is <hi>to ſay many great Congregations and Aſſemblies were added to the Church;</hi> yea, the expreſsion doth as it were intimate <hi>that they came in ſo faſt that they could not now any longer be counted as it were by retayle or enumerate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, as when they came in by ſmall numbers, as three thouſand and five thouſand at a time which might eaſily be told and reckoned, but that now they came into the Church in ſuch great bodies, as they were forced to ſet them downe by whole ſale;</hi> and therefore the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>that Beleevers were added unto the Lord, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes both of men and women,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>many great Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Beleevers of both ſexes;</hi> yea, and that there might yet be no miſtake in this buſines, the Scripture ſaith in the laſt verſe of this chapter, for the great multitudes of them, that the Apoſtles <hi>daily in the Temple, and in every houſe ceaſed not to teach and preach Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So that here by the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt wee are aſcertained <hi>there were divers and ſeverall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Beleevers at that time in the Church of Ieruſalem;</hi> for they had their meetings not onely in the Temple, but in every houſe, <hi>or from houſe to houſe,</hi> which is all one that is to ſay, <hi>they had many Congregations and Aſſemblies of Beleevers at that time in ſeverall private houſes, as well as in the Temple;</hi> ſo that this truth being confirmed unto us not onely by reaſon, but by the mouth of ſo many infallible witneſſes, as that out of the ſecond chapter, where it is ſaid <hi>they brake bread daily from houſe to houſe,</hi> and two more witneſſes alſo in this fifth chapter, where it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. <hi>that multitudes both of men and women,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>many great Congregations of Beleevers of both ſexes were added to the Lord,</hi> and in the laſt verſe, that there might be yet no ſcruple made of the buſines, the places of their meetings are alſo expreſſed, <hi>viz. in the Temple and in every houſe;</hi> ſo that all good Chriſtians are bound to beleeve <hi>that there were many Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Aſſemblies of Beleevers at that time in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and therefore more then could all poſsibly meet in any one place or congregation.</hi>

So that if I ſhould ſay no more, the truth concerning this point is ſo evidently apparent to all judicious and underſtanding men, that they cannot doubt of it, except they will deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe; yet that the truth concerning this controverſie may yet more fully be cleared, <hi>I</hi> ſhall for the farther coroborrating of it and for confirmation of the ſame, produce a few teſtimonies more.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>The word of the Lord increaſed,</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>and the number of Diſciples multiplyed in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>greatly, and a great company of the Prieſts were obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the faith.</hi> Here wee find multiplication upon multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beleevers, and more additions of them, and that in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and amongſt theſe multitudes there was a great company of Prieſts, that is a great company of their Miniſters and learned Rabbies were converted, and all theſe ſeverall admiſsions of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers into this Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were without any of the conditions thoſe of the congregationall way require now of their new Members; for it is not ſaid, <hi>that they demanded of them that they ſhould walke ſome time with them before their admiſsion, or that they ſhould make any publicke confeſsion of their faith, or bring in the evidences of their converſion, or enter into any particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Covenant, or come in by the conſent of the people before their admiſsion;</hi> nothing of all theſe things were required at their hands in this Mother-church; and therefore all the practiſe of this kind of admiſsion in our new Congregations is without any preſident or example; and therefore thoſe of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall way doe moſt wickedly <hi>to pretend they have the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for an example for their practiſe of admitting of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſay the thing chiefly to be obſerved here is <hi>the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the increaſe of many more Diſciples to the former,</hi> adding withall, <hi>that amongſt thoſe Diſciples and Converts that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Lord there was a great company of the Prieſts:</hi> now what an increaſe of Beleevers may any man ſuppoſe there muſt then needs follow, when ſo many of their Miniſters were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? without doubt when the people ſaw their Prieſts turne Chriſtians, and heard them alſo in their preachings give in their reaſons for their imbracing of the Goſpel, and ſaw withall the daily miracles of the Apoſtles for the confirmation of this their

doctrine they did infinitly multiply; ſo that if there had beene no converſion of men before ſpak of, yet the converſion of theſe very Prieſts in a ſhort time would have procured the converſion of many more <hi>then could have met in any one place or a few;</hi> and this all reaſon will perſwade; for wee find it by hourly experience, how many hundreds are daily miſlead, and ſeduced by the error of a few temporiſing unſtable Presbyters, who are turned Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and what a deale of miſchiefe they have done here amongſt us, ſo that not a few places can containe their Proſelytes, and all this without the helpe of any miracles; and we ſee daily, <hi>if but any rich and craſed Gentlewoman, or any confounded Lady turne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, or if but any unſtable man of any eminency revolt from the Presbyterian way,</hi> what a noyſe there is by and by made at it, and how many giddy headed men, and women eſpecially, are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it, and that without any prodigies: Now <hi>I</hi> ſay all reaſon will perſwade any intelligible man that truth ſhould much more prevaile then error, and that in the hands of ſo great a multitude, and of ſuch learned Rabbies, and thoſe alſo in ſo great honour and eſteeme amongſt the people, having withall the helpe of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles amongſt them, and that to the ſpeedy converſion of many thouſands; yea, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>that the Word of God increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>converted many, and that the number of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples multiplyed in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>greatly,</hi> not in a ſmall manner; <hi>and that a great company of the Prieſts were alſo added unto the Lord;</hi> ſo that if there were a great Congregation and Aſſembly of the Prieſts, as the Word of God relateth; there muſt neceſſarily be many more Congregations of the ordinary people, and all theſe are to be yet reckoned upon a new account, and upon a new Liſt, <hi>ſo that there were numberleſſe Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>if any credit may be given to the Holy Scripture, and that in the very infancy of the Church:</hi> ſo that I am moſt confident, that this truth is now evident and perſpicuous to all thoſe that have but ordinary underſtanding.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this is the onely buſines, as the Independents ſay, and that will put an end to this controverſie betweene us; for they have often ſaid, <hi>prove once but clearly unto us out of the Word of God that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and then wee will grant you the day;</hi> I ſay in this regard I ſhall briefly adde ſome other Arguments to

            </p>
            <p>But omitting many Arguments that I could produce from the <hi>multitudes of their Preachers, and the diverſity of the nations, and the infinit number of the Inhabitants, and from the Miracles in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>that neceſſarily called for many Congregations and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies;</hi> that one place in the 21. of the <hi>Acts</hi> may for ever ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all Gain-ſayers, and abundanly prove unto rationall men, <hi>that there were many, if not numberleſſe congregations of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then in the church of</hi> Ieruſalem.

ſeeing for the moſt part in all Churches where there are able and learned Miniſters it is ever obſerved, that there are three ſtrong brethren to one weak one, at leaſt more ſtrong brethren then weak ones: Now when there was a whole Colledge of Apoſtles for the moſt part reſident in that Church, and a whole colledge of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, fixed Miniſters there and able Preachers, <hi>beſides a multitude of Prieſts,</hi> and all painefull, and laborious, that preached unto them night and day, &amp; inſtructed them all in their Chriſtian Liberty, and confirmed them in it with miracles; and when they had alſo for a farther ſtrengthning of them in that their Chriſtian Liberty, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Councell and Synod in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ratified the abrogation of the legall Ceremonies, and that from the Holy Scripture, and the Spirit of God, and did daily preach unto them all this their Chriſtian Liberty; we are bound by the Law of charity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>there were many more thouſands of ſtrong Chriſtians then weake in that Church;</hi> yea, our daily experience will perſwade any man to beleeve this Doctrine; Now let us heare what Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and all the Presbyters witneſſe unto Saint <hi>Paul</hi> concerning this point, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. <hi>Thou ſeeſt Brother Paul</hi> (ſay they) <hi>how many ten thouſands</hi> (for ſo it is in the Originall <gap reason="foreign">

Beleevers may any rationall men ſuppoſe were then there in that church, where there were a colledge of Apoſtles forthe moſt part, and a ſtanding Colledge of able Presbyters, all miraculous Teachers, and aſsisted immediatly by the ſpirit of God? <hi>Surely a few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of houſes or places could not poſſibly have held their very bodies, much leſſe could a few hundred of houſes have held them</hi> to partake in all the Ordinances; <hi>ſo that all men that have not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely reſolved to give the Spirit of God the lye, yea, to wage warre againſt Heaven, muſt acknowledge,</hi> that there were many Congregations and Aſſemblies of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, eſpecially when it commeth confirmed by ſo many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of divine authority.</hi> By which it appeareth that there were many Congregations of Beleevers there, as in every houſe one. <hi>So that for this point, I am moſt aſſured it is now without controverſie,</hi> that there were many Congregations and Aſſemblies of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem; and yet all theſe as the Holy Scripture aſſerteth in many places, made all but one Church; and the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents themſelves acknowledge,</hi> there was but one Church in Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>Now how in any ordinary mans underſtanding can many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations be one politicall miniſteriall Church, except only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are united and aſſociated under one Presbyteriall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? that is to ſay, <hi>under the government of a whole colledg of Preſbyters which the Church of Ieruſalem was? for there was many Preſbyters there as this</hi> 21. <hi>ch. teſtifieth and the</hi> 15. <hi>chap. and many other places of holy writ, all which had the government over that Church committed to them in common;</hi> So that it may be a wonder to all rationall men that there ſhould any appear in the world, notwithſtanding the abundant evidence out of the holy Word of God, that ſhould yet aſſert, <hi>there were no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church of Ieruſalem then could all meet in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:</hi> which aſſertion of theirs, beſides the Scripture, very common reaſon overthrows; for if we conſider Jeruſalem, <hi>it is ſaid to be the city of the great King in which there were never leſſe then ſeven or eight hundred thouſand inhabitants, who dayly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Meſſiah;</hi> who it is well known when he came had twelve Apoſtles and ſeventy Diſciples at his command to go and come at pleaſure, whoſe powerfull preaching was ſuch, <hi>that it is related that Satan was ſeen fall down like iightning from heaven,</hi> that is to

            <p>Now my other companies drawn out of the Apoſtles quarters after Chriſts death and aſcenſion, they militate againſt all the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian</hi> Independents, who acknowledge <hi>that there were many</hi>

               <hi>The firſt,</hi> that there were many congregations and aſſemblies of believers in the church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond,</hi> that all thoſe ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies were churches properly ſo called: <hi>which when it comes to the main battell, will be fully made good, and withall it will be maintained,</hi> that all thoſe ſeverall congregations made all of them but one Church, and were all of them combined together and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to one Preſbytery, <hi>that is,</hi> to a Colledg of Preſbyters, who by Gods own appointment had the rule over them committed to them in common: <hi>by all which the doctrine of the Congregationall way is utterly overthrown, whoſe tenent and opinion it is,</hi> that every Congregation of beleevers, be it greater or ſmaller, ought to be a diſtinct Church or body by it ſelf exerciſing all Church power and authority within it ſelf Independent; and ought not to have reference or relation to any other church or congregation for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of government, no farther then pleaſeth themſelves; <hi>and this they affirme to be Gods Ordinance and Conſtitution,</hi> whereas in the Church at Ieruſalem the Mother-church, there were innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Congregations and Aſſemblies of beleevers, and yet all of them made up but one Church: For thoſe ſeverall congregations, <hi>as the</hi> Burtonian <hi>Independents do affirme,</hi> were but branches of that one entire Church; <hi>theſe are their words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it now appeareth that it is Gods Ordinance and his Appointment <hi>that many congregations combined together in any city or vicinity within ſome Precinct, ſhould all of them within that juriſdiction make up but one Church and be under a Colledg of Preſbyters to be governed by them in common,</hi> which is indeed a meer eccleſiaſticall Corporation; and therefore this kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might without any offence or diviation from the holy Word of God be compared by me to any civill Corporation, as
<pb facs="tcp:48122:56"/>
that of <hi>London</hi> or the like: For though <hi>I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſpend much time and many words to no purpoſe about my <hi>ſimile,</hi> yet it will ſtand for ever immoveable and ſerve to all intelligible Chriſtians for that very end <hi>I</hi> propound it: <hi>viz. to declare the ſtate of the queſtion;</hi> yea by <hi>I. S.</hi> his own words pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fourth of his Pamphlet it is authorized; for he there after much babble thus expreſſeth himſelf concerning this point, <hi>when</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we know the true nature of ſpirituall things, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of God, as I may call them, we may find a reſemblance of them in things here below, which are made after them, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fetch the knowledg of heavenly compoſures from theſe earthly things.</hi> Thus <hi>J. S.</hi> ſpeaks there.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>I</hi> having from the holy Word of God and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church at Jeruſalem the firſt true formed Church and originall Church found out the true nature of that ſpirituall and eccleſiaſticall government, that heavenly compoſure and that device of God (as he grolliſhly calleth it) it was then no ſin in me (in <hi>I. S.</hi> his opinion) to find a reſemblance of it in things below. And therefore both he himſelfe and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> might have ſaved all that labour they needleſly ſpent about that ſimile, which will ever ſtand good againſt whatſoever they ſhall be able to ſay againſt it, for the elucidating and cleering of the point of difference between the Presbyterians and the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which was the onely end <hi>I</hi> made uſe of it for; and there fore all the pudder they made about that ſimile, was but to beat the aire and to vent their own vanity.</p>
            <p>But from all this diſpute (that <hi>I</hi> may now ſpeak ſomething concerning Nationall Churches, which the Independents deny) I farther gather, That if many hundred Congregations being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together under one Presbytery in any great City or Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity within any large Juriſdiction, may all of them make up but one Church within that Precinct, and may take its name or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from the City or place in which it is: <hi>I</hi> ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why a thouſand Pariſhes, yea ten thouſand, all of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Goſpell and making profeſſion of the true Chriſtian Religion, in what Kingdome, Nation, Province, Country, or Commonwealth ſoever they be, may not all of them in thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Countries, being all of them combined together and under ſome grand Presbyteries, take their ſeverall names and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations

and King of his church which was typified by the legall high Prieſt and the Kings of Judah and do yeeld obedience unto him and that government he hath appointed in his church, may all of them, being joyned in a particular conſociation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in any country Nation or Province or Kingdome, receive their denomination from the ſeveral countries &amp; nations in which they are. For the Church eatholick being an <hi>homogenial and ſimilar body</hi> retains the name of church, into what cities, countries, nations or Kingdomes ſoever it be divided into; <hi>for as thoſe many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the Church at</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>made all of them but one church within its precincts, and had its name from thence;</hi> ſo may the many Pariſhes and Villages, which being met together in their ſeverall bounds, in the profeſsion of the ſame Chriſtian faith, make but one Church, being all of them through that countrie combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together under one government, both Eccleſiaſticall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; for as for the diviſion of the nations, it is not to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, meerly as an humane and politicke Ordinance, as many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and therefore would make Provinciall Churches, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches a humane invention; for in the 32. of <hi>Deut. v.</hi> 8. it is ſaid there <hi>when the moſt high divided to the nations their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;</hi> ſo that God was the Author of this diviſion, and gave their ſeverall names unto them, and ſet all their bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; yea, he hath ſet the bounds of every man, as it is ſufficiently proved by the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. where hee ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. <hi>that God hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the bounds of their habitations;</hi> ſo that the diviſion of the whole world into divers nations, and thoſe nations into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Provinces and Counties, and thoſe counties into ſo many hundreds, and Wapentakes, or Rapes, or Tribes, and all theſe into ſo many ſeverall Pariſhes, is ſaid to be Gods owne appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for he is ſaid to have divided the nations, &amp; tohave ſet them their bounds; and therefore I can conceive no reaſon why Pariſh Churches amongſt us may not as well be accounted Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as Pariſh Synagogues amongſt the Iewes; and why citie Churches amongſt us may not as well be Gods Ordinance now, as it was then; for ſo by divine inſtitution they were then in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times eſteemed; and it is well knowne that in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> all their ſeverall Townes, as that of <hi>Plymouth, Boſtorne,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:58"/>
               <hi>Cambridge,</hi> &amp;c. have all their bounds and limits preſcribed unto them, and all the people within that precinct, and no farther, that ſubmit themſelves to that their government, are ſaid to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each ſeverall Church, and of no other; and yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all this is as much politick, as the diviſion of our Pariſhes and Cities; and thoſe Churches conſtituted by the Apoſtles in every citie, village and countrey, were as much politick as ours, and yet are called Gods Ordinances: and truly I know no good reaſon why our pariſh churches ſhould not farre rather, and with farre greater reaſon be of divine inſtitution, then thoſe churches of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way: for it is well knowne that all the Members in our ſeverall Pariſhes dwell within ſuch and ſuch limits, and for the moſt part are all well and familiarly knowne one to an other; and every weeke, once at leaſt ſee all one an others faces, and can daily meet together for to watch over one another; whereas thoſe of the congregationall way dwell many of them twenty miles one from another, and ſome threeſcore miles one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and all for the moſt part a great diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſcattered here and there, ſo that they cannot poſsibly one watch over an other, as is pretended, and behold one an others converſation, for that is impoſsible; and therefore for my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar I know that the parochiall or pariſhionall aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together for the injoying of the Ordinances hath preſidents for it in holy Writ, and that many, both in cities and villages; but wee have not one preſident of ſuch congregations as are now in our new Churches in all the whole Booke of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude that all our parochiall meetings are farre more of divine inſtitution, and Churches properly ſo called then the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the congregationall way: And by the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I may gather that the Chriſtian Churches now through the world, at leaſt all the reformed Churches may as well be called nationall Churches, as the Jewiſh Church was, eſpecially if we looke unto the requiſites that make a nationall Church; for two things are required for the making of a nationall Church; firſt a nationall agreement in the ſame faith and worſhip. Secondly, a nationall union in one Eccleſiaſticall body in the ſame commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Eccleſiaſticall government; as now the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> have all by covenant bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to maintaine the ſame faith and worſhip, and by a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="tcp:48122:58"/>
union and agreement they have accorded to be under a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall government, and this they all acknowledge to be Gods Ordinance, and a way appointed by him of governing his church; and that the Presbyterian government is Gods Ordinance, the Independents themſelves doe acknowledge, but they hold only a congregationall Presbyterie, and we hold, and that from all reaſon, and from the good word of God, and from many preſidents, both Citie, claſſicall, provinciall and nationall Presbyteries, and oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall alſo upon occaſions; for of theſe kinds of Presbyteries, both the Word of God, and many Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories doe furniſh us with ſome preſidents: and therefore for the one wee have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution for it, and many examples in the Booke of God; but wee have neither precept nor example of that of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall way, and therefore it is none of Gods inſtitutions, nor none of his <hi>devices nor compoſures,</hi> that I may uſe ſome of <hi>I. S.</hi> his Rhetoricke, but a meere figment of their own braine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now I am to anſwer to ſomething my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>hath to ſay concerning the Presbyters of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>who</hi> pag. <hi>6. 7. of his Booke,</hi> If you <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> have not a good Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, where ſhall hee, <hi>viz.</hi> that is ſcandalized or offended, goe to complaine? Hee may goe and appeale higher you will ſay, and what if the higher the worſe? Good Brother <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> either provide the people of the Land an honeſt godly Presbytery, that may be as ſo many Angels to gather out of Christs Kingdome every thing that offends; or elſe let there be a tender care of tender conſciences, and ſome proviſion made for them, that they may not be ſcandalized by being forced to be the companions of the ſcandalous. <hi>Thus my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Burton.</p>
            <p>Here is a double <hi>If</hi> propounded meerly to amuſe the people: for it is not unknowne to all men that the Parliament, the great Councell of the Kingdome, endeavoureth to caſt out all ſcandalous Miniſters, ſo farre as their power extendeth through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if by information and ſufficient witneſſes they can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſuch; ſo that every conſcientious and intelligible man may ſee there is very ſmall ground for the doubts and feares, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> or any of that Fraternity, that there will not be a good Presbytery ſet up, and as little (when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but the godly if offended may goe and appeale higher) for either he himſelfe or they to make ſuch a ſuppoſition; <hi>what if</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:59"/>
               <hi>the higher the worſe?</hi> If I ſhould conclude, that theſe doubts were conceived, nouriſhed, and brought forth out of the wombe of faction, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> with his complices would call it rayling; therefore to avoid (ifit be poſſible) their unjuſt cenſures I onely ſay thus much, that both hee and all his brethren uſe an uncharitable way of arguing (which is the beſt conſtruction can be made of it) for thus they may traduce any man, yea, any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or any way of God at pleaſure, with a detracting <hi>if.</hi> But here lies the myſterie; the onely way my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his aſſociats have to advance Independency, is to cloud the truth of God under darke expreſsions, and to eclypſe thoſe ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lights, the faithfull godly Miniſters throughout the kingdom, that the Lord hath ſet up in his Church, that ſo the people may not heare the voice of God ſpeaking in them, by which meanes the underſtandings of many are wrapped up in error, obſcurity and darkeneſſe, as in a mantle, and the ungrounded and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable notions of Independency are received by them as new Lights, they being very pleaſing to fleſh and blood: for man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hath an ambitious, boundleſſe ſpirit, and from the beginning would not be limited by God himſelfe, and the Independent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being without bounds, teaching that it is free for men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, practiſe and preach abroad their ſeverall opinions (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it liberty of conſcience) this is ſuch a Light that all the ſons and daughters of darkeneſſe will willingly walke in. But ſhould the Independents obtaine their deſire, whereever this new Light were ſet up, it would prove no other liberty then that which our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> gained for their Rebellion againſt Gods command, which was to inſlave themſelves, and all their poſterity to ſinne and Satan; and moſt certaine it is, that ſuch a liberty as the Independents doe teach, ſeeke, and (joyning with all ſort of Sectaries and Libertines) plead and ſtand for, would bring confuſion, and an irrevocable curſe on thoſe Kingdomes and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries as ſhall tolerate ſo great abominations, and cauſe the Lord who hates <hi>Laodicean</hi> Lukewarmeneſſe in Religion, <hi>to ſpue them out of his mouth, Revel.</hi> 3. 15. 16. But before I paſſe on, I will take this liberty to ſay unto my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that whatſoever with his <hi>Ifs</hi> hee can plead againſt our Presbyters, may be ſaid with much more, and with farre better reaſon againſt the independent Presbyters, if they be wicked or hereticall; for from them there
<pb facs="tcp:48122:59"/>
is no appeal for reliefe by any amongſt them never ſo much wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and therefore all ſuch kinds of arguing againſt our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is as altogether uncharitable, ſo but trifling. But my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> cals upon me <hi>to provide the people of the Land an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and godly Presbyterie;</hi> from whence it appeares that in his and his brethrens account all the Orthodox, faithfull and godly Presbyters in the Land at this day, who differ from the opinions they have lately received, are neither honeſt nor godly: for if there be (as moſt certaine it is there are many) honeſt &amp; godly Presbyters provided for the people of the Land, it is ſtrange he ſhould ſpeak in ſuch a manner, as if they were altogether wanting, for ſo his words doe intimate; for why otherwiſe ſhould he make ſuch a requeſt to me of providing an honeſt &amp; godly Presbyterie, if he or they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wee had a godly Presbytery already, who notwithſtanding he knows hath no power to performe it? Truly all his Argumentations are very uncharitable, &amp; no way beſeeming a Brother; for charity is kind, <hi>and thinks no evill,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. 5. But were it ſo, that it might be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> that ther were not any ſuch ſet up in this land, which were to deny the Suns ſhining at noon-day, did hee and the Independents indeed and in truth unfainedly deſire ſuch a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie ſhould be ſet up &amp; eſtabliſhed, why do they not, as they falſly accuſe them, firſt prove them to be enemies of Jeſus Chriſt and his Kingdom, and not a godly and an honeſt Presbyterie, and then as in duty they are all bound earneſtly in the firſt place ſeeke to God, that he would ſend <hi>faithfull Labourers into his Vineyard,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to authority, that they would ſet up an honeſt and a godly Presbyterie, and give unto them full power that they may be as ſo many Angels to gather out of Chriſts Kingdom every thing that offends according to the Word of God, which all the knowing godly Presbyterians (Miniſters and people) do heartilydeſire, that ſo no truly tender conſciences may be ſcandalized? this I ſay were the duty of them all, and not to make ſuppoſitions &amp; needleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to thoſe that have neither power nor authority to doe it. But the Independents are ſo farre from this, that they have made it their deſigne hitherto, to hinder the worke of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by rayſing up queſtions continually, as being alwayes unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied (and by ſeeking to ſtirre up the people in their preachings and Pamphlets againſt the Presbyterians) and that meerly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, retard and keepe off a ſetled government in the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:48122:60"/>
God (ſaying) <hi>what haſte is there of that?</hi> and in the meane time they fiſh in our troubled waters, and yet their ſtrongeſt and moſt effectuall baits wherewith they allure and catch the poore ſilly fiſhes, I meane the ſimple and unſtable people, is this, to tell them that there is not any Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>government ſetled, and that as they <hi>have waited many years already, ſo they may waite as many more, and be as farre off from Diſcipline, and a through Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they now are,</hi> ſaying withall, if they doe waite to have a Presbyterie ſet up, <hi>what if it be not a good one? and what if they have not power to gather out of Chriſts Kingdome every thing that offends?</hi> affirming, <hi>that as it is uncomfortable, ſo it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſinfull, to live without the Ordinances, which amongſt the Saints, and none but Beleevers in their Congregations they may injoy.</hi> Thus whiles the Independents doe labour and endeavour with all their might to oppoſe the ſetling of Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>government, they make the want thereof the moſt powerfull and prevalent Engine and Argument to draw the people into their way; and upon the occaſion of theſe Interrogatories or queries, and of theſe <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands</hi> of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and his confedertes, I ſhall ſet downe ſome of their Independent practiſes well known to many thouſands in this Kingdome beſides my ſelfe, by which their ingratitude, both to God and men, and the reſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſneſſe of theſe mens ſpirits will the better appeare to all ſuch as are not blinded with a previous or prejudicated opinion. So that all men of diſcerning ſpirits by beholding their juglings and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proceedings, may learne to ſhun them, and to take heed of them, and all their by-wayes. It is well knowne that in the time of the Prelats power, the removall of a very few things would have given great content unto the moſt ſcrupulous conſciences: for I my ſelfe can ſpeake thus much, not only concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Profeſſors here in <hi>England,</hi> but the moſt rigid Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts beyond the Seas, with many of which I had familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at home and abroad, and amongſt all that ever I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with, I never heard them till within theſe twenty yeares deſire any other thing in Reformation, but that the Ceremonies might be removed with their Innovations, and that Epiſcopacy might be regulated, and their boundleſſe power and authority taken from them, and that the extravagances of the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Court might be annihilated, and made void, and that there
<pb facs="tcp:48122:60"/>
might through the Kingdom be a preaching Miniſtery every where ſet up. This was all that the moſt that I was then acquainted with deſired in the Reformation of Church matters. Indeed within this ſixteene yeares I met with ſome that deſired a more full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and yet if they might have injoyed but that I now mentioned, they would have beene very thankfull to God and authority, and have ſate downe quietly. But yet I ſay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt extent of their deſires, reached but to the removall of all the Ceremonies and Innovations, the taking away of the Service Booke, and the putting downe of the High Commiſſion Court, (which was called the court Chriſtian, though it was rather Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan) and the removall of the Hierarchy, root and branch, and the ſetting up, and eſtabliſhing of a godly Presbyterie through the Kingdome; this was I ſay <hi>all and the uttermoſt Reformation that was required by the moſt ſcrupulous men then living that I knew;</hi> yea, I can ſpeake thus much in the preſence of God, <hi>that Maſter</hi> Robinſon <hi>of</hi> Leiden, <hi>the Paſtor of the Browniſt Church, there told mee and others, who are yet living to witneſſe the truth of what I now ſay, that if hee might in</hi> England <hi>have injoyed but the liberty of his Miniſtry there, with an immunity but from the very Ceremonies, and that they had not forced him to a ſubſcription to them, and impoſed upon him the obſervation of them, that hee had never ſeparated from it, or left that Church.</hi> This I can depoſe; ſo that all men may ſee, the very diſpenſing with the ceremonies would then have given great content to the moſt auſtere profeſſors; how much more may any man ſuppoſe would they have ſate down ſatisfied, if but the very ceremonies then might have bin removed?</p>
            <p>Surely if the Prelats had not beene infatuated, and had they but in thoſe things a little connived, and would have abated ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their rigour, for ought I know, they might have never been queſtioned, but they might have injoyed all their honours and greatneſſe, and whatſoever they could have deſired, and that with the good liking of all the people; had they I ſay but <hi>diſpenſed with thoſe needleſſe vanities, and had they but favoured honeſt and godly Miniſters, and ſet up Lights, I meane good Preachers in the darke places and corners of the Kingdome, they would have beene beloved and reverenced of all men, and no man would have envied their Magnificence:</hi> yea, I am moſt aſſured had they but favoured good and godly men, the whole Kingdome would have beene their
<pb facs="tcp:48122:61"/>
friends; and whereas they all at laſt petitioned againſt them, they would have ſupplicated in their behalfe, that they might ſtill have continued in their authority. But through their owne pride, and from an ambition of Lording it over their brethren, and by their tyrannicall practices, and licentious living they have brought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion upon themſelves, and beene one of the principall cauſes of all the miſeries and diſtractions, and of all the blood-ſhed that the three Kingdomes are now involved with; and for ought <hi>I</hi> can diſcerne our Independent Predicants now treading in their ſteps, and ſeeking to be the ſole and onely men, and to ſet up their new government, <hi>which is more groundleſſe then that of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> if the Lord of his infinite power and goodneſſe prevent not their deſigne, they are in a way to bring a greater confuſion upon both Church and State, and the three Kingdomes then that which were are all now imbroyled with: For I have heard them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily conclude amongſt themſelves, making uſe of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophet, <hi>that they ſhall come to thee, and not thou to them,</hi> intimating by thoſe words that they would never ſubmit themſelves to the Presbyterian claſſicall Government, but that all the Presbyters muſt come in, and yeeld to their Independency, ſo that if they perſiſt in this their groundleſſe Reſolution, wee may never promiſe unto our ſelves any peace or quiet, <hi>unleſſe they may have what they aſpire to, and what they deſire;</hi> and for ought I know there will be no end of their <hi>demands, nor no limits or bounds to their requeſts and prayers: for they looke every day for new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and expect yet more new Lights,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that all truths are not yet fully revealed, and therefore according to thoſe they ſay they muſt act and be moved;</hi> ſo that by this their doctrine, there will never be a period of their Grolleries.</p>
            <p>And all men may well perceive what an endleſſe worke they that ſhall ſatisfie the Independents will have by their very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: for to my knowledge the chiefeſt of them, and thoſe that are now in higheſt eſteeme in that Fraternity, and the chiefeſt men and women amongſt them at the beginning of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſired only <hi>the removall of the Ceremonies, and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, the removall of the Service Booke, the putting downe of the High Commiſſion Court, and the taking away of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy root and branch, and the ſetting up of the Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as it was in other Reformed Churches, and eſpecially in</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:61"/>
               <hi>that of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and that was all they then deſired;</hi> and there were then none in all the Citie of <hi>London</hi> that more honoured the <hi>Scots</hi> to my knowledge then they: None that entertained them more nobly and freely (which was the honour of our nation, and for their owne reputation) none that frequented the miniſtery of the Scots more, and that more zealouſly attended upon it every Lords day whiles they were lodged by <hi>London</hi>-Stone then they: ſo that I doe not know at this time an Independent in <hi>London,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the principalleſt of them, that were not then great Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Scots, and very deſirous of that Church-government here in <hi>England,</hi> that is now amongſt them, and which they have ſince covenanted for; yea, they were the only people that brought in the Scots; and yet behold now the vanity and inſtability of all theſe men, <hi>there are not any, neither in Citie or Countrey that more maligne them, and are now greater enemies to them and the Presbyterian government then theſe very Independents,</hi> which makes me thinke that it will be as impoſſible a worke for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or any authority to ſatisfie them, as it is impoſsible for the whole world to ſatisfie the avarice of a covetous man, one ſtory of the which comes now to my mind, which I ſhall at this time relate upon my owne knowledge, which ſomewhat ſuteth with theſe times in which we live.</p>
            <p>I <hi>being one day ſome twenty yeares ſince at a great Feſtivity in a Doctor of phyſicks houſe here in</hi> London, <hi>he in a merry way related unto his gueſts how poore he came into this Citie, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto them all,</hi> that hee was not worth ſix pounds in the world, books and all at his firſt comming, <hi>and that being entertained into the Family of one of Queene</hi> Elizabeths <hi>Doctors of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to her perſon, for to teach his children, he ſo pleaſed the humour of the Doctor,</hi> that hee let him have the uſe of his Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and communicated unto him the way of his practice, and gave him many excellent receipts, and hee remaining with him ſome five yeares, it pleaſed God to take away the Doctor, and his Apothecary taking a very good liking to him, perſwaded him now to practiſe phyſicke in his place, wiſhing him withall to take ſome convenient houſe by him, promiſing him that hee would further him what hee could, ſaying moreover that he doubted not but by the prayſe, and the goodreport hee would give of him, to make all thoſe noble perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages that were the Doctors Patients, to make uſe of him, and hee

would do all this upon condition that he would uſe no other Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary but himſelf, to which the Doctor willingly condeſcended: <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apothecary ſo beſtirred himſelf that he made good his promiſe and brought him into the greateſt practice of any Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an then in</hi> London.</p>
            <p>But ſaid he, when I firſt began to practice, being very poor, I thought with my ſelfe that if I could with all my pains and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry get but an hundred pounds a year to live upon when I am old, or leave to my Family, I would never aſpire to greater riches: and truly, ſaid he, within the ſpace of one year I got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two thouſand pounds and purchaſed an hundred pounds a year, and then I thought with my ſelfe if I could but make it up two hundred, I would reſt contented without any farther ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I within leſſe then one years ſpace made it up two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and then I thought if <hi>I</hi> could but make it up five hundred pound a year, I would never deſire any more, and within a few years (ſaid he) I made it up five hundred pound a year; and then I thought with my ſelfe if I could now but make it a thouſand pound a year, I would then be content, and within a few years I had my deſire: And then I thought with my ſelfe if I could make it up but two thouſand pound a year, I would never deſire any more wealth; and before I was fifty years of age I had, ſaith he, purchaſed two thouſand pound <hi>per annum:</hi> And then I thought with my ſelfe if <hi>I</hi> could make it up but three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> I would then go build Hoſpitalls and reſt abundantly ſatisfied; and truly, ſaith he, within a few years I made it up above three thouſand pound by the year and by my troth, ſaid he, <hi>I</hi> am now as covetous as ever I was.</p>

               <hi>This ſtory did I hear that Doctor tell in way of gloriation to many: but it may very fitly be applyed to all the Independents, who are as boundleſſe in their deſires as this Doctor was in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe;</hi> Oh, <hi>ſaid they a few years ſince,</hi> were but the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies removed with the Innovations of the Prelates, we would be ſatisfied; and when they were gone, if now the ſervice book were but caſt out of the Church, we would be content; and when that was caſt out, now if the High Commiſſion Court were put down we ſhould then be ſatisfied; and when that was put down, then if the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy were alſo taken away root and branch, then they ſhould be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; now when that was gone, if we could have but the Preſbytery

eſtabliſhed, and that it might be with us as in the other Reformed Churches, and especially that of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> then we ſhould be abundantly thankfull to God and to the Parliament, and we would reſt ſatisfied for ever.</p>
            <p>This, to my knowledge, was the language of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and all that I now ſay can be proved by a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>Now I deſire all men to take notice how theſe men are ſatisfied with that Reformation which they ſo ambitiouſly deſired, and that is now eſtabliſhed amongſt us, when God and the Parliament hath granted them all they could or did then deſire and crave for, they are yet as unſatisfied and as covetous for more things as that Doctor was of more money, and ſo for ought I can conceive no ſtate in the world will ever be able to ſatisfie their vaſt and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited wiſhes. I may truly ſay of them that an unthankfuller ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration both to God and authority never appeared in the world, then theſe Sectaries are; but withall <hi>I</hi> ſhall ever beleeve that their Teachers and Itinerary Predicants have been the principalleſt cauſe of all their unſatisfiedneſſe and of all their deſtractions, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe <hi>Homothumadon</hi> brethren, thoſe fugitives that ran into <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> that cowardly left the cauſe and ſince have brought over their New Lights here amongſt us, to the darkning of the truth it ſelfe, and diſordering of all things, and hindring of Reformation: for they chiefly and thoſe that have followed thoſe <hi>ignes fatuos</hi> that they ſet up, have occaſioned theſe miſerable diſtractions and diviſions that are now every where through the Land, which if they be not ſpeedily lookt unto, will bring deſolation upon the three Kingdomes, all the which giddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed unſtable men I can compare to nothing more fitly then to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Drums, Trumpets and Whiſſels, and that in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: They that have read but the Hiſtory of the holy War ſhall find that when the Chriſtian Princes went up to fight for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, that many thouſands of them found graves there for themſelves, which happened unto them not from any want of valour in the Chriſtian Army, but by the diſordering of their ranks and files: which gave occaſion to the <hi>Saracens</hi> and thoſe barbarous people to break in upon them, and to cut off many thouſands of them, which diſorder happened unto them upon this occaſion. The <hi>European</hi> horſes being onely acquainted with the warlike
<pb facs="tcp:48122:63"/>
muſick of their own holy Army, never having heard ſo much as the very ſound either of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> drums, trumpets, or whif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels thoſe unſanctified inſtruments, when the Chriſtians and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels came to joyn battell, and that the Armies approached one to another, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> drums, trumpets and whiffels made ſuch a barbarous noiſe in the <hi>European</hi> horſes eares, that they were ſo ſcared and affrighted that they began to run like madd, and brake through all their own ranks and files and ſo diſordered the whole Army that it was a thouſand to one they had not been all cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces at the firſt encounter. And even after the ſame manner have the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> brethren and all their diſciples thoſe their I tinerary Tub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men like ſo many drums, trumpets and whif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels with their barbarous noiſes out of their ſeverall Tubs in the ears of poor creatures both men and women that were acquainted with no ſuch muſick as is exerciſed by thoſe of this new militia, as that of the <hi>Congregationall way, and Church fellowſhip, and the Church way, and the way of the Saints, and of new Lights, and new borne Truths, and of the great things of eternity which come only out of the womb of God and from between his leggs, from Gods immediate hand, by providence not to be explained, juſt as a lot,</hi> &amp;c. For theſe with many ſuch are the noiſes they have now made in the ears of the poor ſilly creatures that they have made them all run madd to the diſordering of all things and diſturbing of the whole Chriſtian Army that might by the power of God if we had been well ordered, without theſe diviſions and diſtractions they have made amongſt us, been able to have encountred with the whole hoſt of Antichriſt; but there is this difference onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> drums and whiffels and theſe our whiffellers, that they onely ſcared a few horſes and made them madd, but theſe have made men and women madd amongſt us with theſe their new and barbarous ſounds of thoſe their new wayes, and this is the firſt thing wherein they are like the Turkiſh drumms and whiffels.</p>
            <p>Now as thoſe <hi>Turkiſh</hi> inſtruments though they made a terrible noiſe, yet there was nothing in them but wind and ventoſity; ſo theſe our whiffellers, &amp; Tubmen, for the moſt part, if they be but looked into, there is nothing in them but meer vapour and frothy windineſs which they ſpread &amp; blow abroad in the ears of ſimple creatures, perſwading them <hi>that the Preſbyterians will be more</hi>

               <hi>tyrannicall and lordly then ever the Prelates were, and that they are an Antichristian brood, the ſons of Belial, the enemies of Ieſus Chriſt and his Kingdome, and that the people ought not nor cannot lawfully hear them or read any thing they write or publiſh to the world,</hi> perſwading them <hi>that all they write or preach tendeth to nothing but the diſthroning of Chriſt &amp; the ſetting him up as a Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant King;</hi> but indeed all their indeavour is but while they cry <hi>hail Maſter, to crucifie him, as the wicked Jews did,</hi> and with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth &amp; barbarous noiſes as theſe they have put the people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally into ſuch a heat, fury and diſtemper againſt all the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as they have deterred many thouſands from ſo much as hearing them or coming into their preſence, yea if at any time any of them but accidentally happen into their company they find them more barbarous towards them then the very Turks were toward many Chriſtians even when they had them at their mercy; and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident were the Presbyterians at their mercy, they would find leſſe courteſie from them then from the very <hi>Saricens;</hi> and I have very good grounds for this my perſwaſion from that inſolent behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our I my ſelfe have ſeen them exerciſe towards all ſorts of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, but principally towards the Miniſters who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they affront often and that in an unſeemly manner in the very Churches whiles they are in their Miniſtery, and when they go and paſſe along the ſtreets and when they paſſe but through the Towns where there are any ſtore or company of them; for they cannot ride by any of them without ſome reproachfull calumny or other or without ſome uncivil behaviour which would not be tolerated in very barbarous Nations. And as for my ſelfe it is well known that neither mywife nor my poor children can paſſe quietly by the ſtreets for them without ſome contumelious diſgracefull language from them: and for my own particular though I never wronged them, I can truly ſay and can alſo prove it, that <hi>I</hi> have and that often, after they heard <hi>I</hi> differed from them in opinion, ſuffered ſuch inhumanity from many of them, as ſcarce ever any man did from the moſt uncivilized people living, they uſually railing of me to my face, and ſuch of them as I know not nor never to my remembrance ſaw before their aſſaulting of me: and they that carry themſelves faireſt towards me, either puffe in my face as they paſſe by me, thinking to provoke me, or elſe make odd fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at me, or ſtare on me as <hi>I</hi> paſſe by them like a hare in a forme,

and they have often profeſſed unto many that they had as leive meet the devill as me, and ſaid that I was a devill and that I looked like the devill and like <hi>Cain,</hi> and a thouſand more ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they have upon all occaſions in their mouthes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me, beſides whatſoever they have publiſhed in their Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and beſides all their filthy and infamous language they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe to the defaming of me and mine.</p>
            <p>But this is not my condition alone, but ſo they deal with all thoſe faithfull and godly Presbyterian Miniſters, all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms me in my opinion, calling them <hi>ugly fellows, and bland aſſes, and Preſbytyrants,</hi> and loading them with all manner of reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo that they have made them all through the Kingdome ſo hatefull and infamous as they cannot dwell ſafely in their houſes where there is any increaſe of them; and all that I now write can ſufficiently be proved by many witneſſes, which paſſages of theirs towards all, corroborates me in my perſwaſion: So that by theſe barbarous practices of all the Sectaries and by theſe their uncouth ſounds <hi>they have ſo ſcared and terrified the people that now the name of a Preſbyterian is formidable to many, and it is enough to hinder any from preferment that they can but blaſt with the name of a Preſbyterian;</hi> and this alſo hath been generally obſerved, <hi>that there is ſcarſe a man found to have been familiar at any time with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Sectaries, that if he once come to declare himſelf to ſtand for the Preſbytery, that ever they could endure after, whatſoever love they ſeemed to ſhew towards him before that time;</hi> yea it is farther obſerved, <hi>that ſcarſe ever any man of what rank or faſhion ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he were that familiarly converſed amongſt them, that they have not afterwards betrayed or blaſted their in honor and reputation,</hi> yea <hi>I</hi> could tell many a ſad ſtory to the deterring of any Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian for ever being familiar with any of that brood, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall ever be able to prove <hi>that when ſome of them that were poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and obſcure men, yet for their ſeeming holineſs have by great Parſonages been entertained in their families, and whom they made their principall companions, theſe most ungratefull and treacherous fellows have made uſe of this their noble courteſie and humanity but to find how they ſtood affected to Independency, and when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they were not for their purpoſe, though otherwiſe they were very moderate men, yet they raiſed many infamous reports of them, yea they ſo blasted them in their honours as they could never</hi>

If ever there was need of this exhortation, there is now ſingular uſe of it, eſpecially in this diſtracted Nation wherein we live. For the diviſion of a Kingdom is the ruine of it: the diviſion of a family deſtroys it: the diviſion between brethren brings a confuſion amongſt them. It hath ever bin obſerved, That diverſity of judgment &amp; opinion hath made a difference in affection. The difference between the <hi>Iews</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in points of Religion, made the Diſciples deſire, That fire might come down from heaven to end that controverſie.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48122:68"/>
The difference between us and the Papiſts, and the diverſity of opinions between us, made them, becauſe they could not bring down fire from heaven, fetch it out of hell, to blow up the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and becauſe that had not the deſired effect, and the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinion ſtil remaining, makes the difference of their affection from us ſo great, that nothing can expiate their indignation againſt us, but the utter internetion and deſtruction of us all; and this and this only, next unto our own ſins, is the cauſe of all thoſe fatall calamities this miſerable kingdome is now imbroyled with. And therefore, all care and diligence among brethren, ſhould be uſed to get a right underſtanding one of another, and to move them to bear one with another, and ever to call to minde the ſaying of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>Let not us contend together for we are brethren.</hi> I am moſt aſſured, if there were a right underſtanding of the differences that are now among brethren, there could not be ſuch bitter expreſſions one againſt another, and ſuch alienation of affection as is now too frequent and too well known to the common enemy. We are commanded, <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lies in us, to be in in peace with all men, Rom.</hi> 12. 18. And the fruits of diſcord are ſet down in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Galathians</hi> verſe 15. <hi>If</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>ye bite and devoure one another, take heede yee be not conſumed one with another,</hi> and in the 20. <hi>verſe. Hatred</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>varience, emulation, ſtrife, hereſies &amp;c. and envyings are of the fleſh, and they that do ſuch things ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> A double miſery follows thoſe that do theſe things, miſery here, and miſery hereafter, it excludes men out of heaven. The contemplation of the ſad condition, that will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably come upon that Land, Kingdome, and Church, where thoſe variances and heart-burnings are, and where there is ſuch diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of opinions, and by reaſon of them, ſuch difference in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, put me chiefely upon this imployment, to ſee and try, if by any poſſible meanes, I could, by ſhewing wherein the difference between the brethren lyeth, be an inſtrument of a good accord amongſt them: reſolving with my ſelf by Gods aſſiſtance whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others do, to obſerve to the uttermoſt of my abilities, the royall Law, <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. 8. I do conceive, that if there were a right underſtanding one of anothers opinions, the world would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there ſhould be ſuch invectives in every pamphlet one againſt another, and ſuch varience among thoſe that are joyned together
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48122:68"/>
and that with nigheſt relations. The truth is, the miſ-underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of each others opinions and the miſ-priſian of each others intentions, is the onely cauſe of this diverſity of affection which to the diſhonour of God and of our holy profeſſion, and indeed to the diſgrace of Chriſtian Religion, every where too much ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe. And therefore as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Lot,</hi> ſo ſay I to all thoſe that love the truth in ſincerity and wiſh the Peace of <hi>Zion;</hi> Let not us contend, eſpecially with evill language, for we are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; we have one father, we worſhip one God, we have one light, one truth, one way. And this I profeſſe to all the world, That I contend not for victory, but for that ancient light, the faith once delivered unto the Saints, <hi>Iude</hi> 3. For that truth <hi>which we have heard from the beginning,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>for the old way,</hi> verſe 6. <hi>The way the truth and the life, Ioh.</hi> 14. and for the honour of that Church againſt which the gates of hell can never prevaile; in the which there are all thoſe undeceiveable marks, as are able for ever to declare her to be built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> in which the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt is purely and ſincerely both preached and beleeved, and where the Sacraments are rightly adminiſtred, and in the which there is the true invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and all other requiſites that make her a true Church; and from which there is no juſt cauſe of ſeparation. That I have dedicated this Treatiſe to no man, nor ſought the patronage of any Authority, no mortall creature I preſume, will blame me, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Reaſons. For writing in defence of the Prerogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Kings, againſt Papall Uſurpation; I dedicated my booke unto the King of great <hi>Britaine, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſuppoſing my ſelfe ſafe under his protection, whoſe honour and imperiall dignity I maintain: but all men know, what miſery to the ruine of me, my wife, and many ſmall children came upon me by it, through the power and exorbitant authority of the Prelates: ſo that for my duty and Loyalty to the King, I had a priſon for my reward, and the ſcornes and contumelies of the world to comfort me in it. And when I moſt humbly petitioned his highneſſe, complaining againſt the injuſtice done me, and moſt ſubmiſſively ſupplicated his Majeſty (who was the <hi>Caeſar</hi> to whom only I could then appeal) that he would be pleaſed to grant me one of theſe humble requeſts, either That his Majeſty would be pleaſed, but for one houre to give me a hearing of my juſt defence; or if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48122:69"/>
that could not be granted, That at leſt he would then grant me that liberty in his Kingdome, that he denyed not to Crows and Kites and other Vermine, that I might provide for my young ones; and if his highneſſe would not be pleaſed to condeſcend unto either of the former juſt demands, That then he would give me leave to depart the Kingdom, and to go into any other Country where I might enjoy my Liberty and provide for my poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed family. I am moſt aſſured there was never a more equall Petition put up to any Prince in the world, yet his Majeſtie vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed not to yeeld unto any of theſe my requeſts, nor to any other Petition put up either by my poor diſtreſſed wife or calamitous children; ſo that without any wrong unto his Majeſty, I may truely ſay, That <hi>Paul</hi> found more favour from a Heathen Roman <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then I had from a Chriſtian King, the defender of the faith. After I ſaw all poſſibility of releefe was now taken from me, I writ my Apology to the Biſhops themſelves, diſcovering unto them their unjuſt proceedings in their Courts, and their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings towards my ſelfe, and gave them my reaſons of all I ſpake, without any offenſive language and without any perturbation of Spirit; and Dedicated this my Booke to the Lords of his Majeſties Privy Councell, expecting ayde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe from them, and indeed I had no hope of ſuccour from any other, nor knew none to whom I could better apply my ſelfe, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly imploring their patronage; but they, as it is well knowne, of Patrons became my unjuſt Judges, and after they had made me a ſpectacle to Men and Angells, and expoſed me to the ſcorne and ludibry of the world, ſent me into baniſhment, where I lived a living death and a dying life, and ſuffered ſuch intolerable miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all ſorts, as would exceed beliefe to relate; and I am moſt confident, if all the particulars were truly known, the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the like, and there I had ended my dolefull life, had not God of his infinite mercy called this Parliament, and put into their hearts to redeem me from my captivity; for the which incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable favour, I do, as of duty I am ever bound, profeſſe my ſelfe to the laſt drop of my blood to be their ſervant in the Lord, and in all their moſt juſt and honourable imployments; I hope, with all fidelity to anſwer to the expectation of the world, and ſhall in life and death ſhew my ſelfe to be one, that without all by-reſpects ſhall ever aime at the glory of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the honour of them and my

Again, if any man ſhould go about to perſwade me, that there were any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed in the Church of God, then an Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and a Presbyterian one, I ſhould notwithſtanding all humane reaſon to the contrary, ſubmit my ſelf to that kind of government,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48122:70"/>
as being moſt confidently aſſured that it is warranted in Gods Word; which all Chriſtians are bound for ever to make the Rule and Square, both of our faith, manners and government. And here I muſt minde all thoſe that ſhall read this Book, that this is no new opinion of mine, but that which I have once and again ſuffered for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if ever they have read my <hi>Elenchus religionis papiſticiae,</hi> or my <hi>Flagellum pontificis,</hi> or my <hi>Apologie,</hi> or any of my Latine Books, in all thoſe they will finde, that the cauſe of all my ſufferings was this, and this only, That I maintained that all Churches were to be governed by an Ariſtocraticall and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian government, which in thoſe Books I have clearly and fully (through Gods aſſiſtance) made good. Yea, in in my anſwer to the Bill of Information put up againſt me in the Star-chamber, they ſhall have ſome reaſons I gave there, of this my tenent, to the Lords of his Majeſties Hrivie Councell, and Judges in the Star-chamber; ſo that I ſtand to my principles and am no ſtarter. And if then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Gods people it was thought an opinion worthy the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for, and my Chriſtian brethren deemed me worthy of honour for it, and afforded me their prayers, and ſhewed me and mine in all our diſtreſſes, many curteſies, when we found little favour from our own brethren (which their humanity I muſt never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, but with all due thankfulneſſe for ever acknowledge) I ſay, if then this my opinion was thought Orthodox, and worthy of their applauſe, I ſee no good reaſon why a truth then ſhould not be counted a truth now; for the Word of God out of which I had it, is the ſame, and if it were good then, it is good now: for the change of mens minds cannot change the truth, but it muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truth: but this my opinion I learned out of Gods Word then which ſhall be for ever, by his gracious aſſiſtance the warrant of my beliefe and practice.

This is granted on all ſides, and of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it muſt be yeilded unto, that that Oblation is the beſt and moſt acceptable that is offered up by faith, without which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God, and that ſacrifice only is offered up by faith, which is according to his Word, and has its warrant from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, which is the rule both for worſhip and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church we are to be guided by. The Brethren on both ſides agree about the rule in deciding of this Coutroverſie and make the written word the rule. They agree alſo about the materials, both acknowledging a Presbytery, the difference between them is only, about the mould and manner of the offering. I will therefore ſtate the queſtions between us, and ſhew wherein we differ, and then ſet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> down my own opinion with my reaſons, and after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be a Moderator for the determining of this unhappy difference, which hath been an occaſion of ſo much rejoycing to the common Enemy.</p>
               <p>There is a two-fold queſtion between us, they call the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and our Brethren they tearme Independents. The firſt is concerning the government of the Church, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> whether it be Presbyterian Dependent, or Presbyterian Independent. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion is, concerning the gathering of Churches: but of that in its due place. The firſt queſtion is whether many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations or Chriſtian Aſſemblies (commonly called Churches in our dialect) in the which there are all the acts of worſhip, or all Ordinances, as the pure preaching of the Goſpell, the due and right adminiſtration of the Sacraments, the true invocation of God, Diſcipline rightly executed, and all other performances, which make for the eſſence and form of a true Church, and in the which aſſemblies likewiſe, they have all ſuch officers and helps of Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in their ſeverall places being rightly imployed, may ſerve for the edification of the ſame, and mutuall comfort and benefit of each other, and the preſervation ofall, as Presbyters, doth preaching and ruling and Deacons, and all other Officers; I ſay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48122:71"/>
the queſtion between us and the brethren is, Whether all theſe ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies, may be accounted but one Church, or make but one Church within their Precincts; and be to be under the government and rule of one Presbytery, or a Councell or Colledge of many Presbyters together, upon which, all the Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies under it are to depend; and to which in all weighty buſineſſes they are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, for any injury or conceived wrong, or ſcandall; or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of any abuſes in Doctrine or manners, and for the exerciſing of Church-Diſcipline upon incorrigable and ſcandalous offenders; as admonition for giving offence, ſuſpenſion from the Ordinances till amendment and reformation; or if obſtinate, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or whether every one of thoſe particular Congregations, or Aſſemblies be they never ſo ſmall, ſeverally or conſidered a part, and by themſelves be Independent; that is to ſay, have full and plenary authority within themſelves, without reference to this, or any other great Councell or Presbytery, for tranſacting or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all differences about faith or manners amongſt themſelves, or for the redreſſing of any grievances or abuſes, or the exerciſing of the power of Diſcipline or juriſdiction, and from the which there is no appeal for relief, though the parties offended conceive they have never ſo much injury or wrong done them? In a word, whether two Presbyters with a ſlender Congregation, have an abſolute kinde of Spirituall Soveraignty among themſelves, in their own Congregation, and as ample authority as was given to the whole Colledge of the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and to the whole Presbytery in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> And this is the firſt Queſtion: Which that it may the better be underſtood, I will propound it in a ſimile, and that in a matter well known unto all men: The government of this famous City of <hi>London,</hi> and of many other great Cities through the Kingdome, are called Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, that is to ſay, majeſtracies; and have in them a Secular or Civill Signory or Presbytry, who are inveſted with Anthority to exerciſe all acts of Government amongſt themſelves, as if they were an abſolute Principality; and this Government, by which all Citizens and inhabitants within their Precincts and liberties, are to be ruled and ordered, as occaſion and neceſſity ſhall require, is committed to the Lord Mayors, Aldermen, and Common-Councell, who onely by ſuch other Officers as they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48122:71"/>
ſhall elect and chooſe, are to manage and exerciſe this government ſo, that all particular Citizens, and all the Companies of ſeverall Tradeſmen, are in their particular Wards, Precincts, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, by their conſtitutions and Charter, to depend upon the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of that Counſell, and are to make their addreſſes unto them upon any urgent occaſion, or conceived wrong, or when it concerns the common good, and for the time to ſtand unto their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement. Now then, the queſtion between us and our Brethren is, as if there ſhould ariſe a controverſie in theſe ſeverall Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Whether the Companies in each City where they all have their ſeverall Halls, and their ſeverall aſſemblies and meetings upon all occaſions, and have all their Officers, and exerciſe alſo a power of ruling and juriſdiction among themſelves be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that is to ſay, have plenary authority within themſelves without reference to the Lord Mayor or Aldermen or Common-counſell, to determine of all things among their ſeverall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and from the which there is no appeale for reliefe; though one be never ſo much injured and damnified by any unjuſt act; and whether theſe ſeverall Companies and ſeverall Aſſemblies be each of them a ſeverall Corporation or Magiſtracy, or all of them put together make but one Corporation, under one civill Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery conſiſting of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-counſell? This I thought fit to propound, that every one may the better underſtand the queſtion. Now, as this kingdome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath its ſeverall Porporations through all Pounties, and the which Porporations, although they have their ſeverall Pompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in them, yet are all dependent upon a civill Presbytery and Common-counſell, and every Company in them makes not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Porporation or Magiſtracy, or a ſeverall City, but are all dependent upon the Common-counſell or Presbytery, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordering and governing of them in all their common affaires, and for the redreſſing of abuſes, and taking away and removing of common grievances, and have their ſeverall appeals to the Common-counſell, the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen; and if they finde no juſtice there nor ſatisfaction, have their redreſſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to ſome generall Court, or ſome ſupreame judicature, as to the Parliament of the Kingdome, who redreſſe and determine all things according to the lawes and conſtitutions of the whole Kingdome. So in the Kingdome of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which

is his Church, all theſe ſeverall Churches which we reade of in the holy Scrupture of the New Teſtament, are ſo many ſeverall Corporations and Aſſociations, all the ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies as ſo many ſeverall Companies in them, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Presbytery or Common-counſell and Colledge of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Rulers, all making up but one Church in every one of their juriſdictions and ſeverall Precincts, though they be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent of never ſo many ſeverall Aſſemblies, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Cities or Townes wherein they are, or according to the ſeverall Hundreds or Diviſions aſſigned to each Presbytery, and all theſe ſeverall aſſociations to be groverned by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Presbyteries for the better ordering and preſerving of the ſame, to the which every particular man, as well as any Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or Congregation, may have their appeal for the redreſſe of any abuſes or enormities, and if they finde themſelves wronged there, then they have appeals to ſome other higher Presbytery or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Divines for relief and juſtice; and both they and all other of the ſeverall Corporations to be governed and regulated by the Laws and Statutes given by Chriſt himſelf, the onely Head and King of his Church, according onely to whoſe laws they are to be governed and ruled for the common good and preſervation of the whole Church, divided into thoſe ſeverall Juriſdictions, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations or Precincts, in imitation as neer now as may be of the Churches of <hi>Ieruſalem, Epheſus, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> &amp;c. and whoſe lawes alone muſt be the rule for the ordering of all their government, doctrine, and manners.</p>
               <p>I have premiſed this I have now ſaid, that all men may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand the ſtate of the Queſtion and controverſie in hand. Now then, if it ſhall be made appear out of the holy Scripture, That all the ſeverall Churches we have mention of in the New Teſtament, were all particular corporations or aſſociations, and governed by a Common-Councell of Presbyters, or by a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall government in each of them; and that there were many aſſemblies and congregations in thoſe ſeverall Churches, and all of them had their diſtinct Officers amongſt themſelves, in the which likewiſe they had all the Acts of Worſhip amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and did partake in all ordinances of Church-fellowſhip, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the preaching of the Word, Prayer, &amp; in the Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, and yet made but one Church,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48122:72"/>
and were all governed by a common-counſell of Presbyters, or by a common Presbyterie within their Precincts, then it muſt of neceſſity follow, that as the Mother-churches were firſt govern'd, all the Daughter-churches to the end of the world muſt be ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, and according to that rule that is ſet down in the Word of God. So then, the queſtion in hand between us and our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is, <hi>Whether, there were many Congregations and Aſſemblies in any of thoſe primitive Churches, as in that of Ieruſalem the Mother Church, and many Elders or Presbyters in that Church, and all other Officers; and whether all thoſe Congregations and Aſſemblies were one Church, and thoſe Presbyters and Officers all of them Elders and Officers of that one Church, and whether all thoſe Congregations and Aſſemblies were under one Presbytery?</hi> Which is the opinion of the Presbyterians, and the contrary that of the Independents. This I ſay is the queſtion between us and our Brethren. Now then if it can be proved, that there were more Beleevers in the Church of Jeruſalem then could all meet in one place, or in one congregation for all acts of worſhip; and if it can be evidently elucidated, that there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall aſſemblies and congregations in the Church of Jeruſalem, &amp; yet ſo, as they made but one church for government; then our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren muſt of neceſſity acknowledge that the church of Jeruſalem, was govern'd by a common-councell of Presbyters, or was presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially governed. Neither did our Brethren ever yet undertake to prove, that in caſe there were many Aſſemblies in Jeruſalem, they had ſeverall and independent presbyteries, neither it they ſhould go about to prove, could they do it. And therfore we may conclude, and that with very good reaſon and warrantable authority, that as the Mother-church, the church of Jeruſalem, in her greateſt glory was govern'd, ſo all other Churches muſt likewiſe be regulated to the end of the world; <hi>For out of Zion ſhal go forth the Law, &amp; the Word of the Lord from Ieruſalem, Iſay</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3. We muſt have both our Law from thence, and our paterne of government. And out Brethren do make the Church of Jeruſalem the patern of their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Now that all things may be handled in good order and in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall way, I will reduce the whole Diſputation concerning the firſt Queſtion into theſe foure Propoſitions, and prove them in order. The firſt, <hi>That there were many Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies of Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, in the which they enjoyed all acts of worſhip, and all the Ordinances amongſt</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48122:73"/>
themſelves, and did partake of all acts of Church-fellowſhip, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of preaching, and in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments and Prayer, <hi>and that before the Perſecution we reade of,</hi> Acts <hi>8.</hi> v. <hi>1. The ſecond,</hi> That all theſe Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies made but one Church. <hi>The third,</hi> That the Apoſtles and Elders go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, ordered, and ruled this Church, joyntly and by a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counſell and Presbytery. <hi>The fourth,</hi> That this Church of Ieruſalem and the government of the ſame, is to be a pattern for all ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and aſſemblies in any City or vicinity to unite into one Church; and for the Officers of thoſe congregations to governe that Church joyntly in a Colledge or Presbyterie.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the proof of theſe particulars, it will not be amiſſe in generall to take notice that all the Churches we read of in the New Teſtament, were Ariſtocratically and Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally governed, and were all dependent upon their ſeverall Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries; and that the ordering and managing of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lay onely upon the Presbyterie; and was their peculiar who had the power of the Keyes. Now Chriſt gave the Keyes to the Apoſtles and Presbyters only, and whatſoever the Apoſtles did in ordering and ſetling the government of the Church, they did by Chriſts command; and that order and conſtitution they ſet down in the Church, was to be perpetuated and continued to the end of the world. And the violating of this order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conſtitution, was the occaſion of the riſe and growth of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and the very cauſe of all thoſe confuſions that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world hath for theſe many generations been wearied and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with; and the occaſion of all thoſe Schiſmes, Sects, and Hereſies the world hath ever ſwarmed with: and the re-eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and reducing of it to its priſtine conſtitution, will be a means not only of removing all ſcandall, and taking away of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion amongſt Brethren, and be a ſingular means alſo of eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing a flouriſhing government in Church &amp; State, and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the bleſſings of God upon the three Kingdoms, but a way alſo of ruining that Man of Sinne, and of making an abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation through the whole world.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore firſt take notice what government was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by God in all the Primitive Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>And when they had ordained them Presbyters</hi> (for ſo it is in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) <hi>in every Church, and had prayed with faſting, they commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48122:73"/>
                  <hi>them to the Lord, on whom they beleeved.</hi> Here are two things obſervable. The firſt that the government of the Church was committed to the Presbyters. The ſecond, that the Presbyteriall government was that government that was eſtabliſhed in every Church; for ſo ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>when they had ordained them Presbyters in every Church.</hi> This was Gods ordinance, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17. <hi>And from Miletus he ſent to Epheſus, and called the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church.</hi> Here we ſee there were many Presbyters in one Church. And <hi>Verſe</hi> 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Biſhops, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi> Here, as we may obſerve, that in Gods Dialect, Presbyters and Biſhops were all one, ſo likewiſe is evident that the Church was committed to their government: this Church therefore of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was under a Presbytery, and was to be regulated joyntly by them by a common-councell of Presbyters. And <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 5. <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>life I thee in Creet, that thou ſhouldeſt put in order the things that are wanting, and ordaine Presbyters in every City, as I appointed thee. If any man be blameleſſe, &amp;c. for a Biſhop muſt be blameleſſe as the Steward of God,</hi> &amp;c. From this place likewiſe we may take notice of the parity between Presbyter and Biſhop, and that the Presbyterian government was that way of ruling that God appointed, not in one City onely, but in every City, and that theſe Presbyters were the Stewards in Gods houſe, which is his Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and had the government of thoſe Churches in every City laid upon them, which they were joyntly to governe and order by the common-counſell of Presbyters. And <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 5. v. 17. <hi>Let the Presbyters,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in word and doctrine.</hi> Still we ever obſerve, that the rule and government of the Church was in the Presbyters hands. And the Author to the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ch. 13. 7. <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>them that have the rule over you, who have ſpake unto you the Word of God, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſation.</hi> And verſ. 17. <hi>Obey,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſoules, as they that muſt give an account,</hi> &amp;c. And in verſ. 24. <hi>Salute all them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that have the rule over you, and all the</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48122:74"/>
                  <hi>Saints.</hi> Here againe he injoynes all the Churches to yeild obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to ſubmit themſelves unto the government of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, ſhewing them that it is their place to obey, and for their Miniſters to rule; and that ſo long as they command in the Lord, they out of conſcience ought to obey them, and that for a double reaſon; <hi>For they watch,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for your ſouls,</hi> and <hi>they muſt alſo give an account</hi> of their ſtewardſhip. And in 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5, 1, 2, 3. <hi>The Presbyters that are among you,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, I exhort, who am alſo a Presbyter, and a witneſſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and alſo a partaker of the glory that ſhall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the over ſight thereof, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but willingly, &amp;c. neither as being Lords over Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, but being examples to the flock.</hi> And Saint <hi>James</hi> chap. 5. ver. 14. <hi>Is any among you ſick?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let him call for the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the Church.</hi> He doth not ſay of the Churches, but of the Church. So that the Presbyterian government was in every Church, and every Church was to ſubmit it ſelf unto the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. it is ſaid, that <hi>Paul and Barnabas went up to the Apoſtles and Presbyters, &amp;c. And when they came to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem they were received of the Church</hi> (it is not ſaid of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but of the Church) and of the Apoſtles and Presbyters, &amp;c. and <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. And the Apoſtles and Presbyters came together to conſider of the matter, &amp;c. and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Then pleaſed it the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Presbyters with the whole Church,</hi> &amp;c. and wrote Letters by them after this manner. <hi>The Apoſtles, and Presbyters, and Brethren.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 17. <hi>And when we were come to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Luke, the Brethren received us gladly. And the day following Paul went in with us in to Iames, and all the Presbyters were preſent.</hi> From all which places, and many more which might be produced, it is moſt clear and evident, that in all Cities there was a Presbytery, and that the Presbyters had the power of order, namely, of preaching, and the power of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that is of ruling, which was ever to be exerciſed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not alone; and that conſiſted in admitting of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and in conventing men before them upon occaſion, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing if any offended, in ſuſpending them from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion till reformation or amendment; and if they continued obſtinate and incorrigble, in excommunicating and caſting of them out of the Church, and upon repentance, in receiving of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48122:74"/>
them in again, and in ordaining of Officers, and in appointing the times of meeting, and the places where.</p>
               <p>And within theſe limits, as I conceive, is all the power given to the Presbyters terminated, and this they are by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance joyntly and by the common-counſell of Presbyters to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and it peculiarly belongeth unto them; and therefore the Presbyterian government was the order of ruling and governing all Churches, that God himſelf eſtabliſhed, and is to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the end of the world; neither do I ever read, that the people or the congregations were joyned with them in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or had any power given them of ruling. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth of himſelf in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. that whatſoever he writ in his Epiſtles <hi>Were the Commands of the Lord.</hi> And the ſame may be ſaid of all the other Apoſtles. Now <hi>Paul</hi> writ to <hi>Titus,</hi> that the Churches in all Cities ſhould be governed by a Presbytery. And in the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> he commands <hi>Timothy</hi> again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in chap. 5. verſ. 21. and in chap. 6. v. 12, 13. I give thee charge in the ſight of God, ſaith he, <hi>That thou keep this Command without ſpot, unblameable till the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Here <hi>Timothy</hi> and all Miniſters in him, are to the end of the world bound to maintain that government unblameable that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apoſtles; and that was the Presbyterian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ruling of all Churches by joynt conſent, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon counſell or Colledge of Presbyters; ſo that nothing ought to be done or tranſacted of publick concernment without their joynt and mutuall accord or agreement and common conſent of the Presbytery. And therfore when <hi>Diotrephes</hi> aſſumed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his particular congregation a power and authority to rule according to his will and pleaſure, without the conſent of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytory, &amp; oppoſed <hi>Iohn</hi> the Presbyter, he ſharply reproves his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and ſignifies to the Church <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. That when he came he would remember his words, and teach him how to prate againſt the Presbytery with malicious words; <hi>For he</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth not himſelf only to prate maliciouſly againſt us, but he will not receive his brethren, nor ſuffer others, but caſteth them out of the Church; which is an evill thing in him;</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn: But for you,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeaking to the Church, <hi>follow not that which is evill but that which is good.</hi> It was evill in him to aſſume unto himſelf alone, and his particular Congregation, that power that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48122:75"/>
belonged unto the colledge or councell of Presbyters, and was to be moderated and exerciſed onely by the conjoynt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of the Presbytery. For God had appointed, that his Church ſhould be governed by a Presbytery; and <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would have his Congregation Independent, and have an abſolute juriſdiction within it ſelf, <hi>Which,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn, is an evill thing.</hi> So that I cannot but wonder our brethren the Independents ſhould call <hi>Diotrephes</hi> the Patriarch of the Presbyterians, as one of them did to me not long ſince; whereas if the place be du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed and conſidered; it will appear that he was the firſt that oppoſed the Presbyterian Govenment, and for the which he was by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſharply reproved, and in him, all that follow his ſteps, and will not ſubmit themſelves to the Presbytery which is Gods Ordinance, and that will not receive the brethren into the Churches, but upon their own termes and conditions. But of this buſineſſe when I come to the ſecond Queſtion.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I muſt here make reply to what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> by way of Anſwer hath to ſay to this Argument drawn from <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes</hi> his practiſe which was occaſioned as I related before, by reaſon of a diſcourſe between me and an Independent, who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, That <hi>Diotriphes</hi> was the patriarch of all the Presbyterians: which opinion of his Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> doth ſeem to favour, as by his words may appear, but I hope to make the contrary more evident then yet it hath been, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was the primate of the Independents, and of all thoſe of the congregationall way. But firſt I will ſet down Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his words at large, to take away all occaſions of their calumniating tongues, who ordinarily uſe to ſay, That we keep from the world their Arguments, that we may the better delude the people, and hold them in ignorance. His words therefore by way of anſwer to that Argument are theſe.</p>
               <p>Now let the reader judge <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> whether the Doctor be not much miſtaken in his commentary expoſition and application of this place of Scripture. And let me give you to underſtand, that Saint Iohn ſaith verſe the <hi>9.</hi> I wrote unto the Church. But ſeeing no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of any particular congregation, how can the Doctor ſo confidently affirme that it was his particular congregation? Now the reader may ſee plainly, that the Doctor can expound thoſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and their Elders or Presbyters, which the Scripture calls a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48122:75"/>
Church, to be a particular congregation. And what it was which Saint Iohn had written to the Church is not in this Epistle, nor in any other Scripture delcared, except it was, to receive thoſe brethren which he ſaith ver. <hi>8</hi> ought to be received, and ver. <hi>10</hi> whom <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi> would not receive, how then doth the Doctor ſay that <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi> aſſumed that power to himſelfe, which belonged unto the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Councell of Presbyters, without whoſe joynt and mutuall agreement, and common conſent nothing ought to be done or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of publike concernment? is the receiving of brethren, or caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of brethren a power which belongs to a colledge of Presbyters, and neither the one nor the other may be tranſacted by the Elders and Brethren of a particular congregation unleſſe the Court or common-councell of Preſbyters conjoyntly conſent unto it? Let it be alſo conſidered, that <hi>D otrephes</hi> oppoſed the brethren and forbad them that would have received thoſe who Saint John ſaith <hi>verſ.</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> we ought to receive, yea and caſt them out <hi>verſe 10.</hi> of the Church, to wit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate them. Doth it hereby appear that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would have his congregation Independent, and have an abſolute juriſdiction within it ſelfe? No, but <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would lord it over the Church, and have the preeminency above his brethren, whether fellow-Elders or fellow Saints. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> loving the primacy amongst them, he would be the Primate and Metropolitan of the Church, and have the preeminency of all the Preſbyters in it, and brethren of it. The Doctor could have urged this Scripture againſt the domineering Prelates, and why ſhould he marvell, that his brethren ſhould now urge it againſt the Court of Preſbyters. It is confeſt that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did that which was evill in uſurping authority over the Church and thoſe brethren he caſt out of the Church; But that he was the firſt that oppoſed the Preſbyterian government, or that he did affront a Court or common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>councell of Presbyters, it is more then I know, or the Doctor can prove. For had <hi>Diotrephes</hi> done ſo, why was he not convented before them? Surely the Apoſtle Saint Iohn would rather have written to the colledge of Preſbyters (if there were any ſuch) then to the Church, or in writing to the Church, would tather have ſent him a ſummons to appear at ſome conſiſtory before the Court and common-councell of Preſbyters, then to warne them to take heed of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> evill, that they did not follow it. And doubtleſſe St John would have writen thus: <hi>Diotrephes</hi> loves to be a Primate amongſt you, wherefore when the Preſbytry, that is to ſay, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48122:76"/>
or Signiory of grave, ſolid, learned, religious, and wiſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Miniſters come to keep order, and meet together in a Court and common-councell, I will remember his deeds, and informe, or complain to the Court and common-councell of Preſbyters, that he prates againſt us (the Preſbyters) with malicious words. But the Apoſtle Saint Iohn (did not know any Court or Common-councell of Preſbyters, neither Claſſicall nor Synodicall, to appeal unto) Nor can the Doctor make good thoſe appeals he mentioneth <hi>page 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to be according to the Scripture of truth, to wit, that every particular man, as well as any aſſembly or congregation, may have their appeals to the Preſbytry of their Precinct, hundred, or diviſion under whoſe juriſdictions they were, and if they found themſelves wronged there, that they have appeals to ſome other higher Preſbytry or Councell of Divines for releefe and juſtice. I only aske the Doctor how he can prove thoſe appeals by Scripture; and if he could, whether that higher Preſbytry or councell of Divines (especially if they may ſay the Holy Ghoſt and wee) be not as Independent as theſe brethren and their churches, againſt whom the Doctor hath written. And if ſo, then ſuch a high Presbytry or councell of Divines, is not Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance by the Doctors own confeſſion and affirmation. Therefore the Apoſtle writes to the Church or particular congregation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a Member and an Elder, whom he knew had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to judge him as well as the Church or particular congregation of <hi>Corinth</hi> had power to judge them that were members therein, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>5. 12. 13.</hi> and therefore might as warantably admoniſh <hi>Diotrephes</hi> as the Church of Coloſſe might Archipus: <hi>Coloſſ. 4. 17.</hi> And if nothing of publike concernment ought to be done or tranſacted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the joynt and mutuall accord or agreement, and common conſent of the Presbytry; Iohn the Presbyter would not have tranſgreſſed ſo farr, as to take upon himſelfe this authority over <hi>Diotrephes</hi> to tell the Church of his faults, and to ſay, he would remember him and ſharply reprove him, and teach him to prate againſt the Presbytry with malicious words, which belonged unto the Court and common-councell of Presbyters. But I ſhall have a juſt occaſion to ſay more touching this matter, in the anſwer unto the third question, and therefore paſſing by the objection with his anſwer mentioned page <hi>19.</hi> to the <hi>29.</hi> unto its due place. I ſhall deſire ſeriouſly to conſider the Doctors proof of his firſt propoſition, which he laboureth firſt by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch Scriptures, as he conceiveth make for the manifeſtation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48122:76"/>
of the truth, and from thence frames and formeth his arguments. <hi>Thus Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>in way of reply ſpeaketh to my argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> Diotrephes <hi>and of his intention what he will do in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcourſe to all the other arguments.</hi>

               <p>I have here ſet down his words at large, omitting only the greek and latin texts which he School-boy-like ſcribleth, to little other purpoſe than to ſhew his own vanity, and to perſwade the ignorant people, that he is ſome-body in the Greeke and Latine tongue (which kind of learning notwithſtanding the moſt of his fraternity generally deſpiſe and contemne) I have therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, eſpecially having learned this leſſon from Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 13. verſ. 19. <hi>rather to speak five words to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the people,</hi> that I might <hi>teach others, then ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> And truly unleſſe there be ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie concerning the Interpretation or about the text (as there is not here) I conceive it the greateſt folly in the world; writing in the vulgar tongue and for the common benefit of all men, to inſert ſentences either of Greek or Latin, except very varly; for it but pudders the reader that is not skilled in the languages, neither do we finde that it was the cuſtome either of the holy Prophets, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ancient Greek or Roman fathers in all their Writings or Sermons, to uſe any, but their vulgar tongue without it were very ſeldom and that with interpretation. I ſay therefore, thoſe flaſhes being excepted I have punctually ſet down all that he had to ſay againſt any of my arguments both here and every where, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor any of his party may complain, that I had not ſet down their words in their full ſtrength, and ſo might fall into the ſame condemnation with him, who hacketh and minſeth my arguments at pleaſure, picking and chooſing what he thinks himſelf beſt able to deal with, either wholly omitting the other or ſlighting of them which is the ordinary method both of Mr <hi>Knollys, J. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all the Independents, wherein they deal not fairly with me, nor ingenuouſly nor candidly with the people: for in ſo doing they delude them and meerly play the jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
               <p>This large diſcourſe of Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> if it be well weighed, hath but little ſubſtance in it, it conſiſting of abſurdities and contraditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and flat denyalls of that which he often granteth. In breife, if the reader will but duly conſider every paſſage of his anſwer,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48122:77"/>
with whathe grants in the third and the 11. pages of his pamplet, he will ſpeedily perceive, that whiles he labours to confute others, he gives a fatall blow to his own cauſe, and overthrowes that opinion which both he and all thoſe of the congregationall way labour to maintaine, and withall by the examination of the particulars he will the better diſcerne into the futility of Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe of his party, that beleeve &amp; take every word of his, for an Oracle though it be never ſo diſtructive totheir own cauſe. The ſum of this his anſwer is this, that I am<hi>miſtaken in my comentary expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and application of this place of Scripture.</hi> Theſe are his words.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſſe therefore, in the firſt place to take notice what he denyeth in his anſwer, and what he affirmeth, with the reaſons of both, that the reader may the more eaſily perceive the vanity of error and the force and efficacy of truth. Firſt he denyeth that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would have had an abſolvte juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within himſelf and have had his Congregation indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that he was the firſt that oppoſed the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or that he had any particular congregation: He deneyeth alſo that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew any Court or Common counſell of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters either Claſſicall or Synodicall to appeale to his time. The reaſons of his denyals are theſe. Firſt, becauſe ſaith he, there is no mention made of any particular congregation <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had. Secondly, it is not declared what it was that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had writ unto the Church in his Epiſtle nor in any other Scripture, except it were to receive thoſe brethren which <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would not receive and therfore, how ſaith God can the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Beſides Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would then have wrot rather to the Colledge of Presbyters (if they had been any ſuch) than to the Church, or in writing to the Church would rather have ſent him a ſummons to appeare at ſome Conſiſtory, than to warne them to take heede of his evill, that they did not follow it, and doubtleſſe he would have written thus. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> loves to be a Primate amongſt you: therefore when the Presbytery comes to keepe order, and to meet together in a Court common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48122:77"/>
I will remember his deeds, and informe and complaine to the Court that he prats againſt us with malicious words. Now when neither of this was done by the Presbytry, nor by Saint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is manifeſt that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did not oppoſe the Presbytry, and that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> then knew not of any Court or common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Presbyters either Claſſicall or Synodicall to appeale to in his time. And then in the third place he putteth me upon the proofe of thoſe appeales I made mention of page 10. affirming that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them good: And in the laſt place, he afferteth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having thus briefly ſet down what Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> both denies and affirmes with the reaſons of each, I ſhall now anſwer to every ſeverall branch in order; and if I be the more large in my reply, I crave pardon, in regard it is not only a buſineſſe of publicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and about the principle queſtion now in debate, but that it will give the more light to the wholo following diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>For anſwer therefore to his reaſon of my miſtake, in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary expoſition and application of that place of Scripture viz: that there is no mention made of any particular congregation that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had, I ſay, there was no neede of making any mention of it: For if there were many Presbyters in all the Primative and Apoſtolicall churches, and in that Church by name in which <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes</hi> was Presbyter as it is evident out of all the places above quoted as out of the 14. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the 15. and 20. and 21. of the ſame booke and the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tit.</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and the 1.

they were not to depart, as too too many of the Independent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters now amongſt us dayly do, leaving the poore ſheepe in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: I ſay when all theſe things are evident out of the holy Scripture it neceſſarily followeth, when <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was an Elder and Presbyter in that Church Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writ unto, which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> confeſſeth, that he had there his particular congregation, and therfore there was no neede of making any mention of it: for very common reaſon will dictate thus much, to any man, that if any great graſier have ten or twelve thouſand ſheepe and many ſeverall walks and places of paſturage to feed them in, and hath ſeverall paſtours to looke unto them all, as not a few Shephards can feede ten or twelue thouſands ſheepe, and gives them all a charge in common of looking to his ſheepe and feeding them, although all thoſe ſeverall paſtours are to have a generall care of all thoſe ſheep that have his marke upon them, and that are within the limits of his ſeverall walks and graſing places, yet it is to be underſtood, that every one of them hath his ſeverall flocke committed to him in ſpeciall for he muſt not be idle, over the which he is to have the particular inſpection and care for the well ordering of it, with this limitation, that he may not wrong the flocke, or do any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto his Maſters pleaſure, or to the dammage or prejudice of his other fellow Paſtours or their flocke: All this I ſay, good reaſon will dictate to any rationall man, and dayly experience will confirme it.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner things were ordered, in the primitive and Apoſtolicall Churches, all whoſe Elders and Paſtours in them, had the charge of the ſeverall flocks committed to them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, all the which they were to governe <hi>communi conſilio presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terorum</hi> as it is by all the Independents themſelves confeſt: for all thoſe Churches were Ariſtocratically and Presbyterianly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned: and therefore according to the wiſdome and common councell of their Elders, this Presbyter had the charge of the ſheepe of ſuch a ward or walke committed unto his care; and that Elder had ſuch a Circuit committed unto his charge, and a third Elder had ſuch a precinct committed to his cure, and ſo of the reſt, with this proviſo alwayes, that all things of publicke concernment, and that tended to the common good both of ſheep and Paſtours ſhould be ordered by the joynt and common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the ſeverall and reſpective Presbyters in an orderly and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48122:78"/>
well regulated way: for all things in the Church were to be done in order and decency and uniformitie which could never have been, if every Paſtour and Presbyter and every particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation under them ſeverally would have governed as pleaſed themſelves, without any reference to the Colledge or common counſell of all the Presbyters, which was the failing of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> here, for which he was greatly blam'd by Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> And that all thoſe Churches were to be governed by their ſeverall Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and that the people were not to intermeddle with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> himſelfe in the third page of his pamphlet and in the eleventh of the ſame doth accord, who citing my words in my introduction to my booke deduceth from them foure concluſions, which I ſhall by and by ſet downe after I have related the grounds of them.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the Doctor comes to proove his four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Propoſitions, he ſaith it will not be amiſſe in generall to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that all the Churches we read of in the new teſtament were ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratically and Presbyterially Governed, and were all Dependent upon the ſeverall Presbyters, and produceth divers places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove the ſame, and two ſheets are ſpent wholly in proving thereof, from the <hi>12 page</hi> to the <hi>29. Theſe words Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out of my book. Now hear his anſwer.</hi> All which <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> ſhould it be granted, onely proves. First, that in every City or Church there was a Presbytery, For they Ordained them Elders in every Church, <hi>Act. 14.</hi> That thou Ordain Elders City by City, <hi>Tit. 1. v. 5.</hi> Secondly, that as there were Apoſtles and Elders in the church of Jeruſalem, ſo there were Elders, <hi>in the church of</hi> Epheſus Acts the <hi>20.</hi> ver. <hi>25.</hi> and in the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and in the church of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Philippy,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, that thoſe ſeverall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were dependent, upon their ſeveral Presbyteries, and they were to obey them who had the rule over them, <hi>Hebr. 13. 7. 17. 24.</hi> Who were their guids, obey your guids. Fourthly, that this Presbyterian church Government God hath appointed as his Ordinance to be continu'd to the end of the World, the which whoſoever reſiſteth, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God. <hi>Theſe are the foure concluſions Maſter</hi> Knolleys <hi>gathereth out of my arguments, but with all adds, ſaying,</hi> that all this doth not prove, that this Presbyterian Church government is dependent upon a ſupreame judicature, to the Decrees of which they muſt ſubmit themſelves and their churches. <hi>This ſaith Mr.</hi> Knollys <hi>doth not follow; but of that in its due place.</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48122:79"/>
from which grant of his, I ſhall now likewiſe deduce theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluſions, which will neceſſarily follow out of his words, and all of them fatall to his own principles, and to the opinion of thoſe of the congregationall way.</p>
               <p>The firſt, that the people are wholly excluded from Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church; for ſaith he, <hi>It is not denyed by the brethren, that the Presbyters in all Churches, were the men in Government of the Churches, in which they were Elders:</hi> So that the people and Church though presbyterated (as they ſpeak) have not the government in their hands, as indeed they have not, as never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the Keyes, nor never having been made ſtewards of the Church, nor joyned in Commiſſion with the Elders, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can never either receive in members, or caſt out offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for all theſe are acts of Government and belong onely to the Rulers of the Church, whom the people are ever to obey in the Lord, as he granteth, and by this he overthrows all that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he affirms, that the Church or Congregation of which <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was an Elder, had power over him; and this is the firſt concluſion, that of neceſſity followeth out of Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his words; but more of this in the ſequell of this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concluſion that follows out of his words is this That the Government was not put into the hands of any one El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with his Congregation, but into the hands of many Elders, that is, into the hands of the whole Presbytery, to wit, the Court or Colledge of Presbyters; ſo that they, and they only, joyntly and together, had the power, both to queſtion, convent and cenſure; for M. <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is not denyed by the brethren, but that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in al churches were the men in the government:</hi> according to that of S. John <hi>If I come, I will remember his deeds which he doth prating againſt us.</hi> So that whoſoever ſhall, <hi>Diotrephes</hi> like, indeavour to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this government, and aſſume it to themſelves from the other Elders and from the Presbyters, or to inveſt the people with it, or joyn them in commiſſion with the Elders, or to arrogate unto themſelves or to their particular congregations, an abſolute juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within themſelves, and an Independency from them; and ſhall go about to diſgrace and prate againſt the Presbyters, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring them into the hatred of the people, and ſhall take this liberty at pleaſure, to caſt out whom they will out of their congregations, or to bring in whom they pleaſe upon their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48122:80"/>
owne tearmes and conditions, and exerciſe an abſolute Lordly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion amongſt themſelves over their congregations and the ſeverall members in them, all ſuch are guilty of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> his ſinne, and offend in like manner, and are equally to be blamed as aſſumers unto themſelvs of that power which only belongeth to the presbytery; now when all the Independents are guilty of this crime, they may juſtly with <hi>Diotrephes</hi> be cenſurd: and this is the ſecond concluſion that neceſſarily followeth from Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> his words.</p>
               <p>The third is this, that there were many congregations in all the primitive churches, and yet made all of them within their ſeverall precincts and juriſdictions but one church; for ſo it was here in the church that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth unto, where there were many Elders as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> confeſſeth, in the which every Elder had his particular congregation as well as <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> for they were no way inferiour to him; ſo that, if he had his particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation they each of them ſeverally had their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions likewiſe, and yet they were all of them to be governed and ruled <hi>communi conſilio presbyterorum,</hi> which kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Diotrephes</hi> oppoſing, or refuſing obedience unto, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting a Supremacy and juriſdiction to himſelfe and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation independent from the presbytery, was juſtly blamed by the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in that he prated againſt the presbyters with malicious words. So that by all that I have now ſaid, theſe three poſitions are clearely manifeſt which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> denyeth, viz: the firſt, <hi>That Diotrephes had a particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>ſecond that he affected an abſolute juriſdicton within himſelfe and to have his congregation independent, and that he was the firſt that oppoſed the presbyterian government; for we never read of any that prated malicious words againſt the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie before.</hi> The third that <hi>the church that</hi> Saint Iohn <hi>writ unto, was governed by the common counſell of the Presbytery at that time, and that</hi> Saint Iohn <hi>did then acknowledge a Court and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon councell of Presbyters</hi> both <hi>Claſſicall and Synodicall to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale unto,</hi> all which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> notwithſtanding doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily deny. But for the fuller elucidation of the truth, I will firſt make all theſe propoſitions good from Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his own words in this his anſwer, and then I will prove thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appeales I made mention of page 10. and after that, evidently evince that the people and congregation in any Church have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48122:80"/>
not power to judge their Miniſters, and that it is a meare babble in M. <hi>Knollys</hi> to ſay, <hi>that if nothing of publicke concernment were to be done without the joynt conſent of the Presbytery, that then</hi> Saint Iohn <hi>the Presbyter would not have tranſgreſſed ſo farre as to take upon him this authority over</hi> Diotrephes, <hi>to tell the Church of his faults &amp;c. all theſe things I will</hi> methodically handle, and then go on to anſwer whatſoever Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> hath to ſay to all my other arguments in their due places.</p>
               <p>And for proofe, that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had a particular congregation, which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith there was no mention of, waving the reaſons above ſpecified, from that nigh relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Paſtor and a flocke, which is ſo much urged by all the Independents, I ſay waving all thoſe reaſons, I will make uſe of Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his owne words, for it may be, he will beleeve himſelfe, and perhaps his Diſciples and followers and thoſe of the congregationall way will give more credit to him, whom they accompt very learned, then to any thing I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of the holy Scripture: and if they will duly conſider and ponder his expreſſion they will then perceive not only his errors, but how palpably he everywhere contradicteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and woundeth their cauſe, and everteth their opinion, whiles he laboureth with all his power to maintaine and defend it.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48122:81"/>
that the presbyters of our times are like <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> in affecting Supremacy over their fellow Presbyters and over the churches; and all this to inrage the people againſt them, when it is they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that would bring all men under their ſlavery, and have an abſolute authority and juriſdiction Independent in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall congregations within themſelves, which was the ſinne of <hi>Diotrephes.</hi> But out of Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his words, it appeareth that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had a particular congregation: For Church and congregation are Synonimaes in his Dialect, which is yet more clearely evident from his words page the 7. which are theſe: <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Apoſtle writs to the Church or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregation, whereof</hi> Diotrephes <hi>was a member and an Elder, who he knew had power to judge him.</hi> Theſe are Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> formall expreſſions; out of all which it doth now evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that there were many Presbyters and many congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that Church Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth unto, and that <hi>Diotrophes</hi> had his particular congregation amongſt them; for ſo Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth in expreſſe termes acknowledge, and in ſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king contradicts himſelfe, and vindicates me from the error he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed me of, who affirmed, <hi>I was much miſtaken in my commentary expoſition and application of that place, ſaying there was no mention made of any particular congregation</hi> Diotrephes <hi>had,</hi> And yet here he aſſerteth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writ to the church or particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, whereof <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a member and an Elder: ſo that he hath done my worke for me once and again, and made himſelfe guiltie of that fault he charged me with page 6 and page 7. By which all men may ſee not only the contentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reſtleſneſſe of the creatures ſpirit, and the folly of the man who contradicteth himſelfe at every hand, but may alſo gather that that Church conſiſted of many congregations, all the which made but one Church within its precinct, and was to be governed by the joynt conſent and common counſell of the Presbyterie; and that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> aſpiring to the primacy amongſt them and ſeeking to ſtand ſingular by himſelfe with his congregation, and to be Independent, and to have no relation or reference to the Presbyters of that Church, became an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender by it, and was therefore ſeverely reproved by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> for his ſo doing, in oppoſing his brethren in taking in and caſting out of what members he pleaſed, by his ſole and abſolute authority;

all which Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> accordeth to: whether therefore this were not to make his congregation Independent, and whether <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi> was not the firſt that oppoſed the Presbyterian government, and affronted a Court and common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>councell of Presbyters (ſeeing we read of none that did theſe things before him) and whether thoſe that now ſeek to eſtabliſh an abſolute juriſdiction in every congregation within themſelves Independent, be not rather like <hi>Diotrephes</hi> than thoſe godly Miniſters that deſire the government in common according to Gods holy word, I leave it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learned to conſider; and whether or no Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> doth not palpably contradict himſelfe in all this his diſcourſe: for he acknowledgeth that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had his particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and oppoſed the Presbyters in it, and that <hi>he did evill in uſurping authority over the church and thoſe brethren he caſt out:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding he ſaid it was more then he knew, or I could prove.

               <p>I conceive that all men that are but of ordinary capacity, when they ſhall well conſider my argument and Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his reply unto it, will ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> aſſumed that power to himſelfe, which belonged to the Colledge and councell of Presbyters; for if he had not bin a tranſgreſſour, and an offender againſt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and the other Presbyters, the Apoſtle would never have ſaid, <hi>Wherefore if I come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will remember his deeds which he doth, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt us with malicious wordes,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that by <hi>us</hi> there, muſt neceſſarily be underſtood, Saint John himſelfe and the other Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; for he includes himſelfe in the number of thoſe that <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes</hi> prated againſt and oppoſed.

that power to himſelfe, that belonged to the Colledge and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Presbyters, and that he was the firſt that oppoſed the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government, and that affronted the common-councell of Presbyters? without ſpeaking of malicious words againſt them, &amp; lording it over the Church and taking in and caſting out of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and ruling after an arbitrary way, and with a ſole power and authority within himſelfe in his congregation, and violating that order of government God had eſtabliſhed in that Church, be not in Mr <hi>Knollys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>I ſhall alſo deſire the reader ſeriouſly to conſider with himſelfe, whether theſe words of Saint <hi>Iohn, Wherfore if I come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will remember his deeds which he doth, prating againſt us with malicious words,</hi> do not neceſſarily inferre, that there was a Court and common-councell of Presbyters in that Church to appeal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time?

                  <hi>but the Apoſtle did not know of any ſuch Court or councell of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to appeal unto.</hi> Thus Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> triflingly cavilleth: As if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Presbyters had been all ignorant of their duty, and as if in writing unto the Church, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did not in that write to the Presbyters in it alſo, as well as Chriſt writing unto the ſeven Churches and in ſending unto them did not alſo write unto the Angels and Presbyters in them, when we learne from all thoſe Epiſtles and from the holy Scripture that the government of all thoſe ſeven churches, as of all the Apoſtolicall churches through the world, lay only on the Presbyters ſhoulders, which Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> alſo aſſenteth unto, ſaying <hi>page</hi> 11. <hi>That it is not denyed by the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the Presbyters in all Churches, were the men in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Churches in which they were Elders.</hi> So that it cannot be denied but in his writting to the Church, he writ unto the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters principally who were the Officers in it and the cheife mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, and knew very well that there was a Court of Presbyters in that Church, who would in convenient time have called <hi>Diotrephes</hi> to an accompt, though Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had never come thither; but he ſignifying that when he came he would remember his deeds, made them retard their proceeding againſt him, for a time, that he being a fellow-Presbyter with them (as <hi>Peter</hi> was, with thoſe Presbyters he writs unto 1 Epiſtle <hi>Pet.</hi> chap. 5.) might have the hearing of the cauſe amongſt the other Presbyters; all which ſufficiently confirmeth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did acknowledge a common councell of presbyters in that Church to appeale unto. And therefore all Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his whibling queſtions are vaine and meerely to delude the people: for what man is there ſo ſtupid or ſo unexperienced in matters of government, or but underſtands the practice of our times in every corporation, or Committee, through the Kingdome, that knowes not if any Alderman of any Corporation, or any Commiſſioner of any Committee ſhould affect a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar domination to himſelfe over his fellow-Aldermen or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, or over the people that were under their charge, whenas they are by their charters and Commiſſions, to governe their ſeveral corporations, Hundreds, Rapes, Ridings or Wapentaks by the common conſent, and joynt counſell and aggreement of them all, ſo that no order made without their combined authority or the joynt conſent of them all, or the major part of them,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48122:83"/>
ſhould be binding and of force, I ſay, who doth not know, that if any of thoſe Aldermen or Commiſſioners contrary unto their Charter or Commiſſion ſhould not onely aſſume unto himſelf a particular power of ruling and ordering things by himſelfe, and of giving Lawes unto others and in bringing in or putting out, either in the Corporation or Committee, whom they pleaſed; and ſhould alſo uſe diſgracefull words againſt their fellow-Aldermen or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, that any either Alderman or Commiſſioner doing any of theſe things, doth not oppoſe the Corporation &amp; Committee with the commiſſioners in them, and by that offend againſt their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and deſerveth thereby ſeverely to be puniſhed? And who doth not likewiſe know, that if either any of the Aldermen or any of the Commiſſioners ſhould underſtand of this their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly carriage, and ſhould informe the Corporation or Committee of it by letters, and ſay, that when he came he would remember his deeds, by theſe his expreſſions doth not acknowledge likewiſe that there is both in the corporation and committee a ſtanding court, in which there was power at all times for the puniſhing and cenſuring of any ſuch offender? I am moſt aſſured that he will ſo conclude that there is a court there, and withall will ſay, that this or that commiſſioners information doth no way impeach or hinder the proceedings of that court, or minoriſe its power, but that it may go on to cenſure ſuch as ſhall offend againſt their authority, if it can be proved by others, though that commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that informed againſt him ſhould not be preſent. And even ſo it was in the Church Saint John writ unto, it had a court, and power within it ſelfe of proceeding againſt <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and would have uſed it againſt him, whether S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had come or no, although we may ſuppoſe that they did not proceed againſt him till Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> came: yea, I ſhall make it good out of Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his words that there was a court in that church. But by this, I ſay, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew very well that there was a court or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Presbyters to appeal unto in his time, in that church, though Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmeth the contrary, peremptorily aſſerting that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew no ſuch Court to appeal to, and that I cannot prove any ſuch appeals. But it is ordinary with M. <hi>Knollys</hi> to confute the holy Scriptures, and to contradict himſelf as he doth both here and in all other of his anſwers, as in their due places we ſhall ſee. For what Chriſtian ever with deliberation did read the Scripture, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48122:83"/>
can beleeve that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> could be ignorant that there was a court and Presbytry in every church, when M. <hi>Knollys</hi> himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it? Without doubt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew the government that was then eſtabliſhed in all churches, as well as Mr <hi>Knollys.</hi> He could not be ignorant what government God had appointed &amp; eſtabliſhed in every church which was a Presbytery (as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from all the places above quoted) which was a Court, to wit, a company of officers in every church armed with power &amp; authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from God himſelf within their ſeverall Presbytries to order, rule and govern the people under them, and to convent any offender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them and to proceed againſt him by cenſure and puniſhment: If the crime layd againſt him were ſufficiently proved, and that the people under them were to yeild obedience unto them in the Lord, ſuch a power was every Presbytery inveſted with through all the Apoſtolicall churches; and this Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath acknowledged in divers places in this his Pamphlet, &amp; in this his very anſwer concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> as we ſhall ſee by and by. And all this S. <hi>Iohn</hi> could not be ignorant of, and that in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in which hee was both a Paſtor and a Member, that the Presbytery ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there, and that all the people made their addreſſes (as well for the good of their ſoules, as for the better rectifying of abuſes) to the Apoſtles and Presbyters of that Church, and appealed alwayes unto them, and never applyed themſelves unto the people or the multitude, as we may ſee in theſe particulars: as,</p>
               <p>Firſt, when they were pricked in their hearts, they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Apoſtles for direction, ſaying, <hi>men and brethren what ſhall we do? Acts</hi> 2. they went not to the church or people, but to the Apoſtles, knowing that the Miniſters were their guides, and that they were to be directed by them, and that they were bound to obey them. And ſo in the fact of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, when they had purloyned the goods of the Church; for whereas it was ordered and agreed upon by common conſent that the price of thoſe poſſeſſions that were ſold ſhould be layd down at the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles feet, and that diſtribution ſhould be made unto every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had need; contrary to this order <hi>Ananias</hi> kept back part of the price, <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife alſo being privy to it: Hereupon the people appeal unto the Apoſtles in whoſe hands the government then lay, and who had power to cenſure and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, as they did for that their delinquency, as it is to be ſeen
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48122:84"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> the 5. they went not to the people and Church, but applyed themſelves to the Presbytery; and of this proceeding Saint <hi>John</hi> was not ignorant.</p>
               <p>Again when the widdowes were neglected in the daily mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, for the taking away of this abuſe, they appealed unto the Apoſtles, as we may ſee in the ſixt of the <hi>Acts</hi> (and not unto the Church or people) who ordered that buſineſſe, and determined the controverſie amongſt them, to which the people aſſented. This alſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was not ignorant of: And he knew very well that the Presbytery in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and all other Churches had power to ſend any of the Apoſtles or their other Miniſters into any other place to preach, or upon any meſſage, as we may ſee it <hi>Acts</hi> the 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Acts</hi> 14, &amp; 15. For the Presbytery of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> to preach amongſt the people there, which they could not have done except the Presbitry had had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority in their hands over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; we ſee alſo the ſame in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they ſent <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and their miniſters to the Presbitry at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp; the Presbitry of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> they likewiſe ſent their decrees by their Miniſters through all Cities and Churches, which they could not have done, had they not had authority over the Miniſters. Again S. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew very well that the power of admitting of members lay not in the peoples hands; for we read <hi>Acts</hi> the 9. When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and aſſayed to joyn himſelf to the Diſciples, and that they being affraid of him, &amp; believing not that he was a Diſciple, St <hi>Paul</hi> appeals from them to the Presbytery of the Apoſtles in whoſe hands the government lay; and declaring unto them how matters were, they admitted him into fellowſhip with them, without the conſent of the people &amp; their good liking, for the government did not belong unto them. All theſe proceedings Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew very well, and therefore could not be ignorant that there was a Court and Councell to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to in all Churches: Yea Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew alſo that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had power and authority over any of the Apoſtles, and did upon any occaſion convent them before them as we may ſee in the 11. chap. and 21. where <hi>Peter</hi> was called before the Presbytery for going in to the Gentiles, and was therefore to give an accompt of his actions there, which he did; all with ſhews there was there a ſtanding Court: and ſo in the 21. chapter the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gave Saint <hi>Paul</hi> an order and direction how to behave himſelf
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48122:84"/>
toward the weak ones; which he followed; all which ſhewes that they only had the power in their hands, and that there was a court there, and that it belonged not to the people; all theſe things, I ſay, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was not ignorant of, &amp; therfore knew very well that in that Church alſo where <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a Presbyter, there was a Court and Common-councell of Presbyters to appeal unto, or elſe he would never have ſaid, <hi>If I come I will remember his deeds.</hi> But why ſhould I ſpend time in proving that which to any underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding man is as evident a nd clear as almoſt any other truth in the holy Scripture? eſpecially when Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath proved it himſelf in formall words in many places in this his anſwer; for he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that there was a Presbytery eſtabliſhed in every Church, and that the government of thoſe Churches was put into the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hands, and that the people were to obey thoſe Presbyters as their guides; and in expreſſe termes page the ſeventh ſaith, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle writes to the Church or particular congregation whereof</hi> Diotrephes <hi>was a Member and an Elder, who he knew had power to judge him, as well as the Church or particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Corinth <hi>had power to judge them that were Members therein,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. 13. <hi>And therefore might as warrantably admoniſh</hi> Diotrephes, <hi>as the Church of</hi> Coloſſe <hi>might</hi> Archippus <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 17. in theſe words, He confeſſeth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew that the Church whereof <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a Member and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had power to judg him; which doth neceſſarily infer that there was at that time a court there; for judgement and cenſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of puniſhment is the act of a court or Magiſtracy and of thoſe that are in authority and armed with power; beſides for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtration of his meaning, he ſaith that the church Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writ unto, had the ſame power over its Members that the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had over its Members: Now all men that have read the firſt and ſecond E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> know very well that there was a court in the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> with plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry authority from Chriſt himſelfe, both to convent and cenſure, and that with the ſevereſt puniſhment thoſe that did publikely ſcandalize the Goſpell, as is evident by the excommunication of the inceſtuous perſon; now if that church that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ unto were equall in power to that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> and to all the other Apoſtolicall churches, as Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> confeſſeth and laboureth to prove; then theſe concluſions will neceſſarily follow
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48122:85"/>
from his argumentations. The firſt, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> could not be ignorant that there was a court and common-councell of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in that church to appeal unto; for Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Saint</hi> John <hi>knew that that Church had power to judge Diotrephes,</hi> and therefore in this contradicteth himſelfe; for in the ſixth page he affirmed that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew not any ſuch court.</p>
               <p>2ly, it follows that there was an Uniformity of government in all the Apoſtolicall and Primitive churches: W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wholy overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the tenent of many of the Independents who hold the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo that one church had not one manner of government, and another church another manner of government peculiar unto it ſelfe, and diſtinct from the other; but they were all governed alike by their ſeverall Presbyteryes, and had equall authority and power within their ſeverall precincts, as the church at <hi>Ieruſalem, Epheſus, Corinth,</hi> in all which there were many congregations, and yet all of them made but each of them a particular church within their reſpective juriſdictions, and were all to be governed by the joynt conſent of there ſeverall Presbytries.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, that this order of government was to be perpetuated to the end of the world, which when Saint <hi>Diotrephes</hi> laboured to violate in aſſuming it to himſelfe and his congregation, both hee and all theſe that follow his ſteps, deſerve ſeverely to be puniſhed for it, as prevaricators againſt both precept and example of all well ordered churches and Chriſtians. And this ſhall ſuffice to have replyed by way of anſwer to what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> had to ſay for proofe that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew not of any Court or Common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Presbyters, either claſſicall or ſynodicall, to appeal unto in his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now I come to make good thoſe appeals I made mention of</hi> page <hi>10. which</hi> Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> thinketh a thing impoſſible for me to do; to wit, That every particular man, as well as any aſſembly or congregation, may have their appeal to the Presbytery of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, Hundred or Diviſion under whoſe juriſdiction they were; and if they finde themſelves wronged there, then they have appeales to ſome other higher Presbytery or Councell of Divines for reliefe and juſtice.</p>
               <p>Theſe appeales Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith I cannot make good to be according to the Scripture of truth, although the having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by appeales, from Inferiors to Superiors and from one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48122:85"/>
Court to another, is ſo evident by the very light of nature, and approved of by the practice of all Nations and Churches in all ages, and is alſo ſo apparent by the holy Scriptures both of the old and new teſtament, as there is ſcarce any truth more obvious to all underſtanding men; yet Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> peremptorily aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that they cannot be made good out of the Scriptures of truth; ſo that it is manifeſt, to all men, that be there any truth never ſo perſpicuous, he is reſolved to beleeve nothing but what he conceiveth to be according to the Scripture of truth.</p>
               <p>Therefore for the gratifying of Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and all ſuch as with candour and ingenuity and without any prejudice ſhall reade the inſuing lines, I ſhall in this place adde ſomething more fully and diſtinctly to that which I ſpake in the foregoing page for the proofe of thoſe appeales I mentioned page 10. and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evince, they are warranted by the Word of truth: and for that purpoſe, I ſhall firſt produce the authority of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and bring forth ſome Preſidents out of the unerring word for the confirmation of the ſame; and then I ſhall alſo ratifie the uſe of appeales by reaſons and from the practice of all ages in all Nations. And all this I ſhall the more willingly do in this place, although it is done againe and againe in this treatiſe; and onely becauſe Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmeth that I cannot make good that appeales be according to the Scripture of truth. And for proofe ofthis, I will begin with that of our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 13 <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if thy brother ſhall treſpaſſe againſt thee, go and tell him of his fault betweene thee and him alone,</hi> &amp;c. But if he heare thee not, appeale higher <hi>to two or three more:</hi> And <hi>if he ſhall neglect to heare them,</hi> appeale yet higher, tell it then <hi>unto the Church,</hi> that is to the Court of Presbyters in that precinct. So that from this place it is evident, that appeales are warranted by the Word of truth; for truth it ſelf, hath taught us the Doctrine of appeals. And for Preſidents of appeales there are many in the New-Teſtament, to ſay nothing of the Old. To begin with that in the 5. of the <hi>Acts</hi> which we finde recorded after Chriſt's aſcenſion in the queſtioning of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> whereas by conjoynt argrement it was appointed and ordered amongſt them, that all things ſhould be common, and that ſelling their poſſeſſions, they ſhould bring
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48122:86"/>
the price of them and lay it alſo at the Apoſtles feet; which very expreſſion ſignifieth and denoteth what great authority and power the Apoſtles and Presbyters in the Church of Jeruſalem were then in, and ſufficiently declares that there was a Court there, as all the carriage of that buſineſſe doth abundantly prove. I ſay therefore, when they had made ſuch an order by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, and when it was found out that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife had not dealt faithfully in that buſineſſe, nor according to publike agreement, but had conſented together to deceive their brethren, and by that had ſcandalized the Goſpel, the Church or people for the redreſſing of this abuſe, take not the matter into their owne hands, nor challenge not any power unto themſelves for the puniſhing of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> as well knowing their place then, and that the government did not belong unto them, but to the Elders and Rulers over them; they appeale therefore unto the Apoſtles and make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint unto them, and exhibit their Articles againſt <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> as both guilty of the ſame crime, whereupon they were convented before the Apoſtles as Delinquents; <hi>Peter</hi> then being there preſident and chiefe judge, and finding them guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſentenced them both, from God himſelfe, and puniſhed them for their ſinne with death; by which we may take notice not onely of an appeale, but that there was a ſtanding Court of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Jeruſalem and that they had in it plenary power from Chriſt for the tryall and puniſhing of all offenders and of caſting them out of the Church, if Scandalous, as well as the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and it ſtands with all reaſon; for Jeruſalem was the mother Church, and therefore was inferior to none of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Churches and to this Court of Presbyters were all appeales ever to be made by the people of that precinct; as this one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance doth ſufficiently declare. And that other preſident in the 6. of the <hi>Acts</hi> where we have a ſecond appeale upon an other publike ſcandall, which was the neglect of their widdowes in the daily Miniſtration where they applyed themſelves unto the Apoſtles; for the particular congregations aſſumed not the authority into their hands of redreſſing the abuſe, nor challenged not any right to the government, but appealed unto the Apoſtles for remedy, who ordered that whole buſineſſe by joynt conſent, to which all the people willingly ſubmitted themſelves as it is at
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48122:86"/>
large to be ſeene in the ſixt Chapter of the <hi>Acts.</hi> The third appeale we finde <hi>Acts</hi> the ninth, where <hi>Paul</hi> aſſaying to joyne himſelf to the Diſciples, and they being afraid of him, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he were a beleever, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> forth with appeals from them to the Apoſtles, who he knew had the authority in their hands, and making knowne his cauſe unto them, they forthwith admitted him into Church-fellow-ſhip with them without the conſent of the people, who indeed had nothing to do, either in the admitting of members of caſting of them out; and therefore they allowed of the appeale of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to teach all men whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fly, to wit the to Presbytery, if they be injured by the people or debard from any Church-priviledge by them, for they only are the ſtewards of the Church and have the Keys of the kingdom of heaven to open and ſhut the doores to whom they ſhall thinke fit, or unworthy; and this is the place of the Presbyters, and not of the people: for they are injoyned to obey their guids and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves in the Lord to what they order and appoint ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God. Here we have three preſidents of appeales in the mother-church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery upon any abuſe, ſo that by the mouth of their witneſſes out of the word of truth this truth of appeales is ſufficiently confirmed; And that the Presbytery at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had plenary power over the very Apoſtles and could call them at any time to an accompt, is manifeſt from the eleventh of the <hi>Acts</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> was convented &amp; queſtionedbefore them and was forced to give an accompt of his going in to the Gentiles and Preaching unto them, which he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elded unto, knowing it was their place to queſtion any; yea the Presbytery in every Church could ſend the very Apoſtles &amp; Miniſters to Preach in any place or city or upon any Meſſage, as we ſee they ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with other Miniſters to the Presbytery of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as is evident <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. and <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and therefore all theſe examples ſufficiently prove that all the people of every Church made their appeales to their ſeverall Presbyteries, if there aroſe any controverſies and abuſes among themſelves: and if there aroſe any difference between Church, and Church, or betweene Presbytery and Presbyterie about any points of Doctrine or Religion, then they made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales for the determining of thoſe controverſies to Councells
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48122:87"/>
and Synods, as we may ſee it <hi>Acts</hi> the 15. and this is one of Gods Ordinances as the Independents themſelves doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So that for the Doctrine of appeales it is ſo cleare that all the learned and judicious cannot doubt of it; and I am moſt aſſured that thoſe that ſhall but with due deliberation ſeriouſly examine the Scriptures above quoted and thoſe that follow in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, for the confirmation of the ſame truth, will wonder that any man that pretends to learning as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth, ſhould ever dare ſay, that appeales cannot be made good to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture of truth, whereas there is almoſt no truth in the holy Scripture more cleare and evident than this of appeales.</p>
               <p>Yea this method of dealing and manner of handling of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of publike offences and ſcandals, and for the redreſſing of them, is ratified by the very light and Law of nature, as we may reade in all the governments under the very Heathens, and <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of it, by appealing from inferiour Courts to <hi>Caeſars</hi> tribunall. And I ſhall never be brought by all the arte and wit of man to beleeve, that Chriſt hath left his Church under the New Teſtament in a worſe condition then it was under the old, where we know they had appeales from one Court to another. Nay if Chriſtians now, had not the liberty of appeales in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Religion, they ſhould be inferior to the Pagan na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ſurely Chriſt hath not left his Church which is his Kingdom, in a worſe condition then either the Iewiſh or Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke Kingdomes were, and therefore by all reaſon beſides the Teſtimony of Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> the 13. and beſides the Preſidents I produced out of the Word of God to confirme appeales, the lawfulneſſe of appeales is ſufficiently eſtabliſhed and ratified. So that I hope that which I have now briefly ſet downe, may ſatisfie any rationall man. But before I go on to prove that the people or Church have not power to judge their Miniſters, which is the laſt thing I undertake to make good. I muſt ſay ſomething by way of anſwer to a vaine and frivolous cavill of Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> which is this. <hi>If the Doctor can prove theſe appeales,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I aske him whether that higher Presbytery or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Divines, be not as Independent as the brethren and their Churches againſt whom the Doctor hath written: and if ſo, then ſuch a high Presbytery or Councell of Divines, is not Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by the Doctors own confeſſion and affirmation.</hi> The very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48122:87"/>
reading of this fond cavill had been enough for the confutation of it to any ſolid man: and truly had not I to deale with ſuch a trifling creature as he is in ſerious buſineſſe, who compts every word he ſcribleth an oracle, I would have paſſed by it with ſilence, as being nothing to the queſtion between us, and as little to his purpoſe as all his other wrangling is, except it be to declare to all men, that he knoweth not his owne principles nor no good learning. But for anſwer, all ſuch as know any thing in the controverſie betweene us and the Independents, know that it is my opinion and ſettled beleefe, that all Churches and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels are to depend upon the Word of God, and to be ruled and ordered in all their proceedings and Governments according to the direction of the ſame: an Angel from Heaven is not be heard that ſpeaks not according to the written Word <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and this Word hath directed us to the law and to the teſtimony, <hi>Iſay</hi> 8. and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all men that ſpeak not according to that, to be in darkneſſe; and therefore according to this my opinion, no Church or Councell in the world is Independent; and therfore all ſuch Churches and Councels as have not either precept or example for their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the ordering and governing of them, out of the Word of God, but follow their own vaine and idle phantaſies and affect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, in my opinion they in ſo ordering their Churches do not according to Gods Ordinances. Now when the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Governments are ſuch, they are their own inventions; and that government only of the Presbyters, is Gods Ordinance, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both precept and Preſidents for it in Gods Word, upon which they depend; and this is my opinion, and not that which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> would grolliſhly put upon me; and this ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for anſwer to that peece of non-ſenſe of his. And now I come to the laſt branch of his anſwer, and that which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to make Good and prove, viz. <hi>that the people and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in any Church have not power to judge their Miniſters,</hi> which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmeth they have, and for inſtance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and that of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> underſtanding by Church the people, who he ſaith had power over the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, miſerably miſtaking himſelf and abuſing the ignorant and ſimple ſoules by it, as will by and by appeare to thoſe that can diſcerne things that differ or are but a little acquainted in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of government, either Eccleſiaſticall or civill. For if men
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48122:88"/>
do once but rightly underſtand what a Church is according to the diſcription of a Church as it is laid down in the New-Teſtament, and conſider withall of the parts and members of that Church which by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is compared to the body of a man: they will eaſily perceive, that the governors and rulers are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the head and all the noble parts of the body, as to the eyes, eares hands &amp;c. which are to guide and governe all the other members in the body, and that all the other members under them are to be ordered and ruled by the head and other more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, and are to follow their direction; ſo that it is in the Church of God, as it is in the body of man, ſome are to rule, and others to be ruled in it and whoſe place it is ever to obey: For none of the members of the body leave their ſtations, unleſſe they by violence be cut off, as all rationall creatures do very well know. For the head is ever the head, the eye is ever the eye, the eare is ever the eare, and the hand is ever the hand, &amp;c. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Now yee are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular. And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps in Government, diverſities of tongues; are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> &amp;c intimating that the Apoſtles, and Prophets and Teachers, and helps in Government in the Church, every of them keepes their ſtations, to wit, they that are once Apoſtles, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or Governors, doe continue in the Church in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places, ever ſo to be, and never loſe their places, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the day of their death, remaine and continue ſtill to be Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers and Rulers, according to that in the fourth of the <hi>Epheſians verſ.</hi> 11. Where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts and ſome Paſtors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the worke of the Miniſtry and the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we come all into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the ſonne of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> We finde not in all the holy Scripture that any of thoſe true Miniſters were at any time degraded, or loſt any thing either of their Titles or of their authority, but as God had put the rule and Government of the Church into their hands, and had given them the power of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48122:88"/>
Keyes, and made them Stewards in the Church which is his body, ſo they were ever to be the head, eyes, eares and hands for the governing and well ordering of the Church. We finde likewiſe that in every ſeverall Church of the New-Teſtament there was a Presbytery ordayned, as <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. &amp;c. and that the Presbyters had the Government of thoſe ſeverall Churches put into their hands, that the people and members of thoſe Churches were commanded to obey their Presbyters as their guides whom God had ſet over them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and all the learnedſt of the Independents do acknowledge. We finde likewiſe by the practiſe of the Church of Jeruſalem the Preſident of all other Churches, that the people there for the redreſſing of any abuſe amongſt themſelves, aſſumed not the power into their own hands, but applied themſelves and made their addreſſes and appeales to the Presbytery, and that they ordered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing according as they thought good, and that the people wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmitted themſelves to the order. We finde further that for all acts of government, as queſtioning any offendo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s for the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring and puniſhing of them, for ordination of Officers, and excommunication, it was done either by the ſole power and authority of the Apoſtles, or by the Presbyteries of the Church and thoſe that were in office, and not by the multitude, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by that in the 2. of the <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 2. ver. 6. a place ſo much abuſed by the Independents; <hi>ſufficient</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to ſuch a man is the cenſure which was inflicted of many.</hi> So that it was not inflicted by all the people, but by ſuch only in whoſe hands the power lay, which was the Presbytery, and therfore the Apoſtle ſaith by many or of many. And truly if we would but duly reade the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> which were writ to them, and in them to all the Miniſters of the New-teſtament in all ages to come, and obſerve the rules ſet downe in them, which are to continue to the ende of the World, we ſhall finde that for all Acts of government and for the well ordering of the Church, it is only committed into the hands of the Miniſters and presbyters of the ſeverall Churches through all Nations, and that to them only belonged the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Goverment, as the rulers and Stewards of the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that all power and authority of Government peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto them, and that the people had nothing to do with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48122:89"/>
it but to obey. Again if we look but into the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> Revel. 2. &amp; 2. We ſhall finde that all the Epiſtles Chriſt writes unto them are directed to the Angels and Miniſters of thoſe ſeverall Churches, as upon whom the Government of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches lay, and who had both the praiſe of well doing and blame of any evill either committed or tolerated by them; for ſeeing they were appointed by Chriſt himſelfe to be the Stewards and Guides of thoſe Churches and to be the Governours of the ſame, all the blame of the malverſation of any of the members in them, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto them, as if they themſelves had been the cauſe of it, as not uſing their Authority for the redreſſing of thoſe abuſes. So that it is apparently evident through the whole New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That the Miniſters and Presbyters, and they onely, in every Church had the rule of the people committed unto them, as the head, eyes, ears, and hands, the more noble members; and that the people as the other members under them, were to yeeld obedience unto them in the Lord. And we find that in the holy Scripture, every man is to look unto that Office that is committed unto him, and that every one is to keep himſelfe in that Station God hath placed him in, as we may ſee it at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Having gifts differing according to the grace given unto us, ſaith Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prophecy, let us prophecy according to the proportion of faith, or miniſtry, let us waite on our miniſtry &amp;c. He that ruleth, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> &amp;c. Here we finde that every man according to his place and office, he is injoyned to wait upon it and not to deſert it; they that are appointed to rule, they are ever to rule; and the others that are under them, are ever to obey; every Member is to keep his ſtation in this myſticall body; the Magiſtrates and Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters whether eccleſiaſticall or civill, are to continue in their ſeverall places and to keep their ranks as long as they are in thoſe places; and all thoſe that are under them, whether Subjects, children, or ſervants, they are likewiſe to keepe their places, and to obey all thoſe that are over them in the Lord; and that is their place; for ſo the holy Scripture everywhere teacheth us, and eſpecially in the 7. of the 1 of the <hi>Corinth. ver.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandements of God;</hi> That is, the yeelding of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the commandments of God, and the obeying of thoſe God hath ſet over us, and the honouring of thoſe that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48122:89"/>
and doing the will of God in every thing to our power, is that that commends any men unto God, eſpecially the honouring of God himſelfe and the reverencing of our godly Miniſters and painfull Paſtors, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Know them which are over you in the Lord, and eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake:</hi> For God hath made them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and all the people their flock; them fathers, and the people children begotten by their Miniſtry; them builders, and the people the ſtones layd by them in the building; them Stewards, and the people Domeſtiques under them and their conduct: So that every one in the Church of God is to continue in that Station God hath placed them in, untill they by their gifts and graces and eminent abilities be removed to a higher calling, or elſe for their miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours are caſt out; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. ver. 20. <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling wherein he was called; and as if it had not bin ſufficient to have once ſpecified his mind in this buſineſſe, in the</hi> 24 verſe, <hi>he reiterateth this precept ſaying, Brethren, let every man wherein he is called therein abide with</hi> God. So that for the Miniſters and Presbyters of the Church, or for the Magiſtrates of the Common-wealth, or for Maſters or Parents of Families, for either of them, I ſay, to leave their calling in their particular places of ruling: and for either the flocks under the Paſtors, or ſubjects under the Magiſtrates, or ſervants and children in the ſeverall Families under their Parents and Maſters, to offer to take the Government into their own hands, or to joyne themſelves in Commiſſion with them, and to take the rule in either Church, State, or Families upon them, is to leave their callings, and ſo to tranſgreſſe againſt the commandements of God who, hath injoyned the Magiſtrates, Miniſters and Paſtors both in Church and State to command, and all the people under them to obey, and in their ſo doing they each of them abide in the ſame cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſtation wherein they are called: otherwiſe, <hi>they will be found tranſgreſſours of the Laws of God and Violaters of that Order God hath appoynted in Church and State,</hi> and bring confuſion in both; Now, <hi>God is the God of Order, and hath injoyned all men to keep his commandements,</hi> and the commandement given to the Magiſtrates, is <hi>to rule;</hi> and the commandement given to the people in every Church is <hi>to obey their guides and yeeld double honour unto them;</hi> the honour of <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>ſubjection,</hi> and the honour of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48122:90"/>
                  <hi>maintenance;</hi> they are ever bound <hi>to obey them in the Lord:</hi> And this is the Order God appointed in all the Primitive Churches, <hi>That the Presbyters only ſhould rule in them, and that the people ſhould obey and not intermeddle in the government; for that is not to keep themſelves in their ſeverall Stations, and to abide in the ſame calling wherein they were called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to ſpeake the truth, the ignorance of this doctrine and the pride of too too many hath bin the onely cauſe of all thoſe confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that now the Church and State are imbroyled with; for if every man had learned but this leſſon, <hi>To keep himſelfe in the ſame calling wherein he was called,</hi> he would know that the Magiſtrates place whether civill or ecclerſiaſticall, is <hi>to command,</hi> and that the ſubjects and peoples place under them in their ſeverall aboads and habitations, is <hi>to obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They would underſtand likewiſe, that in every kingdome, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwelth, corporation, or in any Province and Country or church, that howſoever buſineſſe of publike concernment belongs unto the whole body in each of thoſe governments, yet the managing of them and ruling and ordering of them reſpectively, belongeth and pertaineth onely to thoſe in authority, as in a kingdome or Republique, howſoever the embaſladours of other nations are ſent into ſuch a Kingdome and Common-wealth about buſineſſe that may concern the whole Countrie, yet none but the King and his Councell or the State have the ordering and managing of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the people and ſubjects under them intermeddle not in thoſe high affairs, for they are <hi>Arcana Regni</hi> and appertain not unto them. And ſo it is in every Corporation, howſoever the Letters or Mandates from either King, Parliament or State, are directed unto the ſeverall Counties, Hundreds or Corporations or Cities, yet the Lieutenants, Governors, Sherifes, Mayors, Aldermen and Common-councells in each of them are to mannage the buſineſſe and to put in execution what they are commanded and injoyned by either Letters or Mandates, and the people under them ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are to yeeld obedience to what they order and command accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeverall exigences of the times, as daily experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all men; ſo that the directing of their Letters to the ſeverall Counties or Hundreds or Corporations in generall, doth not inveſt all the people with power or joyne them in commiſſion with the Magiſtrates of thoſe reſpective places, but leaveth the tranſacting
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48122:90"/>
of all things to thoſe onely in thoſe ſeverall juriſdictions that are in authority and armed with power, which the people are not. Yea this truth is ſo well known and perceived by all ſuch as will not wilfully blinde themſelves, as it cannot be denyed; hourly experience furniſhing men with Preſidents of it.</p>
               <p>For if any Delinquents be found out, they are not hailed before the people, but before ſuch as are in authority; there is not an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Hew and Cry that is ſent to any Pariſh, but it is carryed to the Conſtable or his Deputy and to ſuch in that Town or Village as are in place or authority, ſo that the people trouble not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it; yea they will ordinarily ſay it concerneth them not, it is not their place to intermeddle in the buſineſſe of State, that they affirme belonges to thoſe that are in authority. And as it is in the affaires ſecular and in the State, ſo it is in the affaires of the Church, thoſe in authority in the Church are to mannage the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and buſineſſes of the Church and not the people: for God had appointed in all Churches in the New Teſtament (which were but ſo many Corporations) a ſtanding Presbytery, and Order of Miniſters and Rulers in each of them, in whoſe hands the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them all, within their ſeverall Precincts and Juriſdictions lay, the which Government they were ever to mannage and order by common conſent and joynt agreement, with which the people had nothing to do, and with the which they ought not intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; for that had been to confound that Order God had eſtabliſhed in each Church; and this all well-inſtructed Chriſtians knew; and therefore in the Apoſtles times, not any that I ever read of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Government before <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> who is blamed for this his temerity by St. <hi>John, to teach all men not to do the like left they fall into the ſame condemnation;</hi> ſo that they knew very well that howſoever all the <hi>Epiſtles of Sant Paul and the other Apoſtles</hi> were directed to the ſeverall <hi>Churches</hi> of their times, yet the managing of the affairs of thoſe Churches belonged only unto the Presbyters Stewards and Angels of thoſe reſpective Churches, as we may ſee in thoſe <hi>ſeven Churches of Aſia,</hi> where the <hi>Letters</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> are directed <hi>to the Angels and Miniſters of thoſe Churches</hi> as thoſe that had the Government of them in their hands, and not to the people: And ſo it was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> a place that the Independents ſo much abuſe.</p>
               <p>Howſoever <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles were directed to the whole

Church, yet the officers only and Presbyters of that Church had the managing of the whole buſineſſe concerning the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous perſon, both for the caſting of him out and the taking of him in againe, upon his repentance, as is evident from the 2 Epiſtle and the ſecond chapter where the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>ſufficient to ſuch a man is the puniſhment inflicted of many.</hi> So that all the people did not cenſure him, or inflict that puniſhment upon him; but many, to wit the Presbyters and thoſe in authority in that Church. And this agreeable to all reaſon: and therefore Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> is mightily miſtaken in his Commentary expoſition of this place and that of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in ſaying <hi>that as the Church or particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Corinth <hi>had power to judge them that were members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. 13. <hi>and as the Church of</hi> Coloſſe <hi>had power to admoniſh Archippus.</hi> Coloſſ. 4. 17. <hi>ſo the Church whereof</hi> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes <hi>was a member, might as warrantably admoniſh</hi> him. Theſe are his words, in which there is a double yea a treble fallacy: for firſt he taketh the word Church in another ſenſe then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh of it; which in all the Epiſtles of the holy Apoſtles for the moſt part, is taken collectively for a combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many congregations under one Presbyterie within ſuch a precinct, and he onely underſtandeth it for a particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and aſſembly, and by this he deceiveth the reader. 2ly By Church he underſtandeth the people, the Presbyters excluded, and ſaith that they had power to judge their Miniſters, whereas indeed though in all thoſe churches there was a power, yet it lay ſoely in the Presbyters hands, and they only were inveſted with it, and the people were ever to ſtand to their orders, ſo long as they commanded in the Lord; and the place of the people was to obey; and therefore all that he ſaith about this buſineſſe is a meere <hi>non ſequitur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the power of reproofe and cenſure with authority belongs primarily and principally to the Paſtors and Presbyters, in every Church, as the <hi>Epiſtles of</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>ſhew,</hi> in the which all Miniſters are taught their duty in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places, who to <hi>admoniſh, and how, who to ordaine, and who to caſt out,</hi> and how to exerciſe all other Acts of government, <hi>as thoſe of ordination, excommunication and cenſure</hi> &amp;c. and all Miniſters are to performe their offices judicially, &amp; authoritatively, not by way of charity which any Chriſtian upon juſt occaſion obſerving all the vitall circumſtances, of a well ordered reproofe and action, as of time place and perſons may do; for there is a very great difference between the admonition of the Miniſters and that of the people which lyeth in this, <hi>that the Miniſters doe what they doe in the Church as Officers and Magiſtrates and men in place and power;</hi> and the people <hi>do it by way of charity and love and only out of Chriſtian duty, and not with any authority they have over the people; and if their brethren will not heare them,</hi> they can goe no farther <hi>then to take one or two more with them, and if they will not heare them, then to refer it unto the Church,</hi> to tell and informe their ſeverall Presbyteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

not. Neither with any good reaſon will it follow, if any private Chriſtian may admoniſh a Miniſter failing in his duty, that he hath power and authority over him, for this one Member and Brother hath not over another, <hi>as having nothing to do with another mans ſervant,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſufficiently declareth in the fourteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>Epiſtle to the Romans;</hi> and although all Chriſtians are commanded, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> the 3. and in divers other places, <hi>to admoniſh one another,</hi> yet this proves not that they have rule, power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, becauſe the Scripture witneſſeth the contrary. But the Miniſters and Preachers of the Word, they are <hi>to rebuke, to exhort,</hi> and <hi>admoniſh,</hi> and <hi>cenſure,</hi> as Embaſſadours, Stewards, and Governours appointed by God himſelfe over them for this very purpoſe and end, not onely to beſeech and intreate them, but if they be refractory and diſorderly to puniſh and cenſure them, and that by their place as they are officers and as they have received the Keyes, whereas other Chriſtians do their duty onely out of love as Brethren and not as Magiſtrates; So that what the people do, either in <hi>admoniſhing</hi> or <hi>exhorting</hi> it is out of charity; or what they do in chooſing of officers, or caſting out of offenders out of the Church, it is either by denomination of them, or in approving and aſſenting unto what the Presbytery doth; as the Saints ſhall judge the earth ſo that it is not in the peoples power to hinder the caſting out of any offender, if he be proved ſcandalous; or of receiving any into the Church or into any office of the ſame, if they be thought fit and worthy of it for their gifts and graces; for they have no power to do any of theſe things, for theſe are all actions of ſuch as are in authority and have the power of ordering things in their hands, which I affirme was never given to the people.</p>
               <p>And therefore thoſe places quoted by Mr <hi>Knollys, to prove the authority of the people over either their Miniſters or Fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> are not for his purpoſe, as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt;</hi> That all ſuch as affect an abſolute juriſdiction in every particular congregation within it ſelfe Independent, without any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48122:93"/>
reference or relation to a Councell or Colledge of Presbyters, and do speak malicious wordes againſt their Fellow-miniſters and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and do caſt out whom they pleaſe, and bring in whom they will at pleaſure upon their own termes, and do rule after an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way all ſuch violate the Ordinance of God and oppoſe that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that he hath eſtabliſhed in all churches by his bleſſed word, and are guilty of the ſame crime that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was, and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not will be ſeverely puniſhed for it: but all the Brethren of the Congregationall way are ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond is this:</hi> That all ſuch Miniſters and Congregations as give the authority and power of ruling and ordering the affaires of the Church into the hands of the people, either wholly excluding the Miniſters, or joyning the people with them in the Government of the Church, they thus leaving their ſtation and calling wherein they were called, are prevaricators and offenders againſt divine inſtitution: For God hath given the keyes, the power of order and juriſdiction to the Miniſters and Presbyters only, and injoyned the people to obey them: But ſuch are all the Miniſters and Aſſemblies of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall way, as leaving their ſtation and calling wherein they were called: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are all prevaricators and offenders againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>And thus much I thought fit by way of anſwer, to reply unto all that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> had to ſay, againſt my argument drawn from <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and in defence of their congregationall practices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There yet remaines one whibling cavill more in this his anſwer, that I may not paſſe by leſt he ſhould glory I could not anſwer it; I will therefore ſay ſomething to that and conclude this point and then go on to all his other fond anſwers to ſuch arguments as he thought himſelfe beſt able to incounter with. His words are theſe in the concluſion of his Babble.</p>
               <p>If <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> nothing of publike concernment ought to be done and tranſacted without the joynt &amp; mutual agreement, and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Presbytery, <hi>John</hi> the Presbyter would not have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed ſo farr, as to take upon himſelfe this authority over <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi> to tell the Church of his faults, and to ſay he would remember him and ſharply reprove him, and teach him to prate againſt the Presbytery with malicious words, which belonged to the Court and Common-councell of Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> rather chatters than diſputes, in making ſuch
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48122:93"/>
an inference from his own conceit. And therefore for Anſwer let Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> know, that there was no tranſgreſſion in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> againſt the Presbyters in taking ſuch authority upon himſelfe: for S. <hi>John</hi> was an Apoſtle, and an univerſall Paſtor, tyed to no one place or flock, but had the ſame power and authority that <hi>Paul</hi> and all the other Apoſtles had over all the Churches, the care of which lay primarily and principally upon them, who were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inſpired by God, and in all their preachings and writings followed the dictates of his holy Spirit, who ſpake in and by them; ſo that whatſoever they taught or writ was to be the rule of all mens thoughts, words, actions, and governments, and it was their place to give Laws unto all Churches and Miniſters in them, what they ſhould do in the ordering and governing of the ſame; and therefore S. <hi>John</hi> had no leſſe authority and power over this Church, wherein <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was an Elder, and in and over all other Churches, then S. <hi>Paul</hi> and all the other Apoſtles had in all Churches: Now if S. <hi>Paul,</hi> could give a Law unto the Church of <hi>Corinth, For the caſting out of the Inceſtuous perſon, and for the carrying of themſelves with Order and Decency, in their Aſſemblies and ſharply reproove offenders in that Church,</hi> and if all the other Apoſtles did the like, and took ſuch Authority upon them over all the members of thoſe ſeverall Churches; and that without any tranſgreſſion of any divine inſtitution, but with the very good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and allowance of God himſelfe, who writ the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord to all the Churches, then I ſay, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed not at all in uſing his authority and power given him of God over <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> in telling the Church of his faults, and ſaying <hi>He would remember him, and ſharply reprove him;</hi> for this he might well do by his ſole Authority, without any offence, as he was an Apoſtle, for what he did, he did by immediate Revelation and had a warrant for it from Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>who ſent his ſpirit to lead him into all truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is a ridiculous if not an impious thing in Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> to draw ſuch an inference from a phantaſie of his own brain, in that he makes no difference between Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary Presbyter and Miniſter, and would make that an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which was none, and infer that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> took more upon him than he ought. Beſides it had been no tranſgreſſion in any other Presbyter, if he had writ ſo to any Presbytery, under which he had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48122:94"/>
been a fellow Presbyter, to inform them of any miſcarriage in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſtor or member of that Church wherein he was an Elder, and if he had ſaid, <hi>If I come I will remember his deeds,</hi> &amp;c. For in his ſo ſpeaking, he would aſſume no more authority to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then became a Presbyter to take upon him, as both to witneſſe to a truth, and to give in evidence of what he knew of ſuch a man to his fellow judges, and then to leave it to the judgement of the Presbytery and Common Councell of Elders, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did, whoſe place it was to cenſure ſuch an offender, and in his ſo doing he ſhould no way impeach the power and authority of the Court or Common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>councell of Presbyters, but rather ratifie and confirme it as all learned men will gather; For by ſuch words, he declareth that there is a ſtanding Court or Councell there, where offenders are both to be queſtioned and cenſured; for ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>If I come I will remember his deeds,</hi> ſufficiently declareth, that there was power in their hands, and manifeſteth, <hi>that he was a judge there among the reſt, who with others had the hearing of all cauſes there, and that all buſineſſes of publike concernment ought to be done and tranſacted by the mutuall and joynt accord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Presbytery, and not to be managed by any one ſingly by himſelf, or by the people whom God had never given the Keyes unto, nor the power of rule and Government:</hi> This I affirme will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily enſue and follow, and not that which Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> vainly intimateth. And I am confident that any judicious Chriſtian up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due deliberation will ſay the ſame, and will conclude, <hi>That</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>his ſo writing was no offender, though all things of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like concernment in the Church were ever to be tranſacted by the joynt agreement and common conſent of the Presbytery.</hi> So that all men that are judicious may plainly behold the futility in both the anſwers and cavills of this man, and well perceive that he was never cut out for a diſputant, or ever fitted for Government in church or State; who if he might have his own minde would bring in a confuſion in both, and violate all order divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and make the head the foot, and the foot the head.</p>
               <p>And truly if a man would but conſider the manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their <hi>ſeven new Churches or rather ſeventy</hi> (for every ten or twelve of them prove a Church) he ſhould find in them all, ſo much diſorder and diſcrepancy amongſt them, and yet every one of them pretending Divine authority for its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

               <p>But in the meane time it is ſufficiently confirmed out of the Word God and out of all the Scriptures above quoted, that all the churches we reade of in the New-Teſtament, were ſo many corporations in Chriſts kingdome, which were to be governed by a Common-councell of Presbyteries. And ſo for many yeeres after the Apoſtles times they were Governed <hi>Communi conſilio presbyterorum,</hi> as our brethren the Independents do confeſſe and prove by antiquity and humane authority; which weapon I wonder they will contend with, in deciding of Gods matters,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48122:95"/>
which are only out of his holy Word to be proved, which is to be the rule of our faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it ſeemes Saint</hi> Ambroſe <hi>his authority pleaſeth them well, though if we looke into it, it makes much againſt them. He lived as the author that cites him, ſaith, within the fourth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. His words are theſe upon the 1. of</hi> Timothy. Synagoga &amp; poſtea eccleſia ſeniores habuit, quorum ſine conſilio nihil ageba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Eccleſia. Quod qua negligentia obſoleverit neſcio, niſi doctorum deſidia aut magis ſuperbia, dum ſoli volunt aliquid videri. <hi>Take with it his own interpretation.</hi> The Iewes Synagogue <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> and afterwards the Chriſtian church, had Elders, without whoſe counſell nothing was done in the church, which, by what neglect it grew out of uſe, I knew not, unleſſe it were perhaps the ſloth or rather pride of the teachers, whileſt alone they would ſeeme to be ſome body. <hi>However it is acknowledged by their owne teſtimony, that in the Apoſtles time and many yeares after the Apoſtles, nothing was done in the church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Councell of the Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that it is evident the Primitive churches were governed by the joynt and common councell of the Presbytery, and the people had nothing to do with it.

one Prelate, but by the Presbytery and their councell. And if hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine authority were needfull in this buſineſſe, I might make a volume with their very expreſſions, to prove the novelty of the Hierarchicall government, and that of the peoples juriſdiction aſſuming the Authority of governing into their hands, and the Antiquity of the Presbytery, and that by the enemies own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Bet I am reſolved to cleave only unto the Word, and ſound reaſon deduced from thence, for the deciding of this controverſie, being ſorry that there was ſo much as occaſion of naming humane authority in a point of Divinity.</p>
               <p>As for the Presbyterian government, in the ſenſe that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, there is nothing more cleere to me in all the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Yea the very word and name of a Presbytery ſignifieth <hi>a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, or Ariſtocracy, or Signory, or Court;</hi> that is, <hi>a Company, or Senate, or Councell of grave wiſe, and underſtanding men,</hi> inveſted <hi>with authority and power of ruling, ordering, and commanding, and in whoſe hands the government is put.</hi> And as the word is taken in the civill polity and Government, ſo in the Eccleſiaſticall; By a Presbytery we underſtand, <hi>a Religious, Grave, Solid, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and wiſe councell of Divines and Miniſters, or men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate experience; and ſuch as know how to Rule and Govern thoſe that are under their command, with wiſdome and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and according to the Word of God; and the which men likewiſe are inveſted with Authority and Power for to exerciſe a juriſdiction over others, and are hereunto called by ſuch as are able to judge and diſcerne of the ſufficiency of their gifts and abilities for this worke, which the ordinary and common people cannot do.</hi> And as in the civill State, the Presbyters and Elders of the people, were thoſe <hi>that had the rule over them for the common good of them all and for their bodily preſervation;</hi> So the Presbyters and Elders in the Church are thoſe <hi>that have the rule and government over the Churches for the ſpirituall good of their ſouls.</hi> And as Kings and Rulers are by a Metaphoricall and borrowed ſpeech called Paſtors and Sheepherds of the people, and are ſaid to feed the flocks committed to their charge, by which word is underſtoode the exerciſe of all lawfull and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate authority agreeable to the Law of God over them; ſo the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> are called the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Sheepherds, yea,</hi> and <hi>Stewards</hi> over the flocks committed to their charges,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48122:96"/>
and they are commanded to feed them; by which metaphor they are inveſted with the authority and power both of preaching and ruling, and have the Government over thoſe flocks put into their hands, which they muſt alwayes exerciſe according to Gods Word; they muſt feed them and rule them in the Lord, and not after their own wills and pleaſures, they may not <hi>have dominion over our faith,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 2. of the <hi>Corinthians; chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>But that they ſhould be helpers of our joy;</hi> that is, they may not uſurpe an abſolute Soveraignty or power over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the people, as if the ſpirituall ſtate and welfare of their flocks depended on them, which is onely grounded upon their faith in Jeſus Chriſt; but as they are the Stewards of God, and Miniſters and ſervants of the Church, ſo they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them and rejoyce their hearts in the Lord, and eſtabliſh them in the faith; and uſe all the care and diligence that is poſſible, like <hi>good Shepheards,</hi> to preſerve the flockes committed to their charge, that they ſtraggle and ſtray not from Chriſts fold, and run not into the by-wayes and thickets of ſinne and errour, and be corrupted with noyſome food, and falſe Doctrine: And if they have any among them that are unruly, that they bring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into order: or if they have any ſicke, feeble, poor or weak, that they cure, releeve, comfort, and reſtore ſuch: and if they have any that are infected or ſcabby, that they remove ſuch from the ſound, till they be recovered: or if they have any broken or wounded, that they heal and recover them with all lenity and humanity; and that they ſhould by common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>councell govern and order their flocks, and take ſpeciall care that the particular Paſtors and Miniſters of the ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Presbytery and charge, aſſume not any ſole and ſoveraign Authority to themſelves over the flock, to do any thing of publike concernment, <hi>without the joynt conſent of that Preſbytery or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Corporation, under whoſe commands they are.</hi> And it ſtands with all reaſon, that a Common councell, of godly, grave, learned, and experienced miniſters, ſhould ever be more able to manage and order a government, then two or three unexperienced men, or two or three hundred young people, of which moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations conſiſt, in whom the ſap of youth is not yet dryed up; or if many of them ſhould be of riper years, yet they know little what belongs to government, and therefore they can never be ſo

well able to govern, as men both of known learning, ancient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and honeſty, and approved judgement and integrity, as <hi>a whole Colledge or an Aſſembly of learned Preſbyters commonly are; who by God himſelf have the diſpenſation of the Word and the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ruling of the Church committed unto them, and who in the Preaching of the Word, and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and in all ordinary acts of worſhip, and in governing and ruling the flocks committed to their ſeverall charges, are the ſucceſſors of the holy Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by the way, an objection is here to be anſwered unto, made by ſome of the Independents after this manner.</p>
               <p>The Elders and Presbyters of the Apoſtles times, <hi>ſay they,</hi> by the impoſition of their hands, gave the gift of tongues and propheſie, <hi>Acts 19. 1, 2, 3, 4 5.</hi> and the <hi>8. 18</hi> and <hi>1 Tim. 4. 14.</hi> and healed the ſick <hi>Iames 5. 14, 15.</hi> according to our Saviours promiſe <hi>Mark. 16. 18.</hi> Let, <hi>ſay they,</hi> the Presbyters of our time, let them impoſe their hands upon the ſick and heale them, let them by impoſing hands upon their diſciples inable them on a ſudden to ſpeake with ſtrange tongues, and foretell things to come; and then we will acknowledge them for a true Presbytery, then will they be a right aſſembly of Elders, and the Apoſtles ſucceſſors; but, if they cannot give to others, nor yet have for themſelves in ſtore, any of the true Apoſtles, any of the right Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters gifts and characters, we may not, we dare not acknowledge them as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Theſe are their formall words in print. Before I come to my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I deſire there may be ſpeciall notice taken of this Objection, and ſuch like; for, for ought that I know, if any man will argue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this manner, all Chriſtian religion may be called in queſtion, and no man will have any Creed or Belief, except he may make his own Articles, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, who ſaid, <hi>Vnleſſe I put my hands into his ſide and my fingers into the print of the nailes, I will not believe.</hi> And as the Iews ſaid unto our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Thou that ſavedſt others, now ſave thy ſelf, come down from the Croſſe and then we will believe in thee,</hi> do this miracle and then thou wilt perſwade us. Here we ſee, they would make their own Articles, or elſe they would have no Creed. The Jewes had learned this method of diſputing from the Devill, who at his meeting of our Saviour Chriſt, and at his firſt aſſault, thus diſputed, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and wouldeſt have the world ſo believe, and me too, on thee, then</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48122:97"/>
                  <hi>command theſe ſtones to be made bread, do this miracle firſt;</hi> but thou canſt not do it, <hi>Ergo.</hi> So in like manner theſe men argue, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the Presbyters by the impoſition of their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Diſciples, can inable them on a ſudden to speake with ſtrange tongues, to foretell things to come, and heal the ſicke, &amp;c. we will not acknowledge them to be true Elders: but let them do all theſe things by the impoſition of their hands, and then wee will acknowledge them for a true Presbytery.</hi> See the vanity of theſe men, and the inſtability of their faith, by their own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; miracles will make them believe any thing, if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit their own words, though never ſo contrary to their <hi>judgement</hi> and to the <hi>faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> It is well known to the Learned, that the Apoſtles and thoſe Primitive chriſtians had extraordinary and wonderfull gifts, that raviſht the world then into admiration; and it is confeſt alſo by all underſtanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that thoſe wonder-working miracles were but temporary, as the miraculous feeding of the people with <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, where they were fellow-commoners with the Angels, and continued but till they came into <hi>the Land that flowed with Milk and Honey.</hi> So thoſe miracles of the Primitive chriſtians continued but for a time, till the Goſpell and the truth of the Chriſtian faith and doctrine was confirmed and eſtabliſhed, which being once done, and the holy Scriptures which were to be the rule of faith to the end of the world being left to poſterity, and to which we are tyed and commanded <hi>not to be wiſe above that which is written,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and forbid in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwiſe then we have been taught, though the Apoſtles or an Angell from heaven ſhould teach otherwiſe;</hi> after, I ſay, the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion was confirmed, the ordinary working of Miracles ceaſed. And it is ſaid of Antichriſt in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> chap. 2. <hi>That he ſhall come with ſtrong deluſions and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, and with all deceiveableneſs in them that periſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> So that I cannot ſufficiently wonder, to ſee the dealing of theſe men, who in theſe dayes expect and look for miracles to confirme their faith, when notwithſtanding we are forwarned to <hi>take heed of all falſe deluſions,</hi> and commanded to the contrary. <hi>Shew us ſome miracles,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and then we will believe you are true Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi> So dealt the Jewes with Chriſt, <hi>What ſigne ſheweſt</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48122:98"/>
                  <hi>thou that wee may beleeve in thee?</hi> But when Chriſt had ſhewed them ſigne upon ſigne, and miracle upon miracle, were they ever the more convinced? Did thoſe miracles create beliefe in them? No ſurely, but rather hardned them and made them blaſpheme. When he caſt out Devils, they ſay <hi>he did it by the Prince of Devils.</hi> So without doubt, if the Presbyters had thoſe gifts of miracles, that they could gratifie theſe men with daily prodigies and workes of wonder, they would then ſay, <hi>they came with lying wonders, and with the working of Satan,</hi> and they would make the world abhor them the more. There is an old ſaying, <hi>that hee muſt riſe early and never goe to bed, that will pleaſe all men:</hi> and truly it would be not onely difficult, but an impoſſible thing, for any State or great Councell, were it never ſo wiſe, to pleaſe all the people under them. God himſelfe, nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor <hi>Aaron</hi> his ſervants, could pleaſe the Iſraelites though they ſaw never ſuch wonders continually before their eyes, to confirme their authority; yea they told <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to their faces, <hi>that they tooke too much upon them.</hi> And afterwards they caſt off Gods own government &amp; <hi>God himſelfe,</hi> as the Lord complains to <hi>Samuel,</hi> in 1 <hi>Samuel, and would ſet up a governement after the modell of their owne braine,</hi> as it is at large ſet downe in that Booke. And not long after they changed the manner of Gods worſhip, in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time, <hi>and taught the feare of God,</hi> as the Lord complaineth, <hi>Iſay</hi> 29. <hi>after the precepts of men,</hi> and rejected Gods commandements, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. and <hi>Marke</hi> 7. So that what they thought beſt in their owne eyes, that was ever beſt pleaſing unto them. They would not content themſelves <hi>with the Written Word,</hi> though they were never ſo often by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, commanded to cleave unto it, ſaying, <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony, Iſay</hi> 8. Even ſo it is now in theſe dayes, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not themſelves with that Ordinance <hi>that is ſet downe in the Written Word,</hi> but ſay, <hi>Come ſhew us ſome miracles, and then wee will beleeve you are a right Presbyterie.</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaking to the Jewes concerning Saint <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> and Himſelfe, <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>came neither eating nor drinking, and ye ſay behold hee hath a Devill; the Sonne of Man came both eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ye ſay, hee is a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi> So that whatſoever method or way God uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them, they cavil'd againſt it, and were never ſatisfied;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48122:98"/>
alwayes reſiſting the Spirit of God, as <hi>Stephen</hi> told them in <hi>Act.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>So now, in theſe our times they looke for miracles, and a new way of teaching. But all good Chriſtians are forbid to liſten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to give heed to miracles: <hi>and are ſent unto</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, Luke</hi> 16. <hi>and are commanded to ſearch the Scripture, John</hi> 5. Yea our Saviour himſelfe in the perſon of <hi>Abraham, Luke</hi> 16. ſaith, <hi>That if men will not beleeve Moſes and the Prophets, they will not be perſwaded by miracles:</hi> and I am confident, that could the Presbyters doe all thoſe miracles theſe men deſire, they would the more reproach them, and exclaime againſt them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme they <hi>wrought by the Devill,</hi> as the Jews told our <hi>Saviour</hi> he did. I muſt confeſſe, I am of a contrary opinion to theſe men, not only in the matter of miracles, but in all external performances; for I am inſtructed in the holy ſcriptures, <hi>that the Devill can transforme himſelfe into an Angell of light, and that the Deceivers and falſe Teachers ſhall come forth in ſheeps clothing, and for outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhalequalize, if not exceed, the faithfulleſt &amp; trueſt Paſtors and Miniſters of Chriſt;</hi> and therefore we are in ſpeciall, commanded to take heed of ſuch: and for my particular, if any men whatſoever of never ſuch ſeeming ſanctity, ſufficient abilities, unblameable life, ſhould come forth and teach any other <hi>Doctrine of Faith, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> then that I have been taught in the <hi>holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and ſhould confirme this their Doctrine with never ſo many miracles, I will ſtill continue ſtedfaſt in the <hi>Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> and cleave unto the <hi>written Word,</hi> and will never beleeve contrary to that, though I ſhould undergoe the greateſt miſery, or be expoſed to the greateſt want by it, that any man ever ſaw: for I know that all theſe momentary trials and afflictions are not worthy that exceeding weight of glory that ſhall be revealed. And for this very point of the Presbytery, in that ſenſe I take it, I am ſo well aſſured that it is Gods Ordinance, as I am of any point in Religion. But as I ſaid before, if men may argue after this way. <hi>The Presbyters in the Apoſtles times did miracles, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ake with ſtrange tongues, and their Schollers and Diſciples did the ſame; doe you likewiſe, and then we will acknowledge you to be true Preſbyters, otherwiſe wee will not.</hi> Thus the Jewes might have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued againſt all their Prophets, as againſt <hi>Iſaiah, Ieremy, Ezekiel, &amp;c. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> faſted forty dayes and forty nights, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48122:99"/>
did many miracles, do you ſo, and then we will beleeve you are true Prophets, and ſent to us of God, otherwiſe we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you to be true Prophets. Yea all the wicked and ungodly men of theſe times may argue thus alſo: <hi>God gave unto his Church Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets, &amp;c. and they ſpake all ſtrange tongues and divers languages, and did many miracles; but you and your Congregations, have neither Apoſtles, Prophets, nor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, nor ye have not the gifts of Tongues, nor yee can do no Miracle:</hi> Ergo, <hi>you are not the true Church.</hi> The Primitive Chriſtians and the ſervants of God in thoſe times, had the gifts of Tongues and Propheſie, and the holy Ghoſt came down upon them, and they ſpake by direction from God his infallible truth and Goſpell, whoſe ſpeeches were not tyed to time, and to one ſpeaker, <hi>but many ſpake one after another by Interpreters,</hi> as it is at large ſet down in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 14. verſ. 27. 28, 29, 30. &amp;c. So that they ſpake infallible truth by direction from God: <hi>But you have none in your Congregations ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly inſpired with ſundry languages, and divers tongues, nor ye do not ſpeake infallible truths by direction from God; nor you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cure diſeaſes nor do miracles:</hi> Ergò, <hi>your religion is not the ſame Religion; nor your Congregations the true Church: ſhew us theſe miracles and then we will beleeve you to be the true Church, otherwiſe we may not, we dare not acknowledge you to be the true Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again they may argue thus:</hi> The Apostles and Primitive Pastors, and Teachers preached freely, and laboured with their own hands, and were helpfull to the neceſſities of others, and were not burthenſome and exacting from others, and spake <hi>ex tempore,</hi> by direction from God: but your Ministers in your Congregations do not preach freely, nor labour not with their own hands, nor are not helpfull to to others neceſſities, but are rather burdenſome and exacting from others; nor they do no miracles, nor speake not immediately by inspiration, and <hi>ex tempore;</hi> but by Study and out of their Bookes, and are confined to time, and ſpeake not in ſtrange tongues and languages, one after another by Interpreters. <hi>Ergò,</hi> Your Miniſters are not Gods Ministers, nor your Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the true Church, nor your people true Chriſtians; for you want all thoſe things that the Primitive Chriſtians and the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches had.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48122:99"/>
There is a Pamphlet lately come out, and highly eſteemed and priſed amongſt many, full of ſuch conſequences as theſe, which if they hold good againſt the Presbyters, they may alſo for ought I know, be of equall validity to overthrow, not onely all Chriſtian Congregations, but indeed all Chriſtian Religion. But briefly to anſwer.</p>
               <p>We look upon the Apoſtles and Primitive Presbyters, as men miraculouſly and extraordinarily gifted, and as wonder-working men for the confirmation of the truth of the Goſpell to all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages; and we conſider in them and in the Chriſtians of thoſe times, ſomething extraordinary and temporary, <hi>as their working of miracles, and ſpeaking of ſtrange tongues, and gifts of healing, &amp;c.</hi> And thoſe we conceive were to continue no longer in the church, then for the confirmation of the truth of the Goſpel; Chriſt himſelfe proclaiming thoſe bleſſed, <hi>that believe without ſeeing of miracles,</hi> ſpeaking unto <hi>Thomas, Iohn</hi> 20. 29. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt ſeen me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou believeſt, bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and have believed.</hi> So that miracles now are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and we are tied to the written Word. But we conſider likewiſe in the Apoſtles and Primitive Presbyters, that that was permanent and to continue in all Miniſters and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in ſucceeding ages to the end of the world, and that was the power of order and preaching, and the power of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that is of ruling (which is not denied by the moſt learned of the Independents themſelves) and this I have proved by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> to be tranſacted over to all <hi>Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> whoſe Presbyters have that power given unto them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the Learned Brethren deny it, whatſoever the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may do. Yea, the very name of a Presbytery (as I ſaid before) if we look through the whole Scripture, ſignifieth a <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> or <hi>Signiory,</hi> or <hi>Corporation</hi> inveſted with authority of governing and ruling; and ſuch a counſell and company of men, as upon whom the government under Chriſt is laid, and to be extended ſo far, as their juriſdiction extendeth, and as far as by common conſent it may make for the good and edification of the church, and for the ſafety of the ſame. And ſuch was the government of all thoſe churches of the New Teſtament, which were as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Committees, their limits and bounds prefixed them, as at this dayall Committees through the Kingdom have in their ſeverall Hundreds, Rapes, Wapentakes, and Cities, to whom the ordering
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48122:100"/>
and government of thoſe places that are under them, are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſo that all that is done or tranſacted, muſt be done by the joynt conſent, and councell of the whole Committee, not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man or any two of them ſeverally conſidered by themſelvs, can make an order; but that order onely is binding which is made by the joynt conſent and common agreement of them all, or the greateſt part of them aſſembled together. <hi>Even ſo all thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations that are within the compaſſe and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeverall Preſbyteries, are to be ordered and governed by the common and joynt councell of the ſeverall Preſbyters, or the greater part of them.</hi> For this was the order the Apoſtles eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, appointing in every City a Presbytery; and when they had ſo ordered the Churches, they ſet them all to their ſeverall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the <hi>Preſbyters to command,</hi> and all the <hi>people and particular Aſſemblies and Congregations under them, to obey;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ever found in the holy Scriptures, that the people were joyned with the Presbyters in their Commiſſion. So that they that oppoſe this government, reſiſt Gods Ordinance. And if we looke into all the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> writ by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Churches,</hi> we ſhall finde in them, <hi>That they enjoyne all the ſeverall Congregations to yeeld obedience to their Paſtors and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over them, and ſignifie unto them that they owe unto them double honour, eſpecially ſuch as labour in the Word and Doctrine;</hi> that is, they muſt yeeld unto them, not onely due reverence and ſubjection, and obedience to their councell and juſt commands in the Lord; but that they ſhould alſo afford them the honour of maintenance, and take order there be a ſufficient and competent, yea, an honourable allowance for their ſupport; <hi>and that as they miniſter to them spirituall food for their ſoules, they ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe miniſter unto them all things neceſſary for the maintenance of them and their Families,</hi> that they may comfortably and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſolicitous care, follow their holy imployments and wait upon their ſeverall Miniſteries. So that the place and imployment of the Presbyters, is <hi>to teach and rule the people;</hi> and this is their proper worke, and peculiarly belongs unto them; and the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and place of the ſeverall congregations under them, is <hi>to hear and obey:</hi> and therefore if the ſeverall congregations do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume unto themſelves the power of ruling, they take more upon them then by God is allowed them: and the Presbyters in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48122:100"/>
yeilding unto it, reject their own right, and deveſt themſelves of that authority that God hath put into their hands; and by ſo doing in time may not onely bring confuſion into the Church, but to all thoſe Countries where ſuch uſurpations are tolerated. I cannot but ſpeake my conſcience in this point: And truly, very reaſon dictates unto a man, that they only ſhould have the authority of commanding and ruling over the Churches, to whom the power of the Keyes is given. Now it is given only to the Miniſters and Presbyters, as we ſee it in <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. Where our Saviour Chriſt eſtabliſhed <hi>a ſtanding government, to be continued to the end of the World,</hi> the violating and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of the which, was the cauſe of all thoſe confuſions, both in doctrine and manners that is now come upon the world; and was the cauſe, not only of the riſe, but the growth of Antichriſt. And the reducing of it again into the Church, and the re<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of it, will be the confuſion of that <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and of all the <hi>Antichriſtian-brood,</hi> and be a meanes of eſtabliſhing truth and peace through the Chriſtian world. But it will not be amiſſe a little to conſider that place in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>If thy Brother,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>ſhall treſpaſſe againſt thee, go and tell him of it between thee and him alone: if he ſhall heare thee, thou ſhalt gaine thy brother; but if he will not heare thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to heare them; then tell it unto the Church: but if he neglect to heare the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen man and a Publican. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> In theſe words our Saviour Chriſt has reſpect unto the order and cuſtome of judicature in thoſe times in cenſuring mens manners and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which among the Jewes was ordered and adminiſtred by an aſſembly and counſell of learned, experienced, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and by a Presbytery, Conſiſtory, or Colledge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men for government, choſe and ſelected out of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for this very purpoſe, by ſuch as could judge and diſcerne of their abilities: the which aſſembly and company, is by Chriſt himſelf called a Church, becauſe it did repreſent the Church, and in this place Chriſt did eſtabliſh the like to be continued in the Chriſtian church to the end of the world, making his Apoſtles
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48122:101"/>
this repreſentative body, and their ſucceſſors all the godly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters and Presbyters, and gives unto them the ſame power and Authority, to judge and determine of all things belonging unto faith and manners that was obſerved in the Jewiſh church, in all Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline. For otherwiſe, the Chriſtian church ſhould be inferior to that of the Jews, if they had not the ſame Priviledges for the cenſuring of manners and Doctrines, and the ſame power of juriſdiction and ruling that they had. Now all power of juriſdiction among the Jews, was exerciſed not by the promiſcuous multitude, or by the whole congregation, nor by any particular man, nor by two or three (as the place above ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies) but by an <hi>Aſſembly, Senate, Councell,</hi> or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> of <hi>underſtanding men aſſigned to that purpoſe,</hi> which our Saviour himſelf calleth <hi>a Church;</hi> &amp; this government eſtabliſhed in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church, are the ſeverall Presbyteries, where all things are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted by common and joynt conſent: and this was the practiſe of the Apoſtles at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who did all buſineſſe of publike concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by common and joynt conſent, as is manifeſt, <hi>in the firſt chap. of the</hi> Acts, <hi>in chuſing of an Apoſtle in</hi> Iudas <hi>his place,</hi> and in the 5. chap. in cenſuring <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> and in the 6. chap. in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Deacons, and in the</hi> 15. <hi>chapter in determining the queſtion there in hand,</hi> all in a Presbyterian way and by common conſent.</p>
               <p>And this is that government, that God hath commanded to be perpetuated to the end of the world, in theſe words; <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> So that the Presbyters onely have the power of the keyes, &amp; it is their place only to ordain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Church Officers, (whatſoever Authority the people may exerciſe in the chuſing of them) as <hi>Paul</hi> writes unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>they onely are to judge and determine and to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in matters of manners and doctrine,</hi> and <hi>the people are to allow and approve it according to the Word of God.</hi> Yea the very Synagogues of the Jews, which were the ſame that our churches are, were governed by a Presbytery, (as our brethren acknowledge) called by the name of the Rulers of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, who governed by joynt and common councell; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and manifeſt, in that there were ſuperior and inferior Judges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Commanders, and Rulers, according as their yeares, gravity and wiſdome made them more emninent then others, and venerable to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48122:101"/>
the people: as may appeare in many places as <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. It is ſaid there, <hi>That Criſpus the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved with all his houſhould.</hi> So that if there were a chiefe Ruler, or Iudge, or a Preſident; there muſt of neceſſity be a Councell or Segniory of inferiour ones, that had Rule and Authority over others as well as he: and where there is a chiefe Juſtice or Judge, there are other Judges joyned with him, as all reaſon perſwades, and there muſt needs be a Court of Judicature, where all things are tranſacted, by conjoynt and common conſent and agreement: and ſo it was in the Synagogues of the Jewes, who were ſubject to, and ordered by the determinations and abitrement of their Rulers and Governours. So that the ſeverall Churches or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues under the Jews were in ſubjection to thoſe Rulers, and were governed according as by common councell they ordered. And <hi>Mat.</hi> the 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>And behold there came one of the Rulers of the Synagogue, whoſe name was Iairus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> here was a ſpeciall <hi>Ecce</hi> added to take notice, that a great man, and one in authority, came unto Chriſt, and that in a publick way, and one of the Rulers of the Synagogue. So that wee may obſerve the people in every Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue were governed and commanded by their Rulers, and they were to yeeld obedience unto them, and were not joyned with them in Commiſſion, but ſtood to their determination, as all men uſe to doe in Courts of Judicature, that appeal unto them for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And this cuſtome and manner of government was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted over to the Chriſtian Churches; and thoſe that were called Rulers among them, are among Chriſtians ſometimes called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Guides,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Rulers,</hi> and by Chriſt himſelfe and by his Apoſtles, are appointed over all Chriſtian Churches as ſo many corporations; to which all the Aſſemblies and Congregations under them, and committed to their charge, are to yeeld <hi>obedience and ſubmiſſion, in whatſoever they command in the Lord, and according to his bleſſed Word;</hi> for that muſt be the rule both of their <hi>commanding</hi> and of the peoples <hi>obeying.</hi> And this Presbyterian government, is that manner and way of ruling all Aſſemblies and particular Congregations under it, that God hath appointed in his Church, to be continued to the end of the world; <hi>the which whoſoever reſiſteth, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God.</hi> And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken in generall, in way of proofe, <hi>That all Churches wee have mention of under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:48122:102"/>
                  <hi>were Ariſtocratically and Preſbyterially governed, that is, were under the Government of a Colledge or Aſſembly of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I come to prove in order the foure Propoſitions or concluſions I undertooke to make good. The firſt was, That there were many Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in the which they had all acts of worſhip, and did partake in all Ordinances of Church-Fellowſhip; and that before the perſecution we reade of <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and under the perſecution, and after the perſecution. And for the proofe of this Propoſition, and every branch of it, I will firſt produce ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture as make for the manifeſtation of the truth, and from thence frame and forme my Arguments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. 5, 6. <hi>In thoſe dayes came Iohn the Baptiſt, preaching in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Iudaea, and ſaying, Repent ye, for the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand. Then went out to him Ieruſalem, and all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>udaea and all the Region round about Iordan, and were baptized of him in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan confeſſing their ſinnes.</hi> The Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as all the learned know, was the ſame with that of the Apoſtles, for he preached the Baptiſme of Repentance for the Remiſſion of ſinnes, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized all that came to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaying unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>That they ſhould beleeve on him which ſhould come after him, that is, on Chriſt Ieſus, Act.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Hee had his Commiſſion alſo from God as well as the Apoſtles, and Baptized Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; hee preached alſo the Goſpel and the Kingdome of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> as well as the Apoſtles; and had many honourable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies from Chriſt himſelfe; as, <hi>That he was the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that ever was borne of woman,</hi> and <hi>That he was a bright ſhining light,</hi> and <hi>That he was his witneſſe;</hi> and many other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums and praiſes did Chriſt give of him, to ratifie his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>and to ſhew that he was ſent of God, and that he was that Elias that was to come before the Meſſiah:</hi> And all the people owned, and tooke him for a man ſent of God, <hi>and Ieruſalem went out to him, and all the Region round about, and were Baptized of him.</hi> In theſe words wee find that the people of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were all tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſtians, and made members of the Chriſtian Church, and were beleevers. For which way ſoever the word <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> be taken, it ſignifieth a numberleſſe multitude of men, or an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48122:102"/>
For if we conſider <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at this time, ſhe was a moſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous City: the Hiſtorians that write of that age, relate, <hi>That ſhe had ſomtimes in her, no leſſe then eleven or twelve hundred thouſand;</hi> but let it be taken that theſe were but <hi>ſix hundred thouſand inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,</hi> it is a vaſt multitude, and yet ſeldome was there leſſe inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> if any beleife may be had to Hiſtorians; for at that time it was one of the Metropolis Cities of the world, <hi>and the glory of Nations and the joy of the whole Earth;</hi> and beſides there was then great expectation, as we may read, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 11. <hi>That the Kingdome of God ſhould immediately appear,</hi> and all the Jewes out of all Nations where they were ſcattered, now repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Jeruſalem, and returned into their own countrey, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> So that at this time, we cannot conceive but that there were infinites of people in Jeruſalem, and it is ſaid, That Jeruſalem went <hi>out and was baptized by Iohn.</hi> By Jeruſalem, here metonimycally the place is taken for the people. Now when it is ſaid that a City goeth out, it is to be underſtood either of the whole people, Man, Woman, and Child, old and young, with all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; as many times it happens, in great Earth-quakes, or ſome Peſtilence or Inundation, that all the Inhabitants are forced to leave a City, and to ſeek ſome other habitation, or of ſome great part; but we cannot conceive the going out of Jeruſalem to <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> in that large ſenſe and expreſſion; ſo that in this place it muſt be taken Synecdochycally, and we are to underſtand <hi>a great part,</hi> or <hi>a chiefe part for the whole:</hi> as when a City is ſaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine a King, or to go out to meet a King, here it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood principally of the chief <hi>Officers,</hi> as the <hi>Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and the Common-councell, and all their ſeverall <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and chiefe <hi>Captaines</hi> and <hi>Commanders,</hi> with all their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence; ſo that in this notion the <hi>common people</hi> and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Citizens are not thought on, or at leaſt are not numbred. As when JESUS was borne in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and the Wiſe Men came to Jeruſalem, to enquire <hi>where they ſhould finde him that was borne King of the Iewes, that they might worſhip him, for they had ſeen his Star,</hi> it is ſaid, That when <hi>Herod</hi> heard theſe things, <hi>He and all Ieruſalem was troubled with him.</hi> Here, by <hi>all Ieruſalem,</hi> is to be underſtood all the chiefe Officers and Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for the common people were glad of it; for that was the day they had long looked for, and rejoyced at: but <hi>Herod</hi> being an
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48122:103"/>
Uſurper and a Tyrant, and all his Nobles, Peers, and Great men being confederate with him, and adjutors in his uſurpation and tyranny, and conceiving that Chriſt was an earthly Monarch; and that after the manner of the Kings of the Earth, he would not onely pull down the Uſurper, but likewiſe call all them in queſtion, as guilty of High Treaſon, and cut them of as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices and abettors; this made them tremble and feare; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the generall fear of all the great men in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of all the Courtiers and Officers under <hi>Herod,</hi> therefore it is ſaid, <hi>that</hi> Herod <hi>and all Ieruſalem with him was troubled.</hi> So that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and their complices never have any reall peace. But in this ſenſe alſo it cannot be underſtood, <hi>that Ieruſalem went out to</hi> John <hi>and was baptized;</hi> it muſt therefore by a Senecdoche be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for all the common people promiſcuouſly, or for a mighty multitude of all ſorts, and of all ranks of people, and of all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as Publicans, Souldiers, and the ordinary Inhabitants: and in this ſenſe the word Jeruſalem muſt be taken for a mighty mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men in Jeruſalem that were made Chriſtians; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Evangeliſt would have ſaid, <hi>many went out of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem alſo, as well as out of other places:</hi> but in ſaying <hi>that all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and all the Regions round about, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>went out;</hi> this metaphoricall expreſſion doth ſignifie, <hi>That an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people in Ieruſalem it ſelfe, were made Chriſtians and Members of the Church;</hi> and that it is ſo to be underſtood, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following will evidently evince it: for in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 12. our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That from the dayes of Iohn the Baptiſt, untill now, the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force,</hi> then the which, there could nothing be ſpoke more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, to ſet forth the growth and increaſe of Beleevers, and the multitude of Chriſtians, as <hi>Luke</hi> alſo in ch. 16. v. 16. expreſſeth ſaying, <hi>That the Law and the Prophets were untill Iohn; ſince that time the kingdome of God is preached, and every man preſſeth in to it:</hi> that is, the generality of the people became beleevers, and were baptized: as it is yet more evident from <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30. by the very teſtimony of our Saviour, who ſaith, <hi>That all the people that heard him, and the Publicans, juſtified God, being baptized with the Baptiſme of Iohn; but the P hariſees and Lawyers reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the councell of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized of him.</hi> So that by the witneſſe of our Saviour Chriſt, except the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48122:103"/>
Phariſees and the Prieſts; all the people, or the generality of the people in Ieruſalem were baptized, and became Chriſtians, and imbraced the Goſpell: and this was accounted among the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that was wrought in thoſe dayes, and as a thing of ſpeciall obſervation, and as a matter of wonder; as we may ſee in the meſſage our Saviour Chriſt ſent unto <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he bad them relate unto their Maſter, what they had ſeen and heard in the 22. <hi>Verſe; Tell him</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That the blinde ſee, the lame walke, the Leapers are cleanſed, the deafe heare, and the dead are raiſed, and the poore receive the Goſpel;</hi> this I ſay, was among the miracles, that the generality of the poore imbrace the Goſpel, and were baptized and made Believers: which muſt needs import a mighty multitude, and a great increaſe, or elſe it would not have been a thing of ſuch wonder, and have been ſent unto Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> as a miraculous thing; and a thing worthy to prove Chriſt himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> looked for; for no meere man could have wrought ſuch a work, asto draw the hearts of the the people to imbrace the Goſpel, but the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> himſelf; <hi>For Paul may plant, and Apollo may water,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. but God only the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> muſt give the increaſe; he muſt move the heart to imbrace the Goſpel, and to believe; <hi>for faith is the gift of God, Epheſ.</hi> 2. and therefore this was the wonder that the generality of the people did believe and were baptized, and this was the ſole work and operation of Chriſt, and therefore proved him to be the Prophet they looked for. And it ſtands with all reaſon that there were infinites of people in Jeruſalem that believed; and that <hi>Iohn</hi> was greatly magnified of the people, and publickly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, becauſe for a time, <hi>Herod</hi> himſelfe countenanced <hi>Iohn Mark.</hi> 6. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>and feared him, knowing that he was a juſt man and an holy, and obſerved him, and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</hi> And although we read not that he was baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet he highly honoured him; till <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him, <hi>and told him, it was not lawfull for him to have his Brothers Wife.</hi> And in this interim of his ſeeming favour, we may conceive, that the Courtiers alſo and the great men would do as their Maſter did: for if we obſerve the manner of all Courts to this day, what the King does the Courtiers alſo do; if the King laugh, though there be perhaps a cauſe of mourning, they will all laugh; and if he frownes, though there be a cauſe of cheerfulneſſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48122:104"/>
and ſmiling, they will al frown; and if the King commends any man, they will all admire him; and if he hears any Miniſter glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will all heare him willingly: and if he when he is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, be angry and diſpleaſed, and will cut off his head whom he had ſo honoured but the day before, then all the Courtiers, they will helpe him, and further the worke: as we may ſee, not only in the example of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> but in <hi>Haman;</hi> as ſoon as the King frownd upon him, the Courtiers they covered his face, and up they truſſed him; be it right or wrong it is all one to Courtiers. But in that interim, I ſay, that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was in favour with the King, without doubt it animated the people greatly to follow him, and by hearing him, many thouſand Saints were converted, and the multitudes of them were numerous, as is manifeſt from <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 5. for it is ſaid, <hi>That when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude, becauſe they counted him as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> Here are two obſervables, the one, <hi>That he that feared not God, was afraid of his ſervants.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>that it was a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty multitude of Believers that were in Ieruſalem; for a few could not have awed the King and kept him in feare: and therefore he was forced to defer the cutting off of his head, till he had got to him all the ſtrength of Galilee, all his Lords and high Captains, and his chiefe Eſtates and Commanders, Mark</hi> 6. 21. And when he thought himſelfe ſtrong enough, then he exerciſed his tyranny. Yea, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was taken away, yet the multitudes of the people <hi>continued stedfaſt in the faith,</hi> as we may ſee in <hi>Luke</hi> 20. by the confeſſion of the very enemies: for when our Saviour asked them concerning the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn, Whether it was from Heaven or of Men? And they reaſoned among themſelves, ſaying, if we ſhall ſay from Heaven, he will ſay, why then believed ye him not? and if we ſay of Men, all the people will ſtone us, for they be perſwaded that Iohn was a Prophet.</hi> Here by the confeſſion of the very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, all the people, or the generality of them were Believers; and it muſt of neceſſity be a mighty multitude, that kept all the Prieſts and all the Elders that had all the power in their hands, in awe, that they durſt not ſo much as open their mouthes againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> From all which places, and many more that might be produced, to prove, <hi>That there were ſo many Believers in Ieruſalem as could not all meet in one place or roome, or in one Congregation, to partake in all acts of worſhip;</hi> I thus argue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48122:104"/>
Where there was an infinite multitude, or a mighty City of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, there they could not all meet together in one place or roome, or in one Congregation, for the enjoying of all acts of worſhip, and for edification (which is required in the Churches, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 26.)</hi> but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies, and divers diviſions, that they might be all edified, and partake in all Ordinances. But in the Church of Ieruſalem, by the very baptiſme and preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> there were infinite multitudes, and a very City of Believers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place or roome, or in one congregation for the enjoying of all acts of worſhip, and for edification (which is required in the Church of God) but of neceſſitie must be distributed into ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies, and divers diviſions, that they might all be edified, &amp; partake in all ordinances. For the major, it is cleare, by the very light of nature, and all reaſon: for there is no one place or houſe that can contain a whole City, or infinite multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and if any great place could containe them, they could not all be edified and partake of all the acts of worſhip. For if the very great raw-bon'd building of <hi>Pauls</hi> it ſelf were cramm'd full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and had a Preacher of the ſtrongeſt lungs in the City, half the people could not hear and be edified, as daily experience telleth us; ſo that of neceſſity, if they would be edified, and partake in all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, they muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations, and ſeverall aſſemblies. <hi>I am moſt aſſured that there were ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Believers in Jeruſalem, that five ſuch buildings as</hi> Pauls <hi>could not have contained their very bodies within their wals, much leſſe receive them, or entertaine them for edification. So that for the major, I am confident there is no intelligible man will doubt of it. For the Minor, it is manifeſt from the places above produced; for our Saviour ſaith,</hi> excepting the Phariſees and the Lawyers <hi>(which were but a little handfull)</hi> all the people, or the generality of them, juſtified God, and were baptized, and were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. <hi>So that the concluſion from the premiſes doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow. But from the former places I argue yet further after this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where there was ſuch an infinite company and multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Believers, as kept a tyrannicall King in awe, and all the Magiſtrates and Elders in whoſe hands was all the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and ſtruck ſuch a fear and terror into them all, that they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48122:105"/>
durſt not exerciſe their cruelty and tyranny over them, though they were their inveterate enemies, and deſired it: There of neceſſity the number of the Believers muſt be ſo great, as they could not all meet together in one place or roome, or in one congregation, for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and partaking in all the acts of worſhip; but if they would be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies. But in Ieruſalem there were ſuch an infinite company and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Chriſtians and Believers, as kept Herod himſelf, the tyrant, in awe, all the Magiſtrates and Elders, in whoſe hands was all the power and authority; and ſtruck ſuch a feare and terror into them, that they durſt not exerciſe their cruelty and tyranny over them, though they were their inveterate enemies, and deſired it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> of neceſſity the number of the Believers was ſo great, as they could not all meet together in one place or roome, or in one congregation, for the enjoying and partaking in all acts of worſhip; but if they would be edified, muſt be diſtributed into divers Congregations and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
               <p>For the Major and Minor of this Syllogiſme, beſides the force of reaſon and common underſtanding, which were enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any rationall creature of the truth of them: the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf (as from the places above ſpecified, is manifeſt) proves them. So that none can doubt of the truth of the concluſion, but ſuch as will call in queſtion truth it ſelfe. I might out of the ſeverall places above mentioned draw many more Arguments to prove the concluſion; but becauſe I ſtudy brevity, theſe for the preſent ſhall ſerve, to prove, <hi>That by the very baptiſme and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, there were ſuch an infinite company of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the Church of Ieruſalem, as they could not al meet together in one place or congregation, for the injoying of all the Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To theſe firſt arguments of mine, by which I proved that by the very Baptiſme of S.</hi> Iohn <hi>there were more converted and made Chriſtians and believeres in</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>then could meete in any one place or Congregation, Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>anſwers by denying the minor of my Syllogiſmes, and</hi> I. S. <hi>by denying they were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as we ſhall ſee. I will therefore reply unto them both, in order, beginning firſt with Maſter</hi> Knollys, <hi>whoſe words are theſe pag. 8.</hi> I do deny the minor propoſition of theſe arguments <hi>ſaith he.</hi> Neither hath the Doctor proved, that there was an infinite number of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, nor a very City of beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem. The
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48122:105"/>
Scriptures quoted by the Doctor ſpeak no ſuch thing. Thoſe places in <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> tell us of very many who were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and by Chriſts Diſciples; but doe not declare how many of thoſe baptized perſons were of the Church of Ieruſalem; and the Scripture witneſſeth, <hi>Act. 9. 31.</hi> That there were Churches through all Iudaea, as well as in Ieruſalem; and for ought I know, or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor either, many of thoſe baptized perſons might be in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yea the moſt of them, and but a few in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> it may be no more but thoſe hundred and twenty mentioned, <hi>Act. 1. 13, 14, 15.</hi> to whom were added about three thouſand ſoules, who continued in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and in breaking of bread and prayers, Acts the <hi>2. 42, 43, 44. This is all Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>hath to ſay by way of anſwer for the enervating of the ſtrength of my Arguments and Reaſons, by which I proved there were more converted by</hi> Iohns <hi>Miniſterythen could meet in any one place in</hi> Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>Now here before I come to reply, I referre my ſelfe to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader, whether from the forgoing places, which I quoted out of the Holy Word of God, &amp; from the Reaſons and Arguments deduced out of it, it was not ſufficiently evinced, <hi>That there were an infinite number of beleevers, and a very Citie of them in the Church of Ieruſalem, and therefore more then could meet in any one place or Congregation:</hi> I demand I ſay of any intelligible Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, whether thoſe Scriptures I cited with the Arguments deduced from them doe not ſpeake and perſwade ſuch a thing? I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident all ſuch as know any thing in learning, will ſay they doe. But for anſwer, Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> himſelfe, grants that very many were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Chriſts</hi> diſciples, and none were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized then but Beleevers, as he and all the Independents doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and acknowledge; but ſaith he, <hi>the Scriptures quoted, do not declare how many of thoſe baptized perſons were of the Church of Ieruſalem; for the Scriptures witneſſe that there were Churches through all Iudaea, as well as in Ieruſalem, and for ought</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I know or the Doctor either, many of thoſe baptized perſons might be of thoſe Churches, yea the moſt of them, and but a few in Ieruſalem, it may be no more but thoſe hundred and twenty, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Acts the</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>If a bare denyall of any Argument with a ſenſeleſſe Reaſon or two, and an it may be, were a ſufficient conviction of a truth, then Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> would be a very precious Diſputant, and to ſay
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48122:106"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thou lyeſt, would be enough to confute all the Papiſts: But in matters of this nature and of ſo high concernement, there is more required then bare denials, and vaine evaſions and may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee's: And therefore I will take this liberty to tell Maſter <hi>Knollis,</hi> that hee trifles in Divinity, and deales not like a ſerious nor learned Chriſtian, nor to the purpoſe: for this is not in queſtion betweene mee and the Independents, <hi>how many of thoſe baptized perſons through all Iudaea and the Regions round about were reſident in the Church of Ieruſalem?</hi> This I ſay was never controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us; for no man that I know of, ever doubted but that all thoſe that came out of al <hi>Iudaea</hi> and the Regions round about to the Miniſtry &amp; Baptiſm of <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts Diſciples, returned home againe to their ſeverall habitations, and there remained and aboad, as thoſe that came out of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Iohns</hi> Preaching and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, after they were baptized, repaired to their ſeverall houſes &amp; habitations in that Citie, and remained there waiting upon the publick Ordinances; this I conceive all men that have any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding beleeve. And the Scripture ſufficiently declareth, that the multitudes of Beleevers that came out of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, (to ſpeake nothing now of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and ſeventy Diſciples) were numberleſſe, and therefore were more then the hundred and twenty names; yea they were innumerable, &amp; therefore more then could meet in any one place or a few. And if the Reader will but looke backe to the Scriptures above quoted, out of which I framed my Arguments, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſuing Scriptures and Reaſons from them, he will eaſily perceive that Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> is a meere Quibler, and a man no way fit for either diſputation, or any ſerious imployment.</p>
               <p>The Evangeliſts ſpeaking of the great concourſes of people that came from all quarters to the Preaching and Miniſtery of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to be baptized, to avoid miſtakes, doe ſpecifie the ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of which they came, with the numbers indefinitly ſet down that came from every place, ſaying, <hi>There went out to him Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and all Iudaea, and all the Regions round about Iordan, and were baptized of him in Iordan confeſſing their ſinnes, Mat.</hi> the 3. Here it is abundantly declared that it was an infinite company that came from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as by the word <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, being metaphorically ſet downe and taken in that place (as I ſaid before) ſynechdochically for a mighty part and multitude of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48122:106"/>
people that came out of that City. And Saint <hi>Marke</hi> confirmes this, chap. 1. ver. the 5. who ſaith, <hi>there went out unto him all the land of</hi> Judea, <hi>and they of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and were all baptized of him in the river</hi> Jordan <hi>confeſſing their ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſame is further ratified by the words of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29. 30. who ſaith, <hi>that all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juſtified God, being baptized by the Baptiſme of</hi> John, <hi>but the Phariſees and Lawyers rejected the Councell of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized.</hi> So that now by the mouth of three witneſſes and by the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelfe it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, <hi>That if Jeruſalem and all the people of Jeruſalem went out and were baptized by</hi> John <hi>(except the Phariſees and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers) that there was an innumerable multitude, and therefore more then could poſſibly meet in any one place or a few, and many more then the hundred and twenty names ſpoke of in the firſt of the Acts;</hi> which fond conceit of Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> is yet more evidently refuted out of the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is related that there were at that time Inhabitants and Dwellers at Jeruſalem <hi>devout men,</hi> that is, <hi>true Worſhippers and Beleevers from out of all the Nations under Heaven.</hi> To ſay nothing of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea</hi> and of many other Rulers, and of all the people and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that cryed <hi>Hoſanna</hi> and that received Chriſt into the City with all their acclamations and believed in him; the moſt of which were Inhabitants aud Dwellers in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and ſuch as had their aboad there, ſo that by this I have now ſaid, the folly and vanity of Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and his cavill is apparantly manifeſt, and this truth ſufficiently clear to all, that there was an infinite number and a very City of Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, beſides thoſe that were of the other Churches in <hi>Judea,</hi> and therefore could not all meet in one place: For the Scripture ſaith that Ieruſalem and they of Ieruſalem went out and were baptized by <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt;</hi> and therefore all good Chriſtians I am confident will ever beleeve the Scriptures and give credit unto the word of God rather then unto Mr <hi>Knollys;</hi> and if they will beleeve the Scripture of truth, then they will not onely beleeve there was an infinite number and a very City of Beleevers in Ieruſalem, and that by the very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> is a very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and blaſphemous creature as who giveth the ſpirit of God the lye and oppoſeth alſo all good reaſon: For the ſpirit ſaith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48122:107"/>
                  <hi>and all they of Ieruſalem,</hi> except the Phariſees and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, <hi>were baptized by</hi> John, and all theſe were inhabitants at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; and Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmeth the contrary and confuteth all the Evangeliſts; whether therefore he be not a very precious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant I refer it to the judgement of all ſober-minded Chriſtians that love ſincerity, truth and plain dealing.</p>
               <p>And this might ſuffice to ſhew the vanity and wickedneſſe of the man and what a vain caviller he is, that thus abuſeth pretious time to abuſe himſelfe and miſerably to delude ignorant people: But for the farther confirmation of my Minor, I will produce one or two teſtimonies more out of the eleventh of <hi>Mark,</hi> where there is mention made of two great companies and parties of beleevers and thoſe all Inhabitants in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the one of them that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt and beleeved in him, at which the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were offended, and ſought how they might deſtroy him; but ſaith the Scripture, <hi>they feared him, becauſe all the people were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine,</hi> that is, <hi>they beleeved it:</hi> verſe 18. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other company was thoſe that were the Diſciples of <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> and they accompted <hi>Iohn a Prophet indeed, as all the men of Ieruſalem did,</hi> verſe 32. and either of theſe companies were ſo great and powerfull as they kept all Chriſts enemies in awe, ſo that they were affraid of the people of either party, and therefore there was then a very City of believers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and they In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and that in Chriſts time, and they had been baptized by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> for <hi>all Ieruſalem went out and were baptized by him;</hi> So that now I aſſure my ſelfe every but ordinary underſtanding man will gather that there was an innumerable multitude of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and more than could meet in any one place, or a few if they had been put together, when there were two ſuch potent parties there, as either of them kept the very enemies of Chriſt, the Magiſtrates and Rulers, yea <hi>Herod</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>himſelfe in awe, which a few thouſands could never have done; and all theſe were Inhabitans of Ieruſalem and well known to the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees to be <hi>Chriſts</hi> and <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples, and all beleevers, as wee ſhall more abundantly prove in the following diſcourſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my <hi>Minor</hi> doth now ſtand firme, <hi>That there were more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in Ieruſalem, and that by the very miniſtry and baptiſme of</hi> John, <hi>then could meet in any one place or a few, and that there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Where there was ſuch an infinite company and multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and believers, as kept a tyrannicall King in awe and all the Magiſtrates and Elders, in whoſe hands was all the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and ſtruck ſuch a terror into them all, as they durſt not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their cruelty and tyranny over them, though they were their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemies, there of neceſſity the number of them muſt be ſo great, as they could not all meet together in one place or congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to partake in all Acts of worſhip. But, in the Church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem there was ſuch a company of believers by the very baptiſme of <hi>Iohn;</hi> ergo they could not all meete together in any one place or congregation.</p>
               <p>This is the ſumme of my arguments, which I made good out of the Word of God, and from ſound reaſon, as they that have read my booke with judgement, I am confident will acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Now heare how <hi>J. S.</hi> ſetteth them downe with his anſwer to them pag. the 8. and 9. of his booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Doctors firſt propoſition is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there were many Congregations and ſeverall aſſemblies in the Church of Jeruſalem &amp;c. for proofe whereof</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he bringeth the multitudes of Converts to</hi> Iohns Baptiſme; <hi>the people of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>all of them; and all</hi> Iudaea &amp;c. <hi>whereby</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all became Chriſtians, or members of the Chriſtian</hi> Church: <hi>for</hi> Iohns <hi>baptiſme was into Ieſus Chriſt, and the very ſame with that of the Apoſtles.</hi> Thus <hi>I. S.</hi> ſets downe my Arguments, which I affirme, is not candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done of him: for the ignorant Reader cannot ſee into the ſtrength of my arguments, they being delivered in ſuch obſcure tearmes, and ſet down alſo to the halves, the whole truth not being ſpecified. For not one of ten thouſand had ever ſeene or read my book, &amp; I dare ſay, not one of an hundred of the Independents had ever vouchſafed ſo much as to looke into it; for I was made ſo odious unto them by their blaſting language, as they abhorred my
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48122:109"/>
very name: with all howſoever they boaſted at the firſt coming of it out, that there were twenty pens at worke in anſwering of it, yet not one of them ever appeared, till three moneths after it was printed. Now all the Copyes that were printed were all gone in one weeke, ſo that the anſwers coming out ſo long after, and my arguments not being known to the people, and being in this obſcure manner and in ſuch darke expreſſions, and but to the halves ſet down, every vulgar underſtanding can never ſee into the weight and ſtrength of them, eſpecially, they having not my booke before them.</p>
               <p>And to ſay the truth, all the Independents ordinarily uſe this method in their pretended anſwers, as firſt, to let the bookes they reply unto be forgotten, and after that to blurte out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt them, concealing the truth, and then they crow out as victors and conquerers, that they have beate up our quarters and puld downe the pillars of our diſcourſe, as <hi>I S.</hi> doth vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this his Pamplet, when it will appeare to all intelligible men that he hath onely caſt a ſquib or two at them, and then as a meere freſh water Souldier ſpeedily ran away, and left that worke to others, as he unaduiſedly in the tenth page and in his wiſe Epiſtle confeſſeth, ſayning indiſpoſition of body, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it was his want of wit, learning, honeſty, and courage.</p>
               <p>As I haveſet downe the ſum of my Arguments, and compared his expreſſing of my meaning, with it; I will alſo ſet downe the ſumme of his anſwer to them, which he giveth in the name of all the Independents, ſaying, <hi>we anſwerd to your reaſon;</hi> and then ſet downe his own words in their full length, that all men may ſee my faire dealing with him. For <hi>I. S.</hi> doth not here deny my minor as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> did, or accuſe me of falſe Muſters as he vainely and impiouſly doth in his anſwer to my ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But plainly denieth <hi>that thoſe that were baptized by</hi> Iohn Baptiſt were Chriſtians, to whom my brother <hi>Burton</hi> aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, page 16. of his book ſaying <hi>that thoſe beleevers that were baptized by</hi> Iohn Baptiſt <hi>into Chriſt to come, according to the Papiſts doctrine, were not formed into a Chriſtian Church, or Churches, as after Chriſts reſurrection Chriſtians were.</hi> Theſe are my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> formall words, who not only aſſenteth to <hi>I. S.</hi> in this his opinion, but alſo bringeth in the authority of the Papiſts to confirme this their doctrine, and ſo in this the Independents
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48122:109"/>
agree with the Papiſts to overthrow the truth, and to maintain their abominable errors.</p>
               <p>And this I conceive, was the cauſe that moved my brother <hi>Burton</hi> in the ninth page of his booke in the beginning of his anſwer, to ſay, <hi>`as for your indefinite enumeration of thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes baptized by</hi> Iohn <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt <hi>and Chriſts Diſciples, we take no notice of them.</hi> This is his expreſſion there, concerning the which in due place. Surely if my brother <hi>Burton</hi> had thought them Chriſtians, he would have demeed them worthy to have been taken notice of: but in this he agreeth with <hi>I. S.</hi> and the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Now I will give you the ſumme of <hi>I. S.</hi> his Arguments, in way of anſwer, by which he denieth <hi>that thoſe that were baptized by</hi> Iohn <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt <hi>were Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is becauſe <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> they were baptiſed into Chriſt that was to dye, and not dead; therefore in his dialect they were no Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, they were not baptized with the holy Ghoſt and with fire; therefore thy were no Chrſtians.</p>
               <p>The third, they were no more Chriſtians then the Iewes that paſſed through the red Sea; but they were no Chriſtians; <hi>ergo</hi> they alſo that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were no Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The fourth, The baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> was not perfect, <hi>ergo</hi> thoſe that were baptiſed by him were no Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The fifth, thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> did not only haſitate, but were ſcandalized at the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and under the forme of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme did fight againſt the true baptiſme and baptiſer the Lord Jeſus: <hi>ergo</hi> they were no Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were not caſt into a Church mould, according to the New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>teſtament forme, neither were they members of one Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ergo they were not Chriſtians; and this Argument is brought in by way of a corallary.</p>
               <p>This muſt needs be the ſcope of his anſwer, or elſe he ſayth nothing to the purpoſe in denying my Arguments, which were not only to prove, <hi>that thoſe that were baptized by</hi> Iohn Baptiſt <hi>were Chriſtians and beleevers, but alſo that they were in ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes as they could not all poſſibly meete in any one place, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to communicate in all the Ordinances and all Acts of worſhip to edification.</hi> The dint and force of the which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48122:110"/>
he thinkes he ſufficiently evadeth, by denying that they were Chriſtians at all. So that if this Anſwer be well looked into and examined, it will appeare that whiles he boaſteth and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he hath beate up my quarters, he beates up Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> quarters, yea Chriſts quarters, and all his Diſciples quarters before Chriſts death and Aſcenſion, and all the quarters of all Chriſtians that now live in the world: For if none are well Baptiſed and made Chriſtians indeede, but ſuch as are Baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire, then all thoſe that were baptiſed before Chriſts Aſcenſion were no true Chriſtians, nor no Chriſtians in theſe our times, nor many Generations before us, who were not baptiſed by the Holy Ghoſt and with fire; and by theſe his fond cavills he overthroweth the Scripture it ſelf and all Divine and humane Authority, and gives the Spirit of God the lye.</p>
               <p>And truly ſuch a peece of impious ignorance with ſuch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent confidence my eyes yet never beheld before <hi>I. S.</hi> and his complices came into the World. So that it ſtranges me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly that ſuch men as he and they are, ſhould be ſuffered by thoſe of the Congregationall way to go unpuniſhed, who may ſhame them all, as indeed they are a ſhame to all Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For I appeale to the judgement of all ſuch as have any knowledge in Religion or love to the truth, or have any modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or good temper yet left in them, whether this be a thing tolerable in any that has the name of a Chriſtian, to play not only the juglers, to deceive and delude the poore people, but to give the Spirit of God the lye, and then to vapour and brag of it as of a conqueſt?</p>
               <p>But now I will ſet downe his Arguments in his owne words, and give my anſwer to them ſeverally. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>anſwer to your reaſons.</hi> So that he writes in the name of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as one of the Commanders and Captaines in their Militia, and as one of their Champions, and therefore in the name of them all, ſayeth, <hi>We anſwer to your reaſons.</hi> Now take notice what he anſwers in the name of the whole Fraternity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Iohns Baptiſme, was into Chriſt, but it was in Chriſtum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riturum, not in Chriſtum mortuum.</hi> This is <hi>J. S.</hi> his firſt anſwer. Truly one that ſhould but looke on all his Anſwers to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, would wonder what the man meant by them, and to what
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48122:110"/>
purpoſe he uttered theſe words: for they are a manifeſt fighting againſt the Scripture of truth; as all the judicious and learned will wel perceive. And I have heard both learned &amp; pious men ſay, <hi>that they did not beleeve, that I. S. did well underſtand himſelfe when he writ this book:</hi> and there is ſome reaſon of this their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for hee confeſſeth in his wiſe Epiſtle, that hee was in a courſe of Phyſick at the wels; &amp; who knowes but the man might then be ſomewhat diſtemperd in his braine, and ſo might doe the actions of a man craſed? and his very language doth in a manner ſpeake as much, both in this his Anſwer, and in many other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Book, as in their due places will appeare, yea the very title alſo, and his Epiſtle being ſenſeleſſe, calling his Pamphlet <hi>Flagellum flagelli, and the beating up of Doctor Baſtwicks quarters,</hi> when he never came nigh them, and the taking hold and ſhaking of the Pillars of his diſcourſe, when hee never ſo much as touched them, with many ſuch other expreſſions, all which have no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency amongſt themſelves, and ſhewes that the man is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a very ſtranger in Rhetorick, not knowing how to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his Metaphor, or elſe that hee is craſed indeed; and truly ſo every one will conceive, if they duly weigh and conſider all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in his booke; eſpecially this anſwer of his to my Arguments: by which hee labours to prove that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt were no Chriſtians, no Beleevers; which he doth by very ſenſeleſſe reaſons: the firſt of which I have related, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they were baptized into Chriſt to dye and not dead,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his opinion they were no Chriſtians. I omit his latine expreſſion, as thinking it a vaine thing in him to inſert latine ſentences writing in the vulgar tongue, eſpecially in handling points of divinity, &amp; thoſe of great concernment, which the people ſhould have ſet before them in perſpicuous and plaine termes.</p>
               <p>But now take notice how the man contradicteth himſelfe in his anſwer; for the drift of it is to prove, <hi>that thoſe that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Iohn the Baptiſt were no Chriſtians,</hi> and yet hee ſayeth, they were baptized into Chriſt. Then they were Chriſtians by his owne confeſſion, <hi>for Ieſus Chriſt was yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. and He was ever the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, <hi>the ſeed of the woman that ſhould breake the Serpents head, that Rocke upon which the Church was built, againſt which the gates of Hell ſhould never prevaile, Mat.</hi> 16. So that they that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48122:111"/>
into Ieſus Chriſt, whether whiles hee was living or dead, whether before his Nativity, death or aſcenſion, or after, are all good Chriſtians; therefore he contradicteth himſelfe in ſaying they were not Chriſtians; for it is not the circumſtance of time that makes an alteration in the ſubſtance and eſſence of any thing: for the Paſſeover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was the ſame for ſubſtance that it was in the Wilderneſſe, and in the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> for otherwiſe it ſhould follow that the Supper of the Lord celebrated by Chriſt himſelfe before his paſſion, and in memoriall of his death, ſhould not be the ſame with that it was after Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion; and that the Apoſtles that received the Lords Supper, were not Chriſtians then as well as after his death, which I thinke <hi>I. S.</hi> will not dare affirme; but if he ſhould, I am confident all the well grounded Chriſtians in the world would be his adverſaries in this; for the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25. makes them all one for ſubſtance; and as the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was the ſame for eſſence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts death that it was after, ſo was the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, to all that were baptized; and hee was as good a Chriſtian that was baptized in to Chriſt before his death, as hee that was baptized into him after his Aſcenſion, as all good reaſon will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade; for Chriſt was ever the Meſſiah and King of his Church; which will yet more evidently appeare, if wee compare earthly things with heavenly.</p>
               <p>I demand therefore of <hi>I. S.</hi> or any of the congregationall way, whether all ſuch ſubjects as take the oath of allegiance, or ſweare fealty to any King, who is owned by the people and whole Kingdome to be their lawfull King, as appointed and ſet over them of God, and is openly proclamed through the whoſe Realm to be their King, though at that time hee be in an other Countrey, and but now comming to take the poſſeſſion of his Kingdome, I ſay I demand whether ſuch ſubjects as take the oath of allegeance and ſware fealty unto him, before he comes and ſits viſibly upon his Throne, be not by this their oath become that Kings ſubjects, as truly and as really, as if the King were bodily preſent? I demand further, when hee is in perſon come into his Kingdome, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly amongſt them, ſaluted and entertained and owned by the people for their King, whether or no thoſe ſubjects that then take their oath of allegeance, and promiſe by that their oath their ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48122:111"/>
unto him, bee not as really and truly his ſubjects, as thoſe that after hee is inaugurated and gone into one of his other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, take then the oath of allegeance, and ſware ſubjection unto him in all his juſt commands? I am confident that all men that are but a little skilled in politicks, or any good learning, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that either of the former ſubjects, are as truly and really ſubjects unto him though they never ſaw him (as many hundred thouſands never did their Kings) as thoſe that tooke the oath when hee was gone in triumph into an other of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. And thus it was with thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, that great Officer of Chriſts kingdome, and the bleſſed Apoſtle, thoſe Stewards, Secretaries, privie Counſellors, &amp; Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of his Royaltie, who all baptized thoſe that came unto them into Ieſus Chriſt the King and Meſſiah, as well before his death as after, and all they owned him as well then for their King as after, crying Hoſanna thou ſonne of <hi>David,</hi> and ſtrowing their garments in the way, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in Heaven, and glory in the Higheſt, Luke</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and therefore it is a ſenſleſſe reaſon, yea contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory unto it ſelfe that <hi>I. S.</hi> bringeth, conſidering there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for the ſubſtance of the matter, though there be ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in reſpect of the circumſtance of time; and in this fond error of <hi>I. S.</hi> is my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and the Papiſts, who thinke there was a great difference between the Baptiſme before Chriſts death and that after his death, when indeed for ſubſtance there was none, no more then was betweene the Sacrament of the Lords Supper before Chriſts death and after. And therefore all thoſe that received either of thoſe Sacraments or both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his paſſion, were as good Chriſtians as thoſe that received them after; for hee was owned by them at that time to be the Lambe of God that was to take away the ſins of the world of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and to be the King of the Iews, the Saviour of his people, to be the anoynted Chriſt, &amp; they took the Sacraments upon it, which is as much as the oath of allegeance to any King, which were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make them as good Chriſtians as any that ſhould come after them, and therefore they that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt into Chriſt to dye, which <hi>I. S.</hi> doth acknowledge, they were all as good Chriſtians as any now baptized by the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and therefore that hee faith to the contrary and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48122:112"/>
to this truth is a meer babble and a contradiction of himſelfe. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke to his firſt anſwer to prove that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt were as good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as any other that were baptized after Chriſts death.</p>
               <p>His ſecond is as ſenſeleſſe, which is this. <hi>To ſay</hi> (ſaith he) that the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn was the ſame with Chriſts and the Apoſtles, is flat contrary to the aſſertion of</hi> Iohn <hi>himſelfe and the Apoſtles,</hi> Mat. 21. 25. Act. 18. 25. <hi>I baptize you with water</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but there comes one after me, who ſhall baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> Theſe are the words of his ſecond argument to prove that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt were no Chriſtians. In the entrance of this his anſwer he beats the ayre, and fights with his owne ſhadow and falſifies my words; for I never ſaid nor thought it, that the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> was the ſame with Chriſts; for the Scripture relateth <hi>that Chriſt baptized not at all, Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. I ſaid indeed, it was the ſame with the Apoſtles, and that is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt out of many places of the holy Scriptures, as out of the 3. of <hi>Luke, ver.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> the 1. <hi>v.</hi> 33. where <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelf ſpeaking ſaith, <hi>hee that ſent mee to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Yea one of thoſe places quoted by himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. ſufficiently declares that <hi>Iohn</hi> had his Commiſſion from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (whoſe Prophet he was) to baptize with water, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves before Chriſts death and Aſcention baptized but with water, and had no other Commiſſion but that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt had, and <hi>Iohn baptized with the Baptiſme of Repentance, ſaying unto the people, that they ſhould beleeve on him which ſhould come after him that is on Chriſt Ieſus, Act.</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Apoſtles Baptiſme before Chriſts death vvas no other but the Baptiſme of repentance and to beleeve in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea faith and repentance was the ſumme of all the Preaching, both of <hi>Iohn</hi> and of all the holy Apoſtles, both before Chriſts death and after, as wee may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Teſtifying both to the Iewes, and alſo to the Greeks, repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and faith towards our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Now when the Baptiſme of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Apoſtles, both before Chriſts death and after was all one for ſubſtance, and all into Chriſt, as wee may yet further ſee, <hi>Acts the</hi> 8. 16. where it is ſaid <hi>they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> It was no error in mee to ſay that the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> was into Chriſt Ieſus, and the very ſame with that of the Apoſtles, for the Holy Ghoſt which is the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48122:112"/>
ſpirit of truth hath ſo taught mee: and therefore all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt were as good Chriſtians and beleevers as thoſe that were baptized by the Apoſtles, <hi>if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and being baptized into him could make good Chriſtians; which were blaſphemy to gain-ſay, and nothing elſe but to give the ſpirit of God the lye: and therefore <hi>J. S.</hi> affirming that there was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> and that of the Apoſtles, and denying that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were Chriſtians, gives the ſpirit of God the lye: for the holy word of God which was penned by his ſpirit aſſerteth the contrary: And for that text that he citeth out of the third of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>I baptize you with water, but there comes one after me who ſhall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire;</hi> this is nothing to his purpoſe nor nothing againſt my opinion: For, as I ſaid before, it was never my beliefe that the baptiſme of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Iohns</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was all one, ſeeing Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> hath taught the contrary, as in the words alledged it is ſufficiently declared: But I demand of <hi>I. S.</hi> whether the Apoſtles, all whoſe names were written in heaven, were not as good Chriſtians and Beleevers in Jeſus <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, before they had received the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and were baptized with fire (which we read of <hi>Act.</hi> the 2.) as they were after the cloven tongues appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? <hi>ver.</hi> 3. If either he or any of his fraternity ſhall deny it, then they muſt deny the ſixteenth chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the ſixt of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> where we finde that honourable confeſſion of all the Apoſtles where they teſtifie their faith in Chriſt into whom they had been baptized before that, yea they muſt deny the whole Scriptures of the New Teſtament which affirme the contrary: And if the baptizing of any with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire be that thing onely that makes men Chriſtians and Beleevers, then none that were not ſo baptized were good chriſtians: for the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt as the diverſity of tongues and working of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, were not promiſcuous and given to all as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſufficiently declare, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 30. <hi>Have all the gifts of healing? Do all ſpeak with tongues?</hi> So that all the people were not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the Holy Ghoſt; and therefore by <hi>I. S.</hi> his learning were no chriſtians: Neither was that the worke of the Apoſtles, but it was Chriſts work onely who firſt breathed the ſpirit upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

and after his aſcen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore thoſe gifts made them not Chriſtians but declared them to be beleevers, and were the effects of their faith, which notwithſtanding were not conferred by the Apoſtles, but were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately given by the ſpirit of Chriſt: So that thoſe viſible gifts were not eſſentiall for the making of any Chriſtians and Beleevers; for they were alwayes Beleevers before they received them; and if thoſe gifts had been eſſentiall and abſolutely neceſſary for the making of any Chriſtians, then all that had received them ſhould have been ſaved, which they were not; beſides then, many hundred thouſands of the primitive Chriſtians ſhould not have been true Beleevers and Chriſtians indeed; for all men generally received them not (as I proved before) and all the Chriſtians, for ought I know, ſince the Primitive times, and all that now live ſhould be no good Chriſtians: for they were not and now are not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the holy Ghoſt &amp; with fire.

                  <hi>3.</hi> Therefore now, (ſaith <hi>I.

For they were baptized into Chriſt by their baptiſme, <hi>1 Cor. 10. 3.</hi> I deny not but this baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> was to prepare men for Chriſt, and did beare a more immediate relation to ſuch a worke, then any Ordinance before, but it did not make them abſolute Chriſtians. It did not abſolve and perfect the new Church, I mean not ſo far as that Ordinance of baptiſme was to do afterwards.</p>

Thus <hi>I. S.</hi> blaſphemeth rather then diſputeth: For that he ſaith is impious in the higheſt degree; for it is an apparent giving of the ſpirit of truth the lye, and a confuting of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and an oppoſing of the generality of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as every underſtanding man will eaſily gather: for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture everywhere and all the orthodox Divines, yea and all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents that ever I talked with or read of before <hi>I. S.</hi> and my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> acknowledge that thoſe that were baptized by the Baptiſt and Chriſts Diſciples before Chriſts death, were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Beleevers; for otherwiſe they could not have been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Notwithſtanding <hi>I. S.</hi> out of his learning denyeth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they were Chriſtians, but affirmeth alſo that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the red Sea were no Chriſtians; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore this be not to beat up the quarters of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, Chriſt</hi> himſelfe and the quarters of <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord, and of all the Independents, and to pull down the very pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the holy Scriptures; and be not a horrid blaſphemy in <hi>I. S.</hi> I leave to the judgement of the learned! Our ſaviour ſaith <hi>Luk.</hi> the 7. <hi>v.</hi> 29. 30. <hi>And all the people that heard him, &amp; the Publicans juſtified God, being baptized with the baptiſme of</hi> John, <hi>but the Phariſees and &amp; Lawyers rejected the Councel of God againſt themſelves being not baptized of him.</hi> Here we have <hi>Chriſts</hi> teſtimony, who aſſerteth that (the Lawyers and Phariſees only excepted) all that heard <hi>Iohn</hi> of which innumerable multitudes of them came from Jeruſalem, <hi>for all Ieruſalem went out to him, did juſtifie God and did not reject his Councell,</hi> that is to ſay, they were Believers; for the councel of God in the miniſtry of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> to all the people was, that they ſhould repent and believe in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and in token of their faith that they ſhould be baptized; now this ſweet councell for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of free grace and favour offered unto them by God, in the miniſtry of <hi>Iohn</hi> did the Phariſees and Lawyers reject to their own perdition; <hi>for they would not bring forth fruits meet for repentance,</hi> that is they would neither believe in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> nor repent nor be baptized; and therefore as a company of Infidels and unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers they deſpiſed the councell of God and his grace and favour; but all the other that heard <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith Chriſt, juſtified God, and did not reject his councell, that is, they acknowledged that God was juſt, faithfull, mercifull and gracious, and therefore beleeved his promiſes and repented and were baptized and were all as good
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48122:114"/>
Chriſtians and Beleevers as any were, if any credit may be given to Chriſts words. Whether therefore we ought rather to beleeve the words of Chriſt and his teſtimony or <hi>I. S.</hi> his language, I refer it to the judgement of the adviſed reader! Chriſt declareth they were Beleevers and Chriſtians, for they juſtified God and rejected not his councel, but imbraced his grace and favour and free mercy; <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaith the contrary. It is true that the name of Chriſtian, was not given to beleevers, till they were called ſo at <hi>Antioch,</hi> yet to beleeve, in Chriſt and to be baptized into Chriſt, made them as well Chriſtians before his ſuffering as after; for otherwiſe <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Moſes, Abraham, David</hi> and all thoſe Martyrs ſpoke of <hi>Hebrewes</hi> the eleventh, and all thoſe baptized by the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts death, ſhould not have bin Chriſtians, which were wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe to think, when the Scripture affirmeth that they not only lived by faith, but did all thoſe wonders by vertue of their faith in Chriſt, and that they all injoyed the promiſes; and therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow they were Chriſtians, as all beleeving in Chriſt and living and dying in that faith. So that howſoever they had not the name of chriſtians and were not ſo called which makes nothing againſt the reality of the thing, for we contend not about words, yet they were all true chriſtians, they being all built upon that Corner ſtone and upon the foundation Jeſus Chriſt, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing for the eſſence and ſubſtance or object of their faith from any that did ſucceed them in all ages to come.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> affirming that by the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> the beleevers then were not made Chriſtians, and that the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> Baptiſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the cloude were no Chriſtians, overthrowes the holy Scriptures and gives Chriſt the lye, and confutes <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf who in the 10. of the 1 of the <hi>Cor. ver.</hi> 1. 2. 3. <hi>affirmes, that our fathers were under the cloude, and all paſſed through the Sea and were all baptiſed by</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloude and in the Sea, and all eate the ſame ſpirituall meate, and did all drink the ſame ſpirituall drinke (for they all drank of the ſame ſpiritual Rock that followed them and that Rock was Chriſt)</hi> by the which teſtimony of the Apoſtle they were as good Chriſtians: as the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> for he comparing them together, ſheweth that they were equall to them in priviledges, and were as good Chriſtians as they, according to that of <hi>Peter Acts</hi> the 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. and put <hi>no difference</hi> between <hi>us and them purifying their hearts by faith;</hi> &amp; as he had proved that the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> were equall in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48122:114"/>
Priviledges with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and all other Chriſtians, ſo he declareth likewiſe if the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and all other Chriſtians did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt God as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, they ſhould likewiſe be equall to them in puniſhments: <hi>For God was no respector of perſons,</hi> but as inevery <hi>nation he that feareth God &amp; worketh righteouſneſſe is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, Acts</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 35: ſo whatſoever Chriſtians, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ever, whether <hi>Iewer</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall offend as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, they ſhall be equally puniſhed. So that by the witneſſe and teſtimony of <hi>Paul</hi> in this tenth chapter of the 1 of the <hi>Cor.</hi> and the 11. of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and from the above cited Scriptures all our fathers under the cloude and all the Patriarkes, and all thoſe Martyrs, and all thoſe that were baptiſed by the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſt Diſciples, were all as good Chriſtians as any Baptized after Chriſts death or now by thoſe of the Congregationall way or any Chriſtians in the world; and all that I here ſay is moſt true if any beliefe may be given to the holy Word of God. And therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> affirming the contrary blaſphemeth. And now I come to his fourth Argument. Which is this.</p>
               <p>The learned and judicious know <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> was but the Meſſenger before Chriſt <hi>Mal. 3. ver. 1.</hi> And his baptiſme was but as the ſtreaming of light in the Heavens before the day, and he did only bring and reſtore all things to their legall perfection by water, the element of the law; but Chriſt Ieſus he comes and Baptizes with fire, conſummats all things with this transforming powerfull element, even his ſpirit, <hi>Thus</hi> I. S. <hi>ſpeaketh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To examine all the errors in theſe words, would take up much time, and require a large diſcourſe, but I ſtudy brevity. As for the firſt part of this his anſwer, where he ſaith, <hi>the learned and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious know, that</hi> Iohn <hi>was but the Meſſenger before Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> it is a peece of vanity in him to produce the teſtimony of men to prove that <hi>Iohn</hi> was a Meſſenger of Chriſt, when the holy Scripture in many places aſſertsit, and when Chriſt himſelf hath declared that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was that <hi>Elias</hi> that was foretold ſhould prepare the way before the Lord and make his pathes ſtraight: but this I may truly ſay of <hi>I. S.</hi> that he is a meere ſtranger in all good learning and as ignorant in all Divinity and in the holy Word of God, as thoſe judicious he ſpeakes of, were ſingularly excellent and mighty in the Scriptures and all ſound theologie, whoſe works and godly ſolid writings, if ever he had read with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48122:115"/>
he could never have bin ſo prodigiouſly blaſphemous as he is in all his diſcourſe and chiefly in theſe his anſwers: for there is not any one of them in which there is not great impiety to be diſcovered: as in this to accuſe <hi>Iohns Baptiſme</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of imperfection, and to ſay they were but as the ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingsoflight in the Heavens before the day, when notwithſtanding Chriſt himſelf hath often given ſo many honourable teſtimonies of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his Miniſtry, ſaying in the 5. of <hi>Iohn</hi> 32. <hi>that he bare witneſſe of him, and that his witneſſe was true, and</hi> in the 35. ver. in expreſſe words affirming <hi>that he was a burning and ſhining light,</hi> and that the <hi>Iews</hi> for a ſeaſon did rejoyce in his light. And yet <hi>I. S.</hi> boldly and peremptorily affirmeth that the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> was but as the ſtreamings of light, and that they were not conſummate Chriſtians that were baptiſed by him. Who ſhall we beleeve? <hi>I. S.</hi> or Ieſus Chriſt? Chriſt ſaith Iohn <hi>was a burning and ſhining light. I. S.</hi> ſayeth he was but as the ſtreaming of light; if this be not to give Chriſt the lye, I know not what it is! Chriſt in the ſeventh chapter of <hi>Luke</hi> and the 28. <hi>verſe,</hi> ſayth, That <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt was the greateſt Prophet that was ever borne of women.</hi> Then, he was inferior in his Miniſtry to none of them, no not to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, of whom the author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> chap. 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. ſaith with <hi>a verily,</hi> that <hi>he was faithfull in all the houſe of God as a ſervant for a teſtimony of thoſe things that were to be ſpoken after.</hi> Now if <hi>Moſes</hi> did his worke perfectly, as he did, and baptized thoſe perfectly in the Cloude and in the ſea as <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerteth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and did all he did in perfection and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the paterne ſhewed him in the Mount and according to the will of God, and did perfectly conſummate his Miniſtry, then <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> alſo did the like, <hi>for Chriſt</hi> ſaith that amongſt thoſe that <hi>are borne of women, there is not a greater Prophet then</hi> Iohn <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt: <hi>that is there</hi> was not one more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and that did his worke more compleatly and with more perfection: which Chriſts owne words in the third of <hi>Matthew</hi> do yet more fully declare verſ. 15. <hi>ſaying ſuffer it</hi> to be ſo now: <hi>for thus it becommeth us to fulfill all righteouſneſſe.</hi> Now if the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did fulfill all righteouſneſſe in his Miniſtry, then he did it compleatly and made thoſe that were baptized by him perfect, compleat and conſummated Chriſtians; for he in his Office, <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſſe;</hi> if therefore there were any imperfection
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48122:115"/>
(as <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaith) in the Baptiſme and Miniſtry of <hi>Iohn,</hi> then he did not fulfill all righteouſneſſe, and then Chriſts words ſhould not be true, which is a high point of blaſphemy to thinke, much more to ſay and print as <hi>I. S.</hi> doth: <hi>for he that</hi> fulfills <hi>all</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe <hi>in his Office doth it perfectly and compleatly, but</hi> Iohn <hi>did ſo:</hi> ergo <hi>all thoſe that he baptized were compleat Chriſtians.</hi> I demand therefore of <hi>I. S.</hi> my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, whether Chriſt was well baptized, or no by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt?</hi> I preſum they will not deny but that he was perfectly baptized. And if Chriſt himſelfe was well baptized, then all that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> were alſo well baptized and were perfect and compleat Chriſtians, for <hi>John</hi> was ſent of God to baptize; and he obeyed Gods command in this his Miniſtry, and in that alſo fulfilled all righteouſneſſe, and therefore all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; by the Apoſtles before Chriſts death and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were as perfect Chriſtians as any that were baptized after Chriſts reſurrection; and if they were not well baptized then Chriſt was not well baptized, which were high impiety to affirme; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I ever be induced to beleeve, that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> did not know as well how to make compleat Chriſtians, as <hi>I. S.</hi> or as any of the Independent Miniſters; for I know <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſent of God for this worke, and that he fulfilled all righteouſneſſe in it, and I know alſo that he was faithfull in his Miniſtry to the death, and feared not the face of <hi>Herod</hi> nor of any Mortall creature: for all this the Scripture aſcertanieth unto me; but that our Independent Miniſters were ever ſent of God, and bid to ſet up their new lights and to preach, up their congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall way or a toleration of all Religions, I doubt it. For firſt I know that they ranne back-ward, and forward, to and fro, before they were ever ſent, and that they preach that they were never commanded from God, and that when they ſhould have preached andſtood to witnes the truth, many of them ran away and deſerted it and did not ſtand to it as <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> did, but like thoſe hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Chriſt ſpeaks of, <hi>Iohn</hi> the tenth, when they ſaw the Wolfe comming, cowardly ranne away, and left their poore flocks to the fury of thoſe beaſts and many of them now have left their flocks in the wilderneſſe and have deſerted their charges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the command of God <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. who ſaith by the Apoſtle <hi>Take heede therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48122:116"/>
                  <hi>flocke, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you Biſhops, to feeds the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud.</hi> In all theſe reſpects, and many more that I could name, I greatly doubt whether the Independent Miniſters were ever ſent of God: but for <hi>Iohn,</hi> I know he was, and I know in like manner that he fulfilled all righteouſneſſe in his Miniſtery, and made thoſe he Baptized perfect Chriſtian; I know likewiſe that he made innumerable multitudes of them, and that Jeruſalem came out and was Baptized alſo, which when <hi>I. S.</hi> denyeth I aſſert he is a wicked and blaſphemous fellow, and that if he had his due deſerts, he ought to be ſpued not only out of their ſeven new churches here in <hi>London,</hi> but out of all their ſeverall new fangled congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations through the Kingdome as an Alien and ſtranger from the common-wealth of all learning and goodneſſe. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke to the fourth learned anſwer. I now come to the fifth as good as the reſt; his words are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So farre was it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all that were Baptized by</hi> Iohn, <hi>were made Chriſtians, that even</hi> Iohns <hi>owne Diſciples (who had the beſt and frequenteſt inſtruction) not onely heſitated, but were right downe ſcandalized at the true Meſſias</hi> Iohn 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>and others did under the forme of</hi> Iohns <hi>baptiſme, fight againſt the true baptiſme and baptizer the Lord Ieſus. So that I conceive</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this Argument (were it granted that all the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> Iohns <hi>baptiſme) will ſtand in little ſteade to prove the concluſion,</hi> viz: <hi>that they were made Chriſtians, much leſſe cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church mould, according to the New Teſtament forme, and leaſt of all that they were all members of one Chriſtian Church at Ieruſalem.</hi> Theſe are his formall expreſſions, by which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to prove, that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> were no Chriſtians; in theſe his words there is a double Argument by which he indeavours to unchriſtian all thoſe that were Baptiſed by the Baptiſt. The firſt is, becauſe as he falſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth they were enimies of Chriſt. The ſecond is in that they were not rightly moulded. So that in this his laſt Paragraffe or Section, we have two Arguments together. Which being added to the former make up ſix in all, by which the profound diſputant <hi>J. S.</hi> unchurches and unchriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns all thoſe that were baptiſed by <hi>John.</hi> Now becauſe <hi>I. S.</hi> and his complices do place ſo much ſtrength in theſe two laſt Arguments, I ſhall deſire the reader the more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48122:116"/>
ſeriouſly to weigh and conſider them with the concluſions deduced from them by <hi>I. S.</hi> and my reply to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt whereas hee denieth that all that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were made Chriſtians, as it is a begging of the queſtion, ſo in his thus ſpeaking hee overthrows the whole Miniſtry of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and contradicts the Holy Scriptures, and all thoſe places I quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of them in my former reply; and which is more, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth himſelfe: for hee confeſſeth that <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptized in to Chriſt, and he baptized none, as all the Independents acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but beleevers; therefore they were Chriſtians by his owne confeſſion; and yet here as often formerly he denieth they were Chriſtians. But becauſe I have ſpoke of this before, I will now come to his reaſons. His firſt reaſon, to prove they were not Chriſtians, is, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>Iohns owne Diſciples</hi> (who had <hi>the beſt and frequenteſt inſtruction) not only heſitated,</hi> that is doubted, <hi>but were right downe ſcandalized at the Meſſiah.</hi> The ſecond is becauſe <hi>others did under the forme of</hi> Iohns <hi>Baptiſme, fight againſt the true baptiſme and the Baptizer the Lord Ieſus.</hi> Theſe his reaſons, I affirme, are nothing elſe but a meer calumny, and a falſe accuſation, and to ſpeake the truth, are but his owne wicked and groundleſſe ſurmiſes; and if every man, from his owne fictious and fond conceits, and ſuppoſed premiſes, may take the liberty thus to vent himſelfe, I know no truth in the whole word of God, but may be called in queſtion, yea overthrown and I know no Chriſtians nor Saints but may at any time be unſainted and unchriſtianed. Our Saviour Chriſt in the 7. of <hi>Luke, verſ.</hi> 32, 33, 34. compareth thoſe of his time, <hi>unto little children ſitting in the market place, and calling one to another, and ſaying; wee have piped unto you, and you have not danced; wee have mourned unto you, and ye have not wept; for</hi> Iohn <hi>the Baptiſt came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye ſay he hath a Devill. The Sonne of man is come eating and drinking, and ye ſay, behold a glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous man, and a wine Bibber, afriend of Publicans and Sinners. But wiſedome is juſtified of all her children.</hi> By which words of our Saviour wee ſee nothing could pleaſe the Gentlemen of his time.</p>
               <p>Now if ever there were an age in the world, or company of men in it, that might be compared to theſe little children, then this of ours, and the people in it, eſpecially the Independents may
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48122:117"/>
be, who are pleaſed with nothing, and can leaſt of all indure any Vniformity in the Church, againſt which they profeſſedly both write and preach, and as thoſe in our Saviours dayes did ſpeake againſt the Miniſtry of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and againſt Chriſt himſelf; ſo at this very day amongſt us, there are many that make nothing of the Miniſtry of <hi>Iohn,</hi> profeſſing they take no notice of thoſe that were baptized by him or Chriſts diſciples, and <hi>I. S.</hi> peremptorily affirmeth, that thoſe that were baptized by him were no Chriſtians, and that his Miniſtry was imperfect; and therefore I conceive all men will judge, that the Independents may well be compared to thoſe of Chriſts time, who unchurch all but themſelves. But ſaith <hi>I. S.</hi> they were <hi>Iohns</hi> owne Diſciples that both doubted and heſitated, and were right downe ſcandalized at the true Meſſias, and for proofe of this his ſaying hee produceth the 3. of <hi>Iohn, verſ.</hi> 26. I will therefore ſet downe the words of the text with the forgoing verſe, which will give ſome light to the buſines in hand, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. <hi>Then there aroſe</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt) <hi>a queſtion betweene ſome of</hi> Iohns <hi>diſciples and the Iewes about purifying, and they came unto</hi> Iohn <hi>and ſaid unto him,</hi> Rabbi, <hi>hee that was with thee beyond Iordan, to whom thou bareſt witneſſe, behold the ſame baptizeth and all men come to him.</hi> Theſe are the words out of which <hi>I. S.</hi> grounds all his accuſation againſt <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples, by which hee would prove them no Chriſtians. But if men would but duly weigh and examine the text, they will eaſily perceive, there is not ſo much as a very ſimilitude of the illation and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <hi>I. S.</hi> inferres from thence. For firſt the queſtion there ſtarted, was not betweene <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples and Chriſts, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Diſciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Jewes, that is betweene the Scribes and Phariſees and <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples, who were enemies of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt as well as of Chriſt, and therefore queſtioned all they did, ever and anon asking <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſt by what authority they preached and did thoſe things they did. And ſo here the Jewes, they queſtioned with <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples concerning his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, (as by all conjecture it may be gathered) &amp; about legall puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, of which they were very ſtudious and great obſervers, to which the Phariſees had added many of their ovvne, as wee may ſee, <hi>Matth,</hi> the 15. and <hi>Marke</hi> the 7. and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples about purifying, ſuppoſing, that there was no need of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme and waſhing, ſeeing they had ſo

much rinſing and purifying already amongſt them. So that it ſeemes the contention betweene the Jewes and <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples aroſe upon this, that <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples much magnified the Baptiſme of their Maſter, and the Jewes and Phariſees, they extolled as much their Purifications, thinking them neceſſary to ſalvation, which error of the Jewes, notwithſtanding, had often by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets beene confuted, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. and many other places. Now <hi>Iohn,</hi> that hee might revoke all men from this error, that they ſhould not reſt in corporall vvaſhings and in outvvard perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, exhorts them to looke unto Chriſt, vvho vvas the truth of which all thoſe ceremonies were but the ſhadowes and were all fulfilled in him, and therefore that they ſhould by faith wholy rely upon him for ſalvation as the ſequell of the chapter doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhew. Now in the heate of this diſpute, the Evangeliſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth in the 26. <hi>verſe,</hi> that <hi>they came unto</hi> Iohn, <hi>and ſaid unto him, Rabbi, hee that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou beareſt witneſſe, behold the ſame baptizeth, and all men come to him.</hi> Out of which words I ſee no reaſon why <hi>I.

               <p>But firſt, it is not ſaid that <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples came unto him, onely it is related that ſome came unto <hi>Iohn, they came unto him ſaith the Scripture:</hi> which they, it is not ſpecified; for <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples and the Jewes contended, and the Jewes are put in the laſt place, ſo that it may be gathered that they were the Jewes, rather then <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples that came unto him, as being laſt ſpoken of &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: and if they were the Jewes, then they vvere the knovvn and profeſt enemies, both of <hi>Iohn</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore were none of <hi>Iohns Diſoiples,</hi> as <hi>I.

doubted or were ſcandalized at the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as <hi>I. S.</hi> vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impiouſly concludes. For if any ſhould hear ſome one of the Independent miniſters greatly magnifie one of his brethren and fellow miniſters, as to be a man ſent from heaven, and ſhould ſay of him, <hi>That he was the rareſt preacher one of them in the world,</hi> as they do mightily extoll one another: and upon the praiſes and commendations of this man many thouſands of people ſhould by and by flock after him, whereſoever they ſhould hear he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: and ſome one or more of his followers ſhould come unto this miniſter that ſo prayſed him and ſay, <hi>Sir, ſuch a man who you ſo commended in ſuch a place, behold he now preacheth and all men come to him and follow his miniſtry!</hi> would ſuch a relation I pray, as this made unto him that had formerly praiſed that miniſter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that thoſe that told him of ſuch concourſes of people as ran af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him not only heſitated but wer right down ſcandalized at him?

For the Scripture relateth every where that there was fairer agreement, and much love and amity between <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples and <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and that they knew one another very well and deſired to imitate one another: ſo that they did not envy one anothers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters proſperity, nor doubted not of one anothers maſters mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, nor were ſcandalized one at anothers maſters happineſſe: And there is very good reaſon for it: For they all knew that <hi>John</hi> had ſo honourable an eſteem of <hi>Chriſt, as he thought himſelf not worthy to carry his ſhooes</hi> Mat. 3. 11. they knew alſo how highly <hi>Chriſt</hi> had often magnified <hi>Iohn, proclaiming him to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt prophet that ever was borne of women, and how that Chriſt had commanded</hi> John <hi>to baptize himſelfe,</hi> ſo much he honoured his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. They by their experience likewiſe knew that their was great correſpondency &amp; continued amity between their maſters, and that they juſtified each others miniſtry and that before all the people, <hi>John</hi> teaching the people, <hi>That he was the Meſſiah and the Lambe of God, that was to take away the ſins of the world;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon all occaſions making mention of <hi>John</hi> with great prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſaying, <hi>That his miniſtry was from heaven and that he was his meſſenger to prepare his way before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that I ſay in all theſe reſpects and many more that might be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48122:118"/>
ſpecified it followeth that <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples neither heſitated nor were ſcandalized at the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as <hi>I. S.</hi> grolliſhly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly inferreth.

               </p>
               <p>Again, in the 1. of <hi>Iohn</hi> it is related there, <hi>that</hi> Iohn <hi>openly among all the people proclaimed Chriſt to be the Lambe of God, and ſayeth that hee knew him ſo to be, by the diſcending of the ſpirit from Heaven upon him,</hi> becauſe, <hi>that God that ſent him to baptize with water, ſaid unto him, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit diſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is hee which baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt, and I ſaw</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and bare record that this is the Sonne of God.</hi> And all this was ſpoke in the hearing of <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, ſo that they could not doubt now of the Meſsias, or be ſcandalized at him, for then they ſhould have beene very untaught Schollers, which the words following, <hi>verſe</hi> 33. ſhevves they vvere not: for two of <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples at that time hearing their Maſter ſpeake theſe vvords, beleeved and follovved <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and inquired vvhere he dvvelt, vvho inviting them to <hi>come and ſee, went with him to his aboad and tarried with him that night;</hi> and the ſtory and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe follovving ſhevves that they vvere ſo confirmed in their faith, and were ſo far from doubting and being ſcandalized at the <hi>Meſſiah, as they likewiſe preached him and gained Diſciples to him.</hi> And the ſame we may ſay of all <hi>Iohns</hi> other Diſciples that they honoured <hi>Chriſt</hi> very much and predicated his fame unto their maſter upon all occaſions as in the 7. of <hi>Luke</hi> when the rumour of <hi>Chriſt</hi> miracles was ſpred abroad, <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples were alwayes wont to relate it unto their maſter. Whereupon <hi>Iohn</hi> at one time calling unto him two of his Diſciples, <hi>ſent them unto</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſaying, art thou he that ſhall come or looke we for another?</hi> which meſſage was not ſent by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that either he or his Diſciples doubted or heſitated or were ſcandalized at the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but that they all alſo might be as well eye witneſſes of his miracles as others, and might ſay another day that they had not onely heard of his fame, but that they themſelves had ſeen his wondrous works: For <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:48122:119"/>
deſired by all manner of wayes hee could, to publiſh the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Meſſias, and knew that the more witneſſes Chriſt had, and them of knowledge of reputation, the more their report and preaching of him would be credited, eſpecially when they themſelves could ſay, that they had ſeene him working miracles, and that Chriſt bade them goe and <hi>tell</hi> Iohn <hi>what things they had ſeene and heard, how that the blind ſee, and the lame walke, and the Lepers are clenſed, the deafe heare, the dead are raiſed, and the poor receive the Goſpel:</hi> and for this very end did <hi>Iohn</hi> ſend two of his Diſciples to Chriſt, not that either he or they doubted whether he was the Meſſias or no, but that they might be eye witneſſes and relate theſe things with the more confidence both unto the people, and to thoſe that ſhould be pen men of the Holy Scriptures, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the 1 chapter <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye witneſſes and Miniſters of the Word:</hi> according to that of Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> the 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>Wherefore of theſe men which have companied with us, all the time that the Lord Ieſus went in and out amongſt us, beginning from the baptiſme of</hi> Iohn <hi>unto the ſame day hee was taken up from us, muſt one be ordained to be a witneſſe with us of his reſurrection.</hi> So that it may well be gathered, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt had a ſpeciall eye to the future, and deſired not only in his owne perſon to preach up Chriſts Kingdome, but that his Diſciples after him might relate to their Auditors and to the holy pen-men what they had both heard with their owne eares, and ſeene with their own eyes, and ſo might the better witneſſe unto Chriſt: neither will any man deny but that <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples, might alſo be much ſtrengthned in their faith in beholding thoſe wonderful miracles of Chriſt, though they no way doubted or heſitated or were ſcandalized at the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asbefore, no more then the people in <hi>Samaria</hi> doubted concerning him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. after the woman had ſaid to the men of that Citie, <hi>Come ſee a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Chriſt? then it is ſaid, they went out and came unto him, and many of them beleeved for the ſaying of the woman which teſtified hee told mee all that ever J did; but many more beleeved becauſe of his owne word, and ſaid unto the woman, now wee beleeve, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy ſaying, but becauſe wee have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt the Saviour of the world.</hi> The Scripture ſaith they beleeved before upon the womans relation,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48122:119"/>
but wee now coroborated in their faith, and ſo it was with <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples and followers. But ſhall there be any therefore from that bee ſo ſtupid as to thinke that any of <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples that had the beſt and frequenteſt inſtruction concerning the Meſſias, could either doubt or be ſcandalized at him, becauſe the people followed Chriſt, and <hi>John</hi> ſent his Diſciples to him? No ſurely, none would ſo conclude but <hi>I. S.</hi> and his Fraternity. Much leſſe would they ſay, that others did under the forme of <hi>Iohns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, fight againſt the true Baptiſme and Baptizer the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; which is <hi>I. S.</hi> his ſecond reaſon, or rather folly and madneſſe; and upon this their wicked conceit and groundleſſe opinion inferre that they were no Chriſtians as <hi>I. S.</hi> doth. For there is not any one word in all the Holy Scripture, that does relate that any that were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> did under the forme of that Baptiſme, fight againſt the true Baptiſme and Baptizer the Lord Jeſus: what a wicked and abominable Fellow then is this <hi>I. S.</hi> that dares thus at pleaſure traduce the generation of the juſt, and falſely accuſe all <hi>Iohns</hi> owne Diſciples, and all thoſe that were baptized by him to be enemies of Jeſus Chriſt the Meſſias? and upon this bare opinion of his to unchriſtian them all? it may now be no wonder to any good Chriſtian that the whole rout of the Independents unchurch us, and make no Chriſtians of us, and aſperſe and ſpeak all manner of evill of us at pleaſure, calling us the profeſt enemies of Jeſus Chriſt &amp; his Kingdom ſeeing upon all occaſions they doe the ſame to all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples all which <hi>I. S.</hi> proclaims to be no Chriſtians, as his words doe ſufficiently ſpeak. But from the teſtimony that he produceth to prove that <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples were ſcandalized at Chriſt: I gather the contrary for the reaſons above ſpecified, and conclude with al, that there were innumerable multitudes daily converted by Chriſts and <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtry, &amp; were all made good Chriſtians; for it is ſaid in the chapter quoted by him, that all men came to him, &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> and they were all baptized; ſo that not a few congregations could contain all them that came from <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> for all Jeruſalem came out to <hi>John</hi> and our Saviour ſent this meſſage unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 7. of <hi>Luke</hi> as one of the miracles he wrought, <hi>that the poor received the Goſpel,</hi> that is, not onely the poore in ſpirit, but the multitudes of people that were poore and indigent in reſpect of theſe outward things and wanted thoſe riches that others abounded with, and he affirmes of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48122:120"/>
theſe <hi>that they received the Goſpell and imbraced the free grace and favour of God,</hi> and that they were the Phariſees and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers only <hi>that reiected the counſell of God againſt themſelves; but for all the poore</hi> ſaith he <hi>and all others that heard</hi> Iohn, <hi>they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Goſpel, and were Goſpel Chriſtians and ſuch as believed aright and as they ought to beleeve,</hi> and therefore if the teſtimony of Chriſt may be credited, they were caſt into a Church mould, according to the New Teſtament forme and were very good Chriſtians, and that in mighty multitudes; <hi>for all</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and the poore received the Goſpel,</hi> and therefore <hi>they could not meet in one and a few congregations together at any one time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>I S.</hi> ſo peremptorily affirmes, <hi>that were it granted, that all the people received</hi> Iohns <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> yet it <hi>would ſtand me in little ſtead to prove the concluſion:</hi> viz <hi>that they were made Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> Theſe are his words, adding with all, <hi>much</hi> leſſe, <hi>that they were caſt into a Church mould according to the New Teſtament forme, and leſt of all that they were all members of one Christian Church at Ieruſalem,</hi> which is one of their chiefe Arguments by which <hi>I. S.</hi> &amp; they of his fraternity uphold their opinion of Independency, and by which they unchurch all other churches but their own at this day. I ſay in all theſe regards I will ſpend the more time about this argument, the which howſoever it be brought in by <hi>I. S.</hi> but as as a corallary, yet it may ſtand for his ſixth Argument and the beſt in the bunch, to maintaine and uphold there with their way of Independency, therefore I will firſt put his words into a Syllogiſticall frame, then conſider the waight of the reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All ſuch as were not caſt into a Church mould according to the New teſtament forme, and leſt of all were members of one, Chriſtian church in Ieruſalem, they were not made Chriſtians: but all they of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem that went out to</hi> Iohns <hi>baptiſme and were baptized by him, were ſuch as were not caſt into a Church mould according to the New teſtament forme; leaſt of all, were they members of one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church in Ieruſalem;</hi> ergo <hi>they were not made Chriſtians.</hi> This is <hi>I. S.</hi> his Argument which he ſets downe by way of a corallary; the <hi>Minor</hi> of which I deny, affirming they were caſt into a church mould as the ſequell wlil ſhew. But becauſe by this Argument, the Independents do not only unchurch and unchriſtian all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> but indeed unchurch and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48122:120"/>
unchriſtian all the Proteſtant Churches through the world and all other churches but their owne; I ſhall be ſomething the larger in examining it with the ſeverall termes and expreſſions of the ſame, and then ſhew and diſcover the futility and vanity of it, by which I am confident the errors of their wayes will the better appeare; for by that it will be manifeſt, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent doctrine is but an old peece of Popery in new clothes: though varniſhed over with fine colours, that it may come forth into the world more lovely and leſſe ſuſpected, and it is as little prevalent to maintaine their cauſe as the Papiſts is to uphold their Babell.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts and the Independents here agree in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They both deny, that thoſe beleevers that were baptized by</hi> Iohn <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt <hi>into Chriſt to come, were formed into a Chriſtian church or churches;</hi> for we have <hi>I. S.</hi> his formall words in this his anſwer in the name of all the Independents confidently <hi>denying that they were made Chriſtians;</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> in expreſſe termes page 9. of his booke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth unto him, ſaying in the name of all his brethren, we take <hi>no notice of them as formed into a church or churches,</hi> and pag. 16. of his booke he produceth the Papiſts doctrine to prove this their opinion to be legitimate: So that in this point of their beliefe the Papiſts and the Independents agree againſt all the current and the whole Schooles of all the moſt Orthodoxe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines who hold they were Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they agree in this alſo <hi>that both of them hold that the forme of a church muſt ever be viſible and apparent:</hi> So that were their never ſo many Aſſemblies of Chriſtians in a city or country, and all beleevers, if they be not caſt into ſuch and ſuch a mold and forme, then theyare not churches properly ſo called, but in their dialect they are either Heritickes or no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but proclaimed enemies of Ieſus Chriſt and his Kingdom. So that according to the Papiſts doctrine, <hi>all thoſe Chriſtians that are not within the limits, compaſſe and bounds that they have circumſcribed their church with, and are not under that viſible forme of government they have appointed; they accompt them all Heritickes and no churches:</hi> as all men know. And in the ſame manner, do the Independents unchurch all churches in the world
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48122:121"/>
but ſuch as in their opinion are caſt into a church mould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the New Teſtament forme, and have their diſtinct Officers and Members, united into one body reſpectively. That is to ſay, ſpeaking in their owne language, all ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and aſſembles, as are fluid and are not joyned and united together by an explcite particular Covenant &amp; fixed in their officers and Members &amp; having a Presbytery of their own, with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Soverainty and power within themſelves Independent, they are no churches, and all thoſe Chriſtians that are not within the compaſſe and limits of this their new mould or modell, <hi>they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them enemies of Ieſus Chriſt and his kingdome, and accompte of them as a company of infidels and affirme that they are no true churches, nor churches properly ſo called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we ſee, that both the Papiſts and Independents agree in this, that they bound and limit all churches to ſuch and ſuch an externall forme; ſo that whereſoever that is wanting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their dialect, though otherwiſe they have the preaching of the Goſpel, the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments and the true invocation of God; they are no churches properly ſo called. And both of them farther accorde and agree in this, that the forme of their churches conſiſts in the diſtinction of their Officers and members and the uniting of them into one body reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they muſt not be fluid as they ſpeake, but they muſt be fixed in their Officers and Members, and having a Presbytery of their owne, with abſolute ſoverainty and juriſdiction within themſelves Independent. But in this the Papiſts deale far more honeſtly then the Independents: for they have in many large volumes fully ſet downe the modell of their government, and what it is, and ſhew how they are fixed in their Officers and Members; and for their chiefe Officers, they ſay they are the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery at Rome,</hi> the <hi>Cardinals, Patriarchs, Primates, Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, Archbiſhops</hi> &amp;c. and we know where to finde them, and what their modell and government is to a hare: But what the Independents modell is or will be, no man could yet ever learne but by conjecture: which I muſt confeſſe ſeemes a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing to me, that they ſhould thus at pleaſure unchurch and unchriſtian all churches and Chriſtians as not formed into a church mould after the New Teſtament forme, and yet never declare what that forme and mold is. And yet this is, their daily wicked practice.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48122:121"/>
So that all men may ſee, if they will not put out their eyes, that in this and many other of their tenents and opinions the Independents are but a company of Mungrell Papiſts, and would have all men belieeve with an implicit faith <hi>as their Churches believe,</hi> and take all they ſpeake as Oracles, though it be never ſo groundleſſe. But we have learned Chriſt better then ſo, who is the <hi>Prophet and King of his Church and who hath commanded us to heare him Matth.</hi> 17. <hi>and to obey his voyce</hi> Iohn 10. and <hi>not to give eare unto ſtrangers.</hi> And from his bleſſed Word we have learned theſe two leſſons, the firſt that whereſoever the Goſpel of the Kingdome of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is faithfully and truly Preached by Miniſters ſent by him, and where this Everlaſting Goſpell is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and believed and yeelded obedience unto by the people, and where there is the right Adminiſtration of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the true invocation of God, they are a true church or churches, although they be fluid, and be not fixed in their Officers and members, and have not that externall forme either the Papiſts or the Independents ſpeake of; and for this our faith, we have warrant from Gods holy Word. Secondly we are taught out of the holy Scriptures, alſo that there may be a true church or churhes in many nations and kingdomes where they injoy not all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in a publicke manner: nor where their very meetings together are not allowed unto them by authority; for all ſuch as confine a church or churches to theſe externall formes they ſpeak of, they confound the eſſence and ſubſtance of a church with the adjuncts and Accideuts of it; whereas churches may be true churches, and yet want the externall forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as may by innumerable places of holy Scripture be proved: as for inſtances. In <hi>Iſrael</hi> where God had ſet up his owne worſhip and eſtabliſhed a forme of Government, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it ſhould punctually be obſerved, yet we read in the 2 of the <hi>Chron. chap.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> the 3. theſe words: <hi>Now for a long ſeaſon</hi> Iſrael <hi>was without the true God, and without a teaching Prieſt, and without law.</hi> So that from this place we may gather, that their did not then appeare any externall forme of a church, no not in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the true God was not publickly known amongſt them, and yet notwithſtanding God had there his true church amongſt them, yea in the greateſt height of Idolatry when all the Prophets were perſecuted and lay hid in Caves,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48122:122"/>
yet at that time alſo, <hi>God had ſeven thouſand that never bowed knee to Baal;</hi> So that it is evident that it is not the externall forme that is abſolutely required for the making of a true church, but it may be a true church without that externall appearance they ſpeak of: For a church is one thing, and the outward forme and diſcipline is another.</p>
               <p>And truly if a man will not ſuffer himſelfe willingly to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with appearances and naked ſhaddowes for the truth it ſelfe, and will but conſider the great variety and change of the church in reſpect of the outward alteration of the government of it in all ages, after God himſelf had ſet it up in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in all its peregrinations and pilgrimages, and that after God had given unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed ſuch directions for the ſetting up of his worſhip whereſoever he and his poſterity ſhould come, and ſhould alſo behold the diverſe alterations of things in the worſhip and ſervice of God, and if he ſhould with all conſider that if the church ſhould have been onely to be found where there had been ſuch viſible ordinances and formes of Worſhip and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as God had appointed, and no where elſe; then there would not have been a church of God any where viſibly to appear and be found many times in the world in thoſe dayes; and yet the true church alwayes remained in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family and God had his people and a true church amongſt his ſeed, as will appear by theſe examples. I will briefly name ſome.</p>
               <p>We know that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Hebrewes</hi> the onely people of God and his firſt borne, continued many generations as ſtrangers in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> all the which time they never offered up any outward Sacrifices unto God; for that had been an abomination to the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> and they would not tolerate and ſuffer that in their land; which moved <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſollicite <hi>Pharaoh, to give the people of God leave that they might go a dayes journy to ſacrifice in the Wilderneſs,</hi> giving him the reaſon of his poſtulation ſaying, <hi>that they could not ſacrifice in Aegypt, for that was an abomination to the Aegyptians:</hi> So that it is apparent that all the time they remained in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they had not that publike Ordinance &amp; that externall form of worſhip: And yet all that while they were a true Church and were viſibly known by their Religion to be diſtinct from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as who profeſſed the knowledge and worſhip of the true God <hi>whoſe name they called upon through all their tribes and whom they ſerved night</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48122:122"/>
                  <hi>and day:</hi> and yet I ſay they had not the uſe of publike ſacrifices: onely they had Circumciſion amongſt them that diſcriminating Ordinance from other nations. But if that had been the forme of this true Church, then all the time they remained in the wilderneſs which was forty years, there was no viſible forme of a Church: for they circumciſed not their children there, and that reproach was not taken away till they came to <hi>Gilgall,</hi> or at leſt had paſſed the red Sea. So that if the Church had been tyed to externall formes, we ſhall for many years together finde no true formed Church in thoſe times. Nay when they were come into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> how often was the face of the Church in the dayes of the Judges ſo deformed as no man almoſt could ſee any forme or comlineſſe in it; all the externall beauty which was the worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either wholy forgotten or ſo adulterated and polluted with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry as there was not left any appearance of a true Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them? and yet at that time they were the people of God and his choſen people and a true Church; but if they had ſought to know it by any externall form it could never have bin found: <hi>So that the Church of God may be a true church though it want an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form and diſcipline.</hi> Yea after that God had ſet up his worſhip in the dayes of <hi>David and Solomon,</hi> and had commanded that that forme of Government ſhould be continued and perpetuated to the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> how many alterations notwithſtanding were there found both in <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and how did Idolatry ſpread it ſelfe abroad through both thoſe Kingdomes, <hi>So that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry was not only committed under every green tree and in all groves and upon every mountain and high place, but even in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the holy city yea in the very Temple?</hi> So that now there was no exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall forme of a Church left, and yet then alſo had God his Church there, and they were the people of God and dearly beloved of him.</p>
               <p>And again when they were carryed into captivity into <hi>Babilon,</hi> we know that all the time they continued there, they had neither ſacrifices nor many other ordinances that God had appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, they could not ſo much as ſing a ſong of <hi>Sion</hi> in that ſtrange land, and wee read of no other exerciſes amongſt them but of the morall worſhip of prayer and reading the prophets and of prophecying and comforting of one another in the Lord, and of their reſolution not ſo much as to bow in the leaſt to worſhip any
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48122:123"/>
Idoll of the heathens, or ſo much as ſtooping to reverence any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemy of the people of God, as <hi>Mordecay would not to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor the three children to the idoll of</hi> Nebuchadnezer, <hi>nor</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel <hi>leave his praying;</hi> but all theſe kinde of ſervices are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the forme of a Church amongſt the learned, and yet wee read of no other formes of worſhip the Jews had, neither through all the Provinces of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> and through all <hi>Babilon</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> where they were ſcattered; We read indeed that they faſted and prayed upon all occaſions, and that they ſpake one to another, and they exerciſed amongſt themſelves the morall worſhip in all their Synagogues which were all the true Churches of God then through the world; and yet they had not that viſible forme that God had appointed, in any of thoſe Countryes whither they were driven and carryed captives; they onely made their prayers and ſupplications toward <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the Temple the holy place.</p>
               <p>So that if the Church of God had been at any time tyed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall formes they could not then have been Churches properly ſo called, as not having any externall forme; and yet they were all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law and under the law and ſince the law true Churches, notwithſtanding they wanted the externall forme and diſcipline. And the ſame may be ſaid of the Church of God ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and growth of Antichriſt, that it hath been ſo defaced for many generations together that none by its externall forme or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline could find a true Church in it; yet God had in this ſpirituall <hi>Babylon</hi> a true Church ever; and therefore the true Church is not confined to externall formes and diſcipline. But to ſay nothing of that, if the Chriſtian Church be bounded within theſe limits, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Papiſts or the Independents encompaſſe in their Churches with, then I affirme <hi>that the very Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was not a true formed Church, which notwithſtanding they both acknowledge was a true Church, and the Independents confeſſe that it was the firſt formed Church,</hi> Acts <hi>the ſecond:</hi> For in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> there was neither <hi>Pope,</hi> nor <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> nor <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> nor <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,</hi> nor <hi>Paultripolitans,</hi> nor <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> nor any <hi>Conclave,</hi> nor any <hi>Maſſes,</hi> nor any of that <hi>Service they have ſet up in their Romiſh Church,</hi> nor that <hi>Forme of Church Government they have eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> neither had they any of theſe fixed officers. And therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having loſt that forme the Church of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>

had, and being adulterated both in doctrine diſcipline and manners, that cannot be a true Church; and then it will follow, <hi>That the true Church is not ſo tyed to any externall forms that if they be failing they cannot be a true Church;</hi> for then there ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld have been no true Church or Churches in the world all the times of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts reigne. Nay, if the doctrine of the Independents be true and orthodox, the very Church of Jeruſalem, <hi>Acts the</hi> 2. which they call <hi>the firſt formed church,</hi> was no more a true formed church, nor caſt into a Church mould according to the New Teſtament forme, then thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> were; for they deſcribe a Church unto us after the New Teſtament forme to be <hi>a company of Saints or Beleevers, conſiſting of no more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then can all meet together in one place or congregation, having their diſtinct officers and members united together into one body by a particular explicite Covenant: So as that aſſembly or church muſt not be fluid, but fixt in its members and officers; having a Preſbytery of its own with abſolute authority and juriſdiction within it ſelfe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent and injoying all Gods holy Ordinances.</hi> This is the diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Independent Church after the New Teſtament forme as they call it, as far as by their practiſe and writings we can gather; So that whatſoever Church wants this forme according to their language, is no true formed church, as not being caſt into a church mould after the New Teſtament forme: And by this their modell the church it ſelfe of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was not a true moulded church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the New Teſtament forme, as I ſhall here briefly in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars ſhew, and more largely demonſtrate when I come to my brother <hi>Burton.</hi> For it is confeſt by the Independents that at that time <hi>there were three thouſand ſoules added to the church, and five thouſand after that,</hi> it was then a true formed Church after the New Teſtament forme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet at that time they acknowledge they wanted Deacons and Presbyters; and they confeſſe withall as we ſhall ſee in its due place, they wanted that part of diſcipline of caſting out corrupt Members, ſo that then they had not a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the church of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and withall the Independents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <hi>that many of the Beleevers and Saints of Ieruſalem were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of other churches through Iudaea;</hi> for they ſay there were many other churches there, and that many of thoſe belonged unto the other churches, and it is ſufficiently proved alſo out of the holy word of God and acknowledged by my brother <hi>Burton, that there</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48122:124"/>
                  <hi>were more aſſemblies and congregations of Beleevers in the church of Ieruſalem then one;</hi> yea he confeſſes <hi>that in its infancy the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them was ſo great, as they could not all meet in any one place, and yet they were but one church.</hi> Neither do we ever read that they tyed themſelves to each other by any particular explicite Covenant or counted ſuch a Covenant the forme of a true church.</p>
               <p>From all which I gather, that the difinition or deſcription of the Independents Church is erroneous, or if it be orthodoxe, then the very Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was not a true formed Church after the New Teſtament formewhen, they ſay it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For firſt,</hi> there were more Beleevers in Ieruſalem then could all meet in one congregation, or a few, yet though in ſeverall and diſtinct places and aſſemblies, they all made but one Church: <hi>which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Independents doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they had no fixt Officers and Members united into one body reſpectively nor no Presbitery: for if there were not then Deacons at all, nor Elders as the Independents doe acknowledge, and if many of the Beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were ſtrangers, and had their habitations in other cities as they ſay, then they were not fixt, neither in their Officers nor Members, <hi>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48122:124"/>
all alone without either ſheep or Lambes; they alſo were not fixed, bnt were afterward ſent into all nations to teach and baptize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I ſaid before; withall the Independents confeſſe, they had no Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for they want ed that part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> excommunication, and therefore they had no Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in it, nor no juriſdiction within it ſelfe, <hi>Ergo</hi> it was not a true formed Church after the New Teſtament forme, if their doctrine be true and good, neither could they then injoy all the acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and therefore was no better then thoſe that were made chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by the Baptiſmeof <hi>Iohn; for in the Church of Ieruſalem, there were more then could meet in any one place,</hi> which the Independents wil not admit of by their difinition, &amp; they had neither fixed offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers nor Members nor that part of diſciplin, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they did not injoy all Gods Ordinances. In a word there was nothing in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that now the Independents require for the moulding up of a Church after the New Teſtament forme, no more then was amongſt thoſe that were baptized by the Baptiſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore all that <hi>I. S.</hi> and the Independents bable about the forme and mould of a Church after the New Teſtament forme, is to little purpoſe, yea meere vainty: for it is evident out of the holy Scripture, <hi>that a Church may be a true formed Church after the New Teſtament forme, although it want all thoſe things that either the Papiſts or the Independents thinke abſolutely neceſſary for the moulding up a Church after the New Testament forme.</hi> For the very Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which was the Mother-church, and which was to be a patterne to all other Churches was a true formed Church, and at that very time according to the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents learning; and yet I ſay then, ſhee had neither fixed Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers nor Members, nor any external explicite particular covenant, nor diſcipline, nor many other requiſites that they now require as neceſſary for the forming of a true Church, as wee ſhall ſee more at large in its due place.</p>
               <p>But now to returne and come more cloſely to examine <hi>I. S.</hi> his words that we may diſcover yet more fully the fallacious juglings of both himſelfe and all the Independent Miniſters, and that all the people may the better underſtand what it is to to be caſt into a Church mould after the New Teſtament forme, and vvhat is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary and required of all men to be made a Member of a Chriſtan Church, and vvhat that forme is the Scripture hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48122:125"/>
out unto all Chriſtians, to be the mould of a chriſtian Church according to the New Teſtament forme, all vvhich termes and expreſſions being vvell explaned, then the grollery of thoſe of the congregationall vvay vvill the better appeare.</p>
               <p>I will therefore that thoſe that are the moſt ignorant may the better underſtand the termes theſe Juglers uſe, Firſt ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing briefly concerning the governement of the Church of the Iewes under the Law in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and under the Kings both of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> through all their cities, and what it was that was requiſit and thought neceſſary for the caſting off any into a Church mould after the old Teſtament forme; which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the trifling of all the Independent Miniſters will be more obvious to all men.</p>
               <p>For the manner of the governement of the Church of the Iews, wee are to conſider it under a double nation, as it had a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſervice and a morall worſhip and both appointed by God; yet the former but temporary, the other for duration. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner of the adminiſtration it was divers; for the ceremoniall worſhip was ordered after a monarchicall way; there was a high Prieſt that typified Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that was to make the atonement betweene God and the people, who was in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner to mediate with God for the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and hee had many Prieſts under him for the offering up of daily ſacrifices, either of prayſes or of reconciliation in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Temple they were tyed; but the High Prieſt onely went once a yeare into the Holy of holies, for the making of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for himſelfe and the people, and this way of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church continued to the coming of Chriſt who was the true high Prieſt typified, and <hi>who through the eternall ſpirit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offered himſelfe without ſpot to God, to purge our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead workes to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 10. verſe 14. <hi>and for this cauſe is the Mediator of the New Teſtament;</hi> by his death and ſuffering hee hath put an end to that way of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But there was an other way of Adminiſtration in reſpect of the morall worſhip, which was ever to remaine in the Church; and that was in their ſeverall <hi>Cities,</hi> in their <hi>Synagogues</hi> and <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>Synagogues</hi> that were through all <hi>Iudaea</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and through the vvorld, vvho vvere all governed by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Elders vvhich vvere called Rulers; ſo that all thoſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48122:125"/>
that vvere in the ſeverall Villages or Hamlets within the juriſdiction and limits of every Citie were all of them governed after a claſſicall and collegiate way, and thoſe Synagogues were as our Pariſh Churches now at this day are amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Elders and Rulers in <hi>Moſes</hi> time were firſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rule and governe the people in common, ſo long as they were in the Wilderneſſe; but after they were come into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then they had their Elders and Rulers in every Citie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed over them, who had the government of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, and whoſe care it was <hi>that the morall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice of God, as the reading of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the interpretation of the ſame ſhould be every Sabbath day continually preſerved in all their Synagogues, by their Prieſts and Levites, and Scribes and Lawyers,</hi> and they had alſo the power in their hands of conventing any before them upon Delinquency, and of cenſuring and puniſhing of them upon proofe of the ſame: And they were called <hi>the Church,</hi> as is to be ſeene <hi>Matthew</hi> the 18. and there is not any truth almoſt in all the new teſtament that is more evidently cleare than this, that all the Synagogues were governed by a Court or Claſſis or College of Rulers, for they had inferior judges and Superiour in them yea many chiefe rulers in all cities as we may ſee in <hi>Antioch and Piſidia Acts the</hi> 13. 14. 15. where <hi>Paul</hi> and his company <hi>went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day and ſate downe,</hi> and <hi>after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the chiefe</hi> Rulers (for ſo it is in the originall) <hi>ſent unto them, ſaying men and brethren, if you have any word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation for the people, ſay on.</hi> Out of which words theſe three things are obſervable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there were many Governors and chiefe Rulers as well as inferior rulers that governed their Synagogues in every city in common, and that they had a Courte in them to order all the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues and people under their juriſdiction, and that they were all Ariſtocratically governd and by the common counſell of them all, not by any particular Iudge or Ruler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond obſervable is,</hi> that their whole imployment was to uphold and preſerve the true worſhip of God, and to ſee that the Holy Scriptures were read and interpreted, that men women and children might be brought up in the nurture and feare of the Lord, and that all things ſhould be managed with order and decency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third thing obſervable, is this,</hi> that their people yeelded
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48122:126"/>
ſubjection unto thoſe Rulers, and did not intermeddle with their government, nor did not take upon them to command any Minister to Preach or appoint any one to exhort: but it was the place of the Rulers to doe this, and they willingly ſubmitted themſelves to this Government without joyning themſelves in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with them, as knowing it was their place to obey.</p>
               <p>And this kind of Government, was that that was eſtabliſhed in all cities through the world where the Jewes were permitted to exerciſe their Religion, and this kind of government was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted over to the Chriſtian church to be perpetutated to the ende of the world, and therfore there was through all cities Presbyters ordained as the Scripture ſaith <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. that were to governe the church by their common councell; and this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded unto by all the Independents who acknowledge that in the Apoſtles times and many Generations after, all the churches of the New teſtament were governed <hi>communi conſilio presbytero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> And that the Church of Jeruſalem in reſpect of the moral worſhip was governed both in Chriſts time and after his death and aſcention, by a colledge of Elders and Presbyters, all the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and the Acts of the Apoſtles doe teſtifie it; and this way of government I ſay was tranſacted over to the Chriſtian church and is that forme and mould of church government that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the New Teſtament forme, into the which mould of government thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were caſt which was a Presbytery. For the Scripture never ſpeakes of that of the congregationall way. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke at this time and in this place concerning the manner of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the government both in reſpect of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſervice and morall worſhip under the Law, and what it ought to be under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And now a word or two concerning the manner of admitting members then into the church of the Iewes and what was reputed neceſſary for the making of any one a member and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelite there after the old teſtament forme; and what is required now for making of any a member of the Chriſtian church. The whole Scripture of the old teſtament and the new declares <hi>that all thoſe that were aliens and ſtrangers unto the common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>if they deſired to be made partakers of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the</hi> Iews <hi>and to be all accompted in the number of</hi>

                  <hi>the people of God, they were to be inſtructed in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and they were to yeeld obedience unto that, and in token that they beleeved in the true God, and ſubmitted themſelves to his Law and to that diſcipline he had taught in the bookes of</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, they were to be circumciſed, which when they yeelded unto and tooke the Covenant of Circumciſion, they were forthwith made members of the Church of the</hi> Iewes, <hi>and had as good right to all the ordinances of God under that government as any other of the Iewes;</hi> and this I ſay is ſufficiently confirmed in the holy Scriptures everywhere. Now under the New teſtament the Church of God being compared ſometimes to a Kingdom and Empire, and ſometimes to a city; and all the members of it being compared to free Denizons and citizens, where ſo ever the Goſpel of this Kingdom and City is faithfully preached, and the people by the Embaſſadours and Miniſters of the ſame being invited to come in and yeeld obedience unto it, <hi>if they do believe and obey,</hi> that is, <hi>if they do beleeve and repent and willingly ſubmit unto the ſound of it, and offer themſelves to make profeſſion of it,</hi> and in ſigne of this their obedience and faith <hi>receive the ſeale of this Covenant and are baptized,</hi> they are forthwith to be admitted without any reluctation, and having once received the ſeale of this Covenant the ſeale of Baptiſme, they are forthwith made free Denizons of this Kingdome and free-men of this city, and have as good right to all the priviledges of the ſame as any other, and may through the whole world of Chriſtians partake in all the Ordinances of that Kingdome and City as well as any other Chriſtians: as in the Roman Empire and now in all Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions through the world, they that were Citizens of Rome or they that are Freemen in any of them, as they did then partake in all the priviledges of the Romans and might abide and dwell in any place, and trafficke, buy and purchace in what part of it they pleaſed, injoying all thoſe inmmnities that any then did, and ſo likewiſe now as thoſe that are Free-men of any city or corporation do in their ſeverall precincts injoy all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of each of them, and may ſet up in any Pariſh or in any part of the city or within the juriſdiction of the ſame, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all their ſeverall trades, and have as much priviledge for their ſo doing as any of the other Citizens; ſo I ſay in the ſame manner, it is in the Kingdom of Chriſt and his city which

is his church, <hi>Every one that makes profeſſion of the Goſpell, that beleeves, repents and is Baptized,</hi> has as good right to all the Ordinances of the Church as any Chriſtian in the primitive times or any Independents now in the world, and that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the great Charter of this Kingdome and City the Goſpell, and by the practice of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no more of all men and people in their time for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them members of Chriſts Church <hi>but that they ſhould repent and beleeve and be Baptized,</hi> as we may ſee in the third of <hi>Matth.</hi> and in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in thoſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> in the 8. Chapter, and in the <hi>Eunuch Paul, Lydia,</hi> and the Goaler, and thoſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his houſe, of all the which no more was required for the making of them Chriſtians <hi>but to repent and beleeve and to be Baptized,</hi> by which they were inveſted with a right to all the priviledges through all Churches in the world and might partake in all the Ordinances of Chriſts Kingdome where ſo ever they came, as we may ſee in <hi>Paul</hi> and thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed him in his journies. <hi>Whereſoever they came they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with them in all Churches, in all the Ordinances as in the breaking of bread and prayer: So that to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and to be baptized,</hi> is all that according to the Goſpell of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is required of any man or of any people to caſt them into a Church mould according the New Teſtament forme, and to make them not only members of the Catholike viſible Church, but of any church in particular, if the Word of God is to be beleeved and given credit unto.</p>
               <p>Now when all thoſe that came out of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> did repent and beleeve and were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> they were caſt into a Church mould after the New Teſtament forme and were all made as good members of that church as any that were baptized after <hi>Chriſts</hi> death and aſcention by <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles, and might whenſoever they went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to any other place where chriſtians dwelt, partake in all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as thoſe did that by reaſon of the perſecution were ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who we read of that whereſoever they came they went into their Synagogues and Churches, and they preached and converted the people, and partaked and communicated in all the ordinances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them without any gain-ſaying; and ſo all the Chriſtians that are true Beleevers and are baptized, whereſoever they travell

or dwell whether in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany, Italy</hi> or the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes,</hi> or in any part of the world amongſt the true Proteſtants, they have as great right to all the ordinances in thoſe churches as any of the Natives: For they are all free Denizons of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdome and free men of the city the church of God which is <hi>Chriſts</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body, and therefore as members of the ſame may partake in all the Priviledges and Benefits that any member may do; I mean in reſpect of the ordinances, as breaking of bread, hearing of the word preached and in prayer and all the eſſentiall priviledges; for to all thoſe they have right unto by their very admiſſion into the church by their baptiſme, and whoſoever ſhall refuſe communion with them that beleeve, and are baptized and live a godly holy and pious life, unleſſe they will obſerve their own traditions, they are Delinquents &amp; Prevaricators againſt the King of his church <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> and do no way ſet him up upon his throne, but by this meanes they diſ-throne him. And therefore <hi>J. S.</hi> and all thoſe of his fraternity, that not onely unchriſtian and unchurch all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt and Chriſts Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts death, but at this day unchurch and unchriſtian all Chriſtians and Churches but their own, are guilty of high contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy againſt the King of Saints and King of Kings, and are moſt injurious to all their chriſtian Brethren: And truly there cannot be found ſcarſe in the world ſuch an example of temerity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed raſhneſſe and want of charity and common wiſdome, as is every day to be obſerved amongſt the Independents who are ever talking of a Church mould after the New Teſtament forme, and excluding all from being true Churches that are not ſo moulded, and yet never tell us what it is.</p>
               <p>For in the holy Scripture we have never read of any other Church mould or of any New Teſtament forme, <hi>but of publiſhing the Gospel and of preaching faith and repentance, and of yeelding obedience unto it, and of beleeving and repenting and being baptized,</hi> which both <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and all <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles and all the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to do, and a command withall, and a bleſſing annexed unto it, that whoſoever did repent, beleeve and was baptized, ſhould not onely be admitted a viſible member of the catholicke viſible Church, but ſhould be ſaved. The words of our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto his Diſciples, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. are theſe, <hi>Go</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:48122:128"/>
(ſaith he) <hi>into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; he that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; but he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Out of the which words and commiſſion of our Saviour I evidently gather that when <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and Chriſts Diſciples in their ſeverall miniſtryes went according to their commiſſion preaching from place to place and from city to city and publiſhing the glad tydings of the kingdom of the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and baptizing ſuch as beleeved, they caſt them into a Church mould after the New Teſtament forme, and therefore made them all members not onely of the Catholique viſible Church but of all thoſe ſeverall particular Churches and Synagogues through all the cities of <hi>Judaea</hi> and through the world where they preached the Goſpel, as well as at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that as many of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> as were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples were all members of that Church and as truly moulded into a Church mould after the New Teſtament forme and made as reall members and free deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons of Chriſts Kingdome as any of the new congregations at this day, unleſſe any will think and beleeve that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and the bleſſed Apoſtles were ignorant how to gather Churches, and neſcient of the right mould and forme of the New Teſtament chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and had not learned their leſſon ſo well as our Independent Miniſters: which were a piece of impiety and horrid wickedneſſe to affirme: For then it would follow, that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and by the Apoſtles and <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſeventy Diſciples, were never ſaved: For <hi>I. S.</hi> denyes they were Chriſtians and that they were caſt into a church mould after the New Teſtament forme, or members of the chriſtian church, and therefore by conſequent they were in the ſtate of damnation.</p>
               <p>But if all this be wickedneſſe ſo much as to think, then there is a way yet to Heaven and that a ſafe one which the Independents are ignorant of; for they preach up their way as the narrow way to heaven, proclaiming all thoſe that are out of it to be enemies of Jeſus <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his kingdome, and in the ſtate of perdition; and yet <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was ignorant of their way and caſt not his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into their mould, and yet they went ſafely to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, yea they entred into it by violence as our Saviour ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>And therefore by this that I have now ſaid by way of anſwer, all men may ſee the futility and impiety of <hi>I. S.</hi> and how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48122:128"/>
all his arguments are, and may very well conclude, <hi>That all thoſe that were baptized by</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt and by Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples before his death, were members of Chriſts Church and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and that as many of them as came from</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>were members of that church;</hi> and they may alſo from the foregoing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments gather, <hi>That thoſe that came out of Jeruſalem to his baptiſm were in ſuch multitudes (for all Ieruſalem went out unto him and were baptized) as they could not all poſſibly meet in any one place or congregation or a few;</hi> &amp; therfore I am confident that all thoſe that ſhall read both what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> have fondly and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly replyed to my arguments, and what by way of anſwer I have here ſet down, will adjudge, that ſuch unworthy wranglers and cavillers as theſe are ought by their ſeverall Churches to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely cenſur'd for this their ignorance and impiety. And this ſhall ſerve to have replyed to theſe their exceptions againſt my firſt arguments concerning the multitudes baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt: I ſhall anſwer to all their other ſeverall cavills in their due places.</p>
               <p>I will now therefore go on to ſhew the increaſe of beleevers that were made by the miracles and preaching both of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, and from the ſeverall places out of the holy Scripture frame my arguments as out of the former to prove the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. <hi>John</hi> the 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Now when the Lord knew how the Phariſees had heard that Ieſus made and baptized more Diſciples then Iohn (though Ieſus himſelfe baptized not, but his Diſciples:)</hi> Here obſerve that where there was a miſtake in the relation, there the Evangeliſt forthwith ſhews it to rectifie mens underſtandings; as where it was reported <hi>that Chriſt baptized,</hi> he ſhewes it was a miſtake, <hi>for his Diſciples onely baptized:</hi> but where it is ſaid, <hi>that Ieſus made more Diſciples then Iohn,</hi> that is taken <hi>pro confeſſo;</hi> and it was true; for <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe in the 3. chapter ver. 30. had ſaid, <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.</hi> Chriſt therefore made many more Diſciples and Beleevers then <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>added dayly to the church, that was then in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſuch as ſhould be ſaved; for he came to ſave the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and he received all that came to him,</hi> John <hi>the</hi> 6. 37. <hi>And as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſonnes of God, even to them that beleeve upon his name,</hi> John 1. 12. And theſe were infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, as we ſhall ſee by and by. In <hi>Iohn</hi> the 7. 31. it is ſaid <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:48122:129"/>
                  <hi>many of the people of Ieruſalem beleeved on him;</hi> And verſe the 40. they ſaid, <hi>of a truth this is that Prophet:</hi> And in the ſame chapter when the high Preiſts ſent the officers to apprehend Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning without him, and the high Prieſts demanding the reaſon why they had not brought him, the officers replyed ſaying, <hi>That never man ſpake as this man.</hi> ver. 47, 48. <hi>Then anſwered the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, are ye alſo deceived? Doth any of the Rulers or the Phariſees believe in him? But this people that knoweth not the Law is curſed.</hi> Take here notice of the confeſſion of the very <hi>Phariſees;</hi> excepting themſelves and the High Prieſts, they acknowledge <hi>that the generality of the people believed in him.</hi> Here was increaſe upon increaſe of Chriſtians and Believers, all the people generally believed in him: certainely one place could not have contained them all. And which is yet more to be obſerved; that whereas the Phariſees ſaid, none but the curſed people believed in him, and none of the Rulers; in this very chapter we finde one Ruler one <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Verſ. 50. none of the leaſt of the Rulers. And in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 42. it is affirmed, <hi>That among the chiefe Rulers many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him, but becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſſe him, leſt they ſhould be put out the Synagogue.</hi> And in Verſe 11. of the ſame chapter, it is aſſerted, <hi>That many of the Iewes went away and believed on Ieſus;</hi> here was multiplication upon multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Believers. And in Verſ. 19. <hi>The Phariſees therefore ſaid among themſelves, perceive ye how ye prevaile nothing? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the world is gone after him.</hi> Theſe words the Phariſees ſpake in private among themſelves deliberately, and confeſt that the world of men were turned Chriſtians; all <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſwarmed with Believers; <hi>without doubt all theſe could not meet in one place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed through all the Evangeliſts we ſhall reade of infinite multitudes that believed in him; and the reaſon is given, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 29. <hi>Becauſe he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes:</hi> and did ſuch works of wonder, and wrought ſuch miracles, as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 31. they confeſt <hi>none could do but Chriſt:</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. it is related, <hi>that the raiſing up</hi> Lazarus <hi>from the dead made many believe on him,</hi> and was the cauſe that ſuch multitudes of people followed him, and did ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour him and magnifie him; and did receive him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with ſuch an acclamation, crying, <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> as in this 12 Chapter is ſpecified; and is more largely ſet downe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48122:129"/>
in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 8. where it is related, <hi>That a great multitude ſpread their garments in the way, and others cut down branches,</hi> and the people that went before, and they that came after, cryed <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>this is Jeſus the Prophet of</hi> Nazareth; <hi>they all believed in him, and confeſſed him before the world.</hi> Now our Savionr ſaith, <hi>He that ſhall confeſſe me, and own me before men, I will confeſſe and own him before my Father in Heaven.</hi> Here is a whole City of Believers and Confeſſors. Yes, the very children believed in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and openly, and in the Temple cried <hi>Hoſanna.</hi> And Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf allowed of their teſtimony, and avouched they did well, and accordingly as was written. And in <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 47, 48. it is ſaid, <hi>That he taught dayly in the Temple, but the chief Priests and Scribes, and the Elders of the people ſought to destroy him, and could not finde what they might do; for all the people were very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to heare him.</hi> The univerſality therefore of the people by all theſe places were believers, and ſuch as followed Chriſt: So that a man may wonder, how that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> it ſelf, though it were a mighty City, could containe ſuch multitudes of people as believed in Chriſt: ſo far improbable it is, <hi>that any one place or Congregation could containe the hundreth part of them.</hi> And we may alſo gather, that the great miracles at his Suffering, and at his Reſurrection, and the apparition of ſo many <hi>that roſe from their graves and went into the holy City,</hi> made a great increaſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Diſciples and new Believers; ſo that the number was daily augmented; we finde no diminution: but if ſome that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt for bread, that were but Hypocrites, left following him; yet in thoſe places we read again and again of numberleſſe companies that daily came in, and believed in him.</p>
               <p>And to all this we may adde, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, a little before his death; and Chriſt and his Diſciples, by reaſon of the increaſe of the multitudes of Believers, were forced to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in ſeverall places. For ſo it is in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>After theſe dayes came Ieſus and his Diſciples into the land of Iudea, and there he tarried with them and baptized, and</hi> Iohn <hi>alſo was baptizing in</hi> Enon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>neere</hi> Salim, <hi>becauſe there was much water there, and they came and were baptized.</hi> And very reaſon will tell all men, that of neceſſity there muſt be an innumerable multitude of beleevers, (for none were Baptized but beleevers) that muſt take up an hundred preachers or thereabouts; for our Saviour had twelve Apoſtles, and 70. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48122:130"/>
as we may ſee in the 9. of <hi>Luke,</hi> and in the 10. chapter of the ſame book: and <hi>Iohn</hi> had alſo many Diſciples, though not ſo many as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all theſe were imployed in preaching the Goſpell, and many of them in working miracles and wonders; ſo that the very Devills were ſubject unto them, as they rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly confeſt to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when they returned to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Miniſtery. And without doubt if theſe miracles wrought ſo with the very Diſciples, they prevailed much more generally with the people to make them beleeve; ſo that infinite multitudes of people came in and were Baptized, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe informeth us. And of neceſſity, ſo many Miniſters, muſt have ſeverall places to Preach in, and ſeverall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Aſſemblies to Preach to, and ſeverall places to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in: for otherwiſe there would have beene great confuſion; for but one of them could ſpeake at once; and all theſe Diſciples were taken up in their ſeverall Miniſteries, and had their hands full, as the Scripture it ſelf ſufficiently declareth in expreſſe words; for it is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſts Diſciples Baptizedin Indaea: and</hi> Iohn <hi>in</hi> Enon <hi>neere</hi> Salim, <hi>becauſe there was much water there.</hi> It ſeemes there was too little water to Baptize them in, in others places, which expreſſion is worthy to be taken notice of. And amongſt thoſe that came to be Baptized, multitudes of them came from <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if wee compare times with times, which will make much for the evidencing of the truth, and conſider the divers paſſages in the holy Scriptures, wee ſhall find the like diviſion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in thoſe dayes; ſome ſtanding for Chriſt and <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, and ſpeaking in the juſtification of them and their Miniſtery, and others that were of the Phariſaicall faction, and of the high Prieſts company; as is even in theſe our dayes, betweene them they call Caviliers, and thoſe they call Parliamentiers. Now what twenty or thirty places in the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> can containe all the Parliamentiers <hi>to partake in all acts of Worſhip?</hi> Or what ten places can hold all thoſe of the Prelaticall Faction, that contend for their Biſhops and Service, and all their other trumpery and accoutrements? And yet, although they be in divers and ſundry Aſſemblies, they are ſtill the Prelaticall party, and all of them of the Malignant Church: and as the diverſity of the places changeth not their complexions, ſo it altereth not their faith, nor manners,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48122:130"/>
but they continne ſtill Malignants and remaine all Members of the Malignant Church.</p>
               <p>And as in theſe dayes all that wiſh well unto the true Religion through both citie and kingdome, and love their countrey, ſtand for the Parliament; ſo in thoſe dayes thoſe <hi>that loved</hi> Zion <hi>and the proſperity of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>cleaved unto Chriſt and the Goſpel and ſtood for him, and all his Miniſters;</hi> and by all computations, though all the power and Authority was in the hands of the malignant Magiſtrates of thoſe times, who were ſwayed and guided by the Scribes, Phariſees, Elders, and the high Prieſts; yet to one Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee or Malignant Scribe or Ruler, there was ten of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in Chriſt, and honoured him and all his Miniſters and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Yea the Phariſees themſelves do acknowledge it, not once but many times, as is evident from the places above cited, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more that might be produced.</p>
               <p>So that if I ſhould frame no Argument out of them, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that thoſe new additions of Beleevers that were converted by Chriſt and his Miniſtry, conſidered by themſelves a part, from thoſe that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt converted, were ſo great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, <hi>that they could not all meet in any one place for partaking of all acts of worſhip,</hi> but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Congregations</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> if they would all be edified; much leſſe could they all meet together, being joyned to thoſe that beleeved through the Baptiſme and Miniſtry of <hi>Iohn.</hi> But out of the former places above ſpecified I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where there was an innumerable multitude of beleevers, in a word, the whole people and Citie of Ieruſalem, whom the Phariſees accounted accurſed, there they could not all meet at any one time, or in any one roome or place and in one Congregation, to partake in all the Ordinances, but of neceſſity muſt bee diſtributed into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſemblies, and divers Congregations, if they would all bee edified: But in Ieruſalem (the Scribes and Phariſees, and Rulers, by their owne confeſſion, being excepted) there was an innumerable multitude of beleevers, and in a word, the whole people and Citie of Jeruſalem, whom the Phariſees accounted accurſed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet together at one time, and in one place to partake in all the Ordinances, but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſemblies and divers congregations, if they would all be edified.</p>
               <p>For the major, no rationall man will deny is, that hath but read
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48122:131"/>
the Scriptures, or is but a little acquainted with the Hiſtories of thoſe times. For the minor, it is evident from the places produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and therefore the concluſion doth neceſſarily follow. But I yet further thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where there was a world of beleevers, with many Rulers and men of great place and office, with infinite multitudes of men and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; all the people, they could not al meet together at one time, and in one place and congregation to partake in all acts of worſhip; but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into divers aſſemblies and ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, if they would all be edified. But in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> there was a world of beleevers, with many Rulers and men of great place and office, with multitudes of men and children, and all the people. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet together at one time and in one place, to partake in all acts of worſhip, but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies if they would be all edified.</p>
               <p>For the Major, it is evident by the very light of nature, neither will any rationall man deny it, that hath not reſolved to ſacrifice himſelfe to ſtupidity. For the Minor, the places above ſpecified prove it: for in expreſſe words it is ſaid, <hi>that the world followed him;</hi> that is, <hi>believed in him,</hi> and that great multitudes entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with their acclamations, and crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> the very children alſo ſeconding them.

But out of the former places I yet further thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where ther was ſuch an increaſe of multitudes of Beleevers, as that there was not water enough in any one place to baptize them all, nor any one place in the wilderneſſe capable to containe or receive them all; ſo that Chriſt himſelfe, and his ſeventy Diſciples, and twelve Apoſtles, and Iohn Baptiſt and all his Diſciples, were for the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meroſity

of them, forced in ſeverall places to preach unto them and baptize them; there they could not all meet at any one time, or in any one place or roome, or in one Congregation, to partake or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in all acts of worſhip; but of neceſsitie were to be diſtributed into ſeverall congregations or aſſemblies, if they would all be edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there was ſuch multitudes of beleevers that went out to the Baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> and Chriſt, as that there was not water enough in any one place to baptize them all, nor any one place in the wilderneſſe capable to containe or receive them all: ſo that Chriſt himſelfe and his ſeventy Diſciples, and his twelve Apoſtles, and Saint <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt and his Diſciples, were for the numeroſity of them forced to divide themſelves into ſeverall places, and ſeverall aſſemblies and congregations, that all the people might partake in all acts of worſhip, and be edified. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet at any one time, or in any one place, but were of neceſſity forced to divide and diſtribute themſelves into divers places, and ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies, that they might all be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>For the Major and Minor of the Syllogiſme, they are ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both by reaſon, and the holy Scripture, that no man that hath not reſolved with himſelfe to remaine incredulous, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in his obſtinacy, can deny the truth of them; ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of neceſſity muſt from the premiſes be granted. And all theſe multitudes of people were beleevers before Chriſts Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>Now before I goe on to declare what infinite multitudes of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were added to thoſe that were converted by <hi>Iohns</hi> and the Diſciples Miniſtry in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> after Chriſts death, and aſcenſion, which makes it an impoſſible thing, <hi>that they ſhould all meet in one place or a few;</hi> I ſhall deſire the Reader here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and <hi>I.

I will firſt ſet downe Maſter <hi>Knol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys</hi> his Reply with his Reaſons, and give my anſwer to him, and then in order come to what <hi>I.

His words are theſe, pag. 8. <hi>As for the world of beleevers mentioned in theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawne from</hi> John 12. 19. <hi>Behold the world is gone after</hi>

               <p>Theſe are Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> formall words, and all the ground of his denyall of the minor of all my Arguments, yea all that he hath to ſay againſt them. And it is wonderfull to ſee, how the people are ſatisfied with ſuch deluſions. But by this kind of Diſputing, if it be ſufficient for refutation, to deny any Arguments grounded upon the holy Scriptures, confirmed and corroborated by ſound reaſons: then for ought I know, men may not only confute the whole word of God, and whatſoever is evidently proved from thence, but indeed deny the Chriſtian Religion. But that all men may take notice of this mans ignorance, and blaſphemy (for to ſay the truth, he giveth the Spirit of God the lye, whiles hee labours to maintaine his erroneous opinion) &amp; that my anſwer may be the more ſatisfactory, I will make theſe two Propoſitions evidently appeare.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, that</hi> there was a world of beleevers in the Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and that they were inhabitants there, <hi>both which if I make good, then my Arguments will ſtand for ever immoveable, and it will follow,</hi> that there were more beleevers in the Church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem before Chriſts death converted by himſelfe, and by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then could all poſſibly meet in any one place, or congregation or a few; <hi>beſides thoſe that were converted by</hi> Iohns <hi>Miniſtry, and that this deniall of Mr.</hi> Knollys <hi>is groundleſſe, vaine and impious.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, this is ſo cleare a truth, that the very blind Phariſees, <hi>thoſe Leaders of the blind</hi> did well perceive it, and tooke the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes following of him in this ſenſe, <hi>that they beleeved in him,</hi> which their very expreſsion doth ſufficiently declare: For ſay they <hi>verſe</hi> 29. <hi>Perceive yee not how you prevaile nothing?

                  <hi>this man hath done?</hi> and in the 40. <hi>verſe,</hi> many of the people ſaid <hi>of a truth this is the Prophet, others ſaid this is the Chriſt,</hi> and all this was <hi>in Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 48. <hi>Have any of the Rulers and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> (ſay they) <hi>beleeved in him? but this people that knoweth not the Law is accurſed;</hi> out of the which place, it is now abundantly evident, that the world ſpake of, in the 12. <hi>chap.</hi> were beleevers: for here the Rulers and Phariſees make a diſtribution of the people of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp; divide them into two parties, and then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them together, the one that beleeved in Chriſt and followed him, and were his ſchollers, and the other that profeſſed they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his diſciples, yet they were Chriſts profeſſed enemies, and ſuch as declared themſelves not to beleeeve in him: now here what the Rulers and Phariſees judgement was concerning this buſines which was one of the parties, who knew very well what they ſpake, and the people of whom they ſpake, and of themſelves they ſpake thus, <hi>have any of the Rulers and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees beleeved in him? but this people that knoweth not the Law is accurſed.</hi> So that being thus compared together, the unbeleevers are the Phariſees and Rulers, and their complices on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but all the other people of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> they beleeved in him, in their eſteeme, and therefore they adjudged them accurſed, which they would never have done if they had followed Chriſt for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but to have looked upon him: for their words doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as much, as if they ſhould have ſaid in plaine termes, all the people, or the greateſt part of the people in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſaving the Rulers and Phariſees beleeve in Chriſt, and there is none oppoſe him but they, and that this is their very meaning and ſenſe of the words, as learned men may eaſily gather.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſame is confirmed by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his witneſſe in private alſo, who knew very well how the people of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſtood generally affected towards Chriſt, and what opinion they had of him: heare therefore what hee ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> the 3. of whom the Evangeliſt ſpeaketh thus. <hi>There was a man of the Phariſees named</hi> Nicodemus, <hi>a Ruler of the Iewes, the ſame came to Ieſus by night, and ſaid unto him Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God, for no man can doe theſe miracles except God bee with him.</hi> Here <hi>Nicodemus</hi> gives in teſtimony, &amp; devidene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48122:133"/>
that is to ſay, <hi>all the people know,</hi> that thou <hi>art a Teacher come from God;</hi> they knew it with the knowledge of Faith and approbation, and did really beleeve that hee was come from God, and he gives a reaſon of his and their faith, ſaying, <hi>that no men can doe thoſe miracles except God bee with him,</hi> and therefore they beleeved in him: ſo that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> which was a Diſciple of Chriſt, though in ſecret and a great honourer of him, would give in no falſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, nor make no falſe Muſters, and he knew very well the opinion and the eſteeme the people had of him, and he aſſerteth that both himſelfe and the people knew that Chriſt was ſent of God, which is as much as to beleeve in him: for the ſame confeſſion did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles make, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 6. ſaying, <hi>we know that thou art the Sonne of the living God.</hi> So that to acknowledge Chriſt, and to beleeve in him, is all one in the language of holy Scripture, and to follow and go after Chriſt out of ſincerity and love and to beleeve in him, is the ſame if the word of God may be judge in this controverſie. So that to goe after Chriſt then, and to follow him cordially and without worldly ends, both in the language of God and men, is to ſerve Chriſt and to beleeve in him: and therefore for all the above mentioned reaſons, the world that went after Chriſt, &amp; the people and multitudes that followed him, were all beleevers, and the others that either tarried at home, and followed their owne imployments, or oppoſed him, were unbeleevers.</p>
               <p>Now then when a multitulde from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> followd <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and when a world within <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> went after him, and when all the curſed people (as they called them) beleeved in him, not only by the very teſtimony of the enemies of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but by the witneſſes of the holy Scripture, it is ſufficiently apparent that the World ſpake of in the 12. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> were all beleevers, amongſt the which alſo out of ſame Chapter is proved, <hi>That many of the Rulers alſo believed in him.</hi> So that Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> denying all this, is little better then an Infidell: For an Infidell can do no more then deny the holy Scripture and the manifeſt truths diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in them; and by this that I have now ſaid, though I ſhould not adde a word more, it is manifeſt, <hi>That there were more beleevers at that time in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>then could all meete in any one place to partake in all the Ordinances,</hi> except a mighty city and a world of beleevers may <hi>all meete together in one room<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But yet for farther Illuſtration and proofe of this truth, that if it be poſſible, I may undeceive the poore deluded people, I will adde a reaſon or two more. The Scripture is ſo cleare in this point, that there were innumerable believers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> beſides thoſe that were natives there, it is ſaid there were <hi>dwellers in</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>worſhippers, or devout men, that is</hi> to ſay <hi>beleevers out of all nations under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And all theſe ſayeth the Scripture had their dwelling there. And without all doubt all theſe ſeverall Nations, had their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Synagogues in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> where they heard the Word of God in their owne language, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> and other Nations, here in <hi>London</hi> have their churches. And the multitudes of the inhabitants in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at all times, by the relation of the Hiſtorians of thoſe dayes, were ſcarſe ever leſſe then ſeven or eight hundred thouſands; and without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie the number was now increaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they daily and hourely expected the comming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> whoſe appearing they every moment looked for: and therefore all the believing Iewes out of all Countries repaired in multitudes to <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> So that ſuch numberleſſe numbers, both of the native <hi>Iewes</hi> and ſtrangers; required a mighty number of Teachers, and a many places to heare and to be taught in: and that there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove foure hundred Synagogues in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (which are chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in our dialect) the pen-men and Hiſtoriographers of thoſe times have recorded it: and all this is probable, from the numero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Preachers and Teachers there, which the holy Scripture relateth, as the Prieſts &amp; Levits, Scribes, Phariſees, Lawyers, which all ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chaire, and all of them diligently taken up in Preaching to the people and in inſtructing them, upon whoſe Miniſtery by Chriſts command all the multitude and his very fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were to attend <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. 2. 3. So that there was no ſeparation then to be made from the publicke Aſſemblies where the Law and Goſpell was taught, nor no gathering of new Churches, under pretence of eaſting them into a Church mould according to the New teſtament forme. Chriſt and his Diſciples were not then ſo deepely learned as to be in that high
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48122:134"/>
forme of Divinity; Chriſts followers notwithſtanding were all Goſpell Chriſtians, and were all in a Church way, and I am ſure of it, in the right way to heaven, <hi>if the way, the truth and the life</hi> could teach them the ſtraight way thither: and yet they all followed the old lights ſtill, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; Chriſt and his Apoſtles were all their Maſters; we heare then of no new lights, nor new borne truths, nor of new Church moulds, and yet <hi>then the Kingdome of heaven ſuffered violence, and the violent tooke it by force Matth.</hi> 11, 12. they went all well to Heaven, as well and as cheerfully as any of our Independents with their new lights, and their congregationall way. But this by the by.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay if there were ſuch multitudes, both of Hearers and Teachers, there was without all doubt many places for them ſeveally to heare in, and it ſtands withall reaſon that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſtrange Nations had Synagogues by themſelves, and ſuch men to Teach unto them in their own language as they could underſtand, or elſe they could not have been edified, and there is very good ground to induce men to beleeve that I now ſay: For if there was a Synagogue in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> of the Libertines, (as there was) that is to ſay of thoſe that had beene ſlives and bond-men, but were made free, then can any man beleeve that all thoſe ſeverall Nations of the free-men, that abounded alſo with wealth and honour, (or elſe if they had not had great riches, they could never have journied ſo about from Country to Country and tranſported their families thither) I ſay in all theſe regardes it ſtands withall reaſon that they had their particular Synagogues alſo, and therefore that they were in mighty multitudes, ſo that a few places could not containe them all to communicate in all Acts of worſhip, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity in Chriſt his time they were diſtributed into many and ſeverall Congregations; and all this I ſay beſides the holy Scripture very reaſon dictats to any man but Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> and their fraturnity who all deny, that there were either in Chriſts life time or after his death more Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and believers in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> then could meete in one place or congregation, notwithſtanding the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayeth, <hi>that there was a world of believers there and that all</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the very City was full of them.</hi>

I referre therefore that which I have now ſpake, to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the judicious and learned, whether we ought rather to believe the Holy Scripture of truth, which was indited by the Spirit of truth, or Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> who ſaith and writeth the contrary by the ſpirit of error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake for proofe of my firſt propoſion, <hi>to wit that the world that went after Chriſt were believers,</hi> which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> moſt fondly and impiouſly denyeth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition remaining to be proved is this, <hi>that there was a world of beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, and that they were inhabitants there:</hi> Now howſoever by the proving of my former propoſition, this latter alſo was included in it, and proved likewiſe as all the places above cited do ſufficiently ſhew; for the place, where the word that followed Chriſt dwelt, is ſaid to be <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> and if we but conſult with the holy Scripture, eſpecially the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> we ſhall again and again meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies there beſides thoſe I have above quoted to prove the ſame; ſo that it may be thought a needleſſe work in particular to prove this ſecond propoſition, ſeeing it is already evinced in the former; yet becauſe Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath made them two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hath peremptorily delivered it, that there was not a world of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> I will, to gratifie him and to ſatisfie any that will be ſatisfied, prove this propoſition alſo diſtinctly and ſeverally by it ſelfe: <hi>viz.

for the 5 Members, there was not a woman or a child that had a head as big as a crab, but cryed for the Priviledges of Parliament, &amp; commonly as the cock crows, ſo crows the hen &amp; the chickens. And by all probability it was at that time in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in reſpect of Chriſt, as it was then here in reſpect of the Parliament; the generality of all the inhabitants believed in him and honoured him, as the people generally in the city did the Parliament; which is yet more evident from the great indignation and wrath of the Prieſts and Scribes who were diſpleaſed to ſee the wonderfull things he did, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that they heard the children crying in the Temple ſaying, <hi>Hoſanna to the ſonne of David;</hi> by which they well perceived that the children ſpake no otherwiſe then their fathers would have them, and that the whole city of Inhabitants were ſuch as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him.

But the eleventh of <hi>Mar.</hi> puts all out of doubt, for that chapter ſpeaks plainly of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and Dwellers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> as well as of the ſtrangers that came to the Feaſt, where it is ſaid there were two mighty parties, either of which ſo awed the Scribes, chiefe Prieſts and all the enemies of Chriſt, that they durſt not meddle with him, and the one of them was ſuch as adhered unto Chriſt and beleeved his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo that although <hi>Chriſts</hi> enemies ſought to deſtroy him, <hi>yet they feared him, becauſe,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, ver. 17. <hi>all the people were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine,</hi> that is all the people approved of it, and beleeved in him, <hi>for he taught as one having authority</hi> Matth. 7. The other party were <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Diſciples all beleevers too; for it is there aſſerted, <hi>that all men compted</hi> John <hi>that he was a prophet indeed,</hi> ver. 32. And this party alſo kept the chief Prieſts the Scribes and the Elders, Chriſts capitall enemies, in ſuch awe, as they durſt not attempt any thing againſt Chriſt; and all theſe were inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> For it is ſaid in the 28 verſe, <hi>that all the people were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine:</hi> and it is ſaid ver. 32. <hi>that all men counted</hi> John <hi>a Prophet indeed:</hi> Now then if all the people of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and all the men of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> theſe two migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty parties and both believers be put together, and were inhabitants there as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The reader may remember that in his former reply, he ſeemed not to doubt concerning the number of thoſe that were baptized, onely he denyed that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn, were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and that they were caſt into a Church mould after the New Teſtament forme, much leſſe that they were members of one Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church at</hi> Jeruſalem; theſe are his own words and by this hee thought to overthrow that argument: Now here he uſeth another method; tacitly denying the Minor of all my Syllogiſmes; and the reaſon of his denyall is, becauſe as he ſpeaketh, I made falſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; he thinks me, it ſeemes, like the Independents, who would perſwade the ſimple that all are Independent; and amongſt other things he ſaith that I gave the Independents occaſion ſhrewdly to ſuſpect my ignorance. But I will ſet down his whole babble at larg and in his owne termes and words, and his full anſwer to all my laſt arguments as it is page 9, 10. of his Pamphlet. His words are theſe.</p>

where the Doctor having got a multiplying glaſſe in his hand, goes on to make ſtrange diſcoveryes of the increaſe of Chriſtian believers. <hi>pag. 36.</hi> he tells us, that Chriſt made many more Diſciples and Beleevers then <hi>John,</hi> and added dayly unto the Church, that was then in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.

Secondly that Chriſt ſhould adde day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Church that was in Ieruſalem; is not this a marvellous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation and miſtake to apply that which was done by the Diſciples after Chriſts aſcenſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>If I ſhould diſcover all the errors that are in this reply, I might make a very large volume: but in regard that all learned men will eaſily perceive the vanity, childiſhneſſe and horrid impiety of the man in the very reading of it: I ſhall not be ſo larg in my anſwer as otherwiſe I had thought to have been: and yet before I come to it, I cannot but complain of the diſhoneſty of the man that thus cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taileth my arguments every where, not plainly ſetting them down, that the people may ſee my reaſons; but this is the ordinary way of his diſputing who conceales the truth from the ignorant and ſimple that he may the better poyſon them with his errors and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltyes. After the very ſame manner dealeth my brother <hi>Burton</hi> with me, as we ſhall ſee in its due place, who paſſing by all my arguments not ſo much as mentioning any one of them, makes a <hi>rombobombo Syllogiſme</hi> of his own, which as I ſuppoſe he fetcht out of the howling wilderneſſe of <hi>America,</hi> and then with <hi>Phocions</hi> hatchet, that carnall weapon, he fights with his own ſhaddow, and vapors like a conquerour as <hi>I.

               <p>But now for anſwer briefly, I affirme that <hi>I.

                  <hi>not all meete in one place or Congregation to injoy all Acts of worſhip,</hi> I ſay in his confuting of my arguments he doth not ſo much diſpute againſt me, as he doth againſt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt and the very Scripture; for the diſcoveries I made by my multiplying glaſſe (as he ridiculouſly ſpeaketh) of the increaſe of Chriſtian believers, <hi>were no falſe muſters,</hi> (as he chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhly ſcibleth) for I diſcovered only and declare unto all men that increaſe of Chriſtian believers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that the holy Word of God aſſerteth, <hi>Iohn</hi> the 4. where it is recorded, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>That Chriſt made more Diſciples and believers then</hi> Iohn; <hi>and therefore added daily to the Church that was then in</hi> Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>ſuch as ſhould be ſaved; for Chriſt came to ſave the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael: Now the <hi>making of more Diſciples</hi> is the adding of more to the church: and this the Scripture holdeth out not only to me but to all intelligible <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and therefore it was no error in me to affirme the ſame: So that whiles <hi>I. S.</hi> laboureth to confute my Arguments, he fights indeede againſt the Evangeliſt that <hi>affirmeth that Chriſt made mo Diſciples then</hi> Iohn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſayeth he,</hi> here are two Paradoxes. Firſt, that Chriſt made mo Diſciples then <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould adde dayly to the Church that was then in Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>Theſe in <hi>I. S.</hi> his opinion are paradoxes, that is matters of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibry in his dialect. Yet both theſe truthes I ſpake of, are cleere out of the Word of God, and therefore whiles he wounds me, he vulnerateth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and blaſphemeth, for he giveth the Spirit of God the lye, and denyeth the Scripture that aſſerts that <hi>Chriſt made mo Diſciples then John,</hi> and therefore added more unto the church: for of unbelievers and of enemies they were made Diſciples, Chriſtians and friends; and therefore taken out of the world and brought into Chriſts fold and church, and by that worke of converſion they were added to it; as he that ſhould this day take any of our Miniſters and faithfull Paſtors ſheep out of their folds and ſteale them away, (as too too many of the Independent Miniſters daily do) and bring them into their new congregations, may not that Independent Miniſter, without any marvilous anticipation or miſtake, or without any error, truly be ſaid to have added ſo many more to his new
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48122:137"/>
church, when the number of his members is thus increaſed? And if another Miniſter be joyned with him as a teacher in that congregation or ſucced him, if he alſo ſhall run plundering about both city and country, as a gifted brother, and bring in a great many more poore ſilly ſheepe into his fold then the other did, as they are notable cunning theeves, may not it truly be ſaid of him and that without any marvilous anticipation, and miſtake, that he alſo added unto the church, when ſtill the the number is daily increaſed? I am confident that all men of ſound reaſon will ſay there is no error in all this! And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope by all the judicious I ſhall be free from any blame or error, in that I ſaid thoſe that were converted by Chriſt and made Diſciples by his Miniſtry, were added to the church and to thoſe that were formerly converted by the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> But ſaith <hi>J. S.</hi> how <hi>could Chriſt</hi> make mo Diſciples then <hi>Iohn?</hi> Out of whom ſhould he make them ſaith he, <hi>when</hi> Iohn <hi>had ſwept all along with him as the Doctor affirmeth pag.</hi> 32. <hi>Not taking it Synecdochically?</hi> Thus he ſhewes his acumen or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his vanity in contradicting the Scripture and abuſing me. For he that hath ever read my booke, and looks but in the 31 page toward the lower part, ſhall finde theſe words, <hi>That</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>went out to</hi> Iohn <hi>and was baptized; it muſt therefore by a Synecdoche be taken for all the common people promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, or for a mighty multitude of all ſorts, and of all ranks of people, and of all profeſſions, as Publicans, Souldiers and the ordinary inhabitants:</hi> Theſe were my very words there. And therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaying that I took not the word Synecdochically, belyeth me, befooleth himſelfe and abuſeth the reader, and fights with his own phancy. But for anſwer to his whibling Cavill, I ſay Chriſt converted thoſe he made his Diſciples and Schollers, out of the remmant or remainder of thoſe that were yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and in that work he added more unto that church, which though the mother church, as the other were Daughter churches through all <hi>Iuda,</hi> yet it was but a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular church, in that Nationall church; for the being a Nationall church doth not exclude as this man fondly conceits, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches from bearing the name of church, no more then the Catholike viſible church doth deny the name of church to any particular churches, becauſe they being ſimilar parts do
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48122:138"/>
partake both of the name and nature of the whole, as all the learned and Orthodox Divines do hold. And therefore taking <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> Synecdochically as I then did, it is alſo here to be ſo taken, and then Chriſt did make mo Diſciples out of the people of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that remained yet unconverted, then <hi>Iohn</hi> had done before him, and added them unto the church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> that particular mother church in that Nationall church, which as it was at that time in reſpect of morall worſhip go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernd by a Colledge of Elders or Presbyters as the Scripture everywhere relateth, which is called a church, ſo it was ever after governed by a Presbytery, all thoſe Synagogues and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall churches being all combind together under the rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of that Presbytery, and making all but one church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its precinct, after which manner all the other city churches throught <hi>Iudea</hi> following the example of this mother church were ever to be governed to the end of the world; and this is indeed the true chuch mould, according to the New Teſtament forme, that all churches ought to be caſt into, if we will imitate the government of the mother church <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and all the daughter churches both in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> as that of <hi>Samaria</hi> and into this mould did the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> caſt all they converted. Therefore when I ſaid <hi>that Chriſt made more Diſciples in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem then</hi> Iohn, <hi>and that he added them unto that Church,</hi> I ſpeake nothing but that I have warrant for out of the good Word of God and the Scripture of truth, and which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently backt and corroborated alſo by all ſound reaſon: And therefore, it is wickedneſſe in I.<hi>S.</hi> to ſay that in ſo ſpeaking it is a paradox. For if it be a matter of ludibre in me and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox to ſay that Chriſt made more Diſciples then <hi>Iohn,</hi> Then likewiſe it is a paradox and matter of laughter in the holy Evangeliſt: For he in formall words ſaith, <hi>That Ieſus made and baptized moe Diſciples then</hi> Iohn. I referre my ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto the judgement of all honeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> godly minded men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> be not as well cenſured and traduced by this vaine and wicked fellow as my ſelfe, and whether in his ſo ſpeaking he doth not give the Spirit of God the lye.</p>
               <p>And his ſecond paradox is as vaine and childiſh and impious as this, where he ſaith, <hi>is not this a marvelous anticipation</hi> and miſtake, <hi>to apply that which was done by the Diſciples after</hi>

                     </gap>mo Diſciples then the</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>and in making them added them unto the Church at</hi> Ieruſalem, There is no marvelous anticipation or miſtake, as <hi>I. S.</hi> unlearnedly inferrs; for in giving unto Chriſt his due honour and affirming he added unto the Church that was then in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, I</hi> have both the Scripture and reaſon for it, and in ſo ſpeaking <hi>I</hi> detract nothing from the honor and dignity of the Diſciples; for it is no error in any man, to apply that unto Chriſt Miniſtery, viz. the converſion of men and the adding of them to the church, which worke, properly and primarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto him, though in a Metaphoricall ſenſe it may alſo be attributed unto the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpell. And therefore the miſtake is in <hi>I. S.</hi> and not in me; for he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that unto the Diſciples which was done by Chriſt, <hi>for it is ſaid the Lord added unto the Church dayly ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> It was done by Chriſt, and not the worke of the Apoſtles, but inſtrumentally; and therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> is a prevaricator, in many reſpects ſinning both againſt God and man: for here, he giveth that honour which is peculiar unto Chriſt, unto the Diſciples; and then he falſly accuſeth me of an error and miſtake when there is none, and then would make me guilty of his own ſins, which I am free from, as all they that read my booke in the page quoted by him may ſee; and this is not all, but in this alſo he is a great offender, where by this jugling craft of his, he labours to ſeduce the poore people. But for farther anſwer, I have learned of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, that the Diſciple is not above his Maſter; and therefore if <hi>I. S.</hi> will apply the worke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and adding of Diſciples to the Church, unto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Apoſtles after <hi>Chriſts</hi> aſcenſion as he doth, I do not conceive it any paradox in me or any miſtake or Anticipation to apply that worke unto <hi>Chriſts</hi> Miniſtry in his life time: for the Maſter is ever more to be honoured then the ſervant as all reaſon will dictate: and therefore there was no paradox in me in giving that honour unto Chriſt that belonged unto him who was the Maſter: <hi>for he came to ſave the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, and ſo he did, gathering daily ſome of them into his fold, and adding many more ſheepe to thoſe that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> had converted: and therefore I do not think it a paradox in me
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48122:139"/>
to give as much honour to the Maſter, as <hi>I. S.</hi> doth to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ſervants: for the honour of converſion and adding unto the church is a work primarily belonging to the Lord and Prince of the Church Jeſus Chriſt. It is great raſhneſſe therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very unchriſtian dealing in <hi>I. S.</hi> to make mee a ſubject of his ſcorne and ludibry for well doing, and to make that a ſinne and error in mee, which is a vertue; for to give Chriſt his due honour is a vertue; now the honour of converting of men, and adding them unto the Church is his proper work, and it peculiarly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto him firſt and laſt <hi>to adde unto the Church ſuch as ſhould bee ſaved:</hi> The Apoſtles were but the Inſtruments. <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but God the Lord of his Church giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Hee maketh the Church grow and multiply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mighty numbers, and <hi>adds daily unto it, by the mighty working of his Spirit, and it is marvellous in our eyes:</hi> And therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> is ſeverely to be cenſured and that deſervedly, not only for abuſing his brethren, making them offenders when they are not, but chiefly for anticipating that honour which is onely due unto Chriſt and God, and giving it and attributing it unto men, as it is the daily practiſe of the Independents to give the glory of all victories which only belongeth unto God, to the party which they call the <hi>praying army;</hi> and ſo hee aſcribeth that honour that peculiarly belongeth unto God and Chriſt, unto the Apoſtles, which indeed pertaineth unto them only as they are inſtruments, and accuſeth me as of an anticipation and miſtake, ſaying, <hi>I aſcribed that unto the Miniſtry of Chriſt himſelfe, which belonged unto the Diſciples of Chriſt after his aſcenſion.</hi> It ſeemes to <hi>I.

S.</hi> had beene guilty of, hee would never have beene ſo unadviſed as to have oppoſed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, and all ſolid and learned men in ſpeaking ſo raſhly.</p>
               <p>And now I referre all that I have hitherto ſaid by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> to the judgement of the learned to conſider, whether there is either honeſty or reaſon in theſe men, who to maintaine their fond errors, wil deny or affirme any thing, though never ſo repugnant to the Scripture, and to the very light of reaſon, and all this only to miſlead the ignorant people; and this is all that <hi>I. S.</hi> hath to ſay againſt my Arguments drawn from the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts and his Apoſtles Miniſtry, by which I proved, <hi>that in the very dayes of</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt and in Chriſts time there were then many more beleevers in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>then could all meet in any one Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the following Arguments, by which I proved it was much more impoſſible for them to meet together, after there were daily added ſo many thouſands to the Church after Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the miracles and Miniſtry of the bleſſed Apoſtles, and Chriſts ſeventy Diſciples, and the other Miniſters of thoſe times: <hi>I. S.</hi> doth not ſo much as meddle with them, but ſaith pag. 10. <hi>That he had thought to have beſtowd as much time on the reſt, but that other conſiderations forbad him;</hi> and becauſe (as he ſaith) <hi>there were thoſe ſo able already ingaged in the Diſpute: theſe are his words.</hi> And in his wiſe Epiſtle to me, he ſaith <hi>that his health forbade him.</hi> Now what a vaine fellow is this to vapour that he <hi>had whipped me out of the field, and beat up my quarters, and quartered my book, and taken hold of the pillars of my diſcourſe and ſhaken them, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne my building,</hi> as yee may ſee at large in the title page, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48122:140"/>
in his Epiſtle to mee? and yet in the tenth page of his Booke the place above quoted, and in the ſame Epiſtle hee confeſſeth, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of body and other conſiderations forbad him to beſtow any more time upon the Booke, and ſaith in expreſſe termes <hi>he left the worke to others;</hi> whether therefore this be not a worthleſſe and witleſſe Fellow to brag and glory of a victory, and beating up of a mans quarters, when hee hath only flung a ſquib or two at them a farre off, and then cowardly and baſely ran away pretending ſickneſſe as freſh water ſouldiers commonly uſe to doe, I leave it to the judgement of others to conſider. But of <hi>I. S.</hi> I may truly ſay thus much, that hee is a meere quagmire of ignorance, and wicked impudency, and farre unfit for any ſerious or ſolid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, much leſſe to be a Captaine or Commander in Chriſts Armies. I doe not deny, but hee may make a prettie ſouldier at an Independent Feſtivity; and I beleeve that were it to ſhake or pull downe the pillars of a March-pane, or to beat up the quarters of a Cuſtard, to breake up a Wood-cock, or to ſtorme a Veniſon Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, or to plunder a Banquet, that in the Militia of good cheer he would doe very well: but notwithſtanding I would have <hi>I. S.</hi> being now in a courſe of Phyſick and of an infirme body, to uſe ſome moderation when hee comes where good cheer is ſtirring; and therefore becauſe <hi>hee thinkes that my judgement in ſuch matters may be worthy of ſome account,</hi> for ſo hee intimateth in his learned Epiſtle; I would adviſe him for a time to feed upon Snayl pyes and Muſhromes, and of thoſe kind of creatures hee may find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance about the Wels at <hi>Tunbridge;</hi> that low kind of diet is beſt for him; &amp; if he followes this now in the ſpring but ſome weekes, and drinks luſtily of the waters there, they will waſh him till hee be cleane and fit for my fingring againe, and free him from his Frenſie, and make him as cleane and neat, as he ſaith my Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript hee left in thoſe waters will be. And this is the counſell I give unto <hi>I. S. gratis,</hi> for all his learned paines in beating up my quarters. And ſo I have done with him at this time. I have now a few things yet to anſwer to what Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> hath to ſay to thoſe Arguments I rayſe from the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and the multitudes converted by them after Chriſts Aſcenſion, which yee ſhall find punctually ſet downe in their due places.</p>
               <p>I will now therefore take a ſurvey of the numbers that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church, and to thoſe Beleevers that were converted by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48122:141"/>
                  <hi>Iohns</hi> &amp; Chriſts Miniſtry, by the powerfull preaching and miracles of the Apoſtles after Chriſts Aſcenſion; and from the divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I ſhall gather out of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, frame ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſhall make it yet more evident, that there were ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem, as they could not all poſſibly meet together, at one time, or in one place or roome, or in one Congregation, to injoy all the Ordinances, and partake in all acts of worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but muſt neceſſarily be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, if they would all be edified,</hi> and that <hi>before the perſecution</hi> wee reade of in the Acts 3. 1. and <hi>in the perſecution,</hi> and <hi>after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</hi> But before I come to the proofe of the particulars, I muſt anſwer to ſome objections made by our brethren the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; the firſt of the which is, out of the firſt chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, from which they indeavour to prove, <hi>that the number and multitude of Beleevers in the Church of</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>was not ſo great, but that they might all meet in one roome or place, and in one congregation to partake in all acts of worſhip.</hi> The words on which they ground their Arguments are theſe: <hi>and in thoſe dayes</hi> Peter <hi>ſtood up in the middeſt of the Diſciples and ſaid, (the number of the names together, were about an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) men and brethren,</hi> &amp;c. From whence they conclude, that the whole Church in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that is to ſay, all the Beleevers, did meet in one place; for in this number of names they would have all the whole Church in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> included or confined; which to moe is a wonder, that ſuch learned men as many of them are, ſhould ſo argue; for this muſt be the ſcope of the Argument if they intend to prove, <hi>That the whole Church in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and all the Beleevers there, were not ſo numerous, but that they might all meete in one place, and partake in all acts of worſhip, and that theſe in</hi> Peters <hi>Company were all that Church, and all the Believers that were in Ieruſalem:</hi> this, I ſay, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be their meaning, or elſe their Argument concludes nothing to the purpoſe. The invalidity of the which, I am moſt confident will by and by evidently appeare (though all the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the contrary ſhould not ſo much as be thought of) and withall, it will alſo be obvious to any judicious man, that in all reſpects their Argument makes much againſt themſelves. For if I ſhould grant unto them, <hi>That at this inſtant of time that that place ſpeakes of the whole Church in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>or the number</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:48122:141"/>
                  <hi>then of Beleevers were no more but that one place might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them all for the enjoying of all Ordinances (which I cannot doe, for innumerable reaſons, and ſome of them above ſpecified) yet it doth not follow nor evince, that after there were daily ſuch additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Believers, and ſuch multitudes of new Converts added unto the Church, that then alſo, one place or roome could containe them all; and that they might ſtill meet in one Congregation, and all together partake in all acts of worſhip.</hi> For there is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene one hundred and twenty names (for there was no more in this aſſembly) and in many ten thouſands, which all the World knowes could not bee contained in any one place of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to communicate in all the Ordinances, though that place had equalized the moſt magnificent Structure that ever the World yet ſaw; eſpecially, they could not have all met there to edification, for they could not have all heard and underſtood: and wee know that in the Church, all muſt be done to edification, and this would rather have hindred the mutuall edification of the aſſembly, and have brought a confuſion, rather then any profit or benefit unto them. But the truth is, the number of names here ſpoken of, if wee will goe to the genuine interpretation of the place, not to ſpeake of the univerſall conſent of all the learned Interpreters, who gather that in this aſſembly, the ſeventy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the Lord Jeſus ſent out to preach through all Judes, and all thoſe other Miniſters of the Goſpel that had beene Chriſts, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſts Diſciples, every one of the which was thought fit for learning and divine knowledge, to ſucceed <hi>Iudas</hi> in his Apoſtleſhip and to be a Diſciple; all theſe or moſt of them, or ſuch like, were thoſe that are included in the number of names. I ſay, to omit this Interpretation of all the moſt Orthodoxe Divines, and their univerſall agreement and harmony in their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Commentaries about this portion of Scripture, the very words themſelves following ſhew they were ſelect and eminent men, and men of note, and Diſciples of longeſt ſtanding; and all of them or the moſt of them Miniſters and Preachers themſelves; and were indeed the Presbyters of the Church, to whom with the Apoſtles, the power of ruling was committed; and who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, and without the conſent of the common multitude of Beleivers, had power to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſaith S. <hi>Peter, of theſe men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Ieſus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptiſme of Iohn, unto that ſame day he was taken up from us, muſt one be ordained to be a witneſſe with us of the reſurrection. And they appointed two, &amp;c. and they prayed, &amp;c. and they gave forth the Lots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. all buſineſſes here were managed and carryed in an Ariſtocraticall and Presbyterian way, and all was done by a joynt conſent and the common councell of them all. Here wee finde none of the multitude of the people, though Beleevers; here were no Women that gave forth their lots. Neither doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſay, Men, Mothers, and Brethren; or Men, Women, and Brethren; or Men, Brethren, and Siſters; but <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> For howſoever in the foregoing Verſes it is ſaid, <hi>that theſe</hi> (meaning the Apoſtles and Elders) <hi>all continued with one accord in prayer and ſupplication, with the women, and Mary the Mother of Jeſus, and with his Brethren,</hi> by which they fitted themſelves for the Miniſtery after they ſhould receive the Holy Ghoſt; though I ſay, they joyned with them in thoſe duties of humiliation and prayer, which any women may do, in the ſociety and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of godly Miniſters: yet when they went about other acts of Church government, as chooſing of an Apoſtle, then the Apoſtles and Elders onely by themſelves, to whom the power of the Keyes was given, ordered that buſineſſe, and left the Women to their private devotions, and their ſeverall imployments: for in this action of giving forth their lots, there is no mention of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And it is manifeſt from the Text it ſelfe, that this chooſing of <hi>Matthias</hi> was at another time, and without all doubt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſet day for this purpoſe; for it is ſaid Verſe 15. <hi>And in thoſe dayes Peter ſtood up in the middest of the Diſciples, and ſaid Men and Brethren.</hi> Here was onely Diſciples, Men and Brethren, and no Siſters. Till Pope <hi>Joans</hi> time, and our dayes, <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes never hung at any womans Girdle; and we heare not in Scripture that they had any voyce in chooſing of Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>officers, and admi ting of members into the Church, or caſting out of any, till theſe unhappy times; an uſurpation not beſeeming that Sex, as afterwards in its due place I hope to make appear. But this by the way.</p>
               <p>Now to the matter in hand, I ſay it is apparent to any that will not ſhut their eyes, that all thoſe, or moſt of them that were in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48122:142"/>
                  <hi>Peters</hi> company, and at that time met together, were capable of an Apoſtleſhip, and ſuch as were the moſt eminent of all Chriſts followers, and ſuch as were beſt inſtructed in Chriſtian Religion, as having been bred up in the doctrine of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and under the Miniſtry of Chriſt himſelfe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of his Church; and therefore they were the Teachers of the Church and people, who were their flock which they all fed in common: And from thence it argueth, <hi>That the multitude of Beleevers in Ieruſalem was not onely a diſtinct company from them, but that it was exceeding great and numerous, that had ſo many Paſtors and Teachers over them:</hi> For if they had been but ſo ſmall a company as is here mentioned, and that the whole Church had conſiſted but of ſixſcore names, then the Paſtors exceed the number of the flocke; which is not onely abſurd to thinke, but againſt the evident truth of the holy Scriptures, which relate unto us multitudes upon multitudes <hi>that were day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted by the miniſtery of</hi> John <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>and of Chriſt and his Apostles, and added unto the Church before this their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that by this I have now ſaid, it is moſt clear and evident, that all or moſt of theſe, were the moſt eminent Miniſters of the Goſpell, and the Presbytery of the Church. But in this, that our Brethren do acknowledge, <hi>That this aſſembly here spake of were the church,</hi> it makes as much againſt them, and greatly for us: for it is manifeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Text, that they were the Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpell, and in that they give them the name and title of the Church, it followeth that the repreſentative body and Presbytery is a Church, and that to them onely belongs the power and authority of the Keyes: according to that of our Saviour in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17, 18. <hi>Tell it unto the Church, &amp;c. and whatſoever ye binde on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever ye looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> By which words, all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is put into the true Miniſters hands; ſo that they onely have the power and authority of ordaining Paſtors and Presbyters among themſelves; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſufficiently declares in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> and that they have not onely the title of the Church, but a Charter and Warrant alſo granted unto them of ruling and governing the Church, and of ordaining Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and that by joynt and common conſent among themſelves,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48122:143"/>
without the helpe and aſſiſtance of the people and congregations under them, which by God were never joyned in commiſſion with them.</p>
               <p>And howſoever <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 6. for the taking away the ſcandall in going to Law before unbeleevers, gave them liberty to make choyce of ſomethat were <hi>leaſt eſteemed in the Church, for the deciding of their controverſies;</hi> yet that did not authorize them to make choyce of all other Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; for he limits them <hi>to go no farther then to the choyce of ſuch as are of leaſt eſteeme.</hi> And howſoever likewiſe, the Apoſtles in the 6. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> to free themſelves from all impediments, that they might the better attend upon their Miniſteries, and that without interruption they might Preach the Goſpell, gave them liberty to chuſe their Decons and Deconeſſes: yet they preſcribe the Rule by which they ſhall chuſe them, and keep the authority of ordaining them ſtill in their own hands: <hi>Looke you out among you,</hi> ſay they, <hi>men of honest report, full of the holy Ghoſt, and wiſedome, whom we may appoint over this buſineſſe,</hi> and when they had choſe ſuch, ſaith the Scripture, <hi>They put them before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</hi> So that howſoever they gave unto them a Liberty to chuſe, yet it was with limitation, not an abſolute liberty; for if they had choſe men that had not been of <hi>approved honeſty, well gifted, and wiſe, and qualified as they appointed,</hi> it was arbitrary in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to reject their choyce; for they keep the power of Ordination ſtill in their own hands, and to them it did belong to ratifie their Election; ſo that the people had not the power of Ordination then, nor have not to this day, no not of the meaneſt Deacon or Deaconeſſe, that belongs onely unto the Presbytery, much leſſe have they power of ordaining Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Indeed for the deciding of controverſies and differences, they have a liberty given them of making choiſe of ſome petty men amongſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they may do without the Presbytery; but they have no power of Ordination. Neither did I ever yet read in the Sacred Scriptures that the people or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation had any hand at all in chooſing of Miniſters and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, neither were they fit for that imployment; for it is one thing to judge of mans externall carriage and manners, and another thing of his ſufficiency for his indowments and abilities
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48122:143"/>
of learning, and that men of learning and knowledge onely can do, and the Sons of the Prophets; and it is in ſpeciall given in charge to the Presbyters and Miniſters, as it is manifeſt in the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. And they onely know how rightly to examine them, in the knowledge of the tongues and Sciences, and ſuch Arts as are requiſite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the knowledge of the holy Scripture; all which are little enough for the making of a Miniſter compleat and fit for that Sacred imployment. And all the Primitive Churches in the Apoſtles times willingly ſubmitted themſelves to what the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery then did, and aſſented to their choyce, as in the 14. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſ. 23. it appeareth.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, in that our brethren do acknowledge this company this hundred and twenty names, to be a church, and in that it is alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſt, that they are conſidered in a diſtinct notion from the people, which alſo in the holy Scriptures, when they are joyned with their Miniſters, are called a church (as is frequently to be ſeen through the acts of the Apoſtles) and in that it doth abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by what hath formerly been ſpoken, and will yet in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe be farther elucidated, <hi>that there were many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Aſſemblies of beleevers in the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>and that they were all governed by the joynt conſent and Common Councell of the Apoſtles and Presbyters, to whom the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſubject; who were ſent this way and that way by their direction, and to whom they were to give an account of their Miniſtery,</hi> as we ſee in divers places in the <hi>Acts, and were ordered by them, what they ſhould do, and alſo made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals unto the Apoſtles and Presbyters in any buſineſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concernment:</hi> I ſay, in all theſe reſpects, it is evident, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>conſiſted of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, and was yet but one Church, and that governed by a Presbyterian Government, and by a Common Councell of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to whoſe order all the ſeverall Congregation were to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves;</hi> And therefore this their Argument maketh much againſt them and greatly for us. And this ſhall ſuffice to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to this their firſt Objection; which, to ſpeak the truth, is that that carrieth the moſt appearance of any Argument they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to prove their Aſſertion and tenent: for all their other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raiſed from the ſeverall meetings of the Apoſtles and people,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48122:144"/>
and from the multitude comming to them about the ordaining of Deacons, by which they would perſwade the world, <hi>That the company of Believers in the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>was not ſo numerous at any time, but that they might all meete in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or in one place, to partake of in acts of worſhip;</hi> they conſiſt moſt of them in Homonymies, and meere Paralogiſmes, which indeed beſeeme not the gravity of reverend men, and in the weighty matters of Divinity, would be undecent in a ſucking Sophiſter; and therefore are much more blameworthy in them, who by ſuch fallacies labour to amuſe the people, to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the whole Church and Kingdome, and alienating the affections of Brethren one from another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall briefly runne over them.</hi> Acts <hi>2. 46. where it is related,</hi> that the Believers and new Converts continued daily with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe. <hi>From theſe words the Brethren conclude,</hi> That the multitude of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was not ſo great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that they might all meete in one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and in one place, to partake in all acts of worſhip; <hi>for here in expreſſe words, the place where they met is ſpecified, and it is ſaid</hi> to be the Temple. <hi>I appeale to the wiſdome of any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, or but of a rationall Chriſtian, whether this be a candid or ingenuous way of arguing;</hi> That becauſe <hi>3000.</hi> Chriſtians that were newly converted might meet together in the Temple of Jeruſalem, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that believed in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that were converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and all that believed by Chriſts miniſtery and miracles, and all that were converted by the Apoſtles, and the ſeventy Diſciples before Chriſts ſufferings, and all that were after his Reſurrection converted for twenty years together, by the Miniſtry of all the Apoſtles, and all the other Miniſters of the Goſpell, they might yet all meete in any one place or Congregation, to partake in all acts of worſhip, and to edification. <hi>I refer this, I ſay, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of any Learned man, or any intelligible</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be an ingenuous way of arguing. I believe if one ſhould argue againſt them after the ſame manner, they would laugh at him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If one ſhould thus diſpute;</hi> Within theſe ſeven years, all the Independents continued daily with one accord in ſuch a place, and they all met together in one congregation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is but one congregation, and but one Church ſtill of Indeperdents in <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48122:144"/>
and they all meet together in one congregation. <hi>Would not the Brethren make themſelves as merry with ſuch a way of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as they have made others ſad with their way of arguing? yes doubleſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, their way of arguing is not to their owne honour, to ſpeake but favourably of it, as will appeare. For ſhould I grant unto them, that at that time this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes of, there had beene no more Believers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but thoſe hundred and twenty names ſpecified in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and theſe three thouſand new Converts; and accord alſo unto them, <hi>that all theſe did meet together in on place, and in one congregation, and did partake in all the Ordinances, which notwithſtanding</hi> I cannot grant them, for divers reaſons: for in the ſame place it is ſaid, <hi>That although they continued daily in the Temple, yet they brake bread from houſe to houſe;</hi> that is to ſay, ſome of them did daily meet to hear the Word in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then followed their ſeverall imployments, and others in private, and they had the holy Communion or Sacrament in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall houſes; from which it is manifeſtly evident, that then when there were newly added to the Church but three thouſand Believers, they had many and ſeverall congregations and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and without all doubt as the multitudes of Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, they were ſtill diſtributed into more congregations: for it is ſaid, <hi>They brake bread from houſe to houſe;</hi> that is, <hi>they had their aſſemblies and meetings in ſeverall houſes and places, beſides the Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and in thoſe ſeverall houſes, they had not only <hi>the preaching of the Word and Prayer, but the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, and communicated in all the Ordinances;</hi> which they could not do in the Temple, as afterward will appeare: and all that I now ſay is evident from the 41. Verſe of the ſame Chapter to the 47.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, ſhould I ſilence my own reaſon, and ſuffer it to ſpeake nothing; and ſhould I grantto our Brethren, <hi>that there were but three thouſand, and that theſe three thouſand Believers might all meet in one congregation, and partake in all the ordinances to edification:</hi> would it follow, that when ten thouſand were added unto them, and twenty thouſand more to them, and thirty thouſand more to all theſe; would any may think or believe, that ten thouſand men can <hi>meete in one congregation to edifie, and to partake in</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:48122:145"/>
                  <hi>all the Ordinances,</hi> much leſſe when there is ſo many thouſands more added to them, <hi>that they could ſtill meete in any one place or congregation?</hi> I thinke no man that hath not abdicated his underſtanding will ſo conclude. So that all men may ſee, not onely the weakneſſe of this argumentation, but the ſtrength of truth: For this very weapon with which they had thought to have defended themſelves, and wounded the Truth, they wound themſelves, and overthrow their own tenent; as God willing, I ſhall more fully by and by make appear.</p>
               <p>But out of Chap. 5. our Brethren conceive they have a very ſtrong and invincible Argument: where it is related, <hi>That after</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Saphira <hi>were miraculouſly taken away, for lying unto the Spirit of God;</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>That great feare came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard theſe things. And by the hands of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were many ſignes and wonders wrought among the people, and they were all with one accord in</hi> Solomons Porch. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay, they, the number of Believers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was not ſo great, <hi>but that they might all meet together in one congregation;</hi> for the place where they did meet, is ſet downe, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Solomons Porch:</hi> and it is further ſpecified, <hi>That they were all with one accord in that place.</hi> This is their Argument faithfully and truly ſet downe, and with the beſt advantage for their cauſe. But to ſpeake the truth, this kinde of arguing hath no force in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither doth it beſeem grave men, to trifle thus, in the matters of God and Religion. For ſhould I grant unto them, that all the Beleivers that then were in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and had been converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and by Chriſt, and all his Diſciples, before the Paſſion and Sufferings of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; and the three thouſand converted by the firſt Miracle and Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> after they had received the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and the five thouſand after by the ſecond Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Sermon, and after the new additions of ſo many multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Believers both of men and women, by reaſon of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle wrought upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his Wife; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miracles that the fifth Chapter ſpeaketh of; ſhould I ſay, grant that all theſe might yet have met in one place, and in any one congregation to communicate in all the Ordinances, which all reaſon forbids me to yeild to; will it follow, that when there were additions upon additions, and that of multitudes of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they might ſtill meet in any one congregation to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48122:145"/>
and have communicated in all acts of worſhip? For in all reaſon we may conceive, had we no teſtimony out of the holy Scripture to back it, that if eight thouſand were converted beſides multitudes both of Men and Women, with a few Miracles and Sermons: and if at the firſt Preaching of the Goſpell after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection there was ſuch a great encreaſe, and ſuch a multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians; all underſtanding, I ſay, perſwades, that in the ſpace of twenty years, there will be innumerable multitudes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded daily to the Church, when the miraculous working of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with the ſame doctrine ſtill continued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with all, the ſame reaſon will dictate to any man, <hi>That then the whole multitude of all thoſe Believers could not all meete together in one place, and in one congregation for edification, to communicate in all Ordinances.</hi> So that any judicious man, without the help of any great Schoole-learning, may perceive the invalidity and vanity of ſuch argumentations.</p>
               <p>And truly were it not that they are Brethren, and that I deſire in the ſpirit of meekneſſe to deale with them, I would have made it appear, that it is ſo poore a way of diſputing, that it did not beſeeme men of gravity, much leſſe of learning; and that there were many wayes to evade the dint of ſuch reaſoning, and to prove the nothingneſſe of the Argument, and that by the words of the Text: the people there ſpake of, to be in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Porch,</hi> are to be limited and confined within the number of thoſe that were converted by the laſt miracle, and ſome other new miracles of the Apoſtles, which they were then wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in <hi>Solomons Porch;</hi> for there is the place where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and they were together; and I doe acknowledge, that as many as were then, and at that time, in <hi>Solomons Porch</hi> with the Apoſtles, were of one accord. But doth this with any rationall man conclude, that every Believer in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> both Men and Women and all the Chriſtians &amp; Diſciples in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were then together in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> and in one Congregation? I am confident that no wiſe man will thinke ſo; for without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie there were then ſuch multitudes of Believers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as neither many Porches nor many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples could have contained their bodies, <hi>much leſſe could they have all met in any one congregation to edifie.</hi> But I ſay I will not deale with Brethren ſo rigidly as I might, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48122:146"/>
wave many things that I might juſtly here utter.</p>
               <p>But grant it were ſo, that now in the beginning of the Chriſtian, church and if I may ſo ſpeake in the infancy of it, <hi>That all the Believers then in Ieruſalem might all meet together in one place;</hi> doth it follow that they might ever ſo doe in ſucceeding times, when there was ſuch infinite increaſe of Chriſtians daily added to the church? all reaſon wil contradict that aſſertion. Within this ſeven yeares, as all men know, one place and congregation would have contained all the Independents; but will one place now or ten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them? And there is no man as I conceive will deny, but that the Apoſtles and thoſe Primitive Miniſters, had another manner of converting faculty then our Brethen; for the Apoſtles as it is well known did not build upon others foundations; yea, they took it as a diſparagement unto them; for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 15. of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> v. 20. affirmeth. Now our Brethren they build upon others foundations, and gather the ſheep, and them the good and the fat ſheep, with good fleeces on their backs; yea, the Velvit-ſheep, and the Pluſh-ſheepe, and the Sattin and Taffity-ſheep, out of other Sheepheards folds; and while they ſeeme to gather Churches, they ſcatter them, and the poorſheep.</p>
               <p>But I will proceed to the other Argument out of the ſixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is related, <hi>That when the number of the Diſciples was multiplyed</hi> (here we may take notice of multiplication) <hi>There aroſe a murmuring of the Greeks againſt the Hebrews, becauſe the widdows were neglected in the daily miniſtration. And the Apoſtles called the multitude of the Diſciples unto them, and gave them liberty to chooſe their Deacons, and it pleaſed the whole multitude,</hi> ſaith the Scripture. From thence our brethren conclude, <hi>That all the beleevers in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>came here together to the Apoſtles, and were then no more then could all meete in one congregation:</hi> as if our brethren ſhould thus argue; As the wheel-barrow goes rumble, rumble, even ſo is Prelaticall Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy better then the Presbyterian Government. But to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: Should I grant unto the Brethren, <hi>That at this time, all the beleevers that were in the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>did then come together, and were all in one place, and might meet in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;</hi> doth it follow, when there was a dayly increaſe of more beleevers, and that of multitudes of them (as this very chapter ſignifies) that then alſo they <hi>might all meete together in</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48122:146"/>
                  <hi>one place or in one congregation in ſucceeding ages?</hi> I ſuppoſe no man will think or believe ſo But I muſt confeſs, that I cannot grant unto them, that by the multitude of beleevers here ſpake of, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood every individuall Chriſtian, or the greateſt part of them, much leſſe that all the whole body of them came together, and that for warrantable reaſon to the contrary. For the controverſie and murmuring here ſpoken of, was not among all the Diſciples and beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but onely between two Nations of them, <hi>viz.</hi> between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Now we are informed out of the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſe 5. <hi>That there were dwelling in Ieruſalem Iews, devout men, out of every Nation under heaven:</hi> for ſo in expreſſe words, it is ſaid, of the which the <hi>Greeks</hi> were but one Nation, and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> another. So that all the Chriſtians and Beleevers of all the other Nations, were of one minde, and in good accord among themſelves, as the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters tell, and were at peace one with another, ſo that there was no murmuring amongſt them, nor no controverſie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or variance, and they all continued quiet in their ſeverall houſes, and lived in love, and were none of that multitude here ſpoken of: ſo that of neceſſity, by the multitude in this place, we are to underſtand the <hi>Greeks</hi> onely and the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> for ſo in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words it is ſpecified: and this every rationall man can eaſily perceive.</p>
               <p>Againe, by multitude here is to be underſtood not a confuſed company going in a tumultuous way, but a conſiderable number of rationall men of each differing and diſſenting party, and ſuch as were called and ſent for by the Apoſtles, as it is commonly ſeen in thoſe that go by way of complaint to petition to any councell, they ſend a competent multitude of underſtanding and able men, to grace their cauſe and to mannage the buſineſſe: and not every particular and individuall perſon, men and women to negotiate it, which could not be without mighty confuſion, which was not in this multitude: and therefore <hi>by multitude and the whole multitude,</hi> we are to underſtand, that both thoſe parties that came to negotiate this buſineſſe, were well ſatisfied with the Apoſtles Order, and they obeyed it: but from hence if any man would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and conclude, <hi>That every one of the beleeving Hebrews, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individuall beleeving Greek, that was then in Ieruſalem, and that all the Greek Church and all the Hebrew Church, both men and</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48122:147"/>
                  <hi>women, not one perſon excepted were all in one place together before the Apoſtles;</hi> the whole world would judg, that this man thatſhould thus argue, were very much craſed in his brain: but much more would it argue a great imbecillity of wit and judgment in any one, to conclude, <hi>That all the beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem were there:</hi> And unleſſe they can ſo conclude, the Argument is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, nor of any validity to evince and prove the Aſſertion of our brethren. But if I ſhould yeeld unto the brethren, theſe two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt, <hi>That all the beleeving Greeks and all the beleeving Hebrews, none excepted, were all before the Apoſtles in one place:</hi> yet ſtill this will follow, that all the beleevers of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſeverall Nation were not in this multitude and number: for they had nothing to do in the buſineſſe, for they were no parties; ſo that the Argument is nothing to the purpoſe, but a meer fallacy to delude unſtable ſoules, and to make them beleeve that bladders are Lanthorns.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſhould I grant unto the brethren, that by <hi>multitude here, and by the whole multitude,</hi> all the beleevers then in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> were to be underſtood, <hi>and that then they might all meet in one congregation:</hi> doth it therefore follow, that many years after, when there was dayly ſuch additions of multitudes of Beleevers, <hi>that they might all ſtill meet together in one place, and in one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for all acts of worſhip, and to be edified?</hi> I beleeve our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren themſelves the Independents will not grant it; yet they muſt grant it if they will ſtand to their principles.</p>
               <p>But from this murmuring between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> I, with very good reaſon, can frame an Argument to overthrow our Brethrens Tenent, and may from thence gather, <hi>That in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>there were many and ſeverall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where they had all acts of worſhip;</hi> and that every ſeverall nation had their ſeverall congregations and ſeverall aſſemblies, where they might heare the Word of God in their own language and to edification, and communicate in all Ordinances with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For if there ſhould ariſe a controverſie in <hi>London,</hi> between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> about points of Religion, or about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other matter of practice concerning Religion; and they ſhould all apply themſelves to the grave and learned Aſſembly for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of it; would not all men gather that there were two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct congregations of them in the City? So it may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48122:147"/>
againſt our Brethren, that every ſeverall Nation of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> had their ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies apart, (as well as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Hebrewes)</hi> where they might partake in all Ordinances to edification, and underſtand their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Preaching to them in their owne language. As for my part, I verily beleeve it was ſo, and from warrantable reaſons: and yet <hi>all theſe ſeverall congregations made but one Church, and were under one Presbyterie:</hi> and for this my beliefe I ſhall give my reaſons in the enſuing diſcourſe. But had there beene but one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſo many thouſand Believers as the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates there was, <hi>could not all have met in one place, and in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as all reaſon will perſwade.</hi> So that all the Arguments of our brethren to the contrary, are but as ſo many Squibs which onely make a noiſe, and then vaniſh in the ayre; to ſay no more.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the moſt rationall objections that as yet I ever heard from them, to the which I have briefly given my ſeverall anſwers, which I hope by Gods aſſiſtance I ſhall ever be able to make good againſt them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now I will goe on to prove,</hi> That by the miniſtry of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the divers miracles daily wrought by them, after they had received the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, there were ſuch additions of multitudes of Believers to thoſe that were converted by Saint <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and our Saviour and his Diſciples, before the death of <hi>John</hi> and the ſufferings of our Saviour, that they could not all meet at any one time and in one place or congregation, to partake in all Ordinances; no, nor in a few; but were of neceſſity forced to be diſtributed into ſeverall aſſemblies and congregations, and that before the Perſecution, under the Perſecution, and after the Perſecution. <hi>And for proving of what I lay downe, which is ſtill but the firſt concluſion I undertooke to make good, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the firſt eight Chapters of the</hi> Acts, <hi>and then goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the enſuing ſtory of the ſame Booke in order, to prove my aſſertion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it is related how the holy Apoſtles imployed themſelves in their ſeveral Miniſteries, after they had received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; were indued with all power of working miracles, and had received the gifts alſo of tongues and languages; and the effects alſo of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, preaching, and miracles, are there ſet downe at large: and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48122:148"/>
it is ſpecified, that by meanes of that firſt miracle, when all the people of ſeverall Nations heard the Apoſtles ſpeak to them, every one in their ſeverall tongues and languages (who were very well knowne to bee <hi>Galileans)</hi> that they were amazed to heare the wonderfull Works of God, and from their amazement it is ſaid, they gave attention to the Sermon of <hi>Peter;</hi> the Sermon it ſelfe being there ſet downe, and the effect of it, which was, <hi>That when they had heard it, they were prickt in their heart, and ſaid unto</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do? Then</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid unto them, Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins; and yee ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the ſame day were added unto them about three thouſand ſoules. And they continued ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and prayer; And feare came upon every ſoule: and many ſignes and wonders were done by the Apoſtles: and all that believed were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had all things common: and they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their meat with gladneſſe and ſingleneſſe of heart, prayſing God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> Here wee ſee, that by vertue of one Miracle and Sermon (God working with them) were added to the Believers, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and Chriſt and his Diſciples had converted, and ſuch as were formerly baptized, <hi>three thouſand more;</hi> a great Miracle: all which, with the many other that were converted afterward are called <hi>but one Church.</hi> For it is expreſly ſaid, that the <hi>Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> We heard of the great multitudes, and of a world of ſuch as beleeved in Chriſt, before this Miracle and Sermon. And can any man in reaſon conceive, <hi>that all theſe could meet in any one place or congregation, to partake in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</hi> But let us goe on. In the 3. and 4. Chapter, by means of that Miracle that was wrought upon the Impotent Man, who was knowne to all the people to have bin a Cripple from his Mothers wombe, and through the powerfull preaching of <hi>Peter,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>them to repent and to be converted, that their ſinnes might be blotted out, when the time of refreſhing ſhould come from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>that many which heard the word</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:48122:148"/>
                  <hi>believed;</hi> and the number of thoſe new Believers is there ſpecified to be about five thouſand men, which were alſo added unto the Church, and joyned to all the former Beleevers; ſo that wee have here eight thouſand new Members added unto the Church, in a very little time: and this was a greater Miracle then the former. So that the Propheſie in the 110. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> verſe 3. was now fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; <hi>That in the day of Chriſts power, his willing people from the wombe of the morning ſhould be multiplied as the Dew upon the Earth.</hi> And which is not tobe paſſed by without due notice, It is ſuppoſed by the beſt Interpreters, and the moſt orthodoxe Writers, (and there is good reaſon for it) that theſe new Converts were <hi>Men,</hi> not <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children.</hi> And without doubt, theſe new Believers endeavoured to convert their Wives, Children, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Neighbours: and there is good reaſon alſo why wee ſhould be induced to beleeve, that Truth, with ſuch wonders and miracles annexed to it, ſhould be as prevalent to convert Women, Children, Servants, and Neighbours, and whole Families; as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and novelties, in theſe our dayes, are able to miſleade thoſe poore creatures, that are ever learning, and never come to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and the which are carried about with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and beleeve every new-borne truth (as they terme it) and follow every New Light, and every new-found way, though it tend to the confuſion of the Church and Kingdome. It is ſaid <hi>of that man of Sin, that Sonne of Perdition, that hee ſhall come after the working of Satan, with all power and ſignes and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneſſe and unrighteouſneſſe in them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. But to ſee people <hi>ſo deluded without Miracles, is a Miracle.</hi> So that thoſe poore Women that are carried about with every wind of doctrine, from that truth that was taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and confirmed by ſo many Miracles; and thoſe that doe and have miſ-led them, have all of them a great deale to anſwer for. But this I ſpeake by the way, conceiving that all thoſe new Converts would endeavour, as the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman did after her converſion, not only to bring their Wives, Children, and Families, but their Neighbours alſo, and whole Cities to the ſame faith. And I have that opinion alſo of all the Women and people of that Age, that they were as ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, as the Women and people of this Age and in theſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48122:149"/>
our times are to follow errors. But let us now ſee what effects the other Miracles wrought upon the people that are related in the 5. C. as of <hi>Ananias &amp; Saphira</hi> his wife, who <hi>for tempting the Spirit of God, were both ſtricken downdead and gave up the Ghoſt;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracles wrought by the Apoſtles. It is ſaid in Verſ. 11. <hi>That fear came upon all the Church, and to as many as heard theſe things</hi> (&amp; that to the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees, the Maglinant party) <hi>durſt no man joyne himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Believers were added unto the Lord, multitudes, both of men and women:</hi> Here come in the good Women now. And in Verſe 26. it is ſaid, <hi>that the Captaine, with the Officers, brought the Apoſtles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence (for they feared the people, leaſt they ſhould have ſtoned them.)</hi> It will not be amiſſe briefly to take notice of the ſeverall effects theſe Miracles wrought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thefirſt is,</hi> That great fear of offending God came on all the Church, Gods own people; which notwithſtanding of the many additions of Believers is called ſtill but one Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond</hi> That none durſt joyne themſelves to the contrary party, the Phariſaicall malignant crew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third,</hi> That Believers were added to the Church, and that multitudes, no ſmall companies both of Men and Women. <hi>Here is a new increaſe, and that a great one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth is,</hi> that the very Captain and Officers were awed and kept in feare, by reaſon of the multitude of Believers: ſo that thoſe that feared not God were afraid of his ſervants. <hi>By which it may be gathered,</hi> That the party of Believers did ballance the number of the incredulous and Phariſacall party, if not by far exceed them, <hi>And therefore by all probability, muſt needs be an innumerable company and a mighty multitude; and ſuch a number</hi> as could not all meet in any one place or congregation, to partake in all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>And to ſay nothing of the diverſity of Tongues and Languages which were not given to the Apoſtles to be uſeleſſe and of no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; nor to ſpeake any thing of the <hi>divers Jewes that were then dwelling at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>devout Men and Women, out of every Nation under Heaven;</hi> which notwithſtanding may be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument to prove, <hi>That they all had their ſeverall meeting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and their ſeverall Miniſters to preach unto them in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Languages, that they might be edified. I ſay, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

to wave all this, let us take notice what is poſitively ſet down in the laſt Verſe of the fifth Chapter, that is, <hi>That the Apoſtles daily in the Temple and in every houſe, ceaſed not to teach and preach Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> That is to ſay, they preached both publickly and privately, and the very places where they preached are ſet down, as in the Temple, and in every houſe. So that of neceſſity, there muſt be ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies of Belivers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> according to that in the 2. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſ. the 46. where it ſaid, <hi>That they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking of bread from houſe to houſe,</hi> which by all Interpreters is underſtood the adminiſtration of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and that the ſeverall aſſemblies and congregations were wont uſually to meet in private houſes, is frequently mentiond in the holy Scriptures, as in the 16. of the <hi>Romanes</hi> verſe the 5. and in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> chap. 16. verſ. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 14. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſ. 20. ſaith, <hi>That he kept back nothing that was profitable unto them, but taught them publikely and from houſe to houſe,</hi> ſo that they had their Aſſemblies as well private as publicke, even in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where they did partake in all acts of worſhip; and in that Church alſo they had many Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and yet were but one Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now I will paſſe on to the ſixth chapter in the 1, 2, 3. and 7, verſes it is ſaid,</hi> That in thoſe dayes, when the number of Diſciples was multiplyed, there aroſe a murmuring of the Grecians againſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, becauſe their widdows were neglected in their dayly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Then the twelve called the multitude of the Diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and ſaid, It is not reaſon that wee ſhould leave the Word of God and ſerve tables. Wherefore brethren looke you out among you ſeven men of honeſt report, and full of the holy Ghoſt and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whom we may appoint over this buſineſſe. But we will give our ſelues contiunally to prayer and to the miniſtery of the Word, <hi>verſ. 7.</hi> And the Word of God increaſed, and the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> greatly, and a great company of the Prieſts were obedient unto the faith. <hi>In the which words, we may take notice briefly of theſe obſervables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, of the cunning and policy of the Devill, who when he cannot by all his wiles and ſtratagems aſſault the Church without, then he labours to aſſaile it within, as here with civill diſcords and differences among brethren: and in other Churches in all ages even
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48122:150"/>
in, and from the Apoſtles times, by diſſentions in opinions, by Sects, Schiſms, Factions, and Hereſies; and by theſe his wiles and craft, he firſt bringeth in difference in opinion, and afterwards diverſity of affection, and that among brethren; and all this he doth, that in fine, he may bring ruine upon them all. And thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> raiſing a controverſie between the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who complained <hi>That their widdows were neglected in the daily miniſtration;</hi> as either that they were not made Deaconeſſes, as the widdows of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were, or that there was not an equall diſtribution of the Almes, according to the intention of the Church, <hi>who ſold their poſſeſſions and goods to that end, that they might be parted to all men, as every one ſhould have need, Acts</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 44, 45. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 35. And this their ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the cauſe of that controverſie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond obſervable, is, To whom the differing and diſſenting parties did apply themſelves and appeal; <hi>and that was to the Presbytery or Colleage of Apoſtles,</hi> not to any one of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, but to the twelve; as in that difference at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 15. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas and certain other of the Brethren in the Church of</hi> Antioch <hi>appealed to the Apoſtles and Presbyters,</hi> and in both thoſe differences all the Churches ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>to the Apoſtles Order, and that willingly:</hi> and this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles, is the Rule for ordering of all controverſies that all the reformed Churches ſet before them; deciding all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in Religion by the Word of God, and according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident they have laid downe unto them, by the Apoſtles and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Here I ſay, the whole Presbytery and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Apoſtles determined the buſineſſe; neither do we reade, that the Aſſemblies of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> pretended their own Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent authority, though ſeverall Congregations, or challenged a power within themſelves, of chooſing their own Officers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of differences amongſt themſelves, or pleaded that they had Authority within themſelves, to make their own Laws by which they would be orderd, or that they challenged any ſuch priviledges unto themſelves, but they all appealed unto the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as the ſupreameſt Eccleſiaſticall Court, and freely ſubmitted themſelves to their arbitrement, and to the Order they ſet down, as the ſtory ſpecifieth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48122:150"/>
The third obſervable is, the imployment in which the Apoſtles were all taken up, and the effect of it; and their imployment is ſaid <hi>to be continuing in prayer and the Miniſtery, and preaching of the Word;</hi> and the effect of this their Miniſtery was, <hi>That the Word of God increaſed, and the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in Jeruſalem greatly, and a great company of the Prieſts were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the faith.</hi> By all which it is moſt apparent, that ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes being dayly added to the Church, and where there was ſuch variety of teachers, and ſo many Apoſtles, and all of them taken up in preaching; and where there was ſo many different Nations, and ſuch diverſities of tongues and languages as was in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem, they could not all meet together at any one time, or in any one place to edification, and that they might all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in all the Ordinances, but of neceſſity they muſt be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies, if they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde confuſion;</hi> and all that I now ſpeak is evident by the very light of Nature and all reaſon; and therefore it followeth, <hi>That there were many Aſſemblyes and Congregations in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and yet all made but one Church, and that that Church was Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly governed.</hi> But that I may make this truth more evidently yet appear, I will firſt out the former diſcourſe frame ſeverall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then go on to the enſuing hiſtory. And out of all theſe ſix <hi>chapters</hi> I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where there were eight thouſand new converts, beſides women and children, by vertue of ſome few miracles and Sermons, after Chriſts Reſurrection added to the Church of Ieruſalem, and the ſociety of beleevers, beſides thoſe that were convertedby John <hi>the Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſt and his Apoſtles Miniſtery, before his ſuffering; and to the which alſo there were afterwards great multitudes of Beleevers both of men and women, and a great company of the Prieſts joyned; in ſo much that they kept the very Officers and Souldiers in awe, and ſtru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k a feare and terrour into them: there they could not all meet together in any one place or Congregation, to partake in all acts of Worſhip, but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into divers Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and Congregations. But in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there were eight thouſand new converts, beſides women and children, by virtue of ſome few miracles and Sermons after Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on added to the Church and ſociety of Beleevers, beſides thoſe that were converted by John the Baptiſt, and Christ and his Apostles
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48122:151"/>
Miniſtry, before his ſufferings; and to which alſo there were after wards great multitudes of Beleevers both of men and women, and a great company of Prieſts alſo joyned; inſomuch as they kept the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officers and Souldiers in awe, and ſtruck a fear and terrour into them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They could not all meet together in any one place or Congregation, to partake in all acts of worſhip, but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into divers Aſſemblyes and Congregations if they would all be edified.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Major</hi> it is ſo evident, that I cannot beleeve that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rationall man will deny it: for who yet did ever ſee an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of above ten thouſand people in any one place or Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that could partake in all the Ordinances to edification?</hi> Yea, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this, is to fight againſt common reaſon and dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For the <hi>Minor,</hi> it is proved by the ſeverall places above quoted, and therefore the concluſion doth alſo of neceſſity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>This Argument, is ſo well grounded upon the Scripture of truth, and corroborated alſo with ſuch ſolid reaſons as it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing, that there ſhould bee any man now living in theſe dayes of light and knowledge that ſhould be either ſo ignorant or erroneous as to gainſay it; and yet learned Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> in his moderate anſwer as he calleth it, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. and 9. replyeth and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to it, by denying the <hi>Minor</hi> of my Syllogiſme for very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reaſons as his cuſtome is after this manner: I will give you his owne words which are theſe.</p>
               <p>There is no mention <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> in any Scripture quoted by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of eight thouſand new Converts beſides women and children. Neither doth that Scripture produced <hi>Acts 4. 4.</hi> prove any ſuch thing. For the Reader may conſider, that the number of them there mentioned are but five thouſand; and albeit the Dr. make them up eight thouſand, by ſaying thoſe five thouſand men were added to the Church, and joyned to the former beleevers, <hi>pag. 57.</hi> Yet there is a two-fold miſtake in the Doctors addition, to wit; firſt, that ſome of the three thouſand <hi>(may be)</hi> were women, &amp; how then can the Doctor ſay, there were eight thouſand new Converts beſides women? ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, theſe five thouſand, are only called men and not Converts, not beleevers. For howbeit many of them hearing the word belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet it is not ſaid, the five thouſand men beleeved; and the truth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the text well conſidered, only holds forth, that the number of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48122:151"/>
men was wade up five thouſand. <hi>Theſe are Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>owne expreſſions, and all that hee hath to ſay againſt this Argument, with his confuſed reaſons or rather triflings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What man but of ordinary capacity, that had but curſorily read over my Arguments, would not have obſerved the truth ſo plaine and evidently laid downe in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and confirmed with ſuch reaſons, as hee would not onely have beene well ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but would have judged it either great blockiſhneſſe in any and apparent ignorance to have yet doubted of it, or great temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and contentiouſneſſe of ſpirit to have gainſayed ſuch evident demonſtration of verity? And yet Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> out of the ſublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his learning, being a confident Diſputant, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes mee, but repels the very Scripture it ſelfe, and reſiſts the Spirit of God, which is uſually with him and his Complices, and all out of the ſpirit of error and contention to maintaine their ſeverall factions. So that it may be admired, that ſuch men are not abandoned and abhorred of all people truly fearing God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when they ſee their whole ſtudy and indeavour, is, to delude and ſeduce poore ſilly creatures. But I deſire the Reader here deliberately to weigh and conſider what the man ſaith; hee deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is any mention in any Scripture quoted by mee, of eight thouſand new Converts, beſides women and children, whereas in the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> which I cited, there is mention made of three thouſand added to the Church by the firſt Miracle and Sermon of the Diſciples, and this Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> himſelfe doth acknowledge, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. of his Pamphlet. His words are theſe. <hi>To whom were added,</hi> viz. <hi>to all thoſe that were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before by</hi> Johns <hi>and Chriſts Miniſtry about three thouſand ſoules,</hi> &amp;c. Here hee confeſſeth there were three thouſand ſoules added to the Church; neither is there any mention of women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and in the fourth Chapter hee likewiſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that the number mentioned there, is five thouſand. His words are theſe. <hi>For the Reader may conſider, that the number of them there mentioned, are but five thouſand.</hi> Thus hee. Now all the world knowes, that three thouſand and five thouſand are eight thouſand, and the Scriptures quoted by mee made mention of theſe eight thouſand, what ſo ever M. <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith to the contrary. So that no man of underſtanding, can doubt of the truth of what I aſſerted. For that which is confirmed by the teſtimony of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48122:152"/>
Scripture, were it ſingle and by it ſelfe, ought by all Chriſtians to be beleeved; but that which hath both the holy Scripture, and learned Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his owne witneſſe to confirme it, that hee cannot with any good reaſon deny, but that there was three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſoules at the firſt Miracle and Sermon of the Apoſtles after Chriſts Aſcenſion added to the Church, and five thouſand after, both the Holy Scripture affirmeth, and Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there were eight thouſand new Converts added unto the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> for theſe were diſtinct actions or effects of the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and produced at ſeverall times, and upon ſeverall occaſions, from the Miracles and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtles: for otherwiſe they would not have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch notice of as ſuch wonders, and have beene ſo diſtinctly ſet downe with all the ſeverall circumſtances both of time, place, and perſons; neither would there have beene ſuch running and going, queſtioning and conſulting about that buſines, by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Officers, as there was, if ſome new and ſtrange thing had not happend and falne out: for men doe not uſually wonder at ordinary occurrences. Now when the holy Scripture relateth this new miracle in the 4. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> as an unexpected thing and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly hapning &amp; as a matter of great admiration &amp; aſtoniſhment, yea of terrour to the enemies, from the curing of the Criple, &amp; from the preaching of <hi>Peter &amp; Iohn,</hi> &amp; aſſerteth withal, <hi>that many which heard the word, beleeved, &amp; the number of the men was about</hi> 5. <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, v.</hi> 4. It is apparently evident, that as this was a new act &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the former: ſo that the converſion of theſe five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, was a new effect and diſtinct one from the former, and is of purpoſe ſet down by the holy Ghoſt by it ſelfe ſeverally, to be taken notice of as a matter of more admiration than the converſion of three thouſand, by how much it was a greater work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, by another miracle and Sermon, to convert five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, then three thouſand. And without all controverſie, it was thus recorded with all its circumſtances for this very end, that it ſhould for ever be taken notice of, as a diſtinct miracle and work of wonder from the former. For the holy Ghoſt is very accurate in the relation of it, and very carefull that there ſhould be no miſtake in the whole buſineſſe: for in expreſſe words and termes it is ſaid, Notwithſtanding all the oppoſition that was made by the Prieſts and by the Captain of the Temple, and the ſouldiers, to hinder the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48122:152"/>
preaching of the Word, and to ſmother this miracle, <hi>yet many of them that heard the word</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>beleeved.</hi> And that there might yet be no miſtake or fallacy in the ſtory and narration, the very ſum and accompt of thoſe that were converted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by reaſon of this laſt miracle and Sermon, is ſpecified, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularized, and ſet down in theſe words, <hi>and the number of the men,</hi> (viz. <hi>that beleeved,</hi> ſaith the Scripture) <hi>was about five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi> So that the Scripture it ſelfe ſets down the number and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them <hi>men,</hi> and not women and children. And it is very ſafe alwayes to ſpeak as the word of God teacheth us. So that to any intelligible Chriſtian, there can be no doubt or ſcruple any longer left about this point. For that which God himſelfe hath dictated by his holy ſpirit and recorded in his holy word, we may not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay; but God hath dictated by his holy ſpirit and recorded it in his holy word that the multitude that was converted and believed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that new miracle and preaching of <hi>Peter &amp; Iohn</hi> was about five thouſand men; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not to be gainſaid but to be beleeved and received as an everlaſting truth by all Chriſtians. For as I ſaid before, this was a new effect or a new act and diſtinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the former; and therefore theſe five thouſand are to be conſidered by themſelves and apart. Now five thouſand and three thouſand put and joyned together make up eight thouſand, which were all added to the Church, to all the former that were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Miniſtery of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, Chriſt and his Diſciples in Chriſts life time; and therefore there is no miſtake in my addition as Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> fondly and childiſhly concludes: and his reaſons by which he would prove my miſtake, are as vaine and ſenſeleſſe. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſome of the three thouſand (may be) were women, and how can the Doctor ſay there were eight thouſand new converts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides women?</hi> Take notice I pray of the vanity of his expreſſion; <hi>Some of the three thouſand</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may be were women:</hi> and it may be they were not, and it ſtandeth with as good reaſon they were not, as any he can bring to prove they were, although I did not ſet it down as my own opinion, but ſaid onely, That it was the judgement of many learned men, that all thoſe eight thouſand that were converted by thoſe two miracles and Sermons were men, and not women and children: and therefore Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> here commits a double errour: firſt, in making that my opinion and aſcribing that to me which I onely then related as the judgement of others, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48122:153"/>
then left it in <hi>medio;</hi> that is his firſt error; his ſecond is worſe: for whereas the Holy Scripture ſaith, that there were three thouſand ſoules added unto the Church by the firſt Miracle and Sermon, and five thouſand by the ſecond, in the fourth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> peremptorily affirmeth they were but five thouſand in all, &amp; ſo gives the Spirit of God the lye; who declares there were three thouſand at one time, &amp; five at another added to the Church. But if there were but 5. thouſand in all, as M. <hi>Knollys</hi> aſſerteth, then by his own acknowledgement they were all men and not women; and ſo then I had committed no error, neither can M. <hi>Knollys</hi> convince me of an error if I had ſaid it as my own opinion that al thoſe that were converted by thoſe two Miracles, had been all men, and not women and children: For, for the five thouſand, the word of God ſaith they were all men and not women, the words are theſe in the Originall, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: the number of men (according to Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his owne interpretation) was five thouſand; and if there were five thouſand men, then not women. And wee find in the Holy Scripture that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is alwayes taken for men, as we may ſee it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and they that did eat were foure thouſandmen, beſides women and children.</hi> So that amongſt theſe five thouſand by the teſtimony of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in the judgement of Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> &amp; by his owne inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation they were all men and no women; now then if all the whole number of Beleevers that were converted by thoſe two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Sermons mounted in all but to five thouſand, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmeth they did not, and were all men as hee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, to what purpoſe then doth hee rayſe a new and needleſſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill againſt mee, becauſe I ſaid that it was the opinion of many learned men that thoſe that were converted by theſe two mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and ſermons were all men and not women and children: For I did not as I ſaid before, relate it as my owne judgement, neither did I ſay there were no women amongſt thoſe eight thouſand, but that it was the opinion of the learned, that they were all men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not women and children. But were I of as contentious a ſpirit as Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and that it tended to edification, I could bring better reaſons to prove they were men only and not women, then either he or any of his Fraternity can produce to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> himſelf ſeemeth but faintly to aſſert that there
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48122:153"/>
were any of them Women and Children: for he ſaith, <hi>it may be ſome of the</hi> 3. <hi>thouſand were women,</hi> &amp; thus he trifles in his anſwer to my firſt Argument, ſaying, <hi>it may be there were no more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in Ieruſalem at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt but the hundred and twenty names.</hi> Now all the learned know, that to ſay, it may bee there were ſome women, makes no reall conviction of a miſtake, it is but a naked and groundleſſe ſuppoſition of a miſtake, eſpecially when there may be many ſolid reaſons produced to prove they were all men and no women and children.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſuch kind of triflings are not ſufferable in any that pretend to fear God: for vain janglings and needleſſe contentions about words, is that that is condemned by the Apoſtle in all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and it troubles me not a little, that I have to do with ſuch vaine kind of creatures, whoſe cheeſe bable is about words. But notwithſtanding I ſee a providence in it: for in this, the man ſhewes but his ignorance, and whiles he would perſwade the Reader, that he is very acute he ſhewes himſelfe to be a very child in the art of diſputation. <hi>There is an old ſaying, give ſome men rope enough and they will hang themſelves.</hi> Even ſo it is here with Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> whiles he takes that liberty to himſelf to run out in his diſcourſe he intangles himſelf on every ſide as by the ſequell will appeare, as here. He ſayd that there was <hi>no mention in any Scripture quoted by me of eight thouſand, and he denyed withall that the Scripture doth prove any ſuch thing:</hi> and aſſerted moreover that the whole number of all thoſe converts amouted but to five thouſand, and he ſaid that all theſe were men and not women, and yet here he confutes himſelf; I deſire all therfore to take notice of the vanity of the man. He had confidently concluded there were but five thouſand in all, and aſſerted that they were all men, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as it were in the ſame breath, he makes mention of three thouſand more of another company amongſt the which he ſayth <hi>ſome of them might be women:</hi> So that by his own conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, here is two diſtinct numbers or companies, one conſiſting of 5. thouſand and all men and no women, and another conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three thouſand more, of which he makes a ſcruple ſaying <hi>that amongſt them there might be ſome women:</hi> So that if the five thouſand were all men, and there was yet another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of three thouſand more beſides, amongſt which there might

be ſome women, as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith, then this three thouſand was a diſtinct company from the former: now three thouſand amongſt the which there might be ſome women, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand all men, makes up full eight thouſand, ſo that Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> by his whibling againe and againe <hi>Volens nolens</hi> confirmes my aſſertion that the full number of thoſe converts by theſe two mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles &amp; Sermons was eight thouſand, and for ought any thing can be ſaid to the contrary, they were all men beſides women and children; and this is all he gaines by his fond caviling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to prove himſelfe a very jangler, and one like that wicked ſervant, that condemns himſelf by his own mouth. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake for proofe of the number viz: that there were eight thouſand beſides women and children.</p>
               <p>And now I come to his ſecond reaſon, by which he labours to evince and prove they were not converts &amp; beleevers, which I hope to make appeare to be not only groundleſſe, but to be moſt impious and wicked, as giving the Spirit of God the lye and indeede de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to their own tenents and principles. His words are theſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe five thouſand <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> are onely called men, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, not believers; for howbeit, many of them hearing the word believed, yet it is not ſaid the five thouſand men beleeved. And the truth is, the text well conſidered, only holds forth that the number of men was made up five thouſand. <hi>Thus Maſter</hi> Knollys.</p>
               <p>For my owne particular, I ſtand aſtoniſhed at the vanity, ſenſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and wickedneſſe of the man; for his words are not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of reaſon and the judgement of all the learned, and the very opinion of the Independents themſelves, who hold that they were all converts and beleeves, but they are contradictory to the Spirit of God, giving the holy Ghoſt the lye as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the Scripture ſaith notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance and oppoſition made by the enemies of the Goſpell to hinder the work of the Miniſtry: and notwithſtanding all the perſecution that was rayſed againſt them for this very end, I ſay notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their indeavour, the holy Ghhſt ſaith, that <hi>many of them which heard the word believed, and the number of men was five thouſand.</hi> Here are two truths evidently laid downe contrary to Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his errors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:48122:154"/>
                  <hi>The firſt is,</hi> that they are not only called men, but beleevers: <hi>for ſaith the Scripture,</hi> they that heard the word believed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the number of thoſe that believed, is there <hi>in terminis</hi> ſet downe to be five thouſand, and <hi>the number</hi> of the <hi>men</hi> (viz. that believed) ſaith the text <hi>was five thouſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> So that from this teſtimony of Scripture and from all my arguments deduced from thence, theſe two concluſions do follow evidently.</p>
               <p>The firſt, that Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> is a very wicked man, that thus at pleaſure can give the Spirit of God the lye and oppoſe the truth it ſelfe upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that there were more believers in the Church of Ieruſalem, then could poſſibly all meete in any one place and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to partake in all acts of worſhip, and that in its very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; for here we read of eight thouſand more cnoverts beſids wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children; for the Scripture maketh mention of no women nor children newly added to all thoſe that were converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and by the miniſtry of Chriſt and his Diſciples in Chriſts life time, and all they were innumerable: for all <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> went out unto them and were baptiſed, beſides the many other thouſands that the Scripture recordeth were daily added to theſe, all which I ſay could not poſſibly meete in one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to edification. And the truth of theſe concluſions I am moſt aſſured, will appeare ſo cleare in the judgement of all the learned as they wil gather that Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> &amp; his complices that thus ſottiſhly oppoſe it, ought ſeverely to be puniſhed for theſe their wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices who for the upholding of their own errors and for their baſe lucre and gain &amp; for worldly ends care not what they ſay or do to the diſturbance of church &amp; State, for the ſeducing of the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and hindring of the work of reformation ſo much to be deſired.</p>
               <p>But before I paſſe on to Maſter <hi>Knoylls</hi> his other Cavills, I ſhall deſire the reader a little to conſider what I have yet in this place to ſay to him. <hi>Theſe five thouſand</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are called men, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, not believers; for howbeit many of them hearing the Word belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet it is not ſaid the five thouſand men believed. And the truth is, the text well conſidered, only holds forth that the number of men was made up</hi> 5. <hi>thouſand.</hi> From hence I gather if theſe words of his may be credited, that it may be a very well formed Church after the new teſtament forme, (for this Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was ſuch an one by the confeſſion of all the Independents) although they be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48122:155"/>
not all viſible Saints, but many of them unbeleevers, Iewes and Infidels, and be not true converts; and that for the moulding up of a true Church after the new teſtament forme, it is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that they ſhould be all viſible Saints; for here Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> ſays they were mixt good and bad together, <hi>it is not ſaid ſaith he the five thouſand men believed</hi> and yet they were all members: ſo that by his doctrine ſome of them were unbelievers, and notwithſtanding they were all moulded up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church body: ſo that they were not all viſible Saints, and yet the true Saints and believers made no ſeparation from the other: but they all continued together in Church fellowſhip both Saints and infidels and communicated in all Ordinances. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> by this doctrine of his doth not fight againſt the opinion of all his brethren, and utterly overthrow all the new fabricke of Independency, I leave it not onely to the judgement of the learned of the congregationall way (if there be any ſuch) but to the cenſure of the ſeven new churches of which he is one of the paſtours, and an other Saint <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> who if they do not puniſh him for this his Grollery, I will ſay they deſerve cenſure and puniſhment themſelves.</p>
               <p>But this is not all I have here to ſay to Mr <hi>Knollys;</hi> I have this alſo to adde, that if any credit may be given to his words, there will then be no certainty in any thing the Scripture relateth unto us. For he ſaith, <hi>That thoſe five thouſand that were added to the Church are called men, and not Converts and Beleevers; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many of them believed, yet it is not ſaid the five thouſand believed.</hi> So that if he may be credited, all that the holy Scripture hath related unto us concerning the converſion of theſe men is a meere fable: for the Scripture ſaith they believed, and he affirmeth the contrary, and ſayth <hi>they were only called men and not converts not believers.</hi> Whether this fellow therefore ought not to be caſt out of the ſeven Churches, and out of all the Churches of the world for this his wickedneſſe and temerity, I leave it to the judgement of all the learned, either dependents or independents. and ſo I will paſſe to his other good ſtuffe which in its due place you ſhall meete with. But in the meane time out of all the above quoted places of Scripture, I thus farther argue.</p>
               <p>Where there was almoſt an hundred preachers and Miniſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the twelve Apoſtles, and all theſe continually taken up in prayer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48122:155"/>
and preaching, and could not leave their Miniſtry to ſerve tables: and where there was ſuch a company of believers and people as did imploy them all; there of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe congregations and aſſemblies, if they would all be edified and avoyd confuſion, and partake in all ordinances. But in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there was almoſt an hundred preachers and Miniſters, beſides the twelve Apoſtles; and all theſe were continually taken up in prayer and preaching and could not leave <hi>their miniſtry to ſerve</hi> tables: and where there was ſuch a company of believers and people as did employ them all, there of neceſſity they muſt be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into diverſe congregations and aſſemblies, if they would all be edified, and avoyd confuſion and partake in all Ordinances.</p>
               <p>For the major, very reaſon and the common light of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, without any reluctation will aſſent unto it. And for the Minor, it is manifeſt from Chapter the 1. ver. 21. 22. and from chapter the ſixt ver. the 2 and 4. and chapter the 8. ver. 1. So that the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is undenyable. But out of all the former places I thus farther argue.</p>
               <p>Where there were people of al nations under the heavens, and them in ſome multitudes, and moſt of them believers and devout men and women which waited upon the Ordinances and had a deſire daily to heare the Word; there of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into divers and ſundry congregations and aſſemblies, and have ſuch to preach unto them ſeverally in their owne language; or elſe they could not partake in all acts of worſhip to edification. But in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there were people of all Nations under the Heavens, and them in ſome multitudes, and moſt of them Believers and devout Men and Women, that waited upon the Ordinances, and had a deſire dayly to heare the Word. <hi>Ergo,</hi> of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies, and have ſuch to preach unto them ſeverally in their owne language, or elſe they could not partake in all acts of worſhip to edification.</p>
               <p>For the Major, no reaſon can gainſay it, for the Apoſtles and the other Miniſters imployed all thoſe gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and thoſe divers languages which they had received for the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, to the utmoſt, and did improve all opportunities for the converting of the people committed unto their charge, and for the further building of them up in their holy faith, which was
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48122:156"/>
their calling and imployment: and this they could not have done, unleſſe they taught thoſe Nations in their ſeverall Languages; and that they could not do without confuſion, unleſſe they were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted in ſeverall aſſemblies, where they might diſtinctly heare their own Languages. For otherwiſe, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. if men ſhould ſpeak to the people with unknown tongues, <hi>if the unlearned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>come in and unbelievers, will they not ſay that they are all mad?</hi> And therefore Tongues are given for a ſigne, not to them <hi>that believe, but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not.</hi> Now they were <hi>devout Men in Ieruſalem and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtles and Miniſters were to ſpeake to them ſeverally in their own languages: and for that purpoſe God gave them thoſe Tongues, and that diverſity of languages, <hi>that thoſe that were Believers might be more edified, and that the unbelievers and unlearned, &amp; ſuch as belonged unto Gods election, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and judged of all; and that the ſecrets of their hearts might be manifeſted, that ſo falling down upon their face they might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, and report that God was in them of a truth,</hi> as the Apoſtle there ſaith. So that I ſay for the Major, no reaſonable creature will call it in queſtion.</p>
               <p>And for the Major, it is manifeſt out of the Chap. 2. Verſ. 5. &amp;c. and in Chap. 6. Verſ. 1. and Verſ. 2. 4. And for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that from the Premiſes doth alſo enſue.</p>
               <p>Againe, I thus further argue out of the former Chapters.</p>
               <p>That which the holy Scripture in expreſſe words and in diverſe places hath declared unto us that every Chriſtian is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but the Scripture in expreſſe words and in diverſe places hath declared unto us, that there were diverſe aſſemblies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Believers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that the Apoſtles and all the Believers in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did continue daily with one accord in the Temple; and that they brake bread from houſe to houſe, and that daily in the Temple, and in every houſe, they ceaſed not to teach and preach Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was diverſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and ſeverall aſſemblies of Believers in the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> where they did daily partake in all the Ordinances, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all acts of worſhip.</p>
               <p>For the Major, no Chriſtian can deny it. For the Minor, it is manifeſt from 46 Verſe of the 2 Chapter, and Chap. 5. verſ. 12. and verſ. 42. and Chap. 3. verſ. 12, 13. and many more
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48122:156"/>
places that might be produced. And in thoſe places it is not onely ſaid they preached in every houſe, <hi>but that they brake bread from houſe to houſe;</hi> by which expreſſion all Writers interpret, the holy Communion, and partaking of the Lords Supper: and if it ſhould not ſo be underſtood, we never can reade that any Chriſtians in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> beſides the Apoſtles, ever enjoyed all acts of worſhip, eſpecially thoſe that are peculiar to Church Communion.</p>
               <p>It is related often that they preached the Word daily in the Temple, which was common to <hi>Iewes</hi> and Chriſtians (though no Jewiſh worſhip) as all men acknowledge. And by evident Arguments it may be proved, <hi>that they never adminiſtred the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the Temple,</hi> thoſe diſcriminating and diſtinguiſhing Ordinances of the Chriſtian Church; as all the moſt Orthodox Interpreters gather from the enſuing words, where it is ſaid, <hi>They continued daily with one accord in the Temple;</hi> but when they ſpeake of the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe words, <hi>and breaking of bread from houſe to houſe,</hi> which is interpreted by all Divines, of Sacramentall bread; which phraſe and manner of ſpeaking is uſually ſo expounded by all the Learned, upon <hi>Acts</hi> the 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> the 7. And our Brethren do not deny this. And it is well known, that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had their meetings and aſſemblies in private houſes, as by the many places is manifeſt, which I cited but a little before.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Sacrament of breaking bread is no Temple-ordinance; and therefore could not be adminiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed in the Temple with the ſafety of the Chriſtians and Believers: for if they were ſo highly diſpleaſed with the Apoſtles, for preaching <hi>Ieſus</hi> and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in the Temple, as it appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 2. They would not have ſuffered them to have adminiſtred the Sacraments there. And if <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo aſſaulted, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 28. for being but ſuppoſed to have brought Greeks into the Temple, what would theſe men have done, if one ſhould have brought in a new Ordinance, and a new worſhip and ſervice; and that ſo contrary to their legall rights? Surely the <hi>Iewes</hi> would never have ſuffered it, neither do the Brethren contend for this.</p>
               <p>Now it is well known that in the Primitive Church, if not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, yet every firſt day of the Week at leaſt, <hi>they met together to break bread;</hi> that is to receive the holy Sacrament, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without preaching, as we ſee in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. and in the places
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48122:157"/>
above quoted: in which it is ſaid, <hi>they dayly brake bread together,</hi> and that in ſeverall and particular houſes; and that of neceſſity muſt be; for a few houſes could not have held ſo many thouſands, as all reaſon will dictate: and if they were or could be contained under one roof, yet they muſt be forced to be in diverſe and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall chambers or roomes. So that what is done and ſpoke in the one, the other knowes nothing of it, ſo that they are ſtill ſeverall congregations: as under the roofe of <hi>Pauls</hi> there are diverſe meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>places where Men may partake in all Ordinances, and they are called ſeverall Churches; and they that meet there ſeveral congregations, though under one roof: for the diſtinction of the places under one covert, makes alwayes a diſtinct aſſembly, as it is dayly ſeen in the ſeverall Committees at Weſtminſter; where every Committee of both Houſes have their ſeverall roomes and equall authority, and are yet all but one Parliament, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into ſo many ſeverall aſſemblyes. So here, they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall aſſemblies, and that in ſeverall houſes, as is declared: and reaſon it ſelfe, without any teſtimony of holy Scripture, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade this: for the Apoſtles they all preached, and that dayly; and they muſt have ſeverall roomes to preach in, to avoyde confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: for all things in the Church muſt be done in order, and they muſt have ſeverall auditories or aſſemblies, or elſe they ſhould preach to the walls: ſo that if the Apoſtles would all preach; and the people all heare, of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall congregations and aſſemblyes, to avoyde diſorder; and that there were ſeverall congregations and ſeverall aſſemblies, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces above ſpecified do declare and tell us. So that there is no man that reſolves not to oppoſe all truth that is contrary to his received opinion, but may evidently perceive <hi>that there were many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and aſſemblies in the Church of Ieruſalem, and yet they all made but one Church, and were govern'd by one Preſbytery;</hi> as the many Committees in both Houſes are in divers roomes, and make divers aſſemblies, and have equall power and authority among themſelves; and yet they all make but one Parliament; and all thoſe ſeverall Committees are govern'd by the joynt conſent of the Great Civill Presbytery of the Kingdome, which is all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all this without confuſion, yea, with moſt excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decency.</p>
               <p>This is the laſt argument I produced out of the above cited
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48122:157"/>
Scriptures to prove that there were many aſſemblies of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> before the perſecution: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this argument Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> before he comes to anſwer it, makes a little ſucking preamble. His words are theſe.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> hath one argument which is more to the purpoſe then all the other, which I deſire the reader ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>page 64. Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Anſwer to this Argument is as followeth, I will ſet down all his own words, which are theſe.</p>
               <p>Now I deſire the Reader to conſider how the Doctor proves his Minor, which he ſaith it manifeſt from <hi>Acts 2. 46.</hi> and chapter the <hi>5. 12. 42.</hi> and chapter <hi>3. 11. 12.</hi> and many more places that might be produoed. <hi>page 64, 65, 66.</hi> In all which diſcourſe, the Doctor gives you nothing but his own ſuppoſitions and concluſions, for the proofe of his Minor propoſition, which is his manner of diſcourſing through his booke.</p>
               <p>This Argument <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> I anſwer; Firſt by denying the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Minor propoſition, and the reaſon of my denying it is, becauſe the Scriptures produced by the Doctor, do not in expreſſe words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that there were divers aſſemblies and congregations of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Scriptures quoted do in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words declare the contrary to what the Doctor would prove. For <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>2. verſe 42. 46.</hi> All that beleeved were together, and they continued with one accord in the Temple. And <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>3. 11, 12.</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, that all the people can together to them, in the Porch which is called <hi>Solomons. Acts</hi> the <hi>5. 12.</hi> And they were all with one accord in Solomons Porch. So that theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures produced by the Doctor to prove that there were divers aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes and congregations of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who met together in ſeverall places at one and the ſame time, upon the firſt day of the weeke where they did partake in all Ordinances, do expreſly prove the contrary, to wit, that the Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> met together with one accord in one place, to wit in the Temple and in Solomons Porch, and brake bread from houſe to houſe, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48122:158"/>
Minor propoſition, the latter part of it, That the Apostles and all the Beleevers in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did continue dayly with one accord in the Temple, and that they brake from houſe to houſe; and this ſhall ſuffice for refutation of what the Doctor hath written touching the first propoſition.</p>
               <p>Thus profound Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> confutes my arguments. I have ſet down all his words at large: And as he earneſtly deſired the Reader ſeriouſly to conſider my Argument; So I in like manner intreat him that he would but looke back upon it and adviſedly weight whether there be nothing either in that or any other of my arguments and in all my diſcourſe, but my own ſuppoſitions and concluſions for proofe of what I ſay, as he affirmeth, and whether I have not both Scripture and reaſon for what I ſay through my whole book; and if he ſhall upon mature examination perceive that I have good authority for what I ſay, then let him judg whether or no M. <hi>Knollys</hi> &amp; all his complices that thus upon all occaſions tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me, bee not a generation of the accuſers of the brethren, and whether both Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and all his confederats be not a company of calumniators &amp; raylors, and Lyers rather then Saints. For I bleſs God I have both Scripture and ſound reaſon for all that I ſay, and I ſpeak it here in the preſence of the great GOD, that if I had ever ſeen the leaſt ground of truth, in all the Scripture of truth, for what they of the congregationall way hold about their Church, I would rather have ſuffered any miſery in the world then ever have opened my mouth againſt their way, much leſſe have written againſt it; but finding it not only a novell Opinion, but hereticall &amp; indeed the very ſourſe of all hereſies and errors, and of dangerous conſequence, and ſuch an one that if it be not ſpeedily looked unto, will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring down the plagues and judgements of God upon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and overthrow all the Chriſtian Religion and all power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, but all government in Church and State through City and Country and bring a miſerable deſolation and utter ruine upon the 3 Kingdoms, <hi>which God of his infinite mercy and goodneſſe prevent.</hi>

               <p>And the conſideration of all theſe things, in the preſence of God I ſay it again, and no other, put me upon this imployment to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the error of the wayes of all the Independents and Sectaries, and in this courſe I am now in, by the grace of God and his bleſſed aſſiſtance I will perſevere in with all my endeavours to the laſt period of my dayes.</p>

And now I come to reply to what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath here ſet down by way of anſwer, and although I have formerly given an anſwer to all the fond cavills of the Independents concerning their ſeverall meetings together in the Temple and in Solomons Porch, which the Reader I am confident will ſay is ſatisfactory enough to any that know what reaſon is, yet here again for Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> farther ſatisfaction, if he will with any thing be ſatisfied, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as followeth to what he childiſhly bables againſt this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This argument of the Doctors</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I anſwer firſt by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Aſſumption,</hi> &amp;c. One would have expected that when Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> began with this word <hi>firſt,</hi> which amongſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rationall men in diſputing, it being a word of relation, hath ever reference to ſome ſecond anſwer at leſt if not a third and fourth; that he had had ſome ſecond and third reſerve of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at leaſt to have fallen upon my argument with, this I ſay all wiſe men would have imagined. And yet there followes neither a ſecond, third or fourth anſwer. But howſoever he may ſpeak nonſenſe by his calling, and by vertue of his Independency, I will take no advantage againſt him for that: I will examine onely the futility of his denyall which he calls a reaſon, which indeede is a meer contradiction not only of himſelfe, but of the holy Scripture and is a giving of the ſpirit of God the lye as at other times, as will forth with appear,</p>
               <p>For whereas he ſaith that the Scriptures produced by me do not in expreſſe words declare, that there were divers Aſſemblies and Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of Jeruſalem; and that the Scriptures quoted do in expreſſe termes declare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is moſt abominably falſe, and that by his own confeſſion, as we ſhall by and by ſee. For ſhould I grant unto Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> which I cannot do for many reaſons ſet down in my foregoing Diſcourſe, <hi>That when there were but three thouſand converted and added to the Church, that they might then all meet together in any one place or congregation to partake in all Ordinances, and that when there were five thouſand more added to them, they might ſtill likewiſe all meet together, either in the Temple or in Solomons Porch to hear the Word:</hi> I ſay ſhould I to gratifie Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> grant him all this; yet it will not follow, that when there were dayly new additions upon additions of other Converts and Beleevers, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48122:159"/>
that of many thouſands, that then they could ſtill doe the ſame.</p>
               <p>But I cannot grant all this, for it would be againſt all reaſon, and contrary to daily experience, which tels us, that eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men cannot <hi>meet in any one Congregation to partake in all acts of worſhip to edification.</hi> Yea, if I ſhould grant this to Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> both hee himſelfe and all his Fraternity would laugh at mee, &amp; all learned men would conclude that I were indeed a mad man, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſpeakes of mee; for it is moſt certaine, that all the Beleevers and Converts in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did never all together <hi>partake in all Ordinances, and in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, either in the Temple, or in</hi> Solomons <hi>porch:</hi> for wee never reade that they either baptized or brake bread in either of them: neither would the Magiſtrate have ever indured, or ſuffered it, and yet both theſe were the diſcriminating, and ſealing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, by which all Chriſtians were diſtinguiſhed from Jewes and Gentiles, and all Vnbeleevers, and it is well knowne that there was no room in any private houſe that could containe ſuch a multitude to partake in all Ordinances to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and this my brother <hi>Burton</hi> accordeth to, ſaying in expreſſe words, <hi>that there was no roome or place large enough (to containe them all)</hi> and the very Scripture alſo is cleare in this point in many places. Yea, Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> aſſenteth to this, though hee takes no notice of what hee ſayes at any time. But becauſe hee perhaps will beleeve himſelf rather then me, and becauſe alſo his Followers and Schollers will give credit to his words, rather then to any reaſons produced by mee, let them I pray heare what hee ſaith.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles and all the Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem (ſaith hee)</hi> met together, with one accord, in one place, to wit the Temple, and in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch, and brake bread from houſe to houſe <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>From the which all learned men may eaſily perceive the force of truth, and the weakneſſe and feebleneſſe of errour: for whiles the man labours, to enervate my Argument, he contradicteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the holy Scriptures, and overthrowes his owne Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and confirmes my opinion; for by his owne words it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

there were many Congregations and Aſſemblies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which hee ſtifly denyed. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>The Apoſtles and all the Beleevers in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>met together with one accord in one place, to wit, the Temple, and in</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <hi>Porch, and brake bread from houſe to houſe.</hi> I deſire the Reader to take notice of his expreſſion, and ſee if there be not only a flat contradiction of himſelfe, but a full confirmation of what my Argument proveth, <hi>viz. that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church at</hi> Jeruſalem, which hee peremptorily denyed.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48122:161"/>
Lords Supper: the Apoſtles and the Miniſters of the Goſpell only had the charge to feed Chriſts ſheep and Lambes, ſo that the ſheep and lambes were not to feede their Paſtor? Now all the people under them were either ſheepe or lambs, and they were not to intermedle in thoſe holy Ordinances to adminiſter them, though they might receive them from them; and therefore what the holy Word of God relateth to us, that we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but the holy Word of God relates unto us that in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and that in the very infancy of the Church, they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Aſſemblies every day in many ſeverall houſes at one time; yea in every houſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there were many Aſſemblies and Congregations of believers in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that in the very infancy of it: and this Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; for he confeſſeth they had their meetings day by day, and houſe by houſe, that is to ſay every day and in every houſe they had their Congregations in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſo he is conſtrained to confeſſe that which he had ſo often and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily denied: but ſuch is the force, power, and efficacy of truth as it will breake out of the mouth of the enemie and fly in their faces: for Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth confeſſe, that beſides their meetings in the Temple and in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> and that daily, they had their meetings alſo houſe by houſe <hi>Domatim,</hi> ſo that their meetings and congregations in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe, if they were from houſe to houſe. But if neither the Scripture, nor his owne confeſſion, can convince his error, at leaſt let his owne Words take ſome place with him who in the 23. pag. of his learned anſwer hath theſe expreſſions. <hi>Some god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men of approved gifts came to ſojourne in this city, and preached the Word both publickly and from houſe to houſe, and daily in the Temples, and in every houſe they ceaſed not to Teach and Preach</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>and ſome of them have dwelt in their owne houſes and received all that came unto them</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> ſpeaks, and for proof of what he ſaith he quotes the very places of Scriptures in the Margent of his booke that I produced as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 46. <hi>Acts</hi> the 5. 42. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Where from houſe to houſe</hi> and in in every houſe in his dialect is all one, which it was not when I quoted it out of the Word of God.

men that whereſoever the Independents have their meeting houſes they have a Church or congregation there; and as many meeting houſes as they have, ſo many Churches ordinatly they have, witneſſe Toleration-ſtreete, which they call the holy ſtreete I meane <hi>Coleman-ſtreete,</hi> which an Independent one day mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me paſſing through it, tould me was the Saints ſtreete, and that their were more precious Churches in that ſtreet then in all <hi>England</hi> beſides, and he did confidently believe it. And I was no ſooner paſſed from him, but turning on the right hand I ſaw many of the Independents going into the <hi>Nags-head</hi> a Taverne a little above <hi>Coleman-ſtreete;</hi> there they call their Parliament, and make Committees and Chayre-men, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of buſineſſes for the great Councell, and for the adviſing of them what to do, and there they order how they will deale with the Presbyterians; and this is one of their meeting houſes alſo whither the Saints reſort upon all occaſions to conſult together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the affairs of the Church &amp; State, and that is the holy drinking Schoole of the Saints, for they ſay, they are all Saints, and to the pure all things are pure; and therefore they muſt have a pure drinking Schoole.

I am confident they will none of them deny it: Yea they will acknowledge that in as many places as the Word of God is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them, and the Sacraments adminiſtred, that in all thoſe they have a ſeverall Church, congregation, and aſſembly &amp; this very reaſon will dictate unto any man. And therefore if in this City there be many Congregations and aſſemblies in all thoſe places where
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48122:162"/>
they preach publikely, and from houſe to houſe, and in every houſe; not onely becauſe Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith it, but becauſe every mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will convince him of it: after the ſame manner every man will conclude, <hi>That in the Church of Ieruſalem there was many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Aſſemblies;</hi> for the Scripture relates, <hi>That the word of God was preached publikely in the Temple and in Solomons Porch, and that the Saints brake bread from houſe to houſe, and that the Apoſtles ceaſed not to teach and preach Ieſus Chriſt in every houſe;</hi> and therefore all Chriſtians are bound to beleeve this <hi>becauſe the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoke it,</hi> yea and it is acknowledged by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Knollys;</hi> from all which it doth now evidently appear to all the world, <hi>that there were many Congregations and Aſſemblyes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> which Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth wickedly deny, affirming there were no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then could all meet in any one place, and ſo he not onely contradicts himſelfe and fights againſt the very light of reaſon, but which is more he gives the ſpirit of God the lye, and therefore he ought by all thoſe of the ſeven Churches to be ſeverely dealt with as a wicked impoſtor and deceiver and ought indeeed to be thrown out of all their Congregations as a jugler and a falſe prophet.</p>
               <p>Having thus evidently proved that there were many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the church of Jeruſalem, before the perſecution: I will by Gods aſſiſtance make good that there were alſo many Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes under the perſecution, and after the perſecution; and this I do the rather undertake, becauſe ſome of the brethren have ſaid that howſoever it could be proved that before the perſecution there were many ſeverall Aſſemblies: yet by reaſon of the diſperſion of the beleevers, the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was ſo waſted and ſcattered that there were no more left then could all meet in one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And were it ſo, that after the ſcattering of the Beleevers and Chriſtians in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it could never be evinced and made good that there were more then could meet together in one place: yet all this were nothing for the enervating of the argument: for we muſt ever look upon the firſt conſtitution and government of the Church, and what it was originally and by divine conſtitution, and not what it was accidentally and through perſecution and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and by the violence of men: for governments of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are often changed from their Primordiall State through many
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48122:163"/>
caſualties as it happened often in the Church of the Jewes: and therefore in all reformations things are to be reduced to the firſt rule and originall pattern: and we are not to look upon them as by occaſion they vary and change through the injury of the times.</p>
               <p>And therefore if we look into the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> as ſhe was in her youth and in her moſt flouriſhing age, we ſhall finde her conſiſting of <hi>divers Congregations and many Aſſemblies,</hi> and all them governed by a Common Councell and joynt conſent of a Presbytery, which muſt be the patterne of all Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the end of the world, if wee will in our Reformation conforme our ſelves to Gods Ordinance and to the firſt conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I ſay they think it ſo difficult a thing to prove ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations in Jeruſalem after the perſecution, I will now God willing make it evident; and not onely after the perſecution, but even in, and under the perſecution: and I will do it firſt out of that very place our brethren bring againſt us, and by which they labour to evince the contrary: the place is in the 8. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſe 1, 2, 4. In theſe words, <hi>And at that time there was a great perſecution againſt the Church which was at Ieruſalem; and they were all ſcattered abroad through the Regions of Iudea and Samaria, except the Apoſtles,</hi> verſe 3. <hi>As for Saul he made havock of the Church, entring into every houſe and haling men and women, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to priſon. Therefore they that were ſcattered abroad, went every where preaching the word:</hi> From whence the brethren gather, <hi>that there were no more beleevers left, than could meet in one Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I come to prove my Aſſertion, I muſt give ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to evince and make good, that this diſperſion and ſcattering of the Beleevers here ſpoken of, was not ſo generall and univerſall and ſo great, <hi>as that there might not yet remain more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and more people then could poſſibly meete in any one place or two:</hi> for perſecution is the bellowes of the Goſpell, which blowes every ſpark into a flame: ſo that this their diviſion proved their multiplication at home and abroad, as wee ſhall ſee after I have ſet down my Arguments and Reaſons, ſo that it was no cauſe why we ſhould conceive that there were fewer aſſemblies in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> then before; for although
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48122:163"/>
I ſhould grant that this perſecution was very great in reſpect of the intention of the perſecutors, as reaching to <hi>impriſonment and death of all ſorts,</hi> chap. 22. verſe 4. and although I ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accord, that in regard of the extent of it, it reache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h to all ſorts both Preachers and Chriſtians, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>They were all ſcattered abroad through all the Regions, &amp;c. except the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> both which notwithſtanding I cannot yeeld unto for ſome reaſons following: but I ſay ſhould I grant all this, yet I affirme that this perſecution rather made more Congregations in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> then fewer then there were before, though they might be ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and leſſer, then ſo, to waſt them and bring them to ſuch a pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, <hi>as they might all meet in one Congregation:</hi> for this their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was a cauſe of their multiplication at home and abroad, as I ſaid before, and will afterwards appear.</p>
               <p>And even as it was here in <hi>England</hi> in the time of the Prelates power, when any aſſembly of thoſe they called Puritans, were at any time found together, they were haled before Authority, (as the whole Kingdome can witneſſe) and theſe people were all ſcattered; yet ſo, as they ſtill had their meetings in leſſe numbers; and whereas before they met perhaps a hundred in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, now this hundred was divided into three or four ſeverall aſſemblies, which were ſo many ſeverall Churches; for in all theſe <hi>they enjoyed all the acts of worſhip, and did partake in all the Ordinances</hi> as fully as if they had been in the moſt crowded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyes; but this they did for their own ſafety, and that there might not be ſuch notice taken of them: for commonly if men ſee a good company of people goe into a houſe, and none of them come out again, they will by and by gather, that there is ſomething there to be done, more than ordinary; and that there is ſome exerciſe of Religion, or ſome conſultation and plotting about ſome deſigne or other; and therefore it ſtirs up the people to take more notice of it, and then they begin to examine the occaſion of that concourſe, and to pry into their proceedings: whereas, if they come but in ſlender companies, they conceive it to be ſome ordinary entertainment, and think no farther of it; ſo that they then more peaceably enjoy the ſociety and fellowſhip one of another, without any interruption, which they could not ſo well have done, if they had come in greater aſſemblies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48122:164"/>
And even ſo it was among the Beleevers and Chriſtians in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> in that perſecution; they could not now meet in the Temple, nor poſſibly at their wonted meeting houſes, and yet even then they had their aſſemblies; no terrours could make them forſake the companying of themſelves together. For in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution that is ſpoken of in the 12. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we finde <hi>the Church aſſembled in ſeverall places; for they were praying in the houſe of</hi> Mary, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. there was one Congregation, to which <hi>Peter</hi> comes and relates unto them the manner of his delivery, and bids them <hi>go and tell it</hi> James <hi>and the brethren;</hi> and there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other aſſembly; and without doubt <hi>Peter</hi> went unto a third: for he would not goe among the enemies: and it ſtands with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that in this perſecution alſo, they were as zealous as then, and therefore did not forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together. Neither would the Apoſtles be idle, who gave themſelves continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prayer and the miniſtring of the Word, which they could not have done if there had been but as many Chriſtians in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem as could all have met in one place and in one Congregation;</hi> for one or two of the Apoſtles could have preacht unto them all, and then to what end or purpoſe did all the other Apoſtles tarry in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> (who in all their motions and ſtayes, were directed by the Spirit of God) unleſſe it were to comfort and ſupport the Church there, in the heat and rage of this perſecution, when they had ſcattered their other teachers from them? From all which it may evidently appear, that there was a very great multitude of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers at this time in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that they were not diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſcattered, though all their Paſtors and Miniſters, ſaving the Apoſtles, were.</p>
               <p>And I have very good reaſon to induce me to beleeve, <hi>That this perſecution did not extend to all Chriſtians promiſcuouſly, and that all the Beleevers were ſcattered and diſperſt except the Apoſtles, as our brethren conceive.</hi> For if wee conſider the uſuall method of the perſecuting <hi>Jews,</hi> and the manner and cuſtome of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Church in all ages, wee ſhall ever obſerve that they chiefely aymed at the taking away and extirpating of their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Miniſters, and thoſe that inſtructed them. So the <hi>Iews</hi> malice was greateſt againſt the Prophets in all ages, as we may ſee <hi>Matth. the</hi> 5. <hi>verſe the</hi> 12. <hi>For ſo they perſecuted the Prophets:</hi> and in the 23. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> our Saviour ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. <hi>Woe unto</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:48122:164"/>
                  <hi>you Scribes and Phariſees hyprocrites, becauſe ye build the tombes of the Prophets, and ſay, if we had lived in the dayes of our Fathers, wee would not have been partakers with them of the blood of the Prophets; and therefore ye witneſſe unto your ſelves, that ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets. Wherefore behold I ſend unto you Prophets, and wiſe men, and Scribes, and ſome of them you ſhall kill and crucifie,</hi> &amp;c. Here our Saviour Chriſt declares what method they had formerly uſed in their perſecutions; and that was chiefely to perſecute their teachers, and what method they would for the future take, and that was principally <hi>To kill and crucifie, the Prophets, Wiſemen, and Scribes;</hi> which Propheſie of Chriſt, was here in this perſecution manifeſtly fulfilled: for here it is ſaid, They were all <hi>(viz.</hi> their teachers) ſcattered abroad and perſecuted, except the Apoſtles. It was I ſay ever the method and cuſtome of perſecutors to ayme principally at the rooting out and taking away of thoſe they ſuppoſed were ableſt to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people, and this enraged them againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt and Chriſt himſelfe; and that made them at this time ſo miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly to perſecute their Miniſters and Teachers. Neither do I read in all the New Teſtament, before thſs perſecution, that as yet they were come to the maſſacring of the common people; they had ſlain the Lord of Life, and ſtoned <hi>Stephen;</hi> and after in the 12. of the <hi>Acts</hi> we read, <hi>How Herod ſlew James, and becauſe it pleaſed the Jews, he proceeded to take Peter:</hi> they alwayes had their eyes upon their teachers and haled them to priſon, as they did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 4. of the <hi>Acts;</hi> but for the people, the onely puniſhment they under-went, till this perſecution, was this, <hi>That they were cast out of the Synagogues, if any of them did publickly profeſſe Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed in this perſecution their violence extended to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of men and women to priſon; But before, we read of no violence offered unto the people; onely they railed on them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, and reproached them, as all wicked men, whoſe tongues are ſet on fire from Hell, uſe to do, on all the generation of the juſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame method did the Prelates here in <hi>England</hi> uſe; they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more principally perſecuted the faithfull and painfull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Miniſters every where, and ſuch as they thought beſt able to inſtruct the people, and ſelected but here and there ſome
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48122:165"/>
private families for to ſcare others, and this method Antichriſt and his complices had learned from the devill and the Jewes. So that when it is ſaid <hi>they were all ſcattered except the Apoſtles,</hi> it is to be underſtood <hi>that all their Preachers and Teachers,</hi> the Apoſtles only excepted, <hi>were ſcattered;</hi> For the word <hi>all</hi> in this place, muſt be underſtood, either of all the Beleevers, or of all the Teachers and Officers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem, except the Apoſtles.</hi> But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood of all the beleevers, that they were all ſcattered; and therefore it muſt be underſtood of all the Teachers, and that for many reaſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt, if all the beleevers had been ſcattered and none left, to what end then ſhould the twelve Apoſtles have remained in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> They were not to Preach to the walls, neither would they have remained there idle, but would rather have ſhaken off the duſt of their feet, (as Chriſt commanded them) <hi>for a witneſſe againſt them, Luke</hi> 10. And would have departed and have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the reſt of the Teachers, as all good reaſon perſwades.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon is; becauſe if this particle <hi>all</hi> be alwayes exceptive or taken to the utmoſt, and in the largeſt extent, as ſome of the brethren imply and would have it; then there ſhould not one believer have been left in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> beſides the Apoſtles, which is expreſly againſt the Text, for <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. It is ſaid, <hi>That Saul brake into houſes, haling men and women, committing them to priſon,</hi> and this he did at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at this time, as he acknowledgeth himſelfe <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. And therefore of neceſſity it muſt follow, <hi>That all the beleevers were not ſcattered abroad, for ſome of them were in priſon in Ieruſalem.</hi> And for ought I can gather, all the reſt were in their ſeverall houſes, or elſe the Apoſtles could have had no harbour: for if all their friends had been ſcattered by this tempeſt, and if all the ſheep had been drove away and the whole flock diſperſed, their Paſtors without doubt would have followed them: for he would be counted a very bad Shepherd that ſhould not follow or look after the poor ſheep that were ſcattered by the Wolves.</p>
               <p>Neither can we imagine that the Apoſtles that were the Paſtors of the flock of Jeſus Chriſt, and to whoſe care he had committed his ſheep and his Lambes, with a ſpeciall charge that they ſhould feed them, would relinquiſh their care and chooſe rather to dwell amongſt a company of Wolves, from whome they
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48122:165"/>
could expect no faire meaſure, then amongſt the ſheepe: But in that all the Apoſtles ſtill remained in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> I rather gather, and that without all controverſie, they continued there for this very purpoſe, <hi>that they might comfort and ſupport the Church there, and refreſh the Beleevers in this heate of Perſecution, when they wanted the helpe of their other faithfull Miniſters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is very evident from the Text, they were onely the Preachers that were ſcattered; for <hi>verſe</hi> 4. It is ſaid, <hi>That they that were ſcattered went every where preaching the Word,</hi> which expreſsion in the Originall, as may be proved by innumerable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſignifieth ſuch teachers as were Miniſters by Office, and ſuch as preached by way of Sermons to a multitude, though they might likewiſe in private conference inſtruct, which their publike Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery did not exempt them from. And although private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may teach and inſtruct one another, as <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla</hi> taught <hi>Apollos,</hi> and as all Chriſtians are commanded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct one another, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 16. Yet this text ſpeaks not of ſuch a teaching, but of preaching, <hi>They went every where,</hi> ſaith the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>preaching the Word.</hi> For teaching may be an act of Charity, but preaching is an act of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; <hi>for how can they preach except they be ſent? Rom.</hi> 10. So that by vertue of their Office, they might both publikely preach, and in private converſe alſo inſtruct others whereſoever they came, whether they were ſent out by perſecution or by miſſion. As I do conceive of any of thoſe Godly Miniſters that were not many yeares ſince, drove from their habitations, and that were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of their places by the Prelates, that they might have preached publickly in any Congregation as Miniſters and men in Office, and might alſo have inſtructed privately; but the one was an act of duty as it was their Office, and the other of love and charity. And ſo may a well gifted private Chriſtian inſtruct and teach others upon occaſion, and in private conference, which is an act of love; but hee cannot properly be ſaid to Preach, which is an act of one in Office, and belongs onely to the Presbyters and Paſtors, and ſuch as for their ſufficient learning and abilities are called unto the Miniſtry and ordained and ſet apart to this Office: and ſuch onely were thoſe that were ſcattered, <hi>except the Apoſtles:</hi> and by all probability theſe Miniſters and Preachers that wee
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48122:166"/>
ſcattered were thoſe that were at the chooſing of <hi>Matthias,</hi> the ſeventy Diſciples and many more. So that for ought I can gather, all the beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet remained in their ſeverall habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and dwellings, except thoſe that were haled to priſon. And therefore of neceſſity there muſt bee many Aſſemblies and Congregations yet in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that made all the Apoſtles abide and continue ſtill among them all, which makes exceeding ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove, that there were innumerable multitudes of Beleevers ſtill in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which of neceſsitie were forced to divide their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies into more diſtributions and leſſe Congregations then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and therefore rather multiplyed their aſſemblies then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that by ſuch Privacy they might avoide perſecution, as in our times, good Chriſtians here in <hi>London</hi> were wont to doe, when the Prelates were in their ruff. But out of this place I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where there were twelve of the moſt able, painfull, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Preachers in the world, and that gave themſelves continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prayer and the Miniſtery of the Word, and at ſuch a time as there was moſt need of preaching, and when they could not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely come together, by reaſon of the Perſecution, and where there were innumerable multitudes of beleevers of all nations to be taught and preached unto in their ſeverall Languages and tongues; there of neceſſity there muſt be ſeverall Congregations and aſſemblies for the imployment of them all, both Preachers and hearers. But in the Church of Jeruſalem in the time of the hotteſt perſecution, there were the twelve Apoſtles, the moſt able, painefull, and diligent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the world, and that gave themſelves continually to prayer, and the Miniſtery of the Word, and when they could not publickely come together, by reaſon of the perſecution, and where there were innumerable multitudes of beleevers of all nations to be taught and preached unto in their ſeverall Languages and tongues. Therefore of neceſſity there muſt be ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies for the employment of them all, both Preachers and hearers.</p>
               <p>For this Syllogiſme, all and every part of it, is ſo cleared by what hath formerly beene ſaid, as I am moſt aſſured, no rationall man will call either of the Propoſitions in queſtion. But from the former place I thus further argue.</p>
               <p>Where there were ſuch multitudes of beleevers of all Nations and Countries, ſtill remayning even in the hotteſt time of perſecution, as
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48122:166"/>
had for many years imployed and continually taken up above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred painefull Miniſters and Teachers, there they could not all meet together in any one place or roome, but of neceſſity muſt bee diſtributed into divers Congregations and aſſemblies, if they would all be edified; and much more now they were forced unto it, if they would avoyd Perſecution, and provide for their owne ſafety: But in the Church of Ieruſalem in the hotteſt time of Perſecution, there were ſuch multitudes of Beleevers of all Nations and Countries ſtill remayning, as had for many yeeres imployed and continually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up above an hundred painefull Miniſters and Teachers: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet together in any one place or roome: but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies, if they would all be edified, and much more now were they forced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, if they would avoid perſecution, and provide for their owne ſafety.</p>
               <p>The Major of this Syllogiſme by the very light of nature and reaſon, which we may not in a matter of diſputation eſpecially relinquiſh, is manifeſt and evident. For the <hi>Minor</hi> it is alſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the foregoing diſcourſe: by which it is proved, that their Preachers only were ſcattered, and all thoſe Miniſters that were at the chooſing the Apoſtle <hi>Matthias,</hi> chap. 1. and many more that inſtructed the people: but for the people and beleevers, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned ſtill in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> the concluſion therefore is firme. But I will now goe on to evince, that after the perſecution, there were more beleevers ſtill in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then could all meet in any one place and room together: and therefore of neceſsity, they muſt be diſtributed into many Congregations and Aſſemblies: And for proofe of this Aſſertion, the places following will ſuffice: and firſt that in the 9. chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> verſe 31. <hi>Then had the Churches reſt through all Indaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were all edified, and walking in the feare of the Lord, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Holy Ghoſt, were multiplyed.</hi> Out of which words it may evidently appeare, that perſecution is but the bellowes of the Goſpel; and that which the enemies of the Goſpel thinke to be a meanes of extinguiſhing the light of it, makes it but more gloriouſly ſhine forth, and the farther to ſpread its rayes: for by blowing and puffing at it, they ſpread it the more, and extend it here and there farther abroad; as wee ſee by this perſecution and ſcattering of thoſe Preachers and Miniſters of the Goſpel: for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48122:167"/>
this their diſperſion, by which the perſecutors had thought to have waſted the Churches, was an occaſion of the multiplication of them, and the cauſe of the increaſing of Beleevers every where.</p>

            <div n="200-299" type="pages">
               <p>And here wee may alſo obſerve, <hi>That by how much more the rage of the enemy is great and violent,</hi> by ſo much it is leſſe dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for this great perſecution was but ſhort. And it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but they who were ſcattered by perſecution, would upon the ceaſing of it, returne againe to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as moſt people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Out of the which words I thus argue.</p>
               <p>That Church before the Perſecution and Diſperſion of whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Paſtors, was ſo numerous and had ſuch multitudes of Beleevers in it, of all Nations, as they could not all meet in any one plaee or roome, for edification, and to partake in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but were forced to preach in divers and ſundry places, as in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe; and after the perſecution ceaſed and the Church had reſt, was greatlier yet multiplied then before; and whoſe companies were more &amp; more in number increaſed, they of neceſſity could not al meet together in any one place or room for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and to partake in all acts of worſhip, but muſt neceſſarily be diſtributed into divers and ſundry Congregations and Aſſemblies if they would all bee edified. But the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> before the Perſecution and Disperſion of her Miniſters and Paſtors, was ſo numerous and had ſuch multitudes of Beleevers in it of all Nations, as they could not all meet in any one place or roome for edification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to partake in all acts of worſhip; but were forced to preach in divers and ſundry places, as in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe; and after the Perſecution ceaſed and the Churches had reſt, was greatlier yet multiplyed than before: and whoſe companies were
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48122:167"/>
more and more in number increaſed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Of neceſsity after the Perſecution there were more beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> then could all meet together in any one place or roome for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and to partake in all acts of worſhip, but muſt neceſſarily bee diſtributed into divers Congregations and Aſſemblies if they would bee edified.</p>
               <p>For the Major beſides common underſtanding and ordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which confirme it, it is manifeſt from the 2, 3. and 5. <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which in expreſſe words ſignifieth, That they met daily in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe, yea in every houſe, and therefore that is true and out of all doubt: and for the <hi>Minor</hi> it is evident from the place above cited, where it is ſaid, The Churches, (that is to ſay, all the Churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> of which <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was the Mother Church) <hi>were multiplyed,</hi> the word in the Originall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth properly an increaſe in number and multitude, and not in meaſure; and is ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this place; and cannot being applyed unto perſons, bee otherwiſe taken, whatſoever it may of ſinnes and graces; and then alſo the word is capable of this conſtruction, as may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if need required: ſo that the concluſion doth follow.</p>
               <p>And truly that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt of the <hi>Galatians</hi> is an excellent Argument to evince that there were more Congregations in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> then one, where proving that hee had not received the Goſpel which hee preached, from men, but from God, hee uſeth this reaſon; That if hee had received it from men, it muſt bee from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and from the Apoſtles; for the Gentiles were ignorant of it, and hee was to carry the Goſpel unto them, and therefore they could not teach it him; and to prove that hee received it not from the Apoſtles; hee thus ſpeaketh of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>When it pleaſed God to reveale his Sonne unto mee, that I might preach him amongſt the Heathen, I immediately I conferred not with fleſh and blood, neither went I up to Ieruſalem, to them that were Apoſtles before me; but I went into <hi>Arabia;</hi> Then after three yeares I went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſee <hi>Peter,</hi> and aboade with him fifteene dayes; but other of the Apoſtles ſaw I none, ſave <hi>James</hi> the Lords Brother.</p>
               <p>Out of the which words beſides the ſingular teſtimony wee have that the preaching and writings of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> are the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48122:168"/>
of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Word of the <hi>living God,</hi> againſt the Papiſts: we may evidently gather againſt the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that after the perſecution <hi>there were more believers in</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>then either did or could all meet in one place:</hi> for in ſaying <hi>that he was with</hi> Peter <hi>fifteen dayes, but in all that time ſaw none of the Apoſtles ſave</hi> Iames, this I ſay, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Argument to prove more Congregations and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Apoſtles in their ſeverall Miniſteries asthey had not ſo much ſpare time to viſit <hi>Paul,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was ſo taken up in preaching there, that he had no leiſure to viſit them. And for the diligence of the Apoſtles in their Miniſtry it is ſaid in the ſixth of the <hi>Acts, That they gave themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to prayer and to the Miniſtery of the Word:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were never idle; and that the Apoſtles either all or the moſt of them continued reſident for many years in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> before they diſtributed themſelves into ſeverall Nations and Countries; and that very few of them were ſent abroad, there are frequent teſtimonies in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles; neither as yet did I ever hear it ſcrupled, or call'd in queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apoſtles were then there or no, when <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> for it is taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> that either all or the moſt of them were at that time in <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> neither doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, I ſaw none of the other Apoſtles becauſe they were abſent, or were gone to Preach the Goſpell in other places. And for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> we reade, <hi>that whereſoever he came, he went into their Synagogues and into their Aſſemblies to Preach, and that he preacht from houſe to houſe:</hi> and he that gave ſo ſtrict a charge to <hi>Timothy</hi> (and in him to all Miniſters) <hi>that he ſhould Preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon;</hi> he himſelfe without all doubt, would not neglect his duty, who in the 20. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſets his owne example before all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters for their imitation in their diligent preaching, and he ordinarily preached by the day and by the night, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt out of the ſame Chapter and many other places; and ſurely the time he remained with <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he was as diligent in Preaching, as he was in any of the other Churches; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth of himſelf that the care of all the Churches lay upon him, &amp; that he laboured more then all the other Apoſtles in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48122:168"/>
ſo that it ſtandeth with all reaſon, that while he was in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> he was very ſedulous in Preaching, as who had both ſtrength of body, and Gods ſpeciall aſſiſtance, and his immediate inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alwayes to help him in his Miniſtery; ſo that I conceive, as of charity I am bound, that <hi>Paul</hi> was daily in one aſſembly or other: now if there had been at that time, no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>Ieruſalem then could have met in one place, congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Aſſembly,</hi> then of neceſſity <hi>Paul</hi> muſt have ſeen the other Apoſtles there, as well as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> (for they alſo were good Church-men, to ſpeake a little in the Prelats dialect) and they never left the Word, but were alwayes taken up either in praying or preaching amongſt them in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe, yea in every houſe: and if there had been but one Congregation or Aſſembly of beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Apoſtles would daily upon all occaſion have been with their flock: Now in that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw them not in all that time he was in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it is evidently apparent <hi>there were more Congregations of beleevers in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>then one, and more Chriſtians then could</hi> all meet in any one <hi>or a few places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed to a place or two more for the further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this truth <hi>Acts</hi> 12. verſe 24. It is ſaid there, <hi>that the word of God grew and multiplped.</hi> Here alſo we have another good effect of a new ſierce perſecution in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> it increaſed the number and multitude of Believers there after the Perſecutor was taken away, <hi>For the Word of God grew and multiplyed,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt. Out of which words I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where the Word of God daily more and more grew and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the perſecution, that is to ſay, where there were more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes and greater numbers of Believers added unto the Church; through the Miniſtery and preaching of the Goſpell then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which notwithſtanding was then ſo numerous, as they could not all meete in any one place or roome, to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification, there of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into diverſe aſſemblies and congregations to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification. But in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> after a double perſecution, the Word of God daily more and more grew and mnltiplyed; that is to ſay, there were more multitudes and greater numbers of Believers added unto the Church through the miniſtery
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48122:169"/>
and preaching of the Goſpell by the Apoſtles then was before: which notwithſtanding was then ſo numerous, as they could not all poſſibly meet in any one place and roome. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Beleevers after the Perſecution then before: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity they could not all meete in any one place or roome to communicate in all the Ordinances, but muſt be diſtributed into ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies if they would all be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>For the Major I conceive it is ſo evidently clear as no man of ordinary underſtanding will not ſee the truth of it. For the Minor, the Text proveth it: and if we will compare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Scripture, the truth of it will by and by be out of controverſie, for in the 15. of <hi>Iohn</hi> verſe 16. Our Saviour ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there to his Diſciples, ſaith, <hi>I have choſen you and ordained you that you ſhould go and bring forth fruite, and that your fruite ſhould remaine:</hi> that is, I have choſe you to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell and convert men, which is the fruite of preaching the Word; and cauſeth the multiplication of Beleevers, for Faith commeth by hearing, <hi>Romans</hi> 10. Now this Scripture is here fulfilled, for it is ſaid, that the Word of God grew and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed; that is, it brought forth the great fruite and increaſe of multitudes of Beleevers, and converted many, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the perſecutions that were raiſed againſt it and the Church. So that the concluſion muſt neceſſarily follow from the premiſes, and it is moſt apparent, that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in Jeruſalem after the Perſecution. But in the 21 Chapter, 20 Verſe. there is a place that putteth an end to this Controverſie; and with the which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my firſt aſſertion. In theſe words, <hi>Thou ſeeſt Brother</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>James,</hi> and the Presbyters of Jeruſalem to Saint <hi>Paul) how many ten thouſands</hi> (for ſo it is in the Originall, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>of Jewes there are which beleeve, and they are all zealous of the Law:</hi> In this place the Evangeliſt ſpeakes of the Inhabitants of Ieruſalem that were Beleevers, and had their abode there, and not of ſtrangers, as our Brethren ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſuch as they conceive were come up to Jeruſalem at that time to the feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> at which they thinke <hi>Paul</hi> then was: which opinion of theirs might be confuted with many reaſons, if it were neceſſary; ſome of the which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48122:169"/>
I ſhall briefly ſet downe. As firſt, it is well knowne that the feaſt of Pentecoſt laſted but one day, and that in the time of Wheat-harveſt, when ordinarily but few came to Jeruſalem. Beſides none of the Jewes that lived out of the Countrey of Judaea, and the confines of Iſrael, were enjoyned to come to that feaſt, or any other of the feaſts ſo farre as I remember; neither indeed could they, dwelling in ſuch remote countryes; except they ſpent all their time in running about. So that as I conceive is was arbitrary in the Iewes, that dwelt in other countries, whether they would come or no to all thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Feaſts: though I have this opinion of ſome of the moſt zealous of them, and beſt ableſt and richeſt of them, and that had time and leaſure, that they would ſpare neither paines nor coſts, ſo they might enjoy the Ordinances and the ſociety of their Brethren. Beſides we reade but of very few ſtrangers, that were at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at this time when <hi>Paul</hi> was there, and they were them of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which were perſecutors rather then believers, as the ſtory relateth, verſe 27, 28. Now the multitude of which there is mention made in this place in the 22. verſe, they were all Believers, and were inhabitants, and ſuch as were well knowne to Saint <hi>Iames</hi> and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and were all ſtrangers to <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſuch as had onely heard that <hi>Paul taught all the Jewes that were among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to forſake</hi> Moſes, &amp;c. And therefore none of theſe many ten thouſands were of the believing <hi>Iewes amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> for they are clearly diſtinguiſhed from them: for it is ſaid, that thoſe Myriads of believing <hi>Iewes were informed that Paul taught all the Iewes among the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. They then were informed that <hi>Paul</hi> had taught others. The Iewes among the Gentiles were they who <hi>Paul</hi> had ſo taught, and how could they be in the number of them that were informed? Had they neede to be informed by others what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had taught them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Therefore they muſt needs be the believing Iewes of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and the inhabitants and dwellers there. So that out of the Text I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Many ten thouſands of Believers could not all meet at any one time, or in any one place or congregation to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification; but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and ſundry congregations and aſſemblies, if they would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48122:170"/>
in all acts of worſhip and be edified. But in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after all the perſecutions, there were many ten thouſands believers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet together at any one time, or in any one place or congregation, for the enjoying of all acts of worſhip to edification; but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and ſundry congregations and aſſemblies, they would partake in all the Ordinances, and be edified.</p>
               <p>For the Major all reaſon will aſſent unto it; for the Minor, the text it ſelfe confirmes it; neither doth the word <hi>Myrias</hi> or <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riades</hi> ever expreſſe leſſe then ten thouſand, as might out of many places of Scripture be proved and divers authors. And truly to any man but of an ordinary underſtanding it would ſeem ſtrange, yea an incredible thing that Jeruſalem the Theater of ſo many miracles and where there were twelve Apoſtles, and the moſt of them for the moſt part reſident, and ſo many famous Preachers and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and who at the firſt beginning of their Miniſtry, after they had received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt by their powerfull preaching and a few miracles had in a ſhort time converted above eight thouſand people, beſides great multitudes both of men and women, beſides Prieſts, and who preached dayly in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe, and that for above twenty yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as it is againſt all reaſon, ſo it is againſt the expreſſe words of the holy Scriptures as hath out of many places in the foregoing diſcourſe bin ſufficiently made appear, and out of the place laſt cited, which doth affirme, <hi>That there were many ten thouſand beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem after all the perſecutions; all which could not meet in any one place to enjoy all Acts of Worſhip, no not in a few.</hi> Whether therfore it hath not by this and the many other teſtimonies of holy Scripture and the arguments out of both been ſufficiently proved, <hi>That there were many Congregations in the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> I report my ſelfe to any that have not the pearle of prejudice in the eye of their judgement? And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke for the proof of my firſt aſſertion.</p>

               <p>This Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> had to reply; whoſe words I have ſet down at large that all men may ſee the force of his denyall, and with how little reaſon theſe men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the moſt grounded truth and doctrine for the upholding and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their fond and grolliſh errors.</p>
               <p>But now to examine his words, that the truth may more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, and that my Argument ſtands firme and good notwithſtanding all Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> hath to ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarry.</p>

                  </gap> be derived and come from a word that ſignifieth infinite in the concrete, as he affirmeth, then as all the learned know, the abſtract is of a larger extent: for darkneſſe is more then darke, and ſignifyeth the extremity and profundity of darke; and ſo in the ſame manner, if <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as it is according to Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his learning, then it denotes and ſignifies a greater number then ten thouſand, rather than a leſſe, by how much <hi>Myriads</hi> an infinite and an innumerable multitude of people ſignifies more then a finite, then ten thouſand: for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the 12. of <hi>Luke</hi> is tranſlated <hi>when there were gathered together,</hi> ſaith the tranſlation, <hi>an innumerable company of people inſomuch that they trode one upon another,</hi> &amp;c. an innumerable company therefore ſignifies rather more then ten thouſand, then a leſſe number in any ordinary underſtanding.</p>

                  </gap> ſometimes ſignifies ten thouſand, yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, but for ſome great number which cannot ſuddainly be told; and for the proofe of what he ſaith he quots the 12. of <hi>Luke</hi> the place above mentioned, and brings <hi>Bezas</hi> his verſion and our Engliſh tranſlation for the confirmation of his aſſertion viz. that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth not alwayes ſignifie ten thouſand; and after that he abuſeth his own reaſon to confute Saint <hi>Luke</hi> who recording
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48122:171"/>
the words of St. <hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> ſayes, <hi>thou</hi> ſeeſt brother <hi>how many ten thouſand believing</hi> Iewes &amp;c. To which words of <hi>Luke</hi> Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> learnedly replies that the following verſ. 22. will make it probable that there were not many ten thouſands; for there (ſayeth he) we thus reade, <hi>the multitude muſt needs come together;</hi> ſo that I ſay it is probable that they were not ſo many ten thouſands, but they could, yea muſt aſſemble together.</p>
               <p>Thus Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> diſputeth; ſo that it is manifeſt that he argueth not only againſt me, but confutes Saints <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf, who by the Spirit of God delivers unto the world, that there were many ten thouſands of believers in the Church of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> by the ſpirit of error gainſaith; ſo that it is no wonder, if he and his fraternity make nothing of of my arguments, when they undertake to give the Spirit of God the lye upon all occaſions: for in expreſſe words the ſpirit ſaith <hi>there were many ten thouſands of believers in</hi> Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and his aſſociates affirme the contrary, ſaying that the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> doth not alwayes ſignifie ten thouſand, and that it is probable there were not ſo many belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and he produceth <hi>Bezas</hi> his verſion and our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tranſlation to confirme his errors; which kinde of ſilly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing of his, if it be good, then not only every truth of God may eaſily be over-throwne, but all Hereſies be eſtabliſhed: but I pray ſee the folly of the Man: <hi>Beza</hi> (ſaith he) and the Engliſh interpreters have not tranſlated the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ten thouſand <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not ſo in the Originall: If ſuch kind of diſputing be allowed of in the Congregationall way, I ſhall not ſo much wonder hereafter that they tumble daily into ſo many hideous and monſtrous opinions; but of the validity of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument more by and by, In the meane time, take notice of Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his words, howſoever ſaith he <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth not alwayes ſignifie ten thouſand, yet <hi>it is taken for ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Now I referre my ſelfe to any intelligible and judicious man, whether in this, Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth not plainly oppoſe Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and confute what he hath writ, and whether not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what he ſaith, the truth doth not yet more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, and that by his owne interpretation of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for in his interpretation two things are obſervable; the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48122:172"/>
firſt, that it ſignifies <hi>ſome great number.</hi> The ſecond, that it ſignifies <hi>ſuch a great number as cannot ſuddainly be told:</hi> from which all rationall men wil conclude, if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifie ſome great number that cannot ſuddainly be told, as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirms, then it ſignifies more then ten thouſand; for ten thouſand is not ſo great a number, nor ſuch a number but may without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty be ſuddainly told: for wee have read of five thouſand that have ſuddainly been fed, and of foure thouſand at another time, beſides women and children that have all likewiſe been ſuddainly fed; and therefore ten thouſand may ſuddainly be told; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe five thouſand could meet together, and be ſuddainly fed in the fields, I will not be induced to beleeve that any one place or roome, in a Citie or houſe could have contained them all to communicate in al the ordinances. Now then if according to Mr. <hi>Konllys</hi> his learning there were many greatnumbers of Beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that could not ſuddainly be told; all rationall men will gather, <hi>that they could not all meet in any one place or congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to partake in all acts of worſhip;</hi> this I ſay every good accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and intelligible man will eaſily gather.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmes, and that ſo peremptorily, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth not alwayes ſignifie ten thouſand, and to that end cites <hi>Beza</hi>'s his verſion, and the tranſlation of our Bibles, who interpret it thouſands, and not ten thouſands; I thinke it fit to ſay ſomething concerning this buſines in way of farther anſwer to Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> that all men may the better diſcerne in to the wickedneſſe of theſe trifling men: for all Accomptants know, and they that are but a little skilled in Arithmetick, that the word ten thouſand in what language ſoever it be, loſeth nothing of its ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, but retaines the full number, and alwayes ſignifies ten thouſand, though any Interpreter tranſlating the word ſhould for ten thouſand interpret it thouſands, or many thouſands: for this his interpretation diminiſheth nothing from the ſignification of the word; for ten thouſand is ever ten thouſand: as for inſtance, if one writing to his friend beyond the Seas concerning the Battle at <hi>Nazebie,</hi> ſhould relate unto him the manner of the fight in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular, and ſhould alſo ſet downe the number of each Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and in expreſſe words ſay, that the Kings Army conſiſted of ten thouſand, and the Parliaments Army of as many, and he that ſhould tranſlate this Letter into the French or Dutch tongue for
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48122:172"/>
this certaine number of ten thouſand, ſhould ſay the King came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field with thouſands or many thouſands, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with as many: I demand of any underſtanding Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, or skilfull Accountant, or but of any intelligible creature, whether the number of ten thouſand looſe any thing of its ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or be not ſtill ten thouſand, although the Interpreter for that definite and certaine number ſet downe an indefinite number? I am moſt aſſured, his reaſon will dictate unto him, that there is no diminiſhing of the number, but it will ever be in the Originall Copie ten thouſand, though the Interpreter did not in formall words ſay the King and the Parliament came into the field with ten thouſand men a peece.</p>
               <p>Even ſo it is here, <hi>Beza</hi> and our Tranſlators taking the liberty of Interpreters render the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> thouſands, or many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, which word notwithſtanding in the Originall ſignifies ten thouſand. I appeale now to the judgement of any wiſe man and godly Chriſtian, whether I ſhall cleave rather to the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to the originall and authentick Copie, or whether the Text is rather to be relyed upon or the traduction? eſpecially when wee are commanded to <hi>goe to the Law and to the Teſtimony;</hi> without the guidance of which, wee ſhall wander in darkeneſſe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. I am confident that all judicious men will conclude that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is rather to be ſtuck to and beleeved then the interpretation. Now when in the Originall the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ever ſignifies ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and never leſſe, but many times more, as being a word in the abſtract, it followes notwithſtanding all that Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and all thoſe of his party can ſay or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>firme to the contrary, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in that place, and in all other places in the Holy Scripture, and in all good Authors, ever ſignifies ten thouſand; and <hi>Beza</hi> himſelfe upon the firſt verſe of the 12. of Saint <hi>Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſe</hi> 1. in his briefe notes hath this expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> word for word (ſaith hee) ſignifies ten thouſand, and ſo he interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it in other places. So that <hi>Beza</hi>'s his tranſlation helpeth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and his brethren nothing.</p>
               <p>And as for our Engliſh tranſlation, howſoever in this place it rendreth <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> many thouſands, yet in other places it giveth the right interpretation, the full number the word ſignifieth, as in the 19. of the <hi>Acts, v.</hi> 19. where the word is in the Originall <gap reason="foreign">

of ſilver, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Beza denariorum quinquaginta millia,</hi> that is in both tranſlations five <hi>Myriads.</hi> And ſo likewiſe in the 5. of the <hi>Revelation, verſe</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and in <hi>Iude</hi> the fourteenth. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> they tranſlate it, and behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of Saints. So that it is moſt apparent, by our interpretation that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> never ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth leſſe then ten thouſand, but being taken ſingle and by it ſelfe it often ſignifieth more, and is left free to reach to a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yea an innumerable company, as in the place above quoted in the 14. of <hi>Iude,</hi> and in the 12. of the <hi>Hebrewes, verſe</hi> 22. where <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in our tranſlation is interpreted an innumerable multitude of Angels: by all which I am moſt aſſured, the learned will all conclude that, the place in the <hi>Acts</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no leſſe then many ten thouſands. So that all Maſter <hi>Knolly's</hi> pudder about that word, ſheweth nothing but his vanity.</p>
               <p>And for his reaſon of his probability, that there were not ſo many, it is impious and fights againſt the truth, and gives the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God the lye; and as for the multitude in that place that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the 22. <hi>verſe,</hi> all the beſt Interpreters underſtand ſome of the chiefe and ſelect men, and of the prime in authority: for all things were to be carried with order and decency, and not with confuſion, which the comming together of many ten thouſands would have cauſed, though they had bin Saints; for we ſee what a tumult a few zealots of the Law by ſtirring up the people againſt <hi>Paul</hi> made in the Temple. Now if all the Beleevers in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> beſides women and children had met together, and ſome of <hi>Pauls</hi> enemies had beene there alſo, and ſuggeſted to the people that hee was an enemy of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> what a confuſion may all men conceive would there then have beene? Beſides, there was no one place could have contained them all: and therefore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Knollis</hi> his prattle, is not only againſt all reaſon, and the very opinion of all orthodox Interpreters, but indeed againſt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learnedſt of his owne party, who by multitude in this, as in many other places, underſtand the more eminent and chiefeſt of beleevers, and men of gravity, and wiſedome to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a buſines, and not a confuſed company as this man ſaith: ſo that what I have replyed in way of anſwer I perſwade my ſelfe it ſufficiently ſatisfieth all well grounded Chriſtians of the truth of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48122:173"/>
my firſt Poſition; to wit, that ther were more beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> then could all meet in any one place or a few, to communicate in all acts of worſhip. Yet before I paſſe on to ſhew the confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſenſeleſſeneſſe of this Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I thinke it fit out of his owne Interpretation of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to frame an Argument for the corroborating of the truth. His words are theſe. <hi>Although the word</hi>

But thus I argue out of his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where there was not only ſome great number of beleevers that could not ſuddainly be told, but many ſuch great ſomes, there they could not all meet together in one place or Congregation to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in all acts of worſhip: But in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>there was not onely ſome great number of beleevers which could not ſuddainly be told, but many ſuch great ſomes:</hi> Ergo, <hi>they could not all meet together in any one place or Congregation to partake in all the acts of worſhip:</hi> for the <hi>Major,</hi> it is evident, yea ſo apparent by the very light of reaſon, that no judicious Chriſtian can deny it; for all men know that ten thouſand may ſuddainly be told, if five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand may ſuddainly be ſed; and they likewiſe know that ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand cannot meet together in any one place or roome, or in any one Congregation to communicate in all the Ordinances; this I ſay all men know by the very light of naturall underſtanding, and as by daily experience they are taught; much more by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they will be convinced that many ſuch great numbers cannot meet together in one Congregation to communicate in all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; all this, the very light of reaſon ſuggeſts to any man: and therefore cannot be denyed; ſo that the <hi>Major</hi> of my Syllogiſme is undeniable: and for the <hi>Minor,</hi> beſides the holy Scripture that aſſerts there were many ten thouſands, wee have Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his conceſſion, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſometime ſignifieth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, but alwayes is taken for ſome great number that cannot ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly be told; and the word of God ſaith there were many <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads,</hi> that is many ſuch great numbers: therefore by Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his owne interpretation of the word it followeth, that there were more Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> then could
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48122:174"/>
all meet in any one place or a few to partake in all acts of worſhip.</p>
               <p>And now I will briefly examine his following diſcourſe, though it be little to the purpoſe, the vanity of the which having been ſo often againe and againe diſcovered in the forgoing treatice.

And for this the Word of God is cleare and evident: as in <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. verſe 21. 22. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Peter) of theſe men which have companyed with us, all the time the Lord Ieſus went in and out amongſt us beginning from the baptiſme of Iohn, unto that ſame day that he was taken up from us, muſt one be ordayned to be a witneſſe with us of the reſurrection; and they appointed, two</hi> Ioſeph <hi>called</hi> Barſabas <hi>and</hi> Matthias.</p>
               <p>Out of the which words theſe inſuing truths doe neceſſarily follow; firſt, that they that were aſſembled here with <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles were ancient Diſciples; for ſaith the text, they were ſuch as had companyed with the Apoſtles, all the time the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> went in and out amongſt them, beginning from the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp;c. and therefore muſt needs be ſuch as had been dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Schollers all that time in Chriſts Schoole and ſuch as were well inſtructed in all Chriſtian principles as is eaſily gathered out of the very words; for any one of them were thought fit in the Apoſtles judgement to ſucceede <hi>Iudas</hi> in his place and to be an Apoſtle, in regard that they had heard and ſeene all things Chriſt both ſpake and did till his death and aſcenſion; for otherwiſe they could not have been witneſſes of all things to his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All this I ſay in the firſt place doth neceſſarily follow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this truth alſo doth inſue out of the forgoing words, that either all thoſe men were Miniſters, or the moſt of them: for in expreſſe termes it is related, that they had accompanied the Apoſtles the time the Lord Ieſus went in and out amongſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48122:174"/>
them, beginning from the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> untill Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Now amongſt thoſe that converſed with the Apoſtles, beſids <hi>Iohn</hi> ſchollers Chriſt had ſeventy Diſciples all Miniſters, which he ſent out two by two into all Cities to preach and to worke wonders, who came back again to him, rejoycing that the Divells were ſubject unto them, and they ſtil wayted upon Chriſts Miniſtry; we reade alſo of many of <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples that came unto Chriſt, all which were Miniſters likewiſe, and ſuch as preached and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: and all theſe were with <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles at this time, &amp; continued with them till the perſecution: for we reade of no departure of them, or ſeparation till then: and all theſe were men of ſingular gifts and graces, and ſuch as by the Apoſtles were thought fit to ſucceed <hi>Iudas</hi> in his Apoſtleſhip, and therefore were all Preachers and Miniſters by Office, and were ſuch as had been formerly ſent out by Chriſt or <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> to preach and baptize and to worke Miracles, and therefore I affirme were all Miniſters and Preachers by their place and Office; and not only gifted brethren: and the Scripture is ſo cleere in it, as nothing can be more apparent: for it ſaith <hi>Wherefore</hi> of theſe <hi>men which have companyed with us all the time the Lord Ieſus went in and out amongſt us beginning from the baptiſme of</hi> Iohn <hi>unto the ſame day he was taken up from us, muſt one be ordained</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore of neceſſity they muſt needs be ancient and inveterate Diſciples and Miniſters by Office, or otherwiſe the Apoſtles would not have judged them fit for an Apoſtleſhip. And all theſe continued with the Apoſtles in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for ought any thing related to the contrary till their perſecution, and were of the Presbytery in that Church: and then it is ſaid they were all ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſaving the Apoſtles: therefore thoſe that went abroad Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Word after their diſperſion and publiſhing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, were Miniſters and Preachers by Office, which taught by the way of Sermons in all places where they came, and not out of charity as gifted brethren as I have formerly ſufficiently proved upon that place, whether I referre the Reader, and therefore ſhall not feare here to conclude that of neceſſity there muſt be an innumerable company of believers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that had imployed ſo many faithfull Miniſters and diligent Preachers almoſt an hundred ſo long a time, and the which in this their hotteſt perſecution tooke up and imployed
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48122:175"/>
twelve of the moſt painfull and laborious Miniſters in the world, who ſpent all their time in Praying and Preaching amongſt them: and for the performance of each of their duties, all intelligible Chriſtians will alſo gather, that they muſt neceſſarily have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Congregations and Aſſemblies: for all of them could not preach together at one time and in one place or roome, and therefore there were many Aſſemblies and Congregations even under the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the which afterward were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly multitplyed and increaſed when the Churches had reſt as the Scripture recordeth, the which amounted to many ten thouſands; all the which could not then poſſibly meete in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or a few. And this ſhall ſuffice to have anſwered to what ever Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> had vainely and impiouſly to Cavill againſt ſuch of my Arguments as they thought themſelves beſt able by their learning to deale with, for the ſeducing of unſtable and ungrounded people. And now I come to what my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> hath to ſay againſt all my foregoing Arguments. Whoſe words are theſe.</p>
               <p>But I come briefly to your Arguments, whereby you would prove your Claſſicall Preſbyterian government, and ſo upward. The paterne hereof you take from the Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Hereof many Arguments, or rather words, and tautologies you multiply, and toile your ſelfe and vexe your Reader withall, which you might have reduced to one. It is in ſumme this.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were many Chriſtian Congregations, and all theſe made but one Church, and ſo were governed by one Preſbytery.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being the prime Apoſtolicke Church, is a paterne for all ſucceeding Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> all Church government ought to be regulated by that, and conſequently by a Preſbytery over many Congregations.</p>
               <p>As for your indefinite enumeration of thoſe multitudes baptized by <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and by Chriſts Diſciples, we take no notice of them, unleſſe formed into a Church or Churches: but following the expreſſe Scripture, the firſt formed Church we finde is in <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>2.</hi> which though conſiſting of five thouſand, yet it was one intire particular Church, and not Churches; and they continued daily <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with one accorde in one place together <hi>(verſ. 1.)</hi> and in the Temple <hi>(ver. 44. 46.)</hi> growing from an hundred and twenty <hi>(Acts 1. verſ. 15.)</hi> to three thouſand more <hi>(Chap. 2. 41.)</hi> and then
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48122:175"/>
in all to five thouſand <hi>(chap. 4. 4.</hi> and all theſe but one Church, which aſſembled together to heare the Word in the Temple; and although they wanted a convenient place ſo ſpacious, as whereinto break bread, or receive the Lords Supper altogether, ſo as they were conſtrained to ſever themſelves into divers companies, in ſeverall private houſes to communicate; yet this ſevering was not a dividing of the church into ſo many diſtinct formall Churches, or Church bodyes, being but ſo many branches of one and the ſame particular Church; which though you call ſo many Congregations, yet properly ſo many Churches they were not. And therefore you never reade the Churches at or in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And this no nationall Church neither, witneſſe thoſe Churches in <hi>Iudea</hi> Gal. <hi>1. 22.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon I anſwer to your Argument; and firſt to your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. I deny that thoſe congregations you name are ſo many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches properly ſo called, having their diſtinct Officers and Members united into one Church body respectively: This I put you to prove: And without proving it, your <hi>11.</hi> or <hi>12.</hi> ſheets spent about that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prove to be meer waste paper. And for your aſſumption, that the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as being a prime Apoſtolick Church, is therefore a pattern for all ſucceeding Churches, and therefore for a Claſſicall Preſbytery over many Churches: You muſt firſt prove your propoſition, as before, that there were many Churches in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem conſtituted in their diſtinct formes and bodyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly it being no more then one entire particular Church (and not any Dioceſan, or Provinciall Church, or the Preſbytery thereof claſſicall (as you would beare us in hand) it is a paterne for all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches in ſucceeding ages; and yet by your favour not ſo perfect a paterne, as no Apoſtolick Church beſides it ſhould alſo come in to make up the paterne compleat. For wee are neceſſarily to take all the Churches in the New Teſtament together, to make up one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and perfect Church paterne. For in the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wee find election of Officers, but wee find not expreſſed that part of diſcipline for caſting out of corrupt Members, as in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo in the reſt. For the Churches were not brought forth to full perfection in one day. Their very conſtitution had a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall growth. The Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had not at firſt Deacons, till there was a neceſſity; and the largeneſſe of the Church required ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Deacons, which is no patterne for every Church to have ſeven Deacons. The ſumme is, to make up a compleat paterne, not onely
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48122:176"/>
the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Galatia,</hi> that of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and the reſt, are to be conferred together, that each may caſt in its ſhot to make up the full reckoning, that ſo what is not expreſt in one, may be ſupplyed by the reſt, to make one entire platforme. For the Scripture conſiſts of many parts, as ſo many Members in one body; one Member cannot ſay to another I have no need of thee, <hi>1 Cor. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if it muſt be a paterne for all other Churches, then in this that all other Churches muſt be ſubject to ſome one Church, becauſe <hi>(Acts 15.)</hi> things in queſtion were there debated, and determined, and ſent to other Churches to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. But for as much, as that Church, at that time in thoſe things was infallibly guided by the Holy Ghoſt, wherewith the Apoſtles there were inſpired, in which reſpect their reſolutions were with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it pleaſed the Holy Ghoſt and us (that which no particular Church ſince the Apoſtles could ever ſay) it followeth that the Church then at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> remaines not in all things a paterne for other Churches; for a paterne muſt be in all things imitable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for Appeales ſo much agitated, and preſſed, I have ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before, and elſe-where (as in my vindication) to vindicate the right uſe of that in point of Church matters. And ſo I paſſe briefly from your firſt queſtion to your ſecond; which is concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gathering of Churches, and admitting of Members and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p>I have ſet downe my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> expreſſions at large, that all men may ſee how fairely I deale with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s for his cenſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all my Arguments, that went before, by which I proved my firſt Propoſition, that they are rather words and tautoligies then arguments, by which I toyled my ſelfe and my Reader, I paſſe it by, as neither regarding his pr yſes, nor ſleightings, who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet conſtant to the Principles either of Humanity or Religion, but like the Camelion hee ſpeaketh of page 3. receives impreſſions of ſundry formes changeable according to the preſent condition: And as it is ſaid of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, that hee never ſpared any man in his rage, ſo it may truly be averred of him, that hee never ſpared any in his fury &amp; paſſion, neither living nor dead, upon the leaſt conceived diſpleaſure againſt them; no not thoſe hee was moſt obliged to, as all that have beene familiarly acquainted with
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48122:176"/>
him, and his frothy Pamphlets and language can teſtifie: for he ſpares not the King himſelfe, nor Parliament upon all occaſions, to the one of which notwithſtanding hee was not onely obliged in all Loyaltie as a ſubject, but as a ſpeciall ſervant: and to the other, if ever any man was ingaged in all the obligations of duty and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hee was, who is bound unto that great Councell for his Liberty, which is the life of life, and for his honour and good name, which is better then life; and yet hee hath ſpared neither, but hath moſt unchriſtianly, and undutifully, and that publickly and privately aſperſed them upon all occurrences: and therefore if at pleaſure hee can vilipend, ſleight, traduce and ſpeake evill of thoſe dignities, I may not thinke my ſelfe agrieved, if hee moſt unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly in his ſcriblings abuſe me.</p>
               <p>Yea, I am ſo farre from being offended at him, for this his ſo dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with mee, as I thinke my ſelfe honoured by it, and account it matter of rejoycing, having learned that leſſon of my heavenly Maſter, <hi>That when men revile me, reproach me and ſpeake all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evill of me falſely, for his names ſake, that I ſhould rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for ſo they have done by all the Prophets, Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>Luke</hi> the 6. and <hi>Paul</hi> tooke ſuch dealing from the falſe Teachers of his time, for matter of triumph, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 10.) ſaying, <hi>I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſsities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake, for when I am weake then am I ſtrong.</hi> This I apply unto my ſelfe, who have ſuffered as much from him, and thoſe of his party, in reproaches, in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and in all manner of reviling and blaſting language, as their daily Pamphlets and words can witneſſe, as any man now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and for no other cauſe that I know of, but that I maintaine the truth againſt error, and oppoſe the novelties and groundleſſe opinions of the times; all the which will the more aggravate their judgement; becauſe they did as immoderately prayſe me (as can be proved) before they knew my differing opinion from them, as they doe now maliciouſly and cauſeleſly vituperate mee: and the Lord knowes, that I am not changed in my opinion in any knowne truth from what I both beleeved and to my power pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, above theſe thirty yeares; neither had I any reaſon to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from my Principles, they being grounded upon the unerring word of truth: and therefore for my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and his parties ſleighting of mee, and my indeavours, I wave them as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48122:177"/>
meere Grolleries, knowing that my bookes have beene read by more judicious men, then either himſelfe, or any of his Fraternity, and have had the approbation of learned men at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>And now I come to his Argument, for hee hath not ſo much candour, and faire dealing in him, as to lay downe my reaſons, that the Reader might ſee the grounds of truth, but conceals them all, and makes a Syllogiſme of his owne, or elſe hath borrowed it, from ſome of his American friends, and fetcht it out of the new World: For I never read the like in either <hi>Europian</hi> or <hi>Aſian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; no nor in any <hi>African</hi> Author: &amp; yet that Country was famous for Monſters, and uſually eſteemed to be the Mother and Nurſery of prodigious births, and yet ſuch a Syllogiſme I never ſaw brought forth by any of that Nation, as this of his framing: and I am confident that every ſucking Sophiſter will bee ready truly to ſay of it, as hee falſely ſpeakes of thoſe multitudes baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; Chriſts diſciples, that they were not formed into a Church or Churches: the ſame I ſay, will any but a Novice in the Art of diſputation conclude of his Syllogiſme, that it hath neither forme, mood, or figure: and that I could eaſily make evident, were it not for miſpending of precious time, and that I deſire not to diſpleaſe the good old Father, in diſcovering his nakedneſſe, and infirmities, who if hee were ſo highly offended with mee, becauſe hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived I meant him, when I ſpake of a Basket-hilted beard, how much would hee be inraged, if I ſhould diſcover his ignorance, and make it appeare, that hee is a meer ſtranger in the art of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which hee would perſwade the world hee were ſo great a Maſter in.</p>
               <p>But leaving that, I will come the matter in hand, which is of publicke concernment: and in the firſt place, I muſt needs blame him for his Sacriledge and unjuſt dealing, who at one time robbs the Church of Chriſt of ſuch multitudes of believers as were converted and baptized by the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and by them added unto the Church of the Iews, who were then the only viſible Church upon earth, and proclaimed by Chriſt himſelf <hi>(Iohn</hi> 4.) to be the only true worſhippers, who ſaith that <hi>Salvation was of the</hi> Iews, <hi>and that the</hi> Samaritans, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped they knew not what.</hi> Now to the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> thoſe true worſhippers, thoſe that were converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſts Diſciples, and baptized into Chriſt, were
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48122:177"/>
added: and therfore they were worthy to have been taken notice of by my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> as formed into a Church or Churches, if believing in Chriſt, repenting and being baptized in his name and by his authority, be ſufficient to make men members of a Church: for as the Catholicke viſible Church conſiſts of many Nationall, Provinciall, and Presbyterian Churches, ſo did the Nationall church of the Iews of many citie &amp; Countries, Churches which were in their Dialect called Synagogues, which is the ſame with our Churches both in cities and countries, as all the learned well know; for in all thoſe Synagogues they partaked daily in the morall worſhip, and had the Preaching of the law and the Keyes of Heaven. Now then when thoſe multitudes that I enumerated in my arguments, baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and the bleſſed Apoſtles, and the ſeventy Diſciples were all gathered into Chriſts fold, and made his ſheepe and true believers, and that by the Preaching of the Goſpell, and hearing of the voyce of their Paſtors, and had amongſt them all thoſe ſealing and diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Ordinances, that were ſufficient not only to forme them into a church or churches, but to difference them from Pagans and Infidels, <hi>as who were</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>to whom pertained the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the glory, the Covenants and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the promiſes,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. verſ. 4. all which I conceive were ſufficent and avaylable to make any then living, members of Chriſts Church.</p>
               <p>I ſay, when they had circumciſion, and the Paſſoever, &amp; baptiſme, and the Law and the Goſpell and that worſhip of God that he had eſtabliſhed amongſt them, and were his peculiar people, of whom Chriſt had given this teſtimony that they were his true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and when they were alſo gathered in according to Gods own appointment, by the ſound of the Goſpell and by the preaching of Faith and Repentance and by the Miniſtry of the Word, as all the Prophets had formerly gathered Churches, then thoſe that were Baptized by <hi>Iohn, who was</hi> a Prophet ſent of God <hi>(Luke</hi> the 3.) and ſent to baptize <hi>(Iohn</hi> the 1. 33.) and thoſe that were baptized by the Diſciples <hi>who</hi> were ſent from Chriſt as he was from his Father who ſaid <hi>Go teach all nations baptiſing them, &amp;c.</hi> all they I ſay ought by my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all the Independents to be taken notice of, as formed into a Church or Churches, what ſo ever he and <hi>I. S.</hi> ſay to the contrary, who in this agree, that thoſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48122:178"/>
that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> and by <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples were no Chriſtians, much <hi>leſſe caſt into a Church mould, according to the New-Teſtament forme, and leſt of all that they were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Chriſtian Church at</hi> Ieruſalem. Theſe are <hi>J. S.</hi> his formall words pag. 9. So that whiles theſe men vvill diſpute againſt the truth, they blaſpheme and give the Spirit of God the lye: for Chriſt hath ſaid, that they that heare his Diſciples, heare him, and that they that heare his voyce are his ſheepe; novv, vvhen all thoſe that vvere converted by their Miniſtry, and vvere in token of their faith and obedience baptized, and had given up their names unto Chriſt, they were all incorporated into his fold, which is his church, his Myſticall body, and were moulded into a church or churches, and ſo they are ſet down to us in the holy Scriptures as believers and true members of Chriſts church; and therefore formed into a church or churches; for there is but one Shepherd and one ſheep-fold, and Chriſt had then no other church on earth that we reade of but that of the Iewes; and which is yet more, it was a reformed church; for Chriſt had caſt out all the Buyers and Sellers <hi>(John</hi> 2.) out of the Temple, and cals it his Fathers houſe, and the houſe of prayer, ſo that it was now a pure church, and clenſed from all pollutions, and in the which all Chriſts Ordinances were in their purity; here was the Preaching of the Goſpell, the Teaching of the Law, and all the ſealing Ordinances, both old and new: here was Circumciſion, the Paſſeover, Sacrifices and Ceremonies, here was Baptiſme and the Lords Supper or breaking of bread; here was the true Invocation or calling on the name of God, and that in the houſe of Prayer, where all Supplications were heard, and that before Chriſts death: Here we have all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls for the making or forming of a church or churches, or caſting of Chriſtians into a church mould according to the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtament forme (to ſpeak a little in the Independents dialect) for here we have viſible Saints in multitudes, devoute men and true worſhippers from out of all the Nations under heaven <hi>(Acts</hi> 2): here we have Chriſt and his twelve Apoſtles, and his ſeventy Diſciples, Elders and Teachers in abundance, beſides many Women that followed him and miniſtred unto him; here was no want of Miniſters and Officers and Members of all ſorts beſides innumerable multitudes of believers and cryers <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and all
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48122:178"/>
this before Chriſts death, as well as after, and all theſe Chriſtian believers, and ſuch as did partake of all ſealing and ſaving Ordinances ſufficient to caſt them into a church mould, and to forme them into a church or churches, as well as after Chriſts aſcenſion: and therefore my indefinite enumeration of thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts Diſciples, ought by my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> and all the Independents to have been taken notice of as formed into a church or churches, without Chriſt and his bleſſed Apoſtles who partaked in all Ordinances, be not in their eſteeme reputed Chriſtians and formed into a church, or caſt into a church mould, which were blaſphemy in any to thinke, and therefore is much more the height of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> to affirme and Print: for <hi>I. S.</hi> his expreſſions I produced them often before. I will now ſet downe my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> formall words, which I cannot but reiterate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For your indefinite enumeration</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of thoſe mulititudes baptized by</hi> Iohn, <hi>and by Chriſts Diſciples, we take no notice of them unleſſe formed into a church or churches; but following the expreſſe Scripture, the firſt formed church we finde is in Acts</hi> 2. Theſe are his words and that in the name of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſaying <hi>we take no notice of them.</hi> So that by this, all men may gather that in the Independents language, and in their Divinity, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and all Chriſts Diſciples with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all Chriſtian believers in Chriſts time, and all that by baptiſme were received into Chriſts fold and church, and ſuch as had given up their names to Chriſt, were not worthy to be taken notice of by the Independent brethren who eſteeme of them all as no Chriſtians, but a deformed church, and not caſt into a church mould: For my brother <hi>Burton</hi> peremptorily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, and that in the name of all the Independents pag. 11. that following the expreſſe Scripture, the firſt formed church we finde is in <hi>Acts</hi> the 2.

up as they ought to be and formed into a Church or Churches; which if it be not the height of blaſphemy, I refer to the judgment of any intelligent Reader! Amongſt them in their new moulded congregations, a Paſtor &amp; a Teacher, and two Elders, and a Deacon and five or ſix brethren more and three or four Siſters can make up a formed Church after the New Teſtament form; Now is there any man ſo ſtupid and brutiſh as will not conclude that where Chriſt was the great Paſtor and Shepherd of our Soules, and where there were <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> two Teachers or Doctors, thoſe <hi>Bonaerges,</hi> thoſe ſonnes of Thunder, and eight or nine Elders with ſeventy Diſciples all Saints all whoſe names were writ in heaven with multitudes of Beleevers with many women that followed Chriſt the great Shepherd of our ſouls, who had alſo a Decon amongſt them, <hi>Judas</hi> by name, that all theſe could not or did not make up a formed church or churches, when ten or twelve in their whibling congregations, ſo qualified as formerly, can make a formed church after the New Teſtament form? I ſay he that ſhall not beleeve that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the great ſhepherd of his ſheep, and all his Diſciples, Schollers and followers cannot as well make a formed church, as a few in our new founded or rather confounded congregations, is voyd of all reaſon and underſtanding: And they that ſhall peremptorily and raſhly affirm that they were not a true formed church, I proclaim them guilty of blaſphemy and deſerving moſt condigne puniſhment: And therfore when my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and many of the Independents are guilty of this heinous and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinorous crime they ought ſeverely to be dealt with, as prevaricators againſt the divine Majeſty of the King of Saints and King of Kings and againſt the honour of the Saints in Chriſts time, and ought by all Chriſts true Diſciples and ſuch as love the honour and dignity of their King and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be abominated as a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of falſe teachers, calumniators and horrid ſeducers, how godly ſoever they ſeem to the wrold to be.</p>
               <p>And as all ſuch teachers as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices are, ought by Chriſts Saints and Servants to be looked on as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of grand impoſtors and juglers: So the poor and deſpiſed Presbyterians, who they terme ſinners and carnall people, and men of earth and enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, may comfort themſelves in this <hi>that they are like their maſter and his Diſciples, and all that were converted by John the Baptiſt and by the Miniſtry</hi>

So that neither <hi>Chriſt</hi> nor his Diſciples nor <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and his Diſciples, nor the hundred and twenty names we read of <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. in their learning were a formed church, nor all the other worſhippers the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. nor thought worthy by them to be taken notice of for a church or churches; So that by this bold aſſertion of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I.

               <p>And truly if the hundred and twenty names were not a true for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med church, there was then none upon Earth. And if they had not been a formed church according to the New Teſtament forme, they could not have given a forme to other churches; for all learned chriſtians agree in this, <hi>That it muſt be a true formed Church, that muſt make others true formed churches:</hi> For they cannot give and communicate that to others that they have not themſelvs: this is one of their own principles, and therefore they cannot deny it.</p>

Now if the hundred and twenty names were a true formed church, then all that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples, and as many as were converted by their Miniſtry, were a true for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med church or churches; for they were all formed after one and the ſame way, ſo that what made the hundred and twenty Names a true formed church, made all the other a true formed church or churches, if the ſame cauſe can produce the ſame or the like effect.</p>

               <p>And if it be duly conſidered what the Independents teach and hold concerning a true formed Church, after the New Teſtament forme, and according to their Principles, then this very Church my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſaith was the firſt formed Church wee reade of, was neither in his owne opinion, nor according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of thoſe of the congregationall way, a true formed Church, as not having diſtinct Officers and Members united into one Church body reſpectively, and therefore not a church properly ſo called: and ſo then it will follow, there was not at that time a true formed church in the World, which is impious to ſay or thinke, as in the ſequell of this tractate by Gods aſſiſtance I ſhall abundantly make appeare, and that from my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> owne words, and from the Independents definition of a Church: and therefore my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> ought as little to have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe converted by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon for the firſt formed Church as of thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for they had not their diſtinct Officers and Members united into a Church body reſpectively according to their learning; yea they had not then Deacons at all, nor Elders as many of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents hold, nor other of their requiſits for the making of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church: and therefore it was notachurch properly ſo called to ſpeake in their Dialect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But of theſe things in their due place.</p>

               <p>Now my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> an old Diſciple, and Father amongſt them, acknowledgeth that there were many congregations of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp; that in its infancy and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and proveth it by reaſon and arguments, as <hi>that there was no place great enough to containe them all; and therefore they were forced into ſeverall aſſemblies, and that the largeneſſe of the church required ſeven Deacons.</hi> Theſe are his owne words, by which he proveth many congregations in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which was that I laboured to prove, and therefore hee hath done my worke. Now all men know where there are ſeven Treaſurers, there muſt needs be an innumerable number and multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: For two or three Treaſurers would have ſerved any one congregation though it had conſiſted of many more then five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, as daily experience teacheth us.

Now if his brethren doe not truly conclude of him, and ſay, as they did, when he writ his Proteſtation proteſted of which hee himſelfe was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that hee was a weake man, and unfit for that buſines, and that hee ſhould have left that diſpute to thoſe that had many yeares ſtudied the queſtion, I ſhall be much deceived: and if I have not beene miſ-informed by ſome of that way, many of the moſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

of them for judgement, have already given this verdict of him, and that for his very <hi>vindiciae veritatis,</hi> or rather <hi>falſitatis,</hi> and for his <hi>Truth ſhut out of doores</hi> that hee was a weake man, and unfit for this imployment, as being a man of more paſſion and choler then grounded reaſon and argumentation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would ſpoyle their cauſe.</p>
               <p>But now to the matter in hand. My Brother <hi>Burton</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the Beleevers in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were ſo many, in the very infancy of it, that for want of a convenient place, as wherein to breake bread, or receive the Lords Supper all together, they were conſtrained to ſever themſelves into divers companies; and to communicate in ſeverall private houſes, which conceſſion of his quite overthrowes the opinion of thoſe of the congregationall way as they call it; yet ſaith hee, this ſevering was not a dividing of the Church into ſo many diſtinct formall Churches or Church bodies, becauſe but ſo many branches of one and the ſame particular church, which though (ſaith hee) you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo many congregations, yet properly ſo many Churches they were not, as not having their diſtinct Officers and Members united into one Church body reſpectively. Theſe are his formall words. So that he diſtinguiſheth between church and congregation, as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth betweene <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not making them ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonima's, as other men and thoſe of the congregationall way uſually doe, and thinkes by this his grollery to evade the dint of all Arguments that are brought to convince them. The queſtion therefore betweene me and my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> at this time, is, <hi>Whether a congregation and a company of beleevers communicating together in church Fellowſhip, and in all the ſaving and ſealing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, be a church properly ſo called,</hi> which my Brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> denies, ſaying, that although I called them ſo many congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet properly ſo many churches they were not; and puts mee upon the proofe of it: and therefore to gratifie my kind bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; to ſhew how willing I am to pleaſe his humour I do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that work. Now if I can make it appeare, &amp; evince, that thoſe ſeverall Aſſemblies and congregations of Beleevers in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> wee reade of in the firſt ſix chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> were ſo many ſeverall churches properly ſo called, then hee will acknowledge and confeſſe that my elevenor twelve ſheets ſpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Argument prove no waſte paper; and then alſo the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48122:182"/>
betweene us is at an end, and hee muſt turne Presbyterian Dependent if hee hath any honeſty in him. This then is my taske to maintaine, and prove that thoſe congregations and ſeverall aſſemblies or companies of Beleevers in the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were ſo many churches properly ſo called, which by the grace of God and his bleſſed aſſiſtance I doubt not but to make good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had ſufficiently himſelf overthrowne the Independents doctrine, by the very granting there were many congregations in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by the way, before I come to prove what I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I will take this liberty to premiſe thus much, if That my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> ſpeaketh of the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> bee orthodox di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſevering of themſelves, into divers compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and into many ſeverall congregations, in ſeverall private houſes, for the partaking in all the Ordinances, and for the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the acts of worſhip, that they might be the better edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes them not ſo many diſtinct formall churches, or church bodies properly ſo called, (becauſe but ſo many branches of one and the ſame particular church, the communicating and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating notwithſtanding in al the which Ordinances in al ages, was thought ſufficient to conſtitute a formall church, or a church body properly ſo called): then I affirme the ſame may be concluded of the catholick viſible church; for that is but one church, and one ſheep-fold, as being founded and built upon that one Rock <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that onely Paſtor and Shepheard of his ſheepe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of theſe concluſions muſt neceſſarily inſue upon his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>viz.</hi> if the ſevering of a particular church into many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and aſſemblies makes them not ſeverall churches or church bodies properly ſo called, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> teaches; becauſe it is but one and the ſame church, and all thoſe congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are but ſo many branches of that one church: then the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the catholike viſible church into many congregations and aſſemblies through the world, makes them not ſo many chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches properly ſo called, becauſe the church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is but one and the ſame church, and all thoſe congregations are but ſo many branches of that one church: and ſo by his learning there ſhall now be no viſible churches upon earth properly ſo called, although they injoy all Chriſts Ordinances in each of them, for they are but ſo many branches of that one church. And if this bee good

Divinity, then let all men turne Expectants and Seekers, for wee have not in the world as yet any particular viſible formed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for all theſe ſeverall congregations are but ſo many branches of that one catholicke viſible church: and a branch and a member of a church is not a church properly ſo called in my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> Dialect: and therefore wee have no true viſible churches, or church bodies upon earth properly ſo called: this I ſay will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow upon my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> unſound Principles and this his opinion, which I am confident upon his more ſerious thoughts, and when he makes not ſuch haſte, (as he confeſſes he did, when he writ this his book againſt me) he will acknowledge to be very erroneous.</p>
               <p>But if he ſhall againſt all reaſon, undertake to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame doctrine concerning the Catholicke viſible church he doth about the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> I am aſſured he will be highly condemned by the learnedeſt of his party as well as by the univerſall conſent of all the judicious Divines in the world, who I know are of a contrary judgement. But I ſay, if upon mature deliberation he ſhall acknowledge and grant that the ſeverall congregations or churches of believers mentioned in the Scriptures, as that of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Galatia</hi> &amp;c. and their own ſeverall congregations in their new gathered churches (howſoever he will not grant that title unto our aſſemblies) I ſay if he ſhall but accord that both the primitive churches and their new congregations be churches properly ſo called or church bodies, though but ſo many branches and members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke viſible church, which yet is but one and the ſame church: then likewiſe of neceſſity it will follow, and he muſt yeild unto it, that all thoſe ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were churches properly ſo called, though but ſo many branches of that one and the ſame particular church, becauſe as the learned know, all particular congregations and churches that partake in all the Ordinances as they are ſimilar parts of the whole church, ſo they doe all partake of the name and nature of it and are all of them churches properly ſo called; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the very ſame reaſon I ſay, all thoſe ſeverall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aſſemblies in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> being parts of that Nationall city or Presbyterian church, that one and the ſame church, as partaking both of the name and nature of that church,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48122:183"/>
are all of them churches properly ſo called; one of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, I affirme will neceſſarily follow from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> principles. And for the better evidencing of what I have ſaid, I will adde a few words more by way of a corollary, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the whole church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had in it to make it the firſt formed church properly ſo called, the ſame had all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and aſſemblies reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeverally conſidered, to make every one of them churches properly ſo called: And therefore if the whole church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> may challenge the name of a true formed church (as the Independents acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) then the ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeverally conſidered, might do the ſame, and were churches properly ſo called. For if the whole conſiſted of viſible Saints, ſo did every one of thoſe ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies conſiſt of viſible Saints. And if the whole had the bleſſed Apoſtles in it and Chriſts ſeventy Diſciples and all ſorts of church Officers, ſo had every ſeverall congregation and aſſembly of that church, though but a part and a branch of the whole. And if the whole church inioyed all the ſaving and ſealing ordinances and all acts of worſhip, and continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip and in breaking bread and in prayer, ſo did every one of thoſe congregations and aſſemblies ſeverally and reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered: And therefore when all the branches of that one particular church at <hi>Ieruſalem, viz:</hi> every congregation and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſeverally conſidered and as a part, were equall to the whole church in all priviledges immunities and in whatſoever is required for the making of a true formed church, ſo that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to either of thoſe congregations that the whole church partaked in and injoyed or could challenge for the making it a compleat Church, then it followeth and that neceſſarily, that if the whole church be a true formed church and a church properly ſo called as the Independents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that all thoſe congregations &amp; aſſemblies ſeverally conſidered were churches properly ſo called. This I thought good to premiſe. And now I come to make good what I undertooke, which is to prove thoſe ſeverall Aſſemblies in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to be churches properly ſo called, which I do by this argument.</p>
               <p>All ſuch aſſemblies &amp; congregations as daily met together in diverſe companies in the Temple, and in <hi>Solomons Porch</hi> and in ſeverall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

houſes, in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell, and in the name of Chriſt, and clothed with his power, and honoured with Chriſts preſence, being all believers and Saints, and ſuch as gladly received the word, and were all baptized and continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in the breaking of bread and in prayer, and injoyed amongſt themſelves in their ſeverall congregations all the ſaving and ſealing Ordinances, and all Acts of worſhip, and whatſoever priviledges and immunities the whole church par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taked in (and the which the Independents themſelves repute and thinke ſufficient for the making and conſtituting of a formed church) and who alſo had amongſt them in thoſe ſeverall aſſemblies Miniſters immediately ſent them of God and inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, every one of the which had the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven given unto them by Chriſt himſelfe, with a promiſe to be with them to the ende of the world, and that whatſoever they looſed on earth ſhould be looſed in heaven; and whatſoever they bound on earth ſhould be bound in heaven, and that his ſpirit alſo ſhould leade them into all truth; the which Miniſters likewiſe taught them whatſoever Chriſt had commanded them, and that daily in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and in every houſe, all and every one of them reſpectively and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally taken, were true and compleate churches properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>But in the church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there were many ſuch aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and congregations as dayly met together in diverſe companies in the Temple and in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> and in ſeveral private houſes, in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell, and in the name of Chriſt, and clothed with his power, and honoured with Chriſts preſence, being all believers and Saints, and ſuch as gladly received the Word, and were all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in the breaking of bread and in prayers, and injoyed amongſt themſelves in their ſeverall congregations, all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſealing Ordinances, and all acts of worſhip and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever priviledges and immunities the whole church partaked in, and the which the Independents themſelves repute and thinke ſufficient for the making and conſtituting of a formed church, and who alſo had amongſt them in thoſe ſeverall aſſemblies Miniſters immediately ſent them of God and inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, every one of the which had the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven given them by Chriſt himſelfe, with a promiſe to be with them to the end of the world, and that whatſoever they looſed on earth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48122:184"/>
ſhould be looſed in Heaven; and whatſoever they bound on earth ſhould be bound in Heaven, and that his ſpirit alſo ſhould leade them into all truth: the which Miniſters likewiſe taught them whatſoever Chriſt had commanded them, and that dayly in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and in every houſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all and every one of thoſe Aſſemblies and Congregations reſpectively and ſeverally taken, were true and compleat churches properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>For the Major, no well grounded Chriſtian will deny it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Independents cannot gain ſay it: for if two or three met together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell and in Chriſts name make a true viſible church, as thoſe of the congregationall way hold and teach; then much more where two or three hundreds are met together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell and in the name of Chriſt and in the which alſo they partaked in all the ſaving and ſealing Ordinances, as in the preaching of the Word and Prayer, and in the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, and that by lawfull Miniſters and Officers appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſent by God himſelfe; I ſay, by far better reaſon ſuch a congregation is a true and viſible and compleate church proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called, as all rationall and intelligible men will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; and therefore this cannot be denied by the Independents, eſpecially when (as I noted before) it is their owne Doctrine, taught in all their writings, and Preached by every one of the congregationall way, and confirmed by their own daily practice. And to paſſe by many books writ of late by the Miniſters of <hi>New-England</hi> and ſome of the Independent Miniſters here amongſt us, I will only at this time pitch upon one who hath in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, dealt more candidly then any of his brethren: for he kepes no reſerves <hi>Donec ad triarios redierit res,</hi> but ſets downe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they hold. I will make bold therefore with his new blaſing lights, lately ſet up, upon that learned Beaken, called <hi>Truth gloriouſly appearing from under the ſad and ſable cloude of oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy.</hi> In the which treatiſe, pag. 22. and 23. the author in the name of all the Independents declares their judgement, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this buſineſſe, whoſe words I will ſet down at large, deſiring to deliver their minde in their own expreſſions rather then in mine, that they may not hereafter accuſe me to have pickt and choſe what made moſt for me and againſt them, and left the reſt. His words are theſe.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> It may poſſibly here be objected, how will it appeare that ſo ſmall a number as two or three joyned together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell, do conſtitute a viſible Church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It will appeare evident by this inſuing argument. Chriſt hath given his power, and promiſed his preſence to two or three ioyned together in the fellowſhip of the Gospell; therefore two or three ſo joyned together, do conſtitute a viſible church.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is proved from the Words of Chriſt <hi>Matth. 18.</hi> If thy brother offend thee, tell him of it; if he refuſe to heare thee, take two or three; if he heare not them, tell it to the church: if he neglect to heare the church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen and a Publican. I ſay unto you, whatſoever you ſhall binde on earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever yee ſhall looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven. Loe! Here's their power given them by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The preſence of Chriſt is promiſed by them. <hi>verſ. 20.</hi> Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middeſt of them.</p>
                  <p>The conſequent cannot be denied; for what people in the world may be called a church, if they may not, to whom Chriſt hath given his power, and promiſed his preſence? If the gifts of Chriſt be of any force, if the power of Chriſt be of any efficacy, then they have a right to be ſo called. Neither is this deſtitute of learned men, who have given their ſuffrage to it. <hi>Humfred.</hi> de religione vera conſervanda pag. <hi>24.</hi> Eccleſiam cum dico, non unum aut alterum ſacerdotem aut mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum, ſed legitimum ac Chriſtianum catum nomino et innuo.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the definition of a viſible church, will prove the conſequent. A viſible church is a myſticall body whereof Chriſt is the head, the members be Saints, called out of the world, &amp; united together into one congregation by an holy covenant, to worſhip the Lord, and to edifie one another in all his holy Ordinances. This definition, though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly looke upon a compleate church, it is appliable to two or three that are joyned together in the fellowſhip of the faith of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2,</hi> Object: But is it like that two or three there is taken for the church mentioned <hi>verſ. 17.</hi> to which Chriſt hath given his power?</p>
                  <p>Anſw. I do not ſay that it is alwaies ſo taken, for becauſe the church doth frequently conſiſt <hi>of many; but</hi> this I ſay, that it may be ſo taken, as the very coherence of the words ſhews.</p>
                  <p>Beſide, it will further appeare thus; if two or three may meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, clothed with Chriſts power, and honoured with Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48122:185"/>
then two or three may be the church mentioned, <hi>verſ. 17.</hi> but two or three may meet together, clothed with Chriſts power; for they meet in his name (as the text speakes) <hi>1.</hi> e. clothed with his power, for name ſignifieth power in ſeverall Scriptures <hi>Prov.</hi> the <hi>18. 10. Philip. 2. 10.</hi> and honoured with his preſence: and therefore two or three may be the church there mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3.</hi> Object. But ſuch a company being deſtitute of Officers, can be no church.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. If it had been ſaid, they could have been no compleate church, I would have conſented. But to ſay, that they are not a compleat church, therefore they are no church, is a <hi>Non ſequitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man that wants a hand, or foot, or both, is notwithſtanding a man, though a maimed man, Officers do not concurr to the <hi>eſſe</hi> or being of a church; but to the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> or well being of a church; for otherwiſe, put caſe the Officers of a church dye, then muſt the church be unchurched, and ſo <hi>Toties quoties</hi> as ſuch a thing happens, which in times of mortality may be often. Againe, a company of believers ioyned together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell hath the matter and forme of a church, even before it hath any Officers, and therefore is a Church without them; it hath the matter of a Church, a company believing <hi>1 Cor. 1. 2. Epheſ. 1. 1.</hi> and it hath the forme of a Church, <hi>viz.</hi> a combining and uniting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together into one body by the bond of an holy Covenant.</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoke ſome thing the more in this particular, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſuch as have built upon this foundation; that upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any books, or hearig of any arguments on the contrary ſide, their hearts may not (like the heart of Ahaz <hi>Iſai</hi> the <hi>7. 1.</hi> when he heard of the confederacy of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Ephraim)</hi> be moved, as the trees of the wood are moved with the winde.</p>

               <p>This is the diſcourſe of that Author, whoſe words I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in their full length and extent, not intending at this time to ſhew all the errors of them, which would require a juſt volume, though occaſonally I ſhall meete with ſome of them, and make it appeare that according to his diſcription of a church, which he hath taken out of Maſter <hi>Cotteos</hi> booke of <hi>New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>England</hi> none of the congregationall churches at this day are compleate churches properly ſo called. And if that alſo my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſpeakes, be true, then the very church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as I ſaid before) which he calles the firſt formed church, was not a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48122:186"/>
true formed church properly ſo called. All this occaſionally I hope to make evident.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, I will make uſe of ſuch Arguments, as the new lights from the Summer Ilands afforde me, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of my major propoſition, which was, that, All thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Congregations, met together in thoſe ſeverall houſes at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> every one of them reſpectively and ſeverally taken, were churches properly ſo called. And this I doe the more willingly, becauſe I conceive it will better ſound in my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> eares, and thoſe of his party, to heare one of their own great Rabbyes who they uſually call Giants, and tall fellowes, then to heare me, who at pleaſure they ſtile a Pigmy and Dwarfe; from his words therefore I thus argue.</p>
               <p>If two or three met together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell and in Chriſts name, and clothed with his power, and honoured with his preſence, doe conſtitute a viſible church, as he aſſerteth and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to prove in the name of all the Independents: then much more two or three hundred met together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell and in Chriſts name, and clothed with his power, and honoured with his preſence, having amongſt them alſo their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Officers and Miniſters, and injoying likewiſe all thoſe ſaving and ſealing Ordinances within themſelves, which the Independents confeſſe are ſufficient for the conſtituting of a Church properly ſo called, then I ſay, and that with far better reaſon, that ſuch a company doe conſtitute a compleat viſible Church or a Church body properly ſo called: but in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> there was not onely two or three met together or two or three ſuch Aſſemblies and Congregations, but at leaſt twelve, if not halfe twelve ſcore, yea innumerable, in all and every one of the which, they met together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpell and in Chriſts name, and clothed with his power, and honoured with his preſence, and in all and every one of the which reſpectively and ſeverally, they had alſo their lawfull Officers and Miniſters, and injoyed all thoſe ſaving and ſealing Ordinances, which the Independents confeſſe arr ſufficient for the conſtituting of a Church properly ſo called. <hi>Ergo</hi> all and every one of thoſe Congregations ſeverally and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively conſidered were Churches properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>This Argument is grounded upon the Independents owne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and upon their very words, and corroborated with their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48122:186"/>
owne reaſons, <hi>For what people</hi> (ſay they) <hi>in the world may bee called a Church, if they may not, to whom Chriſt hath given his power, and promiſed his preſence? If the gifts of Chriſt be of any force, if the power of Christ bee of any efficacy, then they have a right to be ſo called.</hi> Thus the Independents ſpeake; and therefore without they will renounce their owne Principles, and abjure all reaſon, and the very light of underſtanding given them of God, they muſt acknowledge <hi>thoſe ſeverall congregations in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to be Churches properly ſo called, as having in every one of them whatſoever they thinke requiſite and ſufficient to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a formed Church; for there were in each of them reſpectively ſuch Miniſters and Officers, as to whom Chriſt had given his power, and promiſed his preſence, and that to the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this that I have now ſaid for the confirmation of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> Propoſition of my Argument may ſuffice, it being grounded upon the Independents owne Principles and Doctrine, ſo that I ſhall not need any more Reaſons for the corroborating of the truth of the ſame.</p>
               <p>As for my <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, they that ſhall reade but the firſt ſix Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the 18. of <hi>Matt.</hi> and the 28. of the ſame Booke, and the ſixteenth and twentieth of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhall find it ſufficiently confirmed; yea, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> denys not, that there were many congregations in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>

ther for the better and more orderly governing &amp; regulating of them.</p>
               <p>And it is very fit, that as the Mother Churches, and thoſe the moſt pureſt ones, were ruled and ordered, ſo ſhould all the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Churches be moderated and regulated in all following Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the full conſummation of all things: yea, all reaſon will perſwade any intelligible man, that a Councel or colledge of grave Divines and experienced men, and men of Knowledge, Learning, and Integrity, ſhould know a great deale better how to governe, then a few giddy headed, witleſſe and worthleſſe men, &amp; women, which moſt of the new Congregations conſiſt of.</p>
               <p>Now in all the Primitive and Apoſtolicall Churches wee find this kind of government, as in the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> the which conſiſted of many and ſeverall Congregations in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Precincts, and yet made but one Church in their particular Juriſdictions, and all thoſe my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſpeaks of, and which hee brings in for the making up of a compleate paterne of Church government, were ſo governed <hi>communi conſilio Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum,</hi> as that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as I ſhall by and by briefly prove, after I have anſwered to what my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> hath yet to ſay in this buſines, to whoſe words if any credit may be given, then the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> it ſelfe which hee cals the firſt formed Church, was not a perfect formed Church; for hee accuſeth that of imperfection, and not that only, but all the other Primitive and Apoſtolicall Churches, ſaying that they were not compleate within themſelves; ſo that to make up a compleate patterne of a true conſtituted Church, we muſt borrow ſomething from each of them; and he affirmes, that there is the ſame relation betweene church and churches, that is betweene the Members of the body, every one having need of the other; ſo that of neceſſity by this his doctrine they were all dependent, by the which he doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all his brethren of the congregationall way, who hold and labour to maintaine not the perfection onely of every one of the Primitive churches within themſelves; but the parity likewiſe of them, and the equall authority; and affirme that they were all Independent; which opinion of theirs, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes, making them all Dependent.</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48122:188"/>
would beare us in hand it is a paterne to all particular Churches in ſucceeding ages; and yet (by your favour) not ſo perfect, as no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick churches beſides it ſhould alſo come in, to make up the patern compleat; for wee muſt neceſſarily take all the Churches, &amp;c. <hi>as you may ſee at large in his words before quoted. I deſire the Reader here in the ſecond part of his anſwer, to take notice of his expreſſions; where,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, there is <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> an ordinary Error amongſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall dealing men: hee begs the queſtion, denying the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to be claſſicall, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Scripture ſufficiently evinceth, as hath beene abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> conſiſted of many congregations, and notwithſtanding it was governed by the joynt conſent and common counſell of many Presbyters, to both which he accordeth, and yet as if nothing had beene granted by himſelf, or ſaid by me, to prove it, hee grolliſhly denieth it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall intreat the Reader to obſerve, how he doth not onely contradict himſelfe, but oppoſe all his brethren of the congregationall way: for they all acknowledge, That the church at Jeruſalem, and the government of that, was to be a paterne of Government to all churches inſucceeding times, as being a moſt perfect paterne, and the Mother church, in imitation of the which Government as they pretend, they mould up all their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregationall churches; ſaying, that as the church at Jeruſalem had an abſolute power within it ſelfe, and was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon any other churches, as being compleate within it ſelfe, ſo ought every church in like manner, after the example of that church, to exerciſe all authority within it ſelfe, and not have dependency on any other; for in all particulars they avow, the church of Ieruſalem was a perfect formed church, and the ſame they aſſert of all the Primitive and Apoſtolicall churches. This I ſay is the Doctrine of all the Idependents beſides himſelfe, that I ever have read or talked with; yea, my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> in the beginning of his Anſwer to his owne Argument, ſaith, that the firſt formed Church we finde, is in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Then if it was a formed Church (as hee confeſſeth) &amp; then there was nothing wanting unto it; ſo that of neceſſity it muſt be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate and perfect church; for that that is deficient and deformed, that cannot bee ſaid to be perfect and compleate and a formed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48122:189"/>
church; now if it were a formed church, as he above ſaid, then it was a perfect and an entire church, as all rationall men will eaſily and readily gather. And yet notwithſtanding here he affirmeth that it was not a perfect paterne; and therefore (ſaith he) for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of a compleate paterne of church government, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtolicall churches beſides it muſt come in. By which words of his, I maintaine, hee does not only oppoſe all thoſe of his owne party, who all hold the contrary, but contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let us heare himſelfe ſpeake: of</hi> neceſſity <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> we are to take all the churches of the New Teſtament together, to make up one entire and perfect Church patern. For in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> we find Election of Officers, but we find not expreſſed that part of Diſcipline for caſting out of corrupt Members, as in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo in the rest. For the Churches were not brought forth to full perfection in one day. Their very constitution had a graduall growth. The Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had not Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons at firſt till there was neceſſity. The ſumme is, to make up a compleat patern, not only the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Philippi</hi> and the reſt are to be conferred together, that each may cast in its ſhot, to make up the full reckoning, ſo that what is not expreſt in the one, may be ſupplied by the reſt, to make up one Entire Platform. For the Scripture conſists of many Books, as ſo many Members in one body, one Member cannot ſay to an other I have no need of thee, <hi>1</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. <hi>12.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus my brother <hi>Burton</hi> confuteth all his brethren, who in all their writings with an unanimous conſent hold, <hi>that the church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and all the other Apoſtolicke churches were prefect formed churches, and abſolute within themſelves and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent:</hi> where as he blames them all of imperfection, and ſayes, <hi>They muſt all be conferred together to make up an entire platforme,</hi> which if it be not an oppoſing of them all and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting of himſelfe, I referre to the Iudgement of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned! For he in the beginning of his anſwer ſaid, <hi>The firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med church we met with was that in the</hi> 2. <hi>of the</hi> Acts, and yet he here accuſeth it of imperfection and faylings and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not formed: for at that time ſaith he it wanted Deacons, and we finde not expreſſed that part of Diſcipline for caſting
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48122:189"/>
out of corrupt members at any time, as in the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and the reſt: So that by his Doctrine here was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and fayling in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and therefore it was not a church properly ſo called; for every church properly ſo called, according to his learning, muſt have not only a good Diſcipline but Diſtinct Officers and Members united into one church body reſpectively: for theſe are his formall words page 11. Now a church according to their diſcription truly formed and properly ſo called, is when it hath a particular Paſtor, and Teacher or Doctor and two to three Elders, and a Deacon with ten or eleven good men and women, with an explicite particular Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; now I ſhall deſire my brother <hi>Burton</hi> in his reply to ſend me word which of all the Miniſters that were there at that time was the peculiar-Paſtor of this formed church, and which of them was the Teacher or Doctor or who were their Elders and who were their Deacons for the diſtinction of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Members united into one church body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, is that that makes up a formed church properly ſo called in their Dialect; and therfore if he cannot make all that I require of him clearly appeare, then he can never prove either the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or any of the primitive and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall churches, churches properly ſo called; for we reade not in all the holy Scripture, that any church had a particular Paſtor and Doctor peculiar to it ſelf, or but two Elders and a Deacon, with a ſmall company of men and women: or any particular Covenant; but we reade that in all the churches there were mighty multitudes of believers and many Deacons, and that they had many Presbyters ſet over them and church Officers to governe them in common, and nothing in particular of that diſtinction of Officers and Members united into one church body reſpectively, with any ſuch Covenant which he and all the Independents ſay <hi>make a church properly ſo called:</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which in their Language it cannot be adiſtinct and formall church properly ſo called: from which I do with very good reaſon conclude and that from the new light I have from my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that either the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and all the other primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive churches were not churches properly ſo called or well formed churches according to the new-teſtament forme, which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious either to thinke or ſay; or if they were, that then there may at
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48122:190"/>
this day be compleat churches properly ſo called although they have not diſtinct Officers and Members, united into one church body reſpectively, but ſerve their flocks and congregations in common.</p>
               <p>So that all the bable of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his brethren of the congregationall way, is but wickedly and unchriſtianly to abuſe the world and to delude poore people when they demande ſuch things of their brethren as eſſentially neceſſary for the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of a church properly ſo called as God never required at his peoples hands, and of which there is neither precept nor preſident in all the holy Scriptures: for this diſtinction of Officers they call for in all churches, and many other things they rigidly exact of us for the compleating and forming of a church after the New-Teſtament forme, were not in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther church, and yet it was by my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> confeſſion the firſt formed church and that in the judgment of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents beſides himſelfe, a perfect church at that time.</p>
               <p>But becauſe he requres of me to ſhew him diſtinct Officers and Members, united into one body reſpectively in all the ſeverall congregations in the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> without which he affirmeth they were no formed churches properly ſo called; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of him likewiſe that he would ſhew me that diſtinction of Officers and Members in that whole church that he demands of me in its parts, without the performing of the which all that he hath written is nothing; and he muſt of neceſſity grant <hi>that the church at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was not a church properly ſo called, if that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction I ſay of Officers and Members be eſſentiall to the complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a church or churches.</hi> For he confeſſeth at that time he calls it a formed church, they had no Deacons, and all the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents that ever I have ſeene or talked with, ſay they reade of no Elders in the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> till the 12. of the <hi>Acts</hi> which was a long time after the firſt forming of this church: and we reade not at any time of any particular Paſtor or of any Doctor or Teacher ioyned with that Paſtor as is uſually in the churches of the Congregationall way, but that upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions all the people applyed themſelves to all the Apoſtles, and and ſaid <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi> and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Doctrine and fellowſhip of all the Apoſtles and that all things were tranſacted by the common Counſell of all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48122:190"/>
the Apoſtles, and that they all laid their hands in the Ordination of the Deacons upon each of them; we heare nothing I ſay of any particular Paſtor or Teacher or of any Elders all this while; and yet by my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> Doctrine it was a formed church then, and we neither heare nor reade alſo any thing of an explicit particular Covenant which the Independents call <hi>the forme of a church,</hi> neither doe we reade of many things they now rigidly require of all ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am confident he will not ſay that <hi>Iames</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> were their Paſtor or Teacher, or that any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were the Paſtor or Teacher of that particular church: for they were the Univerſall Paſtors of the viſible Catholicke church, and were extraordinarily ſent into all the world as the Scripture recordeth: therefore they could not be either the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Paſtors or Teachers of that church: for as the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents teach they muſt be fixt and ſhould not leave their charge and Flocks; neither can my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> tell which were their Elders; for the Independents ſay they reade of none in the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> till the twelfth of the <hi>Acts:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to their doctrine they then had none: and it ſeemes to be my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> opinion; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith <hi>the Church at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>wanted that part of diſcipline of caſting out of corrupt Members,</hi> which if they had had Elders, they could not have
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48122:191"/>
wanted: and for Deacons, my brother <hi>Burton</hi> acknowledgeth that at that time he calleth it a formed Church, they had none: So that by this I have now ſaid I beleeve it will be a difficult, if not an impoſſible thing either for him or any of his fraternity to ſhew me that diſtinction of Officers and Members in the whole Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which he requires I ſhould ſhew him in the ſeveral bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; congregations; without the which notwithſtanding accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his learning it cannot be a Church properly ſo called, and ſo then the church at <hi>Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> it ſelf was no church properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>Therefore when he is at plow again (as now I underſtand he is) I deſire him that he would furrow up this truth unto me, and ſhew me that diſtinction of Officers and Members; withall, I deſire to be reſolved <hi>how he comes to make this diſtinction of Officers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, united into one church body respectively, to be the forme of a Church, when his brethren of the congregationall way make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite particular covenant to be the forme of a Church, and the Members and Officers to be the materials onely of a Church;</hi> All theſe truths I deſire and that earneſtly, that my brother <hi>Burton</hi> at his next going to plow he would lay open and diſcover unto mee, and then I will conclude of him that he is a ſingular tiller and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good husbandman in Chriſts field his Church, or otherwiſe hee will never be fit either to make a compleat Independent Country courtier, or an abſolute Independent Gentleman, but he ſhall be a Haberdaſher in the ſmall wares of Independency, and with thoſe I perſwade my ſelfe he will be beſt able to trade with.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time till I heare from him I will affirme that if it be true he ſaith, <hi>That the Church of Jeruſalem wanted Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and Church diſcipline and an explicite particular covenant and many other good things they require of us for the compleating of a church or churches properly ſo called, then that Church was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat,</hi> and yet we read not that the Saints of thoſe times made any ſeparation from their publike Aſſemblies and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations though they wanted Officers and Diſcipline and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things required now by them, ſo that we may learn from thoſe primitive and holy Chriſtians that we ought not to forſake the publike Aſſemblies of the Saints for want of ſome part of Diſcipline, or for want of ſome Officers, or for want of many things they now exact of all Chriſtians for the compleating and moulding of them into Church bodies pro perly ſo called: for we
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48122:191"/>
read, <hi>That in the Church of Jeruſalem they were perfectly converted and were Saints indeed, and yet that for ſome wants they made no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, rent or ſchiſme from their brethren, but that they dayly met together in their publick Aſſemblies, as in the Temple and in Solomons Porch, and from houſe to houſe openly and that in all love and charity with one accord;</hi> And yet if my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and the Independents may be beleeved, they had neither Deacons, nor Elders, nor diſtinction of Officers, nor a great part of Diſcipline nor many other of their requiſites: So that from the pious and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly example of thoſe glorious Saints, I learn this leſſon, <hi>That rents and ſciſmes are not to be made amongſt brethren for ſome failings in any Churches, yea though there be ſome defects not onely in Officers and Members, but a very want of Officers themſelves and of a good Diſcipline alſo in any Church or Churches: and that they that do make rents and diviſions have a great deal to anſwer for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Withall I learn that it may be a true Church though there be a failing in Diſcipline and a want of ſome chiefe Officers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: For my brother <hi>Burton</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>That the Church at Jeruſalem was a formed Church, although it wanted both Officers and Diſcipline, and all thoſe things they now require of all ſuch as deſire to be made Members in their new Congregations.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this he now preacheth be ſolid and orthodox Divinity, and if he may be credited in what he writeth, as there was at that time no juſt ground of ſeparation from their publike Aſſemblies for want of thoſe things, ſo there is now in theſe our dayes no juſt cauſe of ſeparation from our Aſſemblies; if there be indeed a reall want of diſcipline and Church Officers, which we might long ſince have injoyed had not he and his brethren hindred our happy begun Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Eſpecially I ſay we ought not to ſeparate when there is no failing or want in any dominative or fundamentall pointe of Religion neceſſary to ſalvation, and where all the counſell of God requiſite to eternall happineſſe is dayly publikely taught in every one of our Congregations and Churches, all which the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents themſelves do acknowledge we want not.</p>
               <p>Beſides it is granted by all orthodox Divines, that Diſcipline makes not for the <hi>eſſe</hi> but the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of a Church: Yea the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents themſelves hold, That Officers in a Church make not for the <hi>eſſe,</hi> but the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of it, as the New Lights from the <hi>Summer Iſlands</hi> apparently delucidate: For they ſay, Though
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48122:192"/>
the <hi>Officers</hi> all dye, yet the Church ceaſeth not to be a church.</p>
               <p>But to return to the matter in hand: Whereas my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> affirmeth that the Church at Jeruſalem wanted Diſcipline and that it had not Deacons at firſt, and that the Churches were not brought forth to full perfection in one day, and that their very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution had a graduall growth, I maintain that in all he aſſerteth, he is not onely exceeding erroneous and ignorant, but underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the very doctrine of the Independents, who are all againſt him in thoſe his aſſertions; for they all acknowledg and in expreſs words affirm it in their writings that all the Officers of the church were virtually in the Apoſtles, ſaying <hi>they were Paſtors, Teachers, ruling Elders and Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore they wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deacons nor Elders (if their conceſſion be true) nor any church Officers, which is point blank againſt my brother <hi>Burton</hi> his opinion. They confeſſe likewiſe that all the Apoſtles and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, had the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, that is, the power of order and juriſdiction, <hi>viz:</hi> the key of knowledg and authority: And therefore they had alſo in the church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that part of Diſcipline of caſting out corrupt Members. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in like manner that all the Apoſtles had equall power amongſt themſelves, and that they had authority over all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as having the care of all the churches who were committed to their charge, and that they left both the Presbyters and people in their ſeveral churches to the exerciſe of all their particular rights, &amp; impeached neither of them of their liberties. And they do alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that as <hi>Paul</hi> by his own authority did excommunicate <hi>Hymene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. ver. 20. and others: ſo might the other Apoſtles have done, if they had had the like occaſion given them, and might have put any church, not only in mind of their duty and reproved them for their neglect of Diſcipline, but have injoyned and commanded them alſo to have put it in execution, as both <hi>Paul</hi> did the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and Saint <hi>John</hi> the ſeven churches of <hi>Aſia:</hi> which were all well conſtituted, and well and perfect formed churches, by their firſt conſtitution and brought forth to full perfection in one day, ſo as they had no need of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall growth as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> affirmeth. All theſe things I ſay, the Independents do accord unto. And all reaſon will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any well grounded Chriſtians, That the church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:48122:192"/>
was a perfect church at its firſt conſtitution before the inceſtuous perſon appeared in it; and the ſame they will ſay of the other ſeven churches in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Aſia,</hi> before the doctrine of the <hi>Nicolai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tans</hi> and that of <hi>Baalam</hi> and <hi>Jezabell</hi> ſprung up in them, and before thoſe luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme <hi>Laodiceans</hi> appeared and all the other offenders there ſpake of; all the which were ſo far from adding any perfection to thoſe churches, as it was a deformity to them all, to have ſuch creatures and failings amongſt them, and it was reputed their great ſinne to connive at them and ſuffer them to be amongſt them and in their bowels, which by their firſt conſtitution they had power to have caſt out: For it is well known that all thoſe churches at their firſt plantation and founding had all of them their Presbyters and Elders and all other Members and Officers as conſiſting of Saints, and had in all thoſe ſeverall churches both the power of order and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the power of the Keyes; and this in their firſt conſtitution; and therefore had no neede of a graduall growth but were all brought forth to full perfection the firſt day contrary to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burtons</hi> doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it is confeſſed likewiſe by the Independents and by my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Burton <hi>himſelfe,</hi> That where there are Church Officers as a Paſtor and Teacher with an Elder or two and a Deacon, and where there are a few viſible Saints if they amount but to the number of twenty, nay if they be but ten or twelve gathered together according to their method, that there is a compleat formed Church where Chriſt is ſet up as King upon his Throne, and that this Church is clothed with Chriſts power and honoured with his preſence, the which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wanteth nothing for matter and forme, but hath plenary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity within it ſelfe; and therefore is as compleat a Church within it ſelfe as any church in the world; <hi>by all which it muſt neceſſarily follow and that upon their own principles, that it is brought forth in perfection in one day and hath no neede of a graduall growth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ſhall never beleevethat thoſe glorious churches founded by the holy Apoſtles in every city in the which they had their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Presbyters and all other Officers appointed them, the which churches alſo conſiſted of viſible Saints, that they were not at their firſt conſtitution as compleat churches, and in the which Chriſt was not as well ſet up upon his Throne, as any of our new gathered churches of the congregationall way. Yea it were an

impiety to think that the bleſſed Apoſtles did not know how to gather churches and how to ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne in them, and how to bring them to perfection in one day at their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as well as our brethren the Independents, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding do all proclame they but imitate the Apoſtles, both in the gathering and conſtituting of their new churches. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Independent congregations, are all compleated at their firſt founding and conſtitution, and be all compleat within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as having plenary authority and power within themſelves, much more had all the Apoſtolicall and Primitive Churches abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute juriſdiction within themſelvs at their firſt conſtitution, which is yet more manifeſt from the reproofe given to the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> by S. <hi>Paul</hi> who blameth them for not caſting out the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon; and from the reproof given to ſome of the 7 churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> by Chriſt himſelf: For otherwiſe they if they had not bin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat at their firſt conſtitution, might have replyed and anſwered, <hi>That they had no power to caſt out corrupt Members, and that their churches were not compleatly moulded up at their firſt founding, and that they wanted that part of Diſcipline;</hi> but none of theſe churches pretended any ſuch thing, neither could they; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had given the church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> by name a caveat to take heed of Wolves, that would riſe up among them after his departure, and had armed them likewiſe with power and authority for the caſting of them out, as it is at large to be ſeen in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the <hi>Acts;</hi> and that church executed its power in finding out of falſe Teachers, and is praiſed for it, though the other are blamed. So that the neglect of this their duty, and not executing of their Diſcipline was that that was found fault with in them, and that they had not exerciſed that power that was given them in caſting out of thoſe corrupt Members from amongſt them. This <hi>I</hi> ſay was their failing, and for this were they blamed; ſo that it was not for want of Diſcipline or that they were not perfect at their firſt conſtitution, but their negligence and their not doing their duty was their ſinne.</p>
               <p>Neither was the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> inferior to any other church in power, or wanted that part of Diſcipline of caſting out corrupt Members, as my Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Burton</hi> boldly, and without all reaſon affirmeth: for it is well knowne, that the church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> had power of life and death, as wee may ſee in the ſtorie
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48122:193"/>
of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> his wife, the which if it could take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the very life of offendors, as it did theirs for lying to the Spirit of God, then it had power to caſt out any corrupt Members, and ſcandalous perſons, if they had had any amongſt them, as all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will dictate to any well grounded Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>But that wee reade not of any excommunicated in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it was not for any want of Diſcipline, or power in that Church of caſting out offenders, but becauſe there was no open Delinquents and ſcandalous perſons; for they were all zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Law (as it is well knowne) and would ſuffer none in the leaſt to tranſgreſſe it without queſtioning them; nay, if they conceived but an offence in the Apoſtles themſelves, they would call them to an account, as wee may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>1. where they queſtioned <hi>Peter</hi> for going in to the Gentiles; and it is conceived by learned and judicious Chriſtians, that the puniſhment alſo that was inflicted upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> ſtrucke ſo great a terrour of offending into all the Ghurch, (as it is in expreſſe words declared) that they durſt not in publike be vitious; and therfore that made them all afraid of publike open and ſcandall; withall it is recorded that they were all true Beleevers, and Saints in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and prayer, and were all true converts and Saints indeed; now no church uſeth to caſt out Saints, and men of a holy and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation, and ſuch as perſevere in goodneſſe, and doe their duty, but the wicked and ſcandalous, which when there was none in the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> there was no need of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or at leaſt they had no occaſion of exerciſing that part of diſcipline at that time. For diſcipline in any church is as Magiſtracy in a Common-wealth or Kingdome, which is not a terrour to the good, but to the wicked, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Rom.</hi> the 13. it is a comfort to well doers and as, the Magiſtrate uſeth the ſword onely againſt Offendors and Delinquents; ſo the Officers of the Church exerciſe that part of Diſcipline only in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out corrupt and ſcandalous Members, (which is ſolely to bee put in execution againſt them:) and therefore that wee reade not of excommunication in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it was not for want of that part of Diſcipline, but becauſe there were no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ſcandalous perſons there, as in the church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>

Beſides, all men know that Diſcipline is one thing, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of diſcipline is an other, and is but the reſult and effect of diſcipline, as the church is one thing, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments is another: Power and Authority in a court, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eccleſiaſticall or civill, is one thing, and the execution of the power of that court is an other: and as the execution of its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority makes it not a court, nor giveth not the power to it, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it to be a court inveſted with authority; as in the Parliament the great and ſupreme court of this Kingdome, the cutting off of <hi>Strafford</hi> and the Prelates heads gave not power to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but declared the power they had by their firſt conſtitution: for they were a court before, and had the power of execution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but upon this occaſion they exerciſed it: but will any man ſay, if they had not at this time exerciſed their authority as they have not done for theſe many years before, that the great court had wanted that part of Diſcipline? all men that ſhould attempt to ſay that great councell wanted that part of Diſcipline, I beeleeve they would exerciſe ſome more of their authority to teach ſuch an one better manners or more wit.</p>
               <p>Even ſo it was in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they had diſcipline in that Church, though wee reade not of the putting of it in execution, as we do in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> neither wil any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man conclude, that all the other Primitive Churches wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that part of diſcipline; becauſe I ſay wee reade onely of the execution of it in the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which is commended for it, and ſome of the other ſeven chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are blamed for not caſting out their corrupt Members, and becauſe they had not at that time exerciſed their authority, neither reade wee of it in the churches of <hi>Galatia, Coloſſe,</hi> nor amongſt the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> nor in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Antioch,</hi> nor in <hi>Samaria:</hi> will any man therefore ſay that all theſe churches wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that part of Diſcipline, becauſe wee reade nothing of it in them? I am confident they will not be ſo fanaticall, as to make ſuch a concluſion from ſo brainſick a premiſe: much leſſe will any intelligible chriſtian argue as my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> does, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wee reade not of that part of Diſcipline in the church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> of caſting out corrupt Members, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it had it not: this would indeed prove <hi>a non ſequitur,</hi> and ſuch a conſequenct or concluſion could leaſt of all have been made from the Church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>

upon ſuch an Antecedent, then from any of the other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, becauſe the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had not only the power of the Keyes within it ſelfe, but a legiſlative power alſo, who gave Lawes to all other churches, both for the ordering and ruling of them, and for the exerciſing of their Diſcipline in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that by Gods appointment; <hi>for out of</hi> Sion <hi>ſhall goe forth the Law</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23. <hi>and the word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem. So that the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the Mother church gave power to all the daughter churches, and that both the power of Order and Juriſdiction; the power was radically in it, and in that church was the fountain of all authority, the ſtreames of the which flowed to all the other churches of the world: <hi>For out of Zion ſhal go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>

                  <hi>donec ad triarios redierit res?</hi> I beleeve that all the Independents will much blame my brother <hi>Burton</hi> for this his raſhneſſe, in affirming the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> wanted that part of Diſcipline for caſting out corrupt Members, when the Apoſtles themſelves had all power in their hands bequeathed unto them by Chriſt himſelfe, who ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>verſe</hi> 18. 19. <hi>All power is given to mee in Heaven and Earth, goe yee therefore and teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 20. <hi>verſe</hi> 21, 22, 23. <hi>as my Father hath ſent mee, even ſo ſend I you; and when hee had ſaid this, hee breathed on them, and ſaith unto them, receive yee the Holy Ghoſt; whoſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſe ſoever ſins yee retaine they are retained:</hi> Loe! here was plenary authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto all the Apoſtles, who as they had the Keyes promiſed them in the ſixteenth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> here they now received them, and therefore they had the power in their hands, both of order and juriſdiction, which the Keyes imported, as all the learned know, and the very Independents doe not deny; now this power was not onely given unto them, but unto all faithfull Miniſters their ſucceſſors, to whom Chriſt made a promiſe as well as to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>that hee would be with them to the end of the world;</hi> neither doe wee ever reade that the Apoſtles and Miniſters in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did ever relinquiſh their power, and therefore they wanted not that part of Diſcipline, as my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> grolliſhly affirmeth, who begins now to doubt, when hee begins to dote; but if there had been any juſt occaſion, without
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48122:195"/>
all controverſie, they would have put it in execution; but that church conſiſting of viſible Saints, and having no ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt them, had no occaſion of the exerciſe of that part of Diſcipline: which they wanted not though they exerciſed it not; for it is to be believed that the Apoſtles would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their duty in puniſhing offendors if there had beene any.</p>
               <p>And I believe that the Independents would blame any of their Schollers and Members if they ſhould ſay their new congregated churches wanted that part of Diſcipline of caſting out of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Members, though they have not as yet in ſome of them put it in execution: for they have learned to diſtinguiſh between the power of a Church and the execution of that power in a church: for as it doth not argue that a Court of Juſtice hath not power of life and death when notwithſtanding it is inveſted with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of hanging and drawing, though perhaps after it is erected they either have no occaſion of executing that authority that is given, or them out of Clemency will for a time ſhew mercy and uſe lenity towards offendors, not taking the extremity of the Law the more with humanity and kindneſſe to reclaime them; even ſo in all well conſtituted Churches the not executing of the power given them by Chriſt, or the not having juſt occaſion of putting that power in execution, doth not prove a want of that power: and if any of the Members of the new congregations ſhould ſo argue, againſt their new church Officers, I believe they would ſoone make uſe of their Keyes to ſhut ſuch a Member out of their Church doores, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> falſly complaines that <hi>Truth was lately ſhut out of</hi> Aldermanbury <hi>Church doores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly if one of their whibbling congregations have no want of that part of Diſcipline, though they execute it not: ſhall any man be ſo temerarious and unadviſed as to thinke that the power of the church, in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was evacuated or enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or that they had not that part of Diſcipline, when there was greater power in it then in any church in the world, all who had all the Apoſtles amongſt them and as Chriſts and <hi>Iohn</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, all of them armed with the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, and when the Magazine and treaſury of all power reſided continually in that church, and therefore that part of Diſcipline, when all other churches derived their power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48122:195"/>
and juriſdiction from that as the mother church. And to this I now ſay, I am moſt aſſured all judicious men will eaſily conſent and agree. And therefore my brother <hi>Burton</hi> affirming <hi>that</hi> the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> wanted that part of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of caſting out of corrupt Members, ſaying, <hi>That neither the Church at</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>was a perfect patterne, nor none of the Primitive churches were compleat within themſelves, but that they muſt all of them neceſſarily be conferred together for the making up of a compleat paterne; ſo that every one of them was to bring in its ſhot to make up the full reckoning, that ſo what is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the one may be ſupplied by the reſt to make up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat platforme.</hi> Theſe are his formall words, adding with all, <hi>That as the Scripture conſiſts of many bookes, and the body of many members, and one Member cannot ſay to the other I have no need of thee</hi> 1 Cor. 11.

               <p>I ſay although he will take no notice of my enumeration, I will take notice of thoſe churches he enumerateth, and prove them all Claſſicall and dependent upon their ſeverall Presbyteries, and that there was not an Independent church ſuch as they deſcribe unto us in the world in the Apoſtles time nor before our dayes, nor never ſuch a whimſie taken notice of before this doting age of the world. I ſhall alſo take notice of his words for matter of comfort to us poore Presbyterians who the Independents tearme at every word an Antichriſtian brood, who may not think it much

nor be offended with it, but rather rejoyce when they accuſe our churches not to be well formed churches after the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forme, and when they ſay that our churches are not perfect churches and churches properly ſo called: for here my brother <hi>Burton</hi> a Maſter illdependent, cenſureth and judgeth not onely the congregations in the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to be no churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, but the whole church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelfe for want of a great part of Diſcipline and for want of Officers, and blameth all other Churches, accuſing them likewiſe of faylings and imperfections, ſaying, that they muſt be all conferred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the making up a compleat platforme, which is in plaine Engliſh to ſay they were all defective and not compleate and formed churches, which indeede is a horrid peece of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and deſerves condigne puniſhment from all thoſe of his party.</p>

their ſeverall juriſdictions, and that all thoſe Churches I ſay were Claſſically governed, and were all dependent upon their ſeverall Presbyters, as being ſubordinate to them, and likewiſe ſubject to the Synodicall Decrees at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> then it will follow, that all churches in ſucceeding ages to the end of the world are to be ſo governd: for all theſe churches make up an entire and compleat paterne or platforme of governing all churches for future ages, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> granteth. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire the reader (it being a buſineſſe of ſo great importance) to give me leave, as I proved the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to conſiſt of many Congregations or Churches which my brother <hi>Burton</hi> calls branches of that Church, therefore neceſſarily depending upon the ſtock: So now briefly to evince, that all thoſe Churches my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> enumerats conſiſted likewiſe of many Congregations and were all Claſſically governed. And then I will alſo prove, that according to the Independents definition of a Church, their very Congregationall Churches and Aſſemblies are not true Churches properly ſo called, and withall I ſhall make good by Gods aſſiſtance and that from their own Principles, that they are Dependent, All which I will doe in order.</p>
               <p>And firſt I will begin with the Church of <hi>Samaria</hi> which is one of the reſt my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſaieth muſt be taken in for the making up a compleat platforme. This City of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was the Regall City and the Palace or Chamber of the Kings of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and was one of the greateſt Cities then in the world, and next to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the famouſeſt in all <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and one of the greateſt in all <hi>Canaan</hi> for extent, and it muſt needs be a great one that could entertaine the whoſe <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> army at one time, and it was exceeding populous, as all the ſtories of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> witneſſe, in the which we know there was a true Church in Chriſts time and that planted by Chriſt himſelfe, as we may ſee in the 4 of <hi>Iohn</hi> where we reade that our Saviour converted not onely the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> but many more who were made beleevers by his Miniſtry, as they themſelves acknowledge and teſtifie; and to this Church were many thouſands added by the preaching and miracles of <hi>Philip:</hi> for it is ſaid of them <hi>Acts</hi> the 8. verſ. 6. 10. 12. 14. that all thoſe that had bin ſeduced by that Jugler <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> which were in no ſmall numbers, every one of them being
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48122:197"/>
undeceived by the preaching and wonders of <hi>Philip,</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and were baptized, ſo that there was a mighty company: for it is related that the people of the City with one accorde from the greateſt to the leaſt, both men and women believed and were baptized. Now if any man ſhall duly conſider and weigh things, this City was no contemptible one, as appears from that I ſaid before; and yet it is aſſerted by the holy Ghoſt who is worthy to be believed and credited that all the people of that City from the greateſt to the leaſt both men and women believed and were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: and therfore they could not all meet in any one place or a few, neither was any one Paſtor able to Teach them all, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at firſt ſent two of the chiefeſt Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſo that all this ſhews there was an innumerable company of believers in that City, all which could not meete in any one or a few places as all reaſon will eaſily perſwade. Beſides, the Apoſtles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and the Miniſters of thoſe times had an other manner of converting faculty, then the Independents in our dayes, who I never yet heard converted any, though they have perverted and ſeduced many. For the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts and the primitive Miniſters there, were immediatly ſent of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the holy Ghoſt and ſpake in all Languages, and did Miracles ſuch as none could doe but thoſe that came from God, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaid unto Chriſt, that none could doe ſuch works and miracles as he did <hi>except God were with him, Iohn</hi> 3. 2. for they cured all manner of diſeaſes with their word and ſhaddow, they raiſed the dead, made the lame to walke, and caſt out Devils, and did whatſoever was wonderfull. Withall they Preached unto them the glad tidings of joy and peace and of everlaſting happineſſe after a miſerable life here; and did alſo inſtruct them how to order their wayes and converſations here, ſo that they might live with honour and dye with comfort, and be uſefull to all men both in life and death and after death. And the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts and Miniſters of thoſe times, as they did good wherever they came, ſo they lived ſo holily and unblameably in all manner of converſation, and were men of ſuch integrity, ſincerity and of ſuch plaine upright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as the people that beheld their converſation, and ſaw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their workes of wonder that they did, ſaid of them, that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48122:197"/>
gods were come downe amongſt them in the likeneſſe of men, ſo that they converted whole cities and countries whereſoever they came; yea, it was an ordinary thing with them to bring whole Nations in a ſhort time, and with a few Miracles to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the faith, as wee may ſee through the whole Storie of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and from that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> the 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 18. 19. where the Apoſtle abundantly declareth the effect of the Goſpel and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of thoſe times, who wrought ſo powerfully whereſoever they came, even to the converting of whole countries and cities, and ſo they prevailed in this citie of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that the people of the ſame were ſpeedily converted from the greateſt to the leaſt, both men and women, who all beleeved and were baptized; and what rationall man will thinke, or can beleeve, that all the people men and women of a mighty and royall citie, could meet in any place or a few to partake in all acts of worſhip, but muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be diſtributed into divers congregations and churches, if they would partake in all ordinances? and yet all theſe made up but one Church, as being under one government, that of the Presbyterie; for there were Presbyters ordained in every Church, and in every citie, as is apparent from <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. <hi>verſe</hi> 23. and <hi>Titus</hi> the 1. And now I have proved that the two Mother cities of <hi>Paleſtine, Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> conſiſting of many congregations, were Presbyterially and claſſically governed: I will goe on to the other cities of the Gentiles enumerated by my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and prove that they alſo conſiſted of many congregations, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and were all ſubordinate to their ſeverall Presbyteries and Claſſes.</p>
               <p>And firſt I will begin with the citie of <hi>Corinth,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was a famous citie, and in the which there was an illuſtrious church, and therfore in it alſo there was conſtituted a Presbytery, that was many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to governe and rule that Church and thoſe congregations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: for it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained them Presbyters in every church, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> were Miniſters in the church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> yea, <hi>Paul</hi> planted this church, and <hi>Apollo</hi> with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and the Presbyters wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it; and therefore there muſt neceſſarily be many congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aſſemblies in that church: For one Paſtor or Miniſter would have beene ſufficient for owne flocke, at leaſt a Paſtor and a Teacher, or a Doctor would have beene ſufficient to have fed one
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48122:198"/>
congregation: now in that they had many ordinary Paſtors, and many extraordinary Teachers in it, with all good reaſon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there were many aſſemblies and many congregations in that church, which will yet more abundantly appeare from its firſt conſtitution or planting: for wee reade of multitudes, both of Jewes and Gentiles in that Citie that beleeved, <hi>Acts</hi> the 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. 7, 8. &amp;c. <hi>and that beſides Iuſtus, Criſpus</hi> alſo and all his houſhold, and many Corinthians beleeved, and were baptized, <hi>and the Lord</hi> alſo ſaid <hi>that hee had many people in that Citie, ver.</hi> 10. which by the diligent preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> for eighteene moneths together were converted, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. for whoſe further building up in their moſt holy faith, <hi>Paul, Apollos, Timothy, Cephas,</hi> and many other extraordinary, &amp; famous Miniſters and Teachers, beſides their owne Presbyters, were all conſtantly imployed in ſeaſon &amp; out of ſeaſon in preaching the Goſpel, and adminiſtring the holy Sacraments, and labouring in word and doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 &amp; 4. all the which imports many congregations and aſſemblies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in that Citie.</p>
               <p>Beſides, both the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians ſhew that there were multitudes of deceitfull Teachers, Seducers, and falſe Apoſtles, which urged the ceremoniall Law, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, and they alſo had their congregations and aſſemblies: there were alſo many vaine Inſtructers and idle Teachers, who though they kept the foundation, yet built upon it wood, hay and ſtubble: Now all reaſon will ſuggeſt, that Paſtors of ſuch ſeverall minds, and teaching ſuch ſeverall &amp; diſcrepant doctrines had all of them ſchollers, &amp; followers of the ſame opinion wherof their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſtors were, as now we ſee in the ſeveral Sects in our times; &amp; therefore <hi>they did not all meet in one or a few places,</hi> except we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their meetings for the convention of their Officers with a part of the more choyce people for diſcipline; beſides, as wee have expreſſe mention of a Church in <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priſcylla's</hi> houſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. ſo there were many other meeting places in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> where the Chriſtians aſſembled themſelves together: for in expreſſe words there is mention made in that Epiſtle of churches in the plurall number, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>verſe</hi> 34. <hi>Let the women ſaith the Apoſtle keepe ſilence in the Churches:</hi> by which it followeth, that in Gods dialect congregation and church are ſynonima's, and not that onely, but that there were many churches in this church
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48122:198"/>
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that they were all but one church, as being ſo many branches, and depending all upon that ſtocke, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were all claſſically governed, and ſubordinate to one Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be concluded of the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> where <hi>verſe</hi> the 1. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> ſalutes all the Biſhops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, ſo that in the firſt entrance of that Epiſtle wee meet with a colledge of Biſhops and Presbyters, for they were all one, and wee meete alſo with many Deacons; all which proves to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding man that there were many congregations and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for one Deacon would have ſerved for one congrgeation or aſſembly; and yet they all made but one church, as being ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to one Presbyterie, and governed by their joynt conſent and common Counſell; and that there were multitudes of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there, it is evident from the variety of Teachers, beſides their good and godly Biſhops; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, there were dogs amongſt them, evill workers, and thoſe of the conciſion, and he bids the Philippians to beware of thoſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. and there were many other of their Teachers which were worldly men, that minded earthly things, whom hee proclames enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, who made their belly their God, as too many of the Independent Miniſters now adayes doe, <hi>chapter</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 18, 19. and gives them in command to ſhun their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and only to follow his, and ſuch as walked as hee did, whoſe converſation was in Heaven; and many ſuch Teachers there were in the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and ſuch as taught the Goſpel out of good will and ſincerely; all which ſufficiently prove there were many congregations of Beleevers in this Church; and that it was yet but one Church, and governed by a claſſis and colledge of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Presbyters. And the ſame may be ſaid of the church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> complaines <hi>that there were many falſe teachers amongſt them, which hee wiſht were rooted out, and cut off or deſtroyed:</hi> ſo that it followeth, that in that church alſo, there were many congregations, and they were all governed by the joynt conſent &amp; common counſel of a Presbyterie there; for there were Presbyters ordained in every church, and in every Citie. And now I come to the ſeven churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that by name my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>viz.</hi> the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> with which I will conclude, and this was but one church in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

For <hi>Epheſus</hi> was a famous citie, and a place of great trafficke, where <hi>Paul</hi> preached two whole yeares, by whoſe <hi>hands God wrought no ſmall Miracles, ſo that all they that dwelt in</hi> Aſia <hi>heard the word of the Lord Ieſus, both Iews and Gentiles;</hi> and through other wonders that were wrought in that city, it is related <hi>that the word of God grew mightily and prevailed,</hi> as it is at large <hi>ch.</hi> 19. ſet down, ſo that great multitudes of the very Schollers, and ſuch as ſtudied curious Arts, were alſo converted, and burnt their Bookes, the price of which amounted to fifty thouſand peeces of ſilver, in ſo much <hi>that feare came upon all the Greekes and Iewes that dwelt in</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and the name of the Lord Ieſus was magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> And can any man conceive or beleeve, that all the Jewes and Greekes in <hi>Epheſus</hi> a mighty citie, and a mart Towne, could all meet in any one place together to communicate in all acts of worſhip, yea? were it not a madneſſe to thinke ſo, if the very diverſitie of their languages and tongues of the people did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it? for if they would all be edified, they muſt underſtand their Miniſters preaching unto them, which ſo many people of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Languages and dialects could never do by any one; for it was then a Miracle to have the gift of tongues, which for the moſt part were conferred upon the Miniſters, and Publiſhers of the Goſpel, and upon ſuch as were to be ſent from place to place, and from Citie to Citie to convert the Nations, ſuch as were the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts and Prophets, all extraordinary men, and very ſeldome had the ordinary people the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt conferred upon them, but it was chiefly upon ſome ſelect and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ones, not upon all promiſcuouſly, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> upon ſuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles laid their hands; for if it had beene upon all, then <hi>Simon Magus</hi> needed not have offered money to the Apoſtles for the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48122:199"/>
purchaſing of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, if thoſe graces had been promiſcuouſly given; but without all doubt it was but to ſome ſortsof men for the moſt part that the gift of tongues was diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, ſuch as the Apoſtles made ſpeciall choyce of, for ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. 11.</p>
               <p>And therefore when the common people had not the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all languages, they if they would be edified, muſt have ſuch to preach to them as they could underſtand, and therefore all the Jewes and Greeks in <hi>Epheſus</hi> muſt neceſſarily have divers places to meet in, if the multitudes of them otherwiſe had not been ſo great but that they might have aſſembled themſelves together, and onely that they might be edified. Beſides the great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that we read of at the firſt plantationof this church, the Scripture ſaith <hi>Acts</hi> the 20. <hi>That for three whole years together</hi> Paul <hi>taught them night and day as an extraordinary Miniſter;</hi> they had alſo <hi>Timothy</hi> ſometime amongſt them and other extraordinary teachers and a whole colledge of Biſhops and Elders <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>who all had the care of the flock committed to them with a charge that they ſhould feede that church which Chriſt had redeemed with his blood;</hi> They had a commiſſion likewiſe given them to oppoſe all falſe Teachers, which they faithfully performed, as the Lord beareth them witneſſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> the 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. ſaying, <hi>I know thy workes, and thy labour and thy patience, and how thou canſt not beare them which are evill, and thou haſt tryed them which ſay they are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and are not, and haſt found them lyars.</hi> By which we learne that the Government of that Church was wholly committed into the hands of the Presbyters, who had the charge for the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tryall of the doctrine of all Teachers that came amongſt them; and that they were inveſted with power likewiſe and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of caſting them out that were Deceivers and falſ Teachers; and we farther learne that the care of all thoſe ſeverall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was committed to all the Biſhops and Presbyters of that Church in common; and although it conſiſted of many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, yet it was but one church, and therefore was claſſically governed <hi>communi conſilio Preſbyterorum;</hi> and ſo were all the other ſix churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> governed, in all and every one of the which there were many congregations and churches of beleevers as is manifeſt from the manner of Chriſts concluding his Epiſtles, ſent by the Miniſtry of Saint John to all thoſe <hi>Aſian</hi> churches <hi>Rev.</hi>

For who ever denyed that when Chriſt

ſpake to his Apoſtles bidding them watch, that what he ſpake to them, he ſpake to all men? So who ever yet denyed that when Chriſt in the concluſion of every one of his Epiſtles to the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, ſaid, <hi>Let him that hath an eare hear what the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith to the Churches,</hi> that by Churches there, Chriſt hath as well reference not onely to all the ſeven churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but to all ſucceeding Churches to the worlds end, that they ſhould by their examples be forewarned leſt they likewiſe offend in the ſame manner? For all men know, <hi>That whatſoever was written, was written for our inſtruction upon whom the ends of the world are come:</hi> Though primarily, principally and <hi>antecedenter</hi> he hath reference to all the ſeverall Congregations, Aſſemblies, or Churches in each of thoſe Churches; as firſt to thoſe of <hi>Epheſus</hi> which is yet called but one Church in the ſingular number, as the others alſo, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of many ſeverall companies and ſeverall congregations, yet being all combined together in their ſeverall Precincts and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to each of their Presbyteries, were all collectively taken but for one Church within their particular juriſdictions: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſpeaks to them all ſeverally in the concluſion of all his Epiſtles in the number of multitude as to many, though in the beginning of his Epiſtles he writes to them all as particular and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Churches, becauſe though each of them conſiſted of many congregations (as I ſaid before) yet they were ſubordinate to their ſeveral Presbyteries and governed by the common counſel of their ſeverall Presbyteries in a claſſicall way.</p>
               <p>And there is all reaſon to convince any man that the word <hi>Church</hi> in thoſe Epiſtles ſhould as well be conſidered collectively, as the word <hi>Angell:</hi> Now all orthodox writers and the very Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Miniſters themſelves hold that by <hi>Angell</hi> is meant all the Miniſters and Presbyters in each of thoſe ſeverall Churches: And therefore if the word <hi>Angell</hi> in thoſe ſeverall Epiſtles may or be to be taken and interpreted collectively for many Miniſters; then the word <hi>Church</hi> alſo may or is to be taken collectively for many Churches: For thoſe of the congregationall way do acknowledg, that Paſtor and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It ſeemes that the Magiſtrates there were converted, and the Chriſtians in that city had obtained ſo much favour from them, that they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them publike places of meeting as well as private, as may be gathered from <hi>Pauls</hi> words who ſaid, That he had taught them publikely and from houſe to houſe.</p>

is to be ſo taken, and therefore as there were many Angels and Miniſters in the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſo there were many Aſſemblies and churches in that church, by all which it undenyably followeth that one church may have many churches in ſubordination to it, as this of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and the other <hi>Aſian</hi> churches had, and conſequently was Collegially and Claſſically governed <hi>communi conſilio preſbyterorum:</hi> Now then when the the church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and all the other churches my brother <hi>Burton</hi> enumerateth were all ſo governed, it followes that all theſe churches muſt be a paterne of government for the regulating and moderating of all other churches to the end of the world, which being all Presbyterially and Claſſically governed as hath been proved, all other churches at this day are to be Claſſically and Presbyterially moderated; ſo that now when it is manifeſt both by Scripture and reaſon and by the Independents owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion that the word churches may be taken as well <hi>Anteceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> as <hi>conſequenter,</hi> it matters nothing what Maſter <hi>Baines</hi> thinks to the contrary, whoſe judgement in this buſineſſe is very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, how Orthodoxe ſoever he was in his other writings: for there is no man though of never ſo greatlearning or parts, no not an Angel that ſhall ever by Gods aſſiſtance make me believe or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any doctrine or opinion that is contrary unto the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and all ſound reaſon, as this novell tenent and whimſie of the Independents is: and truly ſo it appeareth to be from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> owne words: who by his induction of ſo many churches and by that nigh relation he affirmes they all had each to other, and amongſt themſelves, concludes they were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, <hi>For if there was as great or nigh a relation betweene church and church, as is between member and member in the body of a man (as he aſſerteth) ſo that the one cannot ſay to the other I have no neede of thee,</hi> then of neceſſity they muſt be all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent: <hi>but there is as great or nigh arelation between church and church as my brother</hi> Burton <hi>aſſerteth, as there is betweene mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and member, ſo that the one cannot ſay to the other I have no neede of thee:</hi> Ergo <hi>they are all dependent.</hi> For the antecedent it is ſo cleere that all intelligible men will aſſent unto it.

the civill government in all the Cities we reade of in the old Teſtament, both in <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in them, the truth would, eaſily be perceived and the controverſie would quickly be at an end amongſt all ſober minded Chriſtians. Now in thoſe ſeverall Cities we ſhall finde, that under their ſeverall Kings and Princes they were all gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a ſecular Presbytery called by the name of Elders and Nobles, whoſe civill power and Authority under thoſe Kings and Princes extended as far as the ſeverall bounds and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories under their ſeverall Cities delated themſelves and not only within their wals: for as at their firſt conſtitution they were ſo many ſeverall kingdomes as the Scripture relateth and had their ſeverall juriſdictions and bounds; ſo into whoſeſoever hands and Authority they were in ſucceſſion of time devolved, either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, donation agreement or compact, they commonly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their Antient dimenſions and limits, and as farre as their ſecular power extended it ſelfe in reſpect of their civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and policy, the ſame limits did the Eccleſiaſticall ever obſerve, and governed all the Townes and Villages under them, all whoſe inhabitants and dwellers in their ſeverall abodes and habitations within the compaſſe of their ſeverall juriſdictions were called Citizens, and the whole country in their ſeverall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts were called by the names of the ſeverall Cities, as all Hiſtories relate. And if we will but examine the <hi>Annals</hi> of times, all men may finde that which I now ſay to be true. For we ſee in the change of all governments, from <hi>Democratiall</hi> to <hi>Ariſtocraticall,</hi> and from both to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that as far as their bounds and limits extended themſelves before their changc, the Monarchsor Kings that either invaded thoſe Governments or were brought in by election or the free choyce of the people, extended their ſole power to the extreameſt limits of thoſe ſeverall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and in their owne name ruled thoſe ſeverall Countries, <hi>which before were governed by the Common counſell of their States, Senats, Elders or Judges, as we ſee it hapned not onely in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of</hi> Iuda <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>after the government of the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>was changed into a Monarchie, but even in the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire and all other kingdomes; for when</hi> Caeſar <hi>had invaded the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty and had made himſelfe</hi> Perpetuus dictator, <hi>as farre as the bounds and limits of the</hi> Roman <hi>Ariſtocracy extended its</hi>

                  <hi>ſelfe before the change, ſo farre did his ſole power expatiate and extend it ſelfe after the alteration;</hi> and the ſame power did all the ſucceeding Emperours exerciſe to the extremeſt bounds of that Empire till the diſſolution of it, as all Hiſtories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>Even ſo when the ſeverall Presbyteries through the Chriſtian world were through the cunning and policy of Antichriſt, that man of ſinne, changed into <hi>Epiſcopacies,</hi> as farre as the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Presbyteries extended themſelves, ſo farre did the ſeverall Biſhops appointed over them extend their ſole power and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their ſole Authority. Hence aroſe ſo many broyles conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and digladiations amongſt thoſe ſeverall Biſhops about the bounds and limits of their ſeverall Seas and juriſdictions, <hi>of which all Eccleſiaſticall ſtories are full;</hi> all the which doe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove and declare to any man of but ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>that in thoſe ſeverall Cities which were after their change of government, the Seates of their Biſhops and Prelates, they had many Townes and Villages and many Churches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under them all the which before this alteration were all governed by their ſeverall Preſbyteryes reſpectively and were all uuder them, and were ordered and moderated</hi> communi conſilio Pesbyterorum <hi>which the Independents themſelves do acknowledge, and my brother</hi> Burton <hi>by name in his vindication.</hi>

               <p>Hence is was that the bleſſed Apoſtles went from City to City, to Preach the Goſpell there in their Synagogues, as the whole Scripture of the new teſtament relateth, and they did not only Preach the Word to them in their ſeverall Cities, but in each of them ordained and conſtituted Presbyteries, giving charge to <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> to doe the ſame, leaving the government of all thoſe congregations and Churches in thoſe ſeverall Cities in the hands of thoſe ſeverall Presbyteries in their ſeverall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, <hi>injoyning alſo thoſe ſeverall Preſbyteries and Churches to obſerve the Decrees of the Synod and Councell of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and commanding the people, all Chriſtians and believers in thoſe ſeverall Cities under them, to be ſubject and obedient to all their ſeverall Miniſters and Guides ſet over them, and to obſerve all that they ſhould from God teach them to obſerve and doe,</hi> as we may ſee out of the ſeverall places I ſet downe at large in the foregoing diſcourſe, as out of the 14. of the <hi>Act.</hi> 23. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27. 18. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1

S.</hi> paſſed by, not ſo much as taking notice of them, as they did not of thoſe multitudes baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and Chriſts Diſciples, of whom likewiſe they took no notice as not formed into a church or churches. But as our Saviour ſaid to the Seducers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Yee erre not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> ſo I may truly ſay of all the ſeverall Sectaries of this time, they erre not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the power of God to puniſh them for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; For would they but take the word Church in that ſenſe the holy Scripture delivereth it unto us and relateth it, the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie would ſoone be at an end. Now the word Church in all the places above quoted, and through the whole Scripture of the New Teſtament for the moſt part, is taken collectively, either for all the catholike inviſible or viſible Church, or for the repreſentative body of the church, or for many congregations and aſſemblies of Beleevers, all combined together under one government, either in a citie or countrie partaking in all the Ordinances, as in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praying, and the adminiſtration of the holy Sacraments, and in the exerciſing of godly diſcipline; not onely within the wals of thoſe ſeverall cities, but through all the townes and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as farre as the bounds and limits of their ſeverall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, precincts, and juriſdictions did extend, as <hi>Acts the</hi> 15. 23. <hi>The Apoſtles and Elders ſend greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, that is, to the Church in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, and in Syria, and in Cilicia.</hi> So that church is moſt often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken collectively, as the church of <hi>Geneva</hi> at this day, and of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil,</hi> and the other reformed Cantons, as it was in the ſeven churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Now when the word church for the moſt part in holy Scripture is taken in this ſenſe, as the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the church of <hi>Samaria, Antioch, Philippi, Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. and where there were many congregations and churches combined together, and all collectively taken, in this the Independents and all Sectaries erre, that they alwayes take the word church for no more then can meete together in one of their pipkin congregations, to partake and communicate in their Ordinances; whereas the Scripture as I have
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48122:203"/>
in all the forgoing diſcourſe ſufficiently proved, taketh the word collectively for many congregations under one government, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every one of thoſe ſeverall congregations conſidered apart and by it ſelfe may truly and properly be called a church, as being a Branch and Member of ſome particular church, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in all eſſentiall Ordinances with it, as hath abundantly bin proved; yet ſtill it is conſidered but as a Member, and a Branch or part depending upon the whole particular church under which it is, and therefore claſſically governed.</p>
               <p>From all which I may conclude, that when all thoſe ſeverall Churches, as that at <hi>Ieruſalem, Samaria, Corinth, Philippi, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> which my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſaith muſt be brought in to make up a compleate paterne of Church government, were all colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively taken, and claſſically and collegiatly governed, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of many congregations, and yet but under one Presbyterie in their ſeverall precincts and juriſdictions, my Arguments will everſtand good; yea, they are all ſtrengthned from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> Conceſſion and his expreſſe words. For if when there were but three thouſand Beleevers in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as it appeares, <hi>Acts</hi> the 2. they were then forced to ſever themſelves into divers companies, becauſe they wanted a convenient place ſo ſpacious as wherein to breake bread, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſaith, how impoſſible a thing was it for them all after that time to meet together in any one place or a few, when the church at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> multiplyed daily, and that by many thouſands, and at laſt grew ſo numerous as they amounted to many Myriads, or innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable companies, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> the 21. all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my brother <hi>Burton</hi> paſſeth by and taketh no notice of, wilfully deceiving the poore people, in concealing from them ſo apparent a truth: But ſhould I take notice of the error of his words and diſcover all his juglings, my diſcourſe would ſwell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mighty volume: for to ſpeake the truth, his expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in them a heape of fraud and confuſion, all which hee muſt one day give a ſevere account for. But not to take notice I ſay of his ſeverall faylings: what he grants, is to be taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> that when the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was in its infancy they wanted a convenient place ſpacious enough to communicate in all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and therefore they were conſtrained to ſever themſelves into divers companies in ſeverall private houſes to communicate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:48122:204"/>
Then of neceſſity when that Church was multiplyed into many ten thouſands, they muſt needs be diſtributed into many and many congregations and churches to partake in all the Ordinances, and all theſe were but one church, and under one Presbytery, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> acknowledgeth.</p>
               <p>So that now I am moſt confident every judicious Reader will eaſily perceive, that my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and all thoſe of the congregationall way meerly trifle, and delude the poore and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, whiles with their ſcriblings they trouble the world, in making rents and ſchiſmes in church and ſtate.</p>
               <p>But heare yet how hee cavilleth: the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſaith hee, cannot bee a paterne to all churches, <hi>for then all Churches muſt have ſeven Deacons, and muſt bee all ſubject to ſome one Church; becauſe things in queſtion, were there debated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and ſent to other Churches to be obſerved; and in regard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that that Church was infallibly guided by the Holy Ghoſt; in which reſpect, the reſolution of that Church was with authority; it pleaſed the Holy Ghoſt and us, which no particular Church ſince can ever ſay. In theſe reſpects</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>it followes then that the Church of Ieruſalem remaines not in all things a patterne for other Churches; for a paterne muſt bee in all things imitable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Thus my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> makes a noyſe to little purpoſe, contradicting all thoſe of his owne party that I ever yet read or talked with, who all acknowledge that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was a paterne to all churches; and from the example of that church, (as they pretend) they forme and governe all their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and labour to reduce all to that paterne, and ground all their proceedings upon the Plat-forme of that church, and doe all as they affirme, in imitation of that, holding Synods to bee one of Gods ordinances, and ground it upon the meeting of the Apoſtles and Elders in the 15. of the <hi>Acts:</hi> and yet my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> here maintaineth the contrary, as his words ſufficiently declare: for which his grollery, I beleeve all thoſe of his Fraternity will give him little thankes, and blame him for his ſo great haſte in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering mee: who in his wiſe Epiſtle to the Reader ſaith, <hi>I haſted at laſt as faſt, as before I was ſlow, if poſſible to recover our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> ſo that it ſeemes hee made more haſte then good ſpeed (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverbe) <hi>Canis feſtinans caecos parit catulos,</hi> and will have cauſe at leiſure to repent; for hee hath by this his jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

and conjuring quite raſed the foundation, and overthrowne the whole Fabrick of the new Bable of Independency, which his brethren had beene ſo buſie and diligent to lay, erect, maintaine, and uphold, and that from the example of the Church of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will not be amiſſe to examine his trifling reaſons of this his gain-ſaying, and denyall that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> cannot be a paterne to other churches: for then ſaith he, <hi>every Church muſt have ſeven Deacons, and all Churches muſt be ſubject to one Church, and to the Decrees of that Church, which they cannot be, there being none now infallibly guided.</hi> Thus my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> out of the acumen of his wit diſputes at randoun: after the very ſame manner did the Prelates in their generation diſpute againſt the godly people they termed Puritans, when they alleaged the example of Chriſt and the bleſſed Apoſtles in receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, as that they all received it either ſitting or uſing a Table-geſture: and therefore that all Chriſtians, and Chriſts Diſciples were bound to imitate and to follow his and the Apoſtles examples rather then Antichriſts, as a paterne ſet downe to them of receiving the Holy Communion to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>To which the Prelates, and thoſe of that faction replyed, that if the Puritans would make Chriſt and his Apoſtles in receiving the Lords Supper a paterne for their imitation; then they muſt always celebrate it in an evening, and that after ſupper, and in an upper roome, and in a private houſe, and not in publick, and then they muſt never exceed twelve or thirteene communicants, and they muſt be all men and no women: and an hundred ſuch other toyes they brought to prove, that the example of our bleſſed Saviour and his holy Apoſtles was not to be a paterne of imitation for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Lords Supper to all Chriſtians in ſucceeding ages: and after the ſame manner doth my brother <hi>Burton</hi> now trifle to no purpoſe. For as the example of Chriſt and the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was a paterne in reſpect of ſubſtance, and not in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which was never required; ſo was the church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> in reſpect of ſubſtance, and not in every circumſtance to be a paterne to all churches for their imitating to the end of the world; As for inſtance.</p>
               <p>The church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had liberty given them by the Apoſtles
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48122:205"/>
to nominate and make choyce of Deacons, when there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie of ſuch Officers &amp; to nominate and make choyce of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they thought ſufficient for their occaſions. And in this it was a paterne to all churches in ſucceeding ages, that they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if they had need of Deacons, might make choyce of holy and godly men, and of approved integrity, and of as many as they had need of, whether fewer or more, and as often as their occaſions required, no church being limited for the number; and as the Apoſtles onely in that church ordained the Deacons, and not the people, ſo the Miniſters and Presbyters only, in all churches ſhould doe the ſame. And as upon any difference amongſt the brethren that are joyned together in church Fellowſhip (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then betweene the <hi>Grecians</hi> and the <hi>Hebrewes, Acts</hi> 6. about their widowes, who they thought <hi>were neglected in the daily Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration)</hi> they made their appeales to the Apoſtles for redreſſe; ſo in this the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is a patern to all other churches upon any occaſions of ſuch or the like difference, to appeale unto their ſeverall Presbyteries: and as they willingly ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their determination, ſo when the Presbyters command or appoint any thing in the Lord, and according to his word, the people are to yeeld willing ſubjection &amp; obedience to their order; and in their ſo doing to make the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne: and as in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem there were many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and churches, and all theſe were combined together, and ſubordinate to one Presbyterie</hi> in this alſo the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is to be a paterne to all churches in ſucceeding ages, that they may doe the like in imitation of that church, which is for ever to be a paterne to them; and as upon occaſion then <hi>certaine men went downe from Iudaea to Antioch, Acts</hi> 15. 1. and troubled the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there and in other churches, with <hi>words ſubverting their ſoules, ſaying that they muſt be circumciſed and keepe the Law verſ.</hi> 24. pretending they came from the Apoſtles and had a command from them of their ſo doing, ſo that upon this the churches ſent unto the Apoſtles and the Elders at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for the determination of this buſines in debate, &amp; waited patiently for their reſolution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any rents or ſchiſmes in the church: and as the Apoſtles and Elders of that church and of other churches called a councell and Synode and there diſputed and debated the matter with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and reaſons ſearching the holy Scriptures <hi>What was the</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:48122:205"/>
                  <hi>good will and pleaſure of God in them,</hi> and accordingly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that difference and queſtion by the written Word, and from thence commanded <hi>that the Decrees of that Councell ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the very ſame manner in this their ſo doing, the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is a paterne to all other churches upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, it any difference of opinion riſe amongſt the churches, or if any new hereſies ſpring up tending to the ſubverſion of the ſoules of the people, how holy and godly ſo ever they ſeeme to be that broach them, and what pretence ſo ever they make that they have them from divine Authority; I ſay upon the like occaſions in Imitation of the Apoſtles and Elders in the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> Kings and Princes, and Chriſtian Magiſtrates and thoſe that are in Authority, may call a councell or Synod of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines together; and as the Apoſtles and Elders there debated things by diſpute and reaſon, and by ſearching the holy Scripture found out the truth, and determined the queſtion and ſent their Decrees which were binding, to all other churches: ſo I affirme alſo in this their ſo doing that church is a paterne of imitation to all churches in all Nations and Countries and Chriſtian churches in them, that Miniſters out of ſeverall Presbyteries in a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body may meet together by the appointment of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and diſpute thoſe queſtions by reaſoning and diſcourſe, and finding by ſearching of the Word of God, what his good will and pleaſure is, may determine the queſtion accordingly, and give out their decrees grouned upon the written Word, with authority to be obſerved by all thoſe churches under their ſeverall Juriſdictions; and as the people then did patiently wait till the determining of that difference without making of any rents, ſchiſmes, or ſeparations, one from another, and did then yeild obedience to thoſe decrees without any reluctation, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them all willingly after the debate; ſo ought all people in imitation of them and following their example, with patience to wait, without making any rents and diviſions, till things are fully diſcuſſed and determined in any ſuch Synode or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and then willingly and cheerfully ſubmit themſelves and yeild obedience to them, and in their ſo doing they have the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for a paterne and the Apoſtles and Elders of that church and the other churches for an example of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48122:206"/>
ſo long as they injoyne nothing contrary to the Word of God. For this way of governing the church by Synods and Councells, upon differing and diſſenting opinions betweene church and church, and upon occaſion of any new Hereſies ſprung up in Chriſtian Countries or any old ones revived, as it hath its paterne from the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and that of <hi>Antioch</hi> which is left for our imitation that all churches upon the like occaſion ſhould follow it; So this way of ruling is grounded upon moſt excellent reaſon: as moſt agreeable both to the Law of God and nature and the practiſe of all Nations and Kingdomes of which we have many preſidents in the holy Scriptures beſides this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and ſome others. For as all Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have been ever governed by generall councells and have ever had their ſeverall appeales, from inferior Courts and councells to Superior upon either publicke grievances, or upon any differences betweene Province and Province, and County and County, or betweene Corporation and Corporation, or City and City, or upon any Preſſures or oppreſſions, or impeachments or incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of each on the others liberties or through injuſtice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to each of them, from ſome that are in power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; So the church of Ieſus Chriſt which is his Kingdome, is inferior to no other Kingdome upon earth; but in that alſo the ſeverall Corporations that are under it, which are ſo many Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian churches, have in like manner the liberty of their appeales upon any of the aforeſaid or above named occaſions.

is Chriſts Kingdome: although in it, the ſeverall Presbyteries and churches conſidered by themſelves and as having equall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongſt themſelves, cannot give Lawes to each other, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and by themſelves conſidered, as the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the other could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to each other a rule or Law to walke by with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but only in an examplary way by well doing: yet all theſe ſeverall churches ioyning together in a generall councell, as they did at <hi>Jeruſalem Acts</hi> the 15. and having from each of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligated and ſent their Presbyters and Miniſters as ſo many Burgeſſes, of their ſeverall cities and Corporations, and they being all met together upon any grievances and having by debating of the matters and differences in queſtion by diſpute and by diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition found, <hi>What is the good will of God, and what is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his good Word and in the holy Scriptures which are the Fundamentall Lawes of his Kingdom</hi> may in any Chriſtian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſo called, and ordering their buſineſſe as the councell and Synod of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did, give out their Decrees and thoſe binding ones to all thoſe ſeverall churches that are under their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and all theſe ſeverall churches ought to yeild obedience to them. And in this their ſo doing they have the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the other churches a preſident and a paterne. For (I ſay) in all theſe reſpects the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is a paterne to all other churches. And as in the church at <hi>Ieruſalem, Corinth, Philippi, Samaria, Epheſus,</hi> &amp;c. the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and the Presbyters in every one of thoſe churches had the charge of each of thoſe churches committed to them in common, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from all the places above quoted, and through the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and as they fed them all and governed them all in common: ſo in that alſo both the church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and all the other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (according to my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> doctrine who ſaith <hi>they muſt all come in for the making up of a compleat platforme)</hi> I ſay as all the Presbyters and Miniſters fed thoſe ſeverall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in common, ſo they are a paterne to all churches in all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages to the end of the world, that they may do the ſame in their ſeverall and reſpective Presbyteries. Neither is there any preſident or example in all the holy Scriptures of the new-Teſtament, that any church had its peculiar Paſtor and Teacher, or Doctor alloted to it, with but two or three Elders and a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48122:207"/>
with a ſlender congregation of people of the which they only had the cure and care for the feeding and ruling of it, and the which had abſolute Authority within it ſelf, and from which there was no appeale, the which notwithſtanding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents aſſert is a true formed church after the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forme; ſuch a modell of a church I affirme can never be ſhewed or proved in all the new teſtament. God (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 12. verſ. 28.) <hi>hath ſet ſome in the church; firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after Miracles, then Gifts of healing, helps in government, diverſities of Tongues; are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> &amp;c. and in the 4. of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>When Chriſt aſcended on high, he gave gifts unto Men, &amp;c. and he gave ſome Apoſtles and ſome Prophets: and ſome Evangeliſts: and ſome Paſtors and Teachers: for the perfecting of the Saints</hi> &amp;c. all the which places are to be underſtood concerning the Catholicke viſible church. So that to appropriate theſe places of Scripture to any particular church, as thoſe of the Congregationall way do, is to abuſe and pervert the holy Scriptures for the upholding of their unwarrantable proceedings: for if theſe Scriptures are to be applyed unto every particular congregationall church, then there muſt not only be a Paſtor and a Teacher, but many Paſtors and many Teachers in each of them beſides other church officers; and then the Paſtors and Teachers would be more in number many times then the flocke; and if we looke upon all particular Churches founded by the Apoſtles which muſt be a paterne indeed to all churches, then we ſhall finde that in all of them, ſeverally, they had many Presbyters, as in the 14. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and in the 20. of the ſame, and in all the above cited Scriptures doth abundantly appeare. So that there is no ground in all the holy Scripture of the new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of the Congregationall way: <hi>for following the expreſſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> (to uſe my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> owne words) the firſt formed church we finde is in the <hi>Acts</hi> the ſecond, which conſiſted of many thouſands, and in that church there were no diſtinct officers and members united into one church body reſpectively: for all the Apoſtles and Miniſters of that church fed and ruled that church in common: and therefore after the very ſame example and paterne may all Chriſtian churches to the end of the world do the ſame and be well formed churches, &amp; yet have neither a particular Paſtor nor
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48122:207"/>
Teacher, nor diſtinct officers amongſt them: for neither the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> nor any of the Primitive and Apoſtolike Churches had that diſtinction of officers amongſt them, and all and every one of them nevertheleſſe were well formed churches, and therefore in this they be a paterne to all churches.</p>
               <p>And as in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and in all the other churches all thoſe that were converted and added to them were none of them forced to walke either Dayes, or Moneths, or years with them before their admiſſion, that they might either know the Saints and Members of that Church, or be known of them, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were ever forced to make a publike confeſſion of their faith, and bring in the evidences of their converſion or to enter in by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite particular covenant, and to obtain the conſent of the whole church before their admittance: So in this <hi>the Church of Jeruſalem and the other Churches of the New Teſtament are to be a pattern to all other churches to the end of the World that they may follow the example of that Mother Church, and all the primitive Daughter-Churches in admitting of their Members without any of theſe things; for that was the firſt formed Church, and yet ſhee required no ſuch things of any that were added into her.</hi> But of this in its due place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as the Miniſters of the Church in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the Apoſtles and Teaches only had the power of government, and admitting of Members, and did it without the conſent of the people, as wee may ſee in their firſt admiſſion of Members, who applyed themſelves unto the Apoſtles onely,</hi> ſaying men and brethren what ſhall wee doe? <hi>and not unto the people; and as in that Church, when the people and Beleevers oppoſed any that deſired to be admitted, as they did Saint</hi> Paul, Acts <hi>the 9.</hi> verſe <hi>26, 27.</hi> of whom they were afraid, not beleeving hee was a diſciple, <hi>and hee then appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtles, who upon hearing of the truth of the buſines, they</hi> admitted him comming in, and going out without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; <hi>in this alſo</hi> the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is to be a paterne to all Miniſters and people in all ſucceeding Churches, that it is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters place onely to admit of Members, and not the peoples, and if they ſhould gaine-ſay the admiſſion of any upon either their feares or jealouſies, or out of other reſpects, that then they may have their appeales from them to the Presbyters in each Church, and giving them an account of their faith, they are by them to be admitted, notwithſtanding the diſlike and diſſenting of their brethren; <hi>for of</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:48122:208"/>
                  <hi>this way of proceeding wee have the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>for a paterne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and all the other Primitive Churches never made any rents and ſchiſmes from the publike aſſemblies for ſome faylings, but alwayes conſtantly frequented their publike meeting places, notwithſtanding the many corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Teachers, both in Doctrine, Diſcipline and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and had not only the example of the bleſſed Apoſtles, but of Chriſt alſo in ſo doing, who when he was queſtioned concerning his doctrine, ſaid, <hi>I taught publickely in the Temple, and in the Synagogue,</hi> and not in corners and by places, and <hi>he inioyned the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo to doe the ſame,</hi> Matth. 23, <hi>ſaying, the Scribes and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>his ſeat: all therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve that obſerve and doe, but doe not yee after their workes,</hi> &amp;c. So likewiſe other Churches to the end of the world ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this Church as their paterne, not to ſeparate from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like aſſemblies, and thoſe Churches for ſome faylings, eſpecially when they are found in doctrine, and preach all ſaving truths needfull to ſalvation without any mixture of humane inventions; and ſo much the rather all Churches ought to imitate the example of the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the other Primitive Churches in this, not only becauſe they have Chriſts both example and precept for it, but becauſe alſo ſeparation is blamed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Hebrewes, Heb.</hi> 10. and therefore forbidden, who ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 23, 24, 25. <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering (for hee is faithfull that promiſed) and let us conſider one an other, to provoke unto love and good workes, not forſaking the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is: but exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one an other, and ſo much the more, as you ſee the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,</hi> It ſeemes the Jewes preſuming of their owne holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that they were the peculiar people of God, thought baſely of the Gentiles, and began to ſeparate in that regard from their publike aſſemblies, as too many now adayes of the Ildepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents doe from their brethren, thinking themſelves more holy then they: the Apoſtle therefore writing to his countrey men the Jewes, blames them for this, and in them reproveth all that doe the like, and forbids them ſo to doe; and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch as made ſchiſmes in the Church, ſaith, that <hi>if they had beene of us they would not have gone out and departed from amongſt</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:48122:208"/>
                  <hi>us;</hi> but in that they ſeparated from amongſt them, it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that they were not of them: ſo that hee maketh it a marke and note of Apoſtates to make rents and ſchiſmes in any Church from the publike aſſemblies; in all theſe regards therefore wee ought to take heed of ſeparation, and ought in this to make the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the other Primitive Churches our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and example, and not to ſeparate from the churches and aſſemblies of the Saints, though indeed there ſhould be many faylings in them, which when the churches of the congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall way daily doe, they are highly to be blamed as offenders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt precepts and preſidents, both of Chriſt and the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and againſt the example of all the Primitive churches who never did it; all the which notwithſtanding my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſaith ought to be conferred together for the making up of a perfect paterne for our imitation; they therefore not following their paterne, but making rents, have in their ſo doing much to anſwer for.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and all the other churches my brother <hi>Burton</hi> enumerates, are to be a paterne to all churches in ſucceeding ages, in their well doing and in what was prayſe worthy: ſo likewiſe, wherein either the whole churches, or any officers or members in them, were fayling in their duty, and for it either reproved, threatned, or puniſhed for their owne diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or but for their indulgence at others in their ſinnes, as old <hi>Ely,</hi> I <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. <hi>in that hee did not correct and chaſtiſe his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſons,</hi> and the ſeven churches of Aſia <hi>for their particular faylings, especially thoſe of</hi> Pergamos, Thyatira, <hi>and</hi> Laodicea, <hi>for ſuffering the doctrinc of</hi> Balaam, Jezebel, <hi>and of the Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> though it was not with approbation of the ſame, but onely in that they connived at them, and did not exerciſe their power in caſting out thoſe offenders, and puniſhing thoſe luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> who were indifferent what religion was ſet up or imbraced amongſt them; I ſay in all theſe reſpects, both theſe churches and people and all other churches for their fayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and puniſhments are examples to us, to teach and forwarne us not to offend in the like manner, <hi>leſt partaking with them in their ſinnes, wee partake with them alſo in their ſeverall plagues and puniſhments: for whatſoever was written was pend for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48122:209"/>
                  <hi>verſe</hi> 11. and therefore if wee will tolerate all religions among us, and ſhall not be zealous for the honour of our God, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by all our might to eſtabliſh his true worſhip, and for the extirpating of all hereſies and ſcandals, the Lord will have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie againſt us, as hee had againſt them, and if wee repent not, <hi>will remove his Candleſticke from us, and leave us in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and in the ſhadow of death,</hi> as hee hath done thoſe churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who are all now under the Mahumetan ſuperſtition. For wee muſt take notice, that as every command of God is both preceptive and prohibitive; ſo there is ſomething in the practiſe and manners of all the Saints and churches of God, as that in the Iſraelites, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and in the above mentioned churches that have ſome things in them to be ſhunned and avoyded, as their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſinnes and faylings, and ſome things in them likewiſe to bee imitated, as their zeale, piety, vertues, and godly examples, and holy courage, which as they are all praiſe worthy, and for which they ought ever to be honoured, <hi>ſo they are ſet downe for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and imitation that wee ſhould doe the ſame;</hi> yea, this their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is as a command to us <hi>that wee ſhould follow them in this their well doing;</hi> and where they did evill and fayled in their duty, in this, there is a prohibition to all chriſtians and to all churches in ſucceeding ages to the end of the world, <hi>to take heed left they doe the like, and ſo fall into the ſame condemnation,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. where prohibiting the Evangeliſt to ordaine a novice for a Miniſter, (he ſaith) <hi>leſt being lifted up with pride hee fall into the condemnation of the Devill:</hi> for by his pride hee was caſt out of heaven, that ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>hee was condemned for; therefore lay thou no hands upon a novice, leſt hee be lifted up with pride and fall into the ſame condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in all the former reſpects, both the church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and all other churches, and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are a paterne to us, <hi>upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> that wee ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſet them before our eyes, if wee deſire to injoy thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and bleſſings they partaked in for their well doing, or to ſhun and avoid thoſe puniſhments were inflicted upon them for their ſins negligences and rebellions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this I thought good to ſay, in way of anſwer, to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Burton <hi>concerning</hi> the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the other Churches enumerated by him, <hi>all the which hee aſſerteth</hi> are to bee
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48122:209"/>
conferred together for the making up of a compleate paterne and plat forme of Church government, <hi>and yet grolliſhly denieth</hi> that they can be a paterne in all things, <hi>which to ſpeake the truth, is a peece of non-ſenſe and a contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But before I conclude with him and ſhut up this diſcourſe, I ſhall deſire the Reader a little to ponder and weigh my brother</hi> Burtous <hi>expreſſions in the very entrance of this his anſwer, and reply to his own argument.</hi> For your indefinite enumeration <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> of thoſe multitudes baptized by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and Chriſts diſciples, wee take no notice of them, unleſſe formed into a Church or Churches: but following the expreſſe Scripture, the firſt formed church wee find is in <hi>Acts</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Theſe words deſerve due conſideration. Amongſt thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, Chriſt himſelfe was one, the Lord of life, who ſanctified that ordinance in his owne perſon, and that in a ſpeciall manner, as being done by his ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>and that for the fulfilling of all righteouſneſſe,</hi> both in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and in the Baptiſt, as it is at large ſet downe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and it was ratified by all the bleſſed Trinity, as by the immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of the Spirit of God upon Chriſt, in the likeneſſe of a Dove who was the perſon baptized, with a voice from God the Father out of Heaven, ſaying, <hi>this is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> So that Chriſt, God the Father, and God the Holy Ghoſt did ſanctifie and confirme this ordinance, not only to all thoſe that had beene baptiſed by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Chriſts diſciples, who were alſo baptized by <hi>Iohn:</hi> but to all thoſe in all future ages that ſhould be baptized by Chriſts diſciples, and all his faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which hee ſent <hi>into all nations to preach and baptize them, Matth.</hi> 28. to all which hee promiſed his preſence to the end of the world. So that I am moſt aſſured, all good Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Chriſt was well baptized; and if he was well bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, it cannot be denyed but that all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts diſciples, were all likewiſe well baptized, and were all good Chriſtians: for both <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Diſciples had their commiſſion from God and Chriſt himſelfe for their ſo doing; and therefore if any authority from Heaven, and a ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, and a miſsion from him, be of any force to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, and aſcertaine any ordinance, then the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts diſciples was authenticke; and all thoſe that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48122:210"/>
by them, ought to have beene taken notice of by my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and all the Independents, as formed into a church or churches, except they doe indeed beleeve, that Chriſt the King and head of his church, with his bleſſed Apoſtles and all his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Diſciples, whoſe names were written in Heaven, and all thoſe multitudes of men and women, that adminiſtred unto him and followed him, of whom hee gave this teſtimony, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 49, 50. <hi>Behold my mother and my brethren; for whoſoever ſhall doe the will of my father, which is in heaven, the ſame is my brother, &amp; ſiſter and mother;</hi> except I ſay they beleeve all theſe cannot make up a formed Church or churches, which were impiety to thinke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now I referre it to the judgement of any well grounded chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> whether or no they doe not beleeve that the great Paſtor and Shepheard of our ſoules Chriſt Ieſus, with his mother, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters, with all thoſe that heard the voice of this their Shepheard, and knew it, and therefore followed him, and beleeved in him, with all <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples and thoſe that were baptized by his and Chriſts diſciples Miniſtry, cannot as well make up a formed church or churches, as any of our new formed congregations with a Paſtor and Teacher, and a few other of their conceited Members? <hi>I am fully perſwaded, that upon due deliberation, they will ſay,</hi> they can ſee no good reaſon, but that Chriſt the chiefe Paſtor of his ſheepe, and ſo many true beleevers and Saints with him, ſhould not all of them as well make up a formed church or churches, as ten or twelve in one of our new congregations; <hi>and therefore that they ought to have beene taken notice of by my brother</hi> Burton, <hi>and thoſe of his Fraternity as formed into a church or churches; which notwithſtanding they doe not, aſſerting in expreſſe termes,</hi> that they take no notice of them as formed into a church or churches; <hi>which if it be not the higheſt point of blaſphemy and temerity, I know not what either blaſphemy or raſhneſſe is in any.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe words may not ſlightly be paſſed over: Wee (ſaith my brother <hi>Burton) take no notice of them, unleſſe formed into a Church or Churches,</hi> &amp;c. What men ordinarily take no notice of, they ſlight or little regard, eſpecially if they ſpeake thoſe words from the judgement of deliberation, and not upon extemporary paſſion: or except they be in very great haſte, and then they may be ſomewhat excuſed, if they paſſe by their beſt friends and take no notice of them; otherwiſe if they ſpeake it out of ſerioſity, <hi>that they take no notice of men,</hi> it is as much as to ſay <hi>they ſlight them, regard them not, or deſpiſe them.</hi> But I have a better opinion of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> (though he thinketh very unworthily of me) then that hee ſhould ſlight his beſt friend Jeſus Chriſt, and take no notice of him, and his diſciples, and all the beleevers in Chriſts time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially when hee pretends <hi>That hee onely labours to ſet him up upon his Throne as King, and counts all his diſſenting brethren from his wayes, enemies of Ieſus Chriſt and his Kingdome.</hi> I ſay, in this regard I harbour a more favourable and a more charitable opinion of my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> then that upon mature deliberation and ſerious thoughts, he ſhould take no notice of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles and Followers, and of all the faithfull baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſts diſciples <hi>as not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a church or churches;</hi> and yet theſe are his words, <hi>we</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take no notice of them as formed into a Church or Churches.</hi>

This humour of his made my good brother idle-brained, and occaſioned him to make more haſte then good ſpeed; certainly it either perverted his judgment, or put him into a lunacy, or into one of his odd dreams; for otherwiſe he would have taken notice, if not of thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples, atleaſt of Chriſt himſelfe his good Friend, his Lord and Maſter, <hi>the King of Saints and King of Kings, the mighty Potentate, the ſole and only head and Lawgiver and Governour of his Church:</hi> I ſay if he had not been in very great haſte indeed and giddy withall in his brain, or in ſome diſtraction, <hi>He would have taken notice of Chriſt and have thought him and his bleſſed Apoſtles and ſeventy Diſciples and thoſe likewiſe that were baptized by</hi> John <hi>with Chriſts Mother, Brethren and Siſters, worthy to be eſteemed a formed Church or Churches;</hi> yet he and his brethren paſſe by them all; ſaying, <hi>we take no notice of them as formed into a Church or churches;</hi> ſo that it is no wonder they at this day take no notice of our Churches and that they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny them <hi>to be formed into a church or churches after the New Teſtament forme,</hi> when they do the ſame to all the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Chriſts time.</p>
               <p>Surely that Subject that ſhould paſſe by his King and Soveraign, and all his retinue and Courtiers, and take no notice of him and them, and ſhould yeild him no reverence, would be thought craſed in his brain; eſpecially if he ſhould in a ſlighting manner ſay, <hi>He tooke no notice of them.</hi> And all men that ſhould hear ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from him, would not onely judge ſuch an one a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred man and an uncivill fellow, but that deſervedly he ought to be taught better manners. And without doubt a King that ſhould underſtand of ſuch a Subject, if he at any time had need of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, would reply unto him, <hi>Sir, you woud take no notice of me and my ſervants, go now to thoſe for help that you think worthy to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of:</hi> As the Lord ſaid unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who when they were oppreſſed by their cruell enemies and came then flying unto him for his aſſiſtance, <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to your gods, that in your proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity yee ſerved, and ſeek help from them.</hi> And truly if the buſineſſe be ſeriouſly conſidered, this my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and his aſſociates dealing with Chriſt and his Diſciples and Followers, is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlike the dealing of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with the Lord, at leaſt in words: For in plain termes they ſay, <hi>we take no notice of them as</hi>

                  <hi>formed into a church or churches,</hi> ſo that Chriſt and his Diſciples are very little beholding to thoſe of the congregationall way.</p>
               <p>Certainly, the man was in very great haſte when he uttered theſe words, or exceedingly diſtemperd in his brain; for otherwiſe Chriſt had been worthy to have been taken notice of, if his followers had not. Our Saviour ſpeaks of ſome, that at the laſt day ſhall ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not preached in thy Name, and in thy Name have we not done wondrous works? Mat.</hi> 7. ver. 22, 23. To whom Chriſt ſaith, he will reply, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi> And doubtleſſe if my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not of theſe their words, and of all their evill dealing, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and miſ-leading of the poor people and of making rents and ſchiſmes in Church and State, but ſhall ſtill perſevere in the errour of their wayes, and will not yet take notice of thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes baptized by <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſts Diſciples and of Chriſt himſelfe and his Followers, nor of their brethren at this day through all the Reformed churches, <hi>as formed into a Church or Churches;</hi> it is to be feared that whatſoever both he and thoſe of his party ſhall pretend, As <hi>that they have preached in his name, and done wondrous works, in gathering of new churches, and preaching up the congregationall way and publiſhing of new truths, and ſetting up of new lights and placing Chriſt upon his Throne;</hi> I ſay whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall in this kinde pretend, <hi>Except they all repent of this their wickedneſſe and uncharitable dealing towards all their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren,</hi> it is to be feared, that Chriſt will ſay to them as he profeſſeth he will ſay to the others, <hi>I know ye not, depart from me ye that worke iniquity, and they all likewiſe periſh.</hi>

                  <hi>For what can any man that hath not reſigned his underſtanding think leſſe of this ſo weighty a buſineſſe? but that Chriſt may ſay unto them at that day,</hi> You have taught it in your congregations and printed in your bookes ſet forth by authority by all your conſents, and that upon deliberation, that you take no notice of all thoſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> and my Diſciples, to be formed into a Church or Churches. Theſe <hi>(will he ſay)</hi> are your owne words and that in capitall letters; nay you deny them to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>for ſo</hi> J. S. <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> page <hi>8, and 9. in the name of all the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> giving many reaſons there to the contrary, aſſerting that by the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> they were not made Chriſtians, much leſſe caſt into a church mould, according to the New Teſtament forme, and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48122:212"/>
leaſt of all, that they were all Members of one Chriſtian church at Jeruſalem: <hi>Theſe are his expreſſions;</hi> For which he hath been much applauded by all of that fraternity, who uſually ſay of him when he rideth through the ſtreets, there goeth he that beat up Doctor <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks</hi> quarters; approving of this good worke of his in unchriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all thoſe that beleeved in mee and were baptized by the Miniſtry of my ſervant <hi>John</hi> the greateſt Prophet that ever was borne of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſent by me and my father to baptize them: And of Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> they never speak but in high praiſes, bleſſing God that he hath anſwered <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> Book, which he writ in defence and maintenace of my honour, and for the reputation of all that beleeved in me, and were baptized in my name; So that all thoſe books that were ſet forth by thoſe of the congregationall way to my diſhonour and the diſrepute of my followers are approved of by you all, and in them you ſay you take no notice of thoſe multitudes that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a church or churches.</p>
               <p>Now amongſt thoſe that were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> I was one, and my Diſciples and my Mother and my Brethren, &amp;c. So that you ſlight us all, and take no notice of us, as formed into a Church or churches; that is in plain words, you are aſhamed of us and deny us; Now thoſe that are aſhamed of me and deny me before men, and take no notice of me and my Diſciples, and of my Brethren and Siſters and Mother, and of thoſe that beleeved in me and followed me whiles I was upon the earth, to be formed into a church or churches, I will be aſhamed of them and deny them, and take no notice of them before my Father in Heaven to be formed into a church or churches: For he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth my Diſciples and my Followers, despiſeth me, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth me, despiſeth him that ſent me; <hi>Yea,</hi> whoſoever ſhall deſpiſe one of theſe little ones that beleeve in me, it were better that a milſtone were hanged about his neck and that he were caſt into the midſt of the ſea. This was one of my ſtatute laws, will Chriſt the King of his Church ſay. Now you of the congregationall way take no notice of me, nor of them that beleeved in me and were baptized in my name by <hi>John</hi> and my Diſciples, as formed into a church or churches; for theſe are your own expreſſions; I therefore will take no notice of you of the oongregationall by-path, as formed into a church or churches; not onely for theſe your hard ſpeeches againſt me and thoſe that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in me, but becauſe in all my holy word I never appointed ſuch a modell and forme of churches as you have erected amongst you, I
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48122:212"/>
therefore in all theſe respects, take no notice of you as formed into a church or churches; I know you not; depart from me; <hi>this I preſume any rationall man will be ready to gather will be the doome of thoſe that take no notice of Chriſt and his Followers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe their words and of this their dealing therefore, except my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his aſſociates, ſeriouſly, unfainedly and ſpeedily repent, they muſt give a dreadfull accompt at the laſt day. For if we muſt give an accompt of every idle word, what an accompt then muſt be given of ſuch expreſſions as theſe are, which deſpiſe Chriſt himſelfe and his bleſſed Apoſtles and all his Followers and all that beleeved in him when he was upon the earth, and take no notice of them <hi>as formed into a church or chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi> And what a dreadfull reckoning muſt he and his abetters give for all thoſe erroneous, impious and uncharitable opinions they have of late hatched and brought into the world? the very naming of the which would be unpleaſant to a true ſanctified ſoule, as this amongſt the other, that they take no notice of Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Followers and all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> to be formed into a church or churches? Yea what a fearfull accompt muſt they at that day give for all their bitter and reviling ſpeeches and malitious practiſes againſt all their Chriſtian brethren through the Reformed churches who they have all unchurched?</p>
               <p>Yea my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices muſt alſo give a great accompt of this, that whereas they ſhould have taught the people the way of God truly and plainly and have delivered unto them the whole counſell of God, they not onely profeſſe they will keep a reſerve <hi>Donec ad triarios redierit res,</hi> contrary to the command of God who hath injoyned all his ſervants <hi>to be ready to give an accompt of their hope to whoſoever ſhall demand it</hi> 1 Pet. 3. and preach it publickly and upon the houſe topp whatſoever he taught his Diſciples in ſecret and privately, but blame all churches but their own of the congregationall way, as not rightly formed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the New Teſtament forme, and yet would never ſet down to their brethren the modell of that forme and ſhew it unto the people and Saints of God that they might all be undeceived if in an error, although they have bin often &amp; again ſollicited thereunto, and although alſo they by promiſe had ingaged themſelves to deliver in their modell by ſuch a time, and by this their unjuſt and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing have kept the people of God and many pretious ſouls
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48122:213"/>
in ignorance of many principall truths if their doctrine be true, and cauſed the people by that means exceedingly to erre and to remain ſtill in darkneſſe; when notwithſtanding they glory that they ſet up every day many New Lights, which is in them all a moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and abominable ſinne, and of the which as of all their hard words againſt their brethren, and of all their calumnies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and bringing up an evill name and report againſt the Presbyterian government as the wicked Spies did againſt the good Land, of all theſe things I ſay as of all their errors, ſciſmes and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and eſpecially of <hi>their taking no notice of thoſe multitudes baptized by</hi> John <hi>and Chriſts Diſciples to be formed into a church or churches,</hi> they except they ſpeedily repent, muſt give a dreadfull accompt at the great day, and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> eſpecially; for he is one of the principall Leaders and Captains in this Militia and new Modell of Ill-dependency.</p>
               <p>If ſome yong <hi>Sprigge</hi> that had been turn'd about with every ſtream of opinion, and carryed about this way and that way with every wind of doctrine, had ſpake ſuch words only, and had bin the author of ſuch novell opinions and of ſuch double dealing and jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I ſhould never have wondred at it, knowing how unſtable youth is; but for an old <hi>Tree,</hi> in which the ſap of youth ſhould now be well dryed up, and which ſhould be ſtiffe and unmoveable and for ever to be ſettled; for ſuch a one I ſay as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> was expected to be, to be unſtable, thus toſſing and tumbling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with every ſtream of new doctrine or every novell blaſt of any windy opinion, it ſheweth that it is either founded upon a ſandy ground or a brittle foundation or rotten at the very root, and that if it be not ſpeedily looked unto and underpropped that it will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fall, and that the fall thereof will be very great; which that it may not happen to my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and that the Lord would give him and his aſſociates repentance for all their unthankfulneſſe to God and for all their evill dealings and uncharitableneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their brethren, and eſpecially towards my ſelfe, it ſhall be my earneſt prayer for them all who they have ſo much deſpiſed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ilified.</p>
               <p>And this I thought fit to ſpeak concerning my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> reply, to whatſoever he had to ſay in way of anſwer concerning my firſt four propoſitions and the whole firſt part of my booke. What he hath to reply to my arguments about the ſecond queſtion,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48122:213"/>
touching the gathering of churches, ſhall be anſwered in their due place, after I have ſpake alittle, according to my promiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Independents definition of their Church,</hi> which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally I met with, when from their owne Principles I confirmed my arguments, that if any thing, <hi>it</hi> might make them more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the Independents eyes, or at leaſt that they might not be ſo inraged againſt me hereafter, when they ſhall take notice that I ſpake nothing, but what I ratified and made good from their own grounds: Their definition of their church is this.</p>
               <p>A viſible Church is <hi>(ſay they)</hi> a myſticall body, whereof Chriſt is the head, the Members Saints, called out of the world, and united together into one Congregation by an holy Covenant, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord, and to edifie one an other in all his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>Before I diſcover all the errors of this definition, and come to ſhew that according to this their deſcription of a Church, there has never as yet beene a true formed church, and that none of the congregationall churches themſelves (if this their definition bee good) be true formed churches; and which is more, <hi>that they muſt of neceſſity, be all dependent,</hi> I ſhall ſet downe the chiefe things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> they define a viſible church, to bee a myſticall body, of which Chriſt is the head, the Members Saints, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, they aſſert, that this church is but one congregation,</hi> or as many as can conveniently meet together in any one place to partake in all Gods holy Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they affirme, <hi>that the forme of this church, is a holy explicite covenant,</hi> which falſely they make one of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: or they ſay, <hi>they are united together into one congregation by an holy covenant.</hi> Now it cannot be holy, except it be one of Gods Ordinances, and have his command and authority for it, which is that that ingraves holineſſe upon it: otherwiſe it is either diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, or at leaſt but humane. So that in the Independents learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereſoever any of theſe things are wanting, in any congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of chriſtians, it is not a formed church: for this is their definition of a church, within the bounds and limits of which whatſoever church doth not come, and within the which it is not terminated, it is no true church; and ſo by this, all particular churches that are and have beene in the world, neither were nor
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48122:214"/>
are true formed churches, no not the very Independent congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations themſelves, as I hope by Gods aſſiſtance I ſhall illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly make appeare, after I have ſaid ſomething in order of the particular branches of this their definition, and have ſhewed the abſurdities of it, and the impoſſibilities of attaining ſuch a church as they have ſet out, and the great inconveniences, and indeed the unſupportable bondage that would redound unto thouſands of Gods people, if theſe men might have their mind, and all things according to their definition: For from ſuch a church as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and deſire, though it conſiſt but of ten or twelve, <hi>bee they never ſo erroneous in their doctrine, and never ſo corrupt in their manners, and never ſo perverſe, malicious and unplacable in their minds and wils, and let their unjuſtice done againſt any poore oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Member, by them, be never ſo great or exorbitant, there is no appeale from it, or helpe or redreſſe to be expected by any appeale to any other court, church, or Eccleſiaſticall Tribunall; which is a yoake of one of the moſt horrid tyrannies and ſlaveries that ever the world yet ſaw, and which neither wee nor our Fore-fathers could ever beare, a greater then the which never any men voluntarily put themſelves under, before theſe our unhappy times.</hi> All the which I ſhall, God aſſiſting mee, in the examination of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of this definition, make evident.</p>
               <p>And firſt, whereas they define a <hi>viſible church,</hi> to be a myſticall body. If any Presbyterian ſhould have ſo ſpake, the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents would have ſaid, <hi>it had beene a bull.</hi> For viſible and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cannot be predicated of one and the ſame body, at one and the ſame time: for if it be myſticall, then not viſible, and if vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible then not myſticall: and therefore their definition belongs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the inviſible church, then to any viſible congregation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter of it is the myſticall body of Chriſt, conſiſting of Saints, and ſuch as are truly holy and godly, which none know but God himſelfe; for no man can certainly and poſitively ſay, <hi>that this or that man is a Saint,</hi> but in the judgement of charity, which is often miſtaken, as the Independents themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they have beene: for the time was, that they thought ſome men Saints (who are the ſame ſtill, they then were) and yet now they not only thinke, but ſay, though falſely, they are Devils, and repent that ever they prayed for them. But moſt true it is, that God only knowes who are his: yea, the Apoſtles themſelves,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48122:214"/>
though of more diſcerning ſpirits then any in our age, yet could not diſcover <hi>Iudas;</hi> Chriſt onely knew hee was a Devill; it was hidden and a myſterie to the Apoſtles, and the ſame to this day lies hid from all men, who are Saints indeed; that belongs onely to God, it is his Prerogative, who is the ſearcher of all hearts: and therefore their definition is abſurd, groundleſſe, and vaine in this branch of it, when they ſay <hi>a viſible church is a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body conſiſting of none but Saints.</hi> And then it would follow, <hi>that none of the Apoſtolicall churches were true formed churches, according to this their modell;</hi> for wee reade not onely <hi>of many ſcandalous walkers amongſt them, but of ſome hereticks,</hi> and yet they ceaſed not to be true churches, what ever the Independents thinke now of ſuch congregations as are mixt, though in none or in very few of them, they can diſcover any ſuch offenders as were in the church in <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Philippi,</hi> and in ſome of the ſeven churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and therefore if their definition bee good, none of the Primitive churches were true churches; yea, I hope to make it evident in the ſequell, that none of the churches of the congregationall way are then true churches, as not conſiſting of all Saints.</p>
               <p>But now I come to the ſecond branch or part, <hi>viz. that the Church they deſire, muſt be but one congregation injoying all Gods Ordinances in it:</hi> which if it be true and good in this branch alſo, then the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was not a well formed church; for there were many congregations; and then alſo never a Church in the world to this day was a true church; much leſſe can any of our new congregations challenge that title and be true churches, it being impoſſible, though they conſiſt but of one congregation apeece, for them ſeverally to injoy all Gods Ordinances in any one of them: for amongſt Gods Ordinances the Independents both in <hi>New-England,</hi> and here amongſt us, hold, <hi>that Synods and Councels are one of Gods Ordinances, and yet they are not chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches properly ſo called in their dialect, though as they are repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive bodies of many churches,</hi> they may have that name given them, and are churches in my notion and according to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but I ſay, <hi>not properly according to their language:</hi> for their congregations conſiſt of particular Paſtors and Teachers, and of two or three Elders apeice and Deacons, and of a few men and women, and have many other pretty things required for the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48122:215"/>
moulding of them up into formed churches, <hi>after the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forme;</hi> whereas in Councels and Synods, they have neither particular Paſtors, nor Teachers over them, nor any ſuch Elders and Deacons as they require, nor no women; ſo that no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church in the world to this preſent day injoyed that Ordinance in it.</p>
               <p>For a Synod and Councell conſiſts of Presbyters onely, and that of many, not onely out of any one particular church though never ſo large and great, but out of many, ſent and delegated from each of them reſpectively and ſeverally; yea, many times not only out of many ſeverall Presbyteries adjacent, but out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries and Provinces; as that at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councels, and that lately at <hi>Dort,</hi> and this our Synod now preſent; and their imployments likewiſe are of an other nature, then that of ordinary Paſtors in their ſeverall congregations, as all men know: and therefore not a church properly ſo called, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their language; for a Synod and church, are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct things, and both of them together were never yet found in any one congregation in the world; and ſo by conſequence, <hi>there was never any congregation or particular church that yet injoyed all Gods Ordinances,</hi> and therefore if their definition be good, they were no true churches, for they had no Synod or Councell in them: neither can any of our new congregations at this day have a Synod in them, and therefore they injoy not all Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in them ſeverally, and ſo come not within the compaſſe, bounds and limits of their owne definition, <hi>and therefore remaine not true formed churches, as not injoying that Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, there are other Ordinances that the congregationall churches cannot injoy: for there is an impoſſibility of it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning and firſt conſtitution of them, but many times after in regard of mortality, and the death of their Elders and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and other Officers, or when there remaines but one alive, as it often happens in our new congregations; and therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they muſt bee Dependent, if they will injoy all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elſe be no churches, as not injoying all Ordinances: As for inſtance, there are Ordinances that neerly concerne every particular congregation, which cannot be performed by that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; for how can a particular congregation, which for the moſt part conſiſts of ignorant men and women, try the ſufficiency of the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48122:215"/>
Presbyters, that are to be elected or put over them, when they have no knowledge in thoſe Sciences, Arts, Faculties and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and of the tongues and languages, as Latine, Greeke, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and are ignorant in many other things, that in ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency are required in all ſuch as are to be made Presbyters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters over them; when I ſay not any one in thoſe congregations, many times, have any knowledge in any one of thoſe arts and ſciences, in all which a Miniſter ought in ſome meaſure to bee verſed in, if hee will take upon him that high calling, and charge of the Miniſtry, and duly and rightly performe it unto them: and were it ſo, that in all theſe new gathered churches they had ſuch intelligible Members, who when they have made choyce of them, ſhall give them impoſition of hands which belongs onely to the Presbyterie and Elders to perform, &amp; cannot be done by the people, who never were appointed by God to ordaine Officers in his church, as all the learnedſt of the Independents hold and teach: ſo that when any Elders and Presbyters, and other church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are to be ordained in their new gathered churches, they permit not the common people to impoſe hands upon them, but alwayes deſire Elders and Presbyters of other congregations to doe it, without whoſe helpe they cannot injoy this Ordinance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves; and therefore if they will have it, they muſt neceſſarily be Dependent. The ſame may be ſaid of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Excommunication; but I will firſt ſpeake of impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, and ordination of Elders and Officers, the which howſoever in ſome of the more unlearned Independents eſteeme it to be of ſmall weight, and but a complement; yet it is one of Gods holy Ordinances, which the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> accounts and reckons amongſt the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a part of the Foundation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, which place of Scripture, one of the Fathers of the congregationall way, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Henry Iacob</hi> by name, who firſt baptized their new gathered churches, with that compellation of Independent churches, for his owne advantage exceedingly urged to overthrow the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Miniſters of the church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe as hee ſuppoſed, the church of <hi>England</hi> erred in the Foundation, not having the due and right impoſition of the hands of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, though in this as in many of his other opinions hee was very much miſtaken: for thoſe that impoſed hands upon the Miniſters

at their Ordination, were Presbyters. Yet I ſay, they can urge this place for their advantage againſt us, and therefore I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why wee alſo may not much more make uſe of it againſt them, it being Gods owne inſtitution, and to be perpetuated to the worlds end in all churches; ſo that whereſoever this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Impoſition of hands by the Presbyterie is wanting in any church, that church cannot be truly ſaid to injoy al Ordinances within it ſelfe; for there is an impoſſibility of obtaining or injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Ordinance of Ordination of Officers, by the Impoſition of the hands of the Presbyterie, and that often in their new ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered churches, not onely in the beginning of them, and in their firſt conſtitution (as I ſaid before) but at many other times alſo, and that by reaſon of the death and mortality of their Elders, or when but one of them remaines alive, which frequently happens amongſt them, as daily experience teacheth us, ſo that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie <hi>they muſt crave the helpe of other churches, and therefore in all theſe respects are Dependent;</hi> for not any one Elder alone, and by himſelfe can ordaine an other, there muſt be more together for that imployment; for it muſt bee done by the impoſition of the hands of the Presbyterie if it be juſtly done and according to Gods appointment; that is, of many Presbyters as the word imports.</p>
               <p>And if wee take a ſurvey and view of all the Primitive and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall churches, as that at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> of <hi>Philippi, Epheſus,</hi> and the other Aſian Churches, wee ſhall find in them all, an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Presbyterie (as I have abundantly proved) many Elders and Paſtors in each of them, appointed over them to govern and rule them in common, and all thoſe ſeverall Presbyteries had in each of them the power of Order and Juriſdiction, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of impoſing of hands, and ordination of Elders and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers within themſelves in their reſpective Presbyteries, ſo that they were as ſo many Corporations or Committees, having their Preſidents and Chaire-men, with all other Officers amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that in abundance, as the Scripture relateth, as in all well ordered Corporations at this day it is to bee ſeene; ſo that if any one or more of their Presbyters or Officers dyed within their ſeverall preeincts, they did by vertue of their ſeverall Charters preſently goe to the Ordination of new ones, and of as many as they had need of, of which they had ſtore and choyce for the moſt part, as all well ordered Corporations at this day have, who if their

Preſidents dye or any of their Aldermen, or any of their Common Councell, or any of their other Officers, they forthwith make election of others, out of ſome of their Free-men, or of men well knowne to them for ſufficiencie, wiſedome and diſcretion, and all other abilities, without having recourſe to any other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations; for they are armed with authority within themſelves for this purpoſe, and they have uſually choyce enough of men fit for their imployments; and ſo it was in the Apoſtolicall and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches, who collectively taken, were all collegiatly and claſſically governed, and depended upon their ſeverall Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries in their ſeverall juriſdictions, which if they had beene ſingle congregations only, as the Independents would perſwade the deluded people, they could never have done, for the many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons both now and in the foregoing Diſcourſe ſpecified. So that I am conſident, it ſufficiently now appeareth to any rationall man, <hi>that no particular Congregation can injoy all Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances within it ſelfe, without Dependency upon others, there being an impoſſibility of it ſelf.</hi>

               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the other Ordinance of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which cannot in any particular congregation be injoyed without it be Presbyterated, to uſe their owne expreſſion; that is to ſay, except it have their Presbyters and Elders, and Church Officers within it ſelfe annexed to it: for they amongſt the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, that hold <hi>that excommunication muſt be inflicted by the votes of the whole Congregation,</hi> underſtand it then onely to be a compleate and formed Church, and to be an entire and a whole congregation, when it conſiſts of their Elders &amp; their other Officers, as well as of the people, and affirme, <hi>that the people without the Elders cannot excommunicate any, nor the Elders without the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and they of the Independent party on the other ſide (for they doe not all agree amongſt themſelves in their Church government) which hath retarded the bringing in of their new nodle, leaſt that by it they ſhould looſe many of their Diſciples and Followers which they well know would ſoone breake of, if they ſhould not humour them in their new mould; and therefore they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly juggle with the people and faine pretences, when indeed if they had meant Chriſtianly and honeſtly, they would long ſince have brought in their new noddle of church government; but fearing what would inſue, and which would not be for their

profit and honour, they have hitherto made delayes to the great diſturbance of Church and State, and the ſeducing of many; but I ſay thoſe of the congregationall way, that hold that this Ordinance of Excommunication belongs unto the Elders onely, and put it into their hands, excluding the people from their votes, and that for many inconveniences as they ſuppoſe which are not yet removed, for all that, as will by and by appear, yet I ſay on all ſides they agree, <hi>that without the Presbyters conſent none can be excommunicated be they never ſo ſcandalous, ſo that ſo long as any congregation is without their Presbyters and Officers they cannot injoy this Ordinance alſo, neither can they ordaine them within themſelves without help from other Churches,</hi> as I ſaid before, and therefore they want this Ordinance till their new ſupply, and that they muſt crave from other churches when their officers are dead, and therefore of neceſſity they muſt ſtill be Dependent; but now let it bee granted, that when their church or congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is againe recruted and made up againe, or presbyterated and compleate in reſpect of both Officers and Members, and that it conſiſts of ten, twenty or thirty, or it may be of a few more, which is a pretty full church and congregation amongſt them, what inconveniences, and them of dangerous conſequence, would forth with inſue upon it; yea under how intolerable a yoake of ſlavery would many oppreſſed Chriſtians by this meanes groan under, when at any time they are unjuſtly and wrongfully inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them? for there is no appeale from them to any other Court or Church-Tribunall for redreſſe or reliefe: let them be never ſo much wronged, or injured, or damnified by them; For if the formidable ſentence of excommunication paſſe once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any perſon, be it right or wrong, they throw and caſt him out of communion not onely amongſt themſelves, but the whole viſible catholick Church, and deliver him up to the devill; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this ordinance of excommunication be once inflicted upon any Member by the whole congregation (as ſome of the II-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents would have it) or by two or three Presbyters only as others contend, the miſery and grievance is never the leſſe, nor the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience (and that of dangerous conſequence) the leſſe avoidable as will dayly appear: for if all the congregation paſſe this ſentence, many of the Members who have their votes, are private men, and for the moſt part unlearned and unexperienced, through want of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48122:217"/>
yeares, parts, education and breeding, and not able to underſtand the nature of the allegations and probations, they being many times ſo intricate, ſo that they can never be able to apply the rule unto the caſe for the inflicting of a juſt cenſure, and may be in danger alſo to bear a peculiar hatred or ill will unto their perſons, and ſo apt to be ſwayed by their paſſion to do unjuſtice, or may be over-awed by fear or threatnings of ſome other in the congregation who are the enemies to the party in queſtion, ſo that they being powerfull men, rich in eſtate amongſt them, and they being poor and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent people whoſe dependency may be upon them as they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther children, ſervants, workmen or tenants, of which moſt of the congregations conſiſt, and they daring not diſpleaſe them, eſpecially if they be their friends, as many times it happens for all or any of theſe reſpects, I ſay they going with the ſtronger ſide may paſſe this ſentence of excommunication againſt him moſt unjuſtly, as it often happeneth; &amp; this muſt go for currant if the moſt voices carry it, and from them the party unjuſtly dealt with hath no appeal: but if they be obſtinately bent againſt him, muſt live and dye in this condition under this heavy doome, which I beleeve in every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding mans judgement will ſeem an intolerable inconvenience, for there is no appeale from them. On the other ſide be it granted that the Elders onely of this particular congregation have the power of excommunication in their hands, they are not ordinarily above two or three, and many times none of the learnedſt, wiſeſt and honeſteſt men that ever were borne, and therefore are lyable and in danger of the ſame temptations that the other were, becauſe of particular relations, and their dependence on their congregation for their maintenance and ſupport: who they ordinarily dare not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe: for they know the fickleneſſe of the people and how little a thing will diſguſt them and alienate their affections from them, which would be a cauſe alſo of withdrawing their contributions and ſupplies by which they ſupport themſelves and their families, and commonly when any rich and great man falls of from a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter though he be never ſo faithfull and diligent in his place yet he will withdraw many, yea of themſelves the unſtable people will take occaſion by others example to ſlight and neglect their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as hourly experience teacheth us; for, humor not them in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing and they are gone. Yea but publickly or privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for their malverſation or for any erroneous opinion

they hold, and they will become your ſecret, if not your open enemies, and upon the leaſt occaſion be ready to ſide with any to do their Miniſter a diſpleaſure, which when their Miniſters well know, they are very fearfull of offending any, eſpecially their more weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and abler Members; beſides we know upon what ſlender oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions differences many times do ariſe amongſt neareſt friends, when it concernes their profit or reputation, or their judgement in things of their eſtates or religion; for if you jumpe not with them in their opinion in all things, they ſtand at a diſtance; or hinder them in the leaſt thing but in their gain and profit, and they will beare a ſecret grudge unto a man and wait an opportunity to do him a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and to be even with him; and this every man knowes is the practice of moſt men; ſo that for any of theſe reaſons men will be ready to harbour a diſpleaſure againſt any Member, and if hee be called in queſtion for any conceived miſcarryage or ſcandall or for any different opinion, and this come once to banding and debate in the Church or Congregation, and there be ſiding on both ſides, and parties made on each ſide, ſo that they grow into a heat, the Miniſters and Presbyters in their ſeverall Congregations are by this meanes brought into many ſtraights, not knowing what many times to do, as not daring to diſpleaſe either ſide, which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their private judgment leads them; but ordinarily it is obſerved, <hi>That the Miniſters will go with the ſtrongeſt party and will gratifie that, and that for their own emolument and private intereſt;</hi> neither is this all, but the Presbyters and Miniſters themſelvs in their Churches many times are ſubject to the ſame paſſions and affections as I ſaid before, that other men are, and for ſome ſecret and private grudg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſon in queſtion they may uſe the extremity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſentence of excommunication againſt him, which when it is once paſt, there is now no remedy of appeal left unto him, be the unjuſtice or wrong never ſo great; and preſidents of this nature there are many to be met with in the congregationall Churches, as I ſhall if occaſion ſerve be able to prove. What a ſad condition therefore are ſuch poor oppreſſed men in when this formidable ſentence is once paſſed againſt them; and when it lies in the breſt of a two or three Presbyters amongſt them? and what a horrid yoke of bondage do miſerable men by this means by their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubjection bring upon themſelves through their wilfull giddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when they yeeld to ſo unwarrantable a government as to

ſtand to the verdict either of a little ignorant congregation or of two or three men that are ſubject to the ſame temptations that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are? and then to be without all help or hope of reliefe be they never ſo much injured by them.</p>
               <p>But let it be ſuppoſed and granted that a ſlender Congregation of people or thoſe two or three Elders in every one of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were as fre from infirmities and temptations as Angels, which they are not, <hi>yet the weightineſſe and ſolemnity of the cenſure requires to be performed by a whole Councell and Colledge of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Elders of a combined Preſbytery which is Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> as I have abundantly evinced: ſo that it being paſſed not by the votes of a few people or by the voice of two or three Elders only; and they lyable to ſo many temptations alſo; but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynt agreement and conſent of a great Presbytery free from any ſuch temptations and exceptions, it may be done with the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and combined authority, and be more dreadfull to the party, and be the better accepted and ſubmitted unto without heart burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grudging againſt either the Congregation or particular El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or fear of revenge.</p>
               <p>But will ſome ſay, <hi>How if this whole Colledge of Elders ſhould erre in their conſure and do iniuſtice, for ſome of the above mentioned reaſons, what remedy or reliefe then has the iniured perſon offended by their cenſure?</hi> For anſwer, he hath the benefit of his appeale to a higher Presbytery or Claſſis; &amp; if wronged there, he hath the benefit yet of appeal to a higher Presbytery and Claſſis; and if he have no releife there, yet he hath the benefit of an appeal to a Synod, which is Gods Ordinance alſo; ſo that he hath ſtill hope of reliefe and he ſtill in Gods way; and ſo long as there is hope and he takes a right courſe, he needs not diſpair, and if at one time he finde not redreſſe in one Presbytery nor in one Synod and Councell, he may in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is good ever to wait upon God in his Ordinances; for in ſo doing we have a promiſe of a bleſſing, and here is alwayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and expectation of reliefe, and this is not onely Gods method, but the cuſtome of all Nations and Kingdomes for the well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing of them and for the redreſſing of grievances and abuſes; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke of the ſecond branch of their definition in diſcovering the abſurdities of it, and the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48122:219"/>
of attaining ſuch a church as that ſets down, and the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, with the unſupportable bondage that would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily enſue upon it to all ſuch as ſhould ſubject themſelves to ſuch a Government as the Independents would bring into the world.</p>
               <p>I now come to the third part of their definition, <hi>viz. Their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular explicite holy Covenant,</hi> which they not onely call <hi>the form of a Church,</hi> but make it an <hi>holy Ordinance,</hi> which it cannot be for the reaſons above ſpecified, as having no warrant from God our father, nor no example in any of the primitive Churches, who had no other but the generall Covenant, which all the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians allow, as it is authorized by God himſelfe, though they reject that particular explicite Covenant brought in by the Independents, as being an humane Ordinance, which all Chriſtians in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ought to abhor, as not commanded and injoyned unto them by the King of his Church Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>whoſe voyce onely they are bound to hear, and who alone they are to ſet up as King upon his Throne, who is their Lawgiver and mighty Councellor, and the ſole governour of his Church and Kingdome.</hi> And ſhould it be accorded and granted to the Independents, That this their particular expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Covenant were indeed the forme of a Church, as they would perſwade the people, then all the primitive and Apoſtolicall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as well as all the reformed Churches at this day in the world beſides their own congregations, were not true formed Churches, which were a great wickedneſſe and impiety to aver and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>But beſides this their unwarrantable Covenant which they make <hi>the forme of a Church,</hi> they require of all ſuch as will enter into Church fellowſhip with them, many other pretty things, which they hold not onely requiſite, but Gods Ordinance alſo; as,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they ſhould walk ſome weeks, moneths, and perhaps years, with them for a proof of their converſation, and for the tryall of their behaviour and manners, and except they can pleaſe the whole church, there can be no admittance at laſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after their good liking of their carriage, they injoyn them to make a publike confeſſion of their faith; and if that diſlikes them, they cannot be admitted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, after this, they require of them to bring in the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their true converſion, as the time when, the place where, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48122:220"/>
the manner how, all which if the congregation approve not of as ſufficient, they cannot be yet admitted.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they that are to be admitted, muſt have the conſent and approbation of the whole congregation both of men and women, or elſe by their Charter they cannot be admitted into Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them. All theſe things as I am able to prove, they require in ſome of their Congregations, before any can be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as joynt members amongſt them; never a one of the which conditions or injunctions not withſtanding hath either precept or preſident for it in all Gods holy Word. And therefore it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable flavery that they impoſe upon the people, beſides this their particular explicet covenant, which they make the form of the Church, which ſhould they onely require, without any of their o'her grolleries, were a bondage too unſufferable; for in that their Covenant, as I have been informed by ſome of them, when in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar manner, and in the time of our friendſhip, I deſired to know the method of admitting of their joynt members, and eſpecially what the Covenant imported, and what they promiſed in it, and what by it they were tyed unto, and for anſwer they replyed, <hi>that three things were contained in this their holy explicite Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they promiſe and by this Covenant binde themſelves to each other in all Church fellowſhip, as to be helpefull one to another in all things, and eſpecially to their Pastors, and to ſtand one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without deſertion of each other, and that in the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and difficulties, and to yeeld obedience and willing ſubjection and conformity not onely to thoſe truths that are now imbraced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained amongſt them, but alſo willingly to ſubmit themſelves to all ſuch New Light for the future, that God ſhall by his Word and by the Ministry of their Paſtors diſcover unto the Church. <hi>This as I have been informed by the Independents, is the firſt thing they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thoſe that are to be admitted as members, and which they promiſe and Covenant to performe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond thing contained in the Covenant, is,</hi> That if they be ſingle perſons either batchelors or maidens, widdows, or widdowers, they may not marry without the conſent of the Church.</p>
               <p>The third thing contained in this their holy Covenant, is, <hi>That they may not remove their habitations and dwellings, though never ſo advantagious unto them for their traffick and tradings, into any remote place from them, without the conſent of the Congregation,</hi> and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48122:220"/>
ſome other things there are compriſed under this Covenant, which they keep among themſelves as <hi>arcana regni</hi> as ſecrets of their Kingdome, all the which if they be ſeriouſly looked into, contain in them ſo many myſteries of Iniquity; yet all of them exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantageous unto themſelves, they all tending to the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their partie, and the more corroborating their combination, as thoſe that are judicious have well obſerved.</p>
               <p>But were there no other ſlavery and bondage, in their whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but this of their covenant and of the appertinances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, as amongſt others, their blind obedience, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet a greater yoak of ſervitude put upon poor people under Antichriſt himſelf; and the truth is, as the Papiſts oft times, ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over old holy dayes with new ceremonies and ſolemnities, and put them upon the people to be obſerved as new ones; even ſo the Independents furbuſh over old errors with new varniſh, to make them more ſpecious to the deluded people, and bring them in as new truths, and ſet them up as new Lights, when they are nothing elſe but ancient errours, and very Popery it ſelfe in a new attire, as is apparent to any that will not wilfully put out their eyes. In the time of the Prelates raign, every ceremony they brought in was excepted againſt as a human tradition, and that worthily: and every invention and tradition of man was rejected as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and will-worſhip was abhorred as Antichriſtian; and to ſerve God by the precepts of men, and by a ſervice eſtabliſhed onely by humane authority, was rejected as a thing diſpleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and thought unſufferable; and to have Prelates ſet over them to Lord it over Gods heritage was thought the higheſt point of tyranny; and for the removall of them root and branch with all their trumpery and appertinances, all the Independents themſelves, with the whole city and the greateſt part of the Kingdome, petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the great Councell of the Kingdome; and not onely ſo, but many of them have ventured their lives in the juſt defence of their Chriſtian libertie, and have offered their eſtates and expoſed themſelves and theirs to greateſt dangers in this good quarrell, which will ever be to the immortall honour of them all to all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, and they will be an example to other Nations to do the like. Yet behold every one of theſe things revived now and brought in amongſt the ignorant people, and contended for with all ſeverity and eagerneſſe, as for the Oracles of God, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48122:221"/>
ding they are but the inventions of men, there being neither precept nor preſident for them in the whole Word of God, nor any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of them in any of the Apoſtolicall and Primitive Churches: and therefore it doth neceſſarily follow, That their whole ſervice and Diſcipline with all their concomitants are but their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, for which there is no warrant or pattern in the whole Word of truth; and as for their Miniſters and Paſtors, both in New <hi>England</hi> &amp; in their new Congregations here they Lord it over the poor people, in as high a manner (as can be proved) as ever the lordly Prelates did, in reſpect of their ſupercilious behaviour; and yet the people ſwallow all theſe things as Gods Ordinances, and bind themſelves by their unholy Covenant to obſerve them, which in any underſtanding mans judgement, that knows what his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus having briefly diſcovered ſome of the errors of their definition and ſhewed the abſurdities of it, and the inconveniences of ſuch a Church as they would have, and evinced alſo, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, there has never yet bin a true formed Church on earth, and that all the congregationall Churches, if they will be included within the compaſſe of that diſcription, they muſt neceſſarily be Dependent; I will now come to my laſt and main concluſion, which is to prove that none of the Churches of the Congregationall way are true Churches, as not conſiſting of all viſible Saints, and therefore not to be communicated with in holy things: which I ſhall do from their own argument. For thus they diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Aſſemblies <hi>(ſay they)</hi> or Churches, in which the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not viſible Saints, called out of the world and united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into their ſeverall Congregations by an holy Covenant to worſhip the Lord and to edifie one another in all his holy Ordinances, they are no true formed Churches according to the New Teſtament forme, and ought not to be communicated with in holy things, but are to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from, unleſſe they will be made companions with ſuch kinde of Saints as <hi>Job</hi> would not ſet with the doggs of his flocke, being tagg ragg, with whom godly ſoules can no more converſe then with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, the Parochiall Congregations through the whole Kingdome</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:48122:221"/>
                  <hi>are ſuch.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they are not true formed Churches after the New Teſtament forme, and ought not to be communicated with, unleſſe &amp;c. This is the Il-dependents doctrine they teach their Diſciples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Churches, as appeareth in all their Pamphlets, as in that of</hi> I. S. <hi>and my brother</hi> Burtons <hi>eſpecially, and this is one of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital arguments which they uſe, to maintain their ſeparation from us; and upon which they ground the gathering of their new Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the futility and vanity of the which every one that ſhall but vouchſafe to read this book ſhall finde in many places diſcovered. I will therefore in this place, make uſe of the ſame againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to prove that their Churches and new gathered congregations are not true formed Churches after the New Teſtament forme, as not conſiſting of all viſible Saints, and therefore not to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with in holy things as the ſeverall inſuing arguments will declare: which I deſire the Independents themſelves would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice ſeriouſly conſider and ponder, that they may the better diſcern into the errors of their wayes, and in time repent of all their unrighteous and uncharitable dealing towards their brethren. I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Churches and Congregations, the Members of the which are not viſible Saints, called out of the world and united together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſeverall Aſſemblies by an holy Covenant to ſerve the Lord in all his holy Ordinances, but are joyned together in a wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy and combination againſt the people of God and his Ordinances and to hinder the reformation of the Church: they are no true formed Churches after the New Teſtament forme, and the Members of them are not true viſible Saints and therefore ought not to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with in holy things, but to be ſeparated from. But all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Congregationall way are ſuch: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not true formed Churches after the New Teſtament forme; and therefore by their own doctrine, not to be communicated with in holy things, but to be ſeparate from, and that for the ſame reaſons the Il-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents falſly pretend they ſever themſelves from our publique Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>The Major of this Syllogiſme is their own, and therefore they cannot gainſay it; the Minor therefore being proved, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will neceſſarily inſue. And as for the Minor, I thus evince it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Minor,</hi> that the churches and aſſemblies of thoſe of the congregationall way conſiſt of Raylers, Revilers, Slanderers, and covenant-breakers, &amp;c. it is evident and well knowne to all ſuch as are acquainted with the practiſe of the Independents, and are verſt in their doctrine, and have read their Pamphlets, which conſiſt chiefly of errors, untruths, and right-downe raylings, as amongſt others, thoſe of my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Lilburne,</hi> not to mention the Pamphlets of all the other Independents, the very names of which would make a booke, in all the which there is little other but rayling and dangerous novelties. Some of my brother <hi>Burtons,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Lilburnes</hi> expreſſions, with an other or two more which write in the name of all the Independents, I will produce, that by the mouth of two or three of their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the truth of their proceedings in their Raylings, Errors and Lyes, and bad practiſes may be yet more evident. My brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in his Vindication hath theſe inſuing words againſt all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, both Miniſters and people: and firſt againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

               <p>
                  <hi>And here</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I challenge our brother for taking Chriſts name in vaine, when inſteed of finding Chriſt ſet upon his Throne in their congregations,</hi> we find <hi>there no more but an Image, ſuch as</hi> Michal <hi>had made up inſteed of King</hi> David; <hi>or as thoſe that in mockery made of Chriſt a Pageant King, ſtripping him, and putting on him a ſcarlet Robe, and on his head a Crowne of Thornes, and in his hand a reed, ſaluting him with Haile King of the Iewes,</hi> with which title over his head they crucified him; therefore (ſaith he) thoſe paſſages quoted out of <hi>my Booke will ſtand good againſt their oppoſers.</hi> Theſe are his words againſt all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Now of all the people that are not of the congregationall way, and of their new Aſſemblies, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> in his Vindication hath theſe words, <hi>Wee exhort them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſet up Chriſt King in their hearts: Wee exhort them to become and profeſſe to be thoſe Saints of whom Chriſt is King, for hee is King of Saints,</hi> Revel. 15. 3. <hi>but they will not beleeve us</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>they will not depend upon Chriſt as the only Law-giver and King over their conſciences.

               <p>My ſecond Argument is this:</p>
               <p>Thoſe Congregations and Aſſemblies whoſe Members contrary to the example of all the holy Prophets and Servants of God, who were ever humble in their own eyes, continually, falſly, and phariſaically and upon all occaſions boaſt themſelves of their owne righteouſneſſe (ſo much condemned in holy writ) calling themſelves the pretious and holy ſervants of God, the godly party, the praying people, the onely men of Gods right hand, the Saints, the generation of the Juſt, hating and deſpiſing their poor brethren, and are ever plotting againſt them, accounting them as Heathens and Infidels, and departing from them as more holy then they; all ſuch, <hi>I ſay,</hi> are neither viſible Saints nor good Daemons, as being by Chriſt himſelfe and the holy Scripture condemned and therefore are not true Churches after the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe Members ought to be all viſible Saints; but are mixt Congregations with whom truly godly ſouls ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in holy things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:48122:227"/>
But all the Congregations and Aſſemblies of the Il-dependents are ſuch as conſiſt of ſuch Members: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are neither viſible Saints nor good Daemons, and therefore ought not to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with in holy things, but to be ſeparated from, by all the truly godly ſouls.</p>
               <p>For the Major propoſition no man can deny it, now if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor be confirmed, then there is no man that will doubt of the truth of the concluſion; for that will neceſſarily inſue from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The parts of the Minor are theſe: The firſt,</hi> That it was ever the practice of all the holy ſervants of God, to be humble in their owne eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond,</hi> That God did ever condemne ſuch as juſtified them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelves and boaſted of their own righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third,</hi> That the Il-dependents do both falſly and phariſaically boaſt themſelves when they call themſelves the pretious and holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, the godly party, the praying people, the onely men of Gods right hand, the Saints and the Generation of the juſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth, <hi>That they do despiſe their Chriſtian brethren and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from them as being more holy then they;</hi> By all which they declare themſelves to be neither Saints indeed nor good Daemons, nor a Church or Churches after the New Teſtament forme, and therefore ought to be ſeparated from.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now prove all theſe parts in order beginning with the firſt, by which the concluſion will be the more obvious to every judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader, and I hope, to many of the Il-dependents themſelves if they will ſeriouſly and without partiality weigh all things: And for the evincing of that, I will begin with <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of all the faithfull, who ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Behold now I have taken upon me to ſpeake unto the Lord, which am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> Here we ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> had no high though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They had no proud conceipts of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, nor vaunted not of their holineſſe and ſanctity. Neither was <hi>Daniel</hi> in any other poſture, though a man greatly beloved of the Lord, <hi>chapter</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Yet he in the 9. <hi>chapter</hi> in the name of all the people humbly proſtrated himſelf, <hi>Seeking unto the Lord by prayer and ſupplication with faſting and ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>O Lord the great and dreadfull God, &amp;c. We have ſinned and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly and have rebelled,</hi> ver. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. And ſo we might run through all the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and finde all the Prophets and holy men of God ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their own vileneſſe, and never boaſting of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.

Beſides, the holy people of old, as <hi>Abraham, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Ioſhua, Cornelius,</hi> &amp;c. were ſuch as with their whole houſes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Lord, they would have none in their Families but ſuch as were of one and the ſame Religion, they would neither connive at, indulge or tolerate any Religion in their houſes, but that God had appointed, as all the holy Scriptures teſtifie, they at their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, and lying down, at their goings out and comings in, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. inſtructed their children and families in the ſtatutes and commandements of the Lord; they with their Men-ſervants, and Maid-ſervants, and the ſtranger within their Gates, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. tooke care that all of them under their roofes ſhould ſanctifie the Sabbath, and keepe all the commandements of the Lord; they thought it their duty and their place, to ſee that they ſhould ſerve the Lord with one ſhoulder, and with one lip, they left them not every one to the liberty of his owne conſcience, but according to the expreſſe rule exacted obedience from them, to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord: and this they eſteemed to bee the holineſſe well pleaſing unto God, not their owne fained conceits. Now in this thing alſo moſt of the Il-dependents are fayling in their duty, as can be proved, who leave their Families to their owne

                  <hi>Genins</hi> in the ſerving of God, ſo that they may goe whether they pleaſe on the Lords day, and bee of what Religion and Sect they like beſt; and therefore they follow not the example of the Godly Party, and holy Saints, and ſervants of God of old. In all theſe regards, and many more that might be ſpecified, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly evident, that thoſe Churches of the congregationall way doe not conſiſt of all Saints, as being but mixt aſſemblies as well as the congregations of their brethren that they ſeparate from, and therefore they are not the only holy people, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crucified unto the world, and the world to them, as the holy people of old were, when they are wholy for the world; and this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake concerning the firſt title they digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves with above their brethren, calling themſelves in all their preachings and writings the holy people, and godly party, whereas the truly holy people and Godly Party were ever humble in their owne eyes, and thought baſely of themſelves, counting themſelves wretched and miſerable ſinners.</p>
               <p>Neither doth the other title truly and onely belong unto them, when they call themſelves <hi>the praying people:</hi> for our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord Lord, ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven,</hi> but hee that prayeth according to his will, for ſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> aſſerteth, in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſe</hi> 14. <hi>this is the confidence wee have in him, that if wee aske any thing according to his will hee heareth us.</hi> So that it is not the meere praying of any people that will procure audience from God, but the praying according to Gods will; for Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>that men are not heard for their much babbling,</hi> for that is a thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto him, but in that they pray according to his direction and will; ſo that of neceſſity it followeth, they onely are the praying people properly ſo called, that in all their ſupplications and requeſts follow the rule ſet downe by Chriſt himſelfe the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet of his Church, and who knew beſt what the will of God was, and what the meaning of the Spirit of God was; for he onely it is, that muſt helpe our infirmities in prayer, for wee of our ſelves know not what to ask, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

And this is the duty of all parents and maſters of families, and this they are for ever tyed unto by the revealed will of God, and that they ſhould not ſpare their nigheſt allies and kindred that ſhould labour or indeavour to bring in any other Religion then that God hath appointed in his holy and bleſſed word: <hi>Den.</hi> 13. and this they that pray aright and according to Gods will, pray may be done to the end of the world, and that both they and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and all the families of the earth may continue to inſtruct their houſholds and families according to the commandments of God which is his revealed will, and that whatſoever ſhall hinder the doing of this will of God may be removed abominated and abhorred, as the toleration of all Religions will do, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended liberty of conſcience, as hourly experience teacheth us; for by this both the duties of the firſt and ſecond tables are neglected on all ſides: for neither fathers nor maſters of families can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme or diſcharge their duties, if a Toleration of all Religions ſhould once be ſet up; for then both ſervants and children, and the ſtrangers within their houſes, ſhould every one of them be left to the liberty of their conſciences without control<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, ſo that they may go whither they will, and imbrace what Religion or Hereſie they pleaſe; and therefore it concernes all men more earneſtly to pray for the ſetting up and eſtabliſhing of the onely true Religion, and the rooting out of all falſe and erroneous Religions; for in this they do according to Gods will: And they onely that thus pray, are the true praying people; But the Il<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>dependents pray that there own wils may be done, &amp; not Gods will; for they pray for a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Religions, and that againſt the revealed will of God who
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48122:234"/>
hath declared his will to the contrary: <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. Yea Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra: Rev.</hi> 2. ver. 12. &amp;c. 18. ſheweth his high diſpleaſure againſt them for but ſuffering and conniving at thoſe falſe doctrines that were taught amongſt them. Yea in this bleſſed prayer of Chriſt we are taught to pray not only that the will of God may be done on earth, but he farther addeth by way of example and for a patern of our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, that it may be done <hi>on earth as it is in heaven:</hi> Now all thoſe that are Chriſts Diſciples, know, that there is but one Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heaven, and one way of worſhip there, as there is but one God; they therefore that pray for a Toleration of all Religions as the Il-dependents do, are not the onely true praying people, ſeeing they would have the will of God otherwiſe done on earth then it is done in heaven; for in heaven there is but one Religion; and therefore they pray contrary to the will of God when they pray for liberty of conſcience and a Toleration of all Religions.</p>
               <p>Again the truly praying people are taught to pray <hi>lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evill;</hi> therefore they pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the toleration of all Religions, which is not onely a great temptation and an occaſion of evill, but the very ſourſe and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all errours, ſchiſmes, hereſies, and of all abominations, and of all the evills both of ſin and puniſhment, that can light upon any Church, Nation or Kingdome, as we may ſee by the example of the Churches of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> to the which the Lord ſaith, <hi>Repent, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee with the ſword of my mouth. And I will caſt her into a bed of great tribulation, and will kill her with death, and all the Churches ſhall know, that I am he which ſearcheth the reines and hearts, and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</hi> I ſay therefore from very good ground, that a Toleration of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions is not onely a great temptation, but the greateſt evill in the world, and would be a meanes of bringing plagues and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the three Kingdomes, and a diſtraction and diſorder amongſt all the people and a confuſion of all things; againſt all the which as ſo many temptations and capitall evills, all truly godly praying people if they will pray according to Gods will, ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly to put up their dayly ſupplications, as they deſire the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God and the removeall of his judgements, and in their ſo praying they do but their duty and according to the will of God:
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48122:234"/>
Therefore when the Il-dependents pray for a Toleration of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions under the name of liberty of conſcience, and labour for it, and hinder with all their power the ſetting up of the onely true Religion and worke of Reformation, and the ſetting up of ſuch a Government in Chriſts Kingdome, which is his Church as he hath revealed in his bleſſed will, and they have alſo covenanted to bring in, in their ſo doing they neither pray that Gods name may be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, nor that his Kingdome may come, nor that his will may be done, nor that they may not be led into temptation, and be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from evill; and therefore they pray not aright, and are not as they falſly boaſt themſelves the only true praying people; for they pray not according to Gods will.</p>
               <p>Now when thoſe Churches of the Congregationall way conſiſt of ſuch kinde of praying Members, it is apparently manifeſt they are a mixt Generation of men, and not the Generation of the juſt, nor the men of Gods right hand, which is another title they falſly and phariſaically alſo claime and challeng unto themſelves, as they did the former, as will by and by appear upon due examination and diſcuſſion of the true ſenſe of that expreſſion. For <hi>thoſe that are the men and people of Gods right hand properly ſo called,</hi> are ſuch, <hi>as with all their might ſtand up in defence of Gods true Religion, and earnestly contend for the faith once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> Jude 2, 3. and are not onely ever ready to lay down their lives for that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient faith, but with all their power to fight for it to the laſt drop of their blood, in oppoſition to all errours, ſuperſtition, hereſies, and all manner of falſe worſhip, and in oppoſing whatſoever is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of godlineſſe as a Toleration of all Religions is, which tends only to the bringing in of all prophaneneſſe and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Now the Il-independents deny, that they did ever fight for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Yea, I my ſelfe have heard many of them ſay, <hi>That it is unlawful to fight for Religion, and they profeſſed that when they went out with the ſword in their hands, they fought onely for the liberty of their conſciences, and for a Toleration of Religion which is a part and branch</hi> (as they ſaid) <hi>of the Subjects birth-right:</hi> All this I can with many more depoſe, and therefore they falſly arrogate unto themſelves that title <hi>of being the men of Gods right hand,</hi> which no more belongs unto them then the other enſignes and titles did: And as little right have they to the title of Saints and the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>
                  <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt) ſhall abide in thy Tabernacle, and who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill?</hi> that is to ſay, who are Saints indeed and the generation of the Juſt? For anſwer, the Holy Ghoſt, that beſt knew who were Saints indeed, ſets down the characters of true Saints. The firſt of which is, his upright walking; <hi>He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth uprightly</hi> (ſaith the ſpirit of God) This is a metaphoricall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſignifying the trade of a mans life, his cuſtome and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage in it, as when a man is ſaid <hi>to walk after the fleſh,</hi> it is as much in the dialect of holy Scripture as to ſay, <hi>He goeth on in his naturall condition and in his irregenerate ſtate, in his ignorance, blindeneſſe, wicked courſes and practiſes, and hath no work of grace wrought in his heart, nor any chang in his will and affections, nor in his whole frame of life and carriage, but he is the old man ſtill,</hi> Rom. 18. ver. 1. So <hi>to walk uprightly,</hi> in Scripture language, is, <hi>to walk after the ſpirit, to be regenerate, to be a holy and heavenly minded man, who doth all the actions of one borne again of the water and of the spirit, he makes the Law of God his delight, and ſquares his life and actions according to that rule and the direction of his bleſſed word, and he orders his life by that rule in all integrity, ſincerity and without hypocriſie, or any baſe or by-ends or wordly respects. He makes it his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with</hi> Enoch <hi>and</hi> Noah <hi>to walk with God ſecretly as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, in all manner of converſation, in his thoughts words and deeds, as if he were ever in the ſight and preſence of God, walking uprightly alſo towards men, carrying himſelfe juſtly towards all, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his main aime is to indeavour that the true worſhip and ſervice of God may be ſet up in his family, and whereſoever he hath power; hee declines not to the right hand nor to the left in matters of Religion, but keeps himſelfe ſtrictly to the rule and goes right on according to the direction of that: He halts not between two Religions or more, for he knowes how much that is diſspleaſing unto God,</hi> who ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people by his Prophet, <hi>Why halt ye between two Religions?</hi> That God cannot indure in any people, no more then he can indure the lukewarme <hi>Laodiceans</hi> that are neither hot nor cold, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different what Religion be ſet up, ſo they may injoy their caſe; all

They are not carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometimes this way with this wind of doctrine, and ſometime that way with that blaſt of opinion, but they walk right on, they ſet not a ſtep backward from their firſt love to Religion like the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Revel.</hi> 2. but paſſe forward toward the price and mark of their high calling with as great a zeal and fervency as at firſt, and hate all falſe wayes and erroneous religions, they perſevere in all the wayes of <hi>God</hi> and in the footſteps of all the Saints of old, and imitate all thoſe vertues and graces that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in the Saints and all the Churches; They cannot indure that any doctrine of <hi>Baalam, Jezabell,</hi> or of the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> ſhould be connived at amongſt them, or tolerated, or any other Religion but that which the Lord our <hi>God</hi> hath appointed and eſtabliſhed in his bleſſed word, and in that they walk and perſevere, they decline not in their love to it, they go not backward with <hi>Demas</hi> to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the preſent World,</hi> nor with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus;</hi> they will deny no truth of <hi>God,</hi> nor with any Hereticks innovate any thing in their Religion, but they walk uprightly to the marke of the high calling in Jeſus Chriſt: They ſtand not ſtill neither, nor make no pauſe in their way, but they are ever journying and in the action of well doing, going from ſtrength to ſtrength till they come to the heavenly Zion, they go on cheerfully in their Religion, yea they run the race ſet before them with patience, and that through thick and thin of all afflictions and perſecutions, and abate not their pace, caſting aſide every thing that preſſeth down, as the love of the world, the love of honours and riches, the love of pleaſures, the love of profits, the love of friends, and all earthly emoluments,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48122:236"/>
yea and the ſin that ſticks ſo cloſe unto them, all their hereditaty and inbred corruptions, yea they reject likewiſe all novelties in Religion, nothing can hinder them <hi>from walking uprightly in the old way God has appointed them to walk in,</hi> but in deſpite of all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments they not onely walk, but run the race, and the whole race ſet before them, <hi>Looking upon the author and finiſher of their faith Jeſus Chriſt, who for the glory that was ſet before him indured the croſſe, deſpiſed the ſhame, and is now ſet down at the right hand of God in heaven,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. He made that good confeſſion to the death before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> and witneſſed the truth; All they therefore that are conformable to Jeſus Chriſt and deſire to walk in his ſteps and that are Saints indeed and the generation of the Juſt, can never indure a Toleration of all Religions; for that is not <hi>to walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their God, nor after Chriſt example;</hi> for Chriſt whipt the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, and would not tolerate them but layd corporall puniſhment upon them for their evill doing, and preached againſt the Scribes, Phariſees and Saduces, and all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Sects in his life time, and after he was aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he wrote unto the Churches of <hi>Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproving them for ſuffering and tolerating amongſt them any other Religion <hi>then that he had appointed,</hi> and for but conniving at any novelties in Doctrine and Religion.

               </p>
               <p>Now whether therefore the Il-dependents by their practiſes can challenge this Character to themſelves, I leave it to the judgement of the learned, when they would have a Toleration of all Religions.</p>

                  <hi>But now to paſſe on to the ſecond Character of a true Saint,</hi> He that worketh righteouſneſſe, <hi>ſaith the ſpirit, they that make it their imployment to render to every one their due obedience and</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the higher powers, <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> Tribute to whom Tribute,

In a word, all that are Saints indeed in Gods repute,</hi> worke righteouſneſſe; <hi>they firſt give unto God his true worſhip and labour for the eſtabliſhment of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion onely that he hath appointed, they cannot indure the Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all Religions, neither will they connive at or indulge that any way of ſerving and worſhipping of</hi> God <hi>ſhould be permitted, where they have power and ability to hinder it, but that which</hi> God <hi>himſelfe hath commanded; for they know that that is not to work righteouſneſſe; for that is not to give</hi> God <hi>his own,</hi> For he appointed but one Religion, and that he challengeth for his own; <hi>ſo then,</hi> they that ſet up any other but that, or tolerate more, or allow of a Toleration of all Religions, they work not righteouſneſſe towards God; for that is unjuſtice and a thing highly diſpleaſing unto his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, as taking his right and authority out of his hand who is King of his Church, and ſubſtituting themſelves in his place, which is the greateſt injustice and unrighteouſneſſe in the world; <hi>and therefore all that are the true Saints indeed</hi> and the generation of the juſt, <hi>dare not attempt any ſuch unjuſt thing;</hi> for they work righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Again, the true Saints in like manner <hi>work righteouſneſſe towards all men,</hi> they yeeld all ſubjection to thoſe that are in authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and they give the Magiſtrates their due honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, yeelding unto them all the duties of obedience and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and veneration, and they yeeld unto the Miniſters and all their Brethren the duty of love and their true honour, and ſo are fulfillers of the law of <hi>God.</hi> They therefore that maligne their brethren and detract from their praiſes and hate them and ſpeak evill of them and of thoſe that are in dignity and authority, and raile of thoſe in the Miniſtry, and as much as in them lies endeavour to make them odious to the world by their daily traducing of them, and aſſuming the honour due to them unto themſelves, and all ſuch as do aſſent unto them in this their unrighteous dealing, they <hi>do not worke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> and therefore in <hi>Gods</hi> dialect <hi>they are not Saints indeed, nor the generation of the juſt:</hi> for it is great injuſtice to detract from any their due honour.</p>
               <p>Now I appeal unto the judgment of any intelligible man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48122:237"/>
or no thoſe that write defamatory books and daily utter injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reproachfull words againſt the great councell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, traducing them before all the people, and accuſing them of injuſtice, and of exerciſing a lawleſſe and an arbitrary government over the people, proclaiming them tyrants and as bad as <hi>Strafford</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop of Canterbury,</hi> and guilty of the ſame crimes, and that at pleaſure can impeach any of the <hi>Parliament</hi> and accuſe them to the people as traitors and ſuch as keepe correſpondency with the enimy, and are betrayers of their liberties, and thoſe that do allow of ſuch men, favouring them and incouraging them by their countenance or connivance, I ſay I appeal to the judgement of any <hi>whether they that do or aſſent to ſuch doings do work righteouſneſſe, when they do apparently tranſgreſſe the law of God in ſpeaking evill of their rulers.</hi> I am moſt aſſured that upon due deliberation they will acknowledge, <hi>that this is no righteous dealing:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt conclude, <hi>that they that work not righteouſneſſe are no true Saints, nor the generation of the juſt in Gods eſteem.</hi>

Now whether the II-dependents bee not guilty of all theſe dealings, I referre the Reader to all their Pamphlets, eſpecially to thoſe of <hi>Iohn Lilburn</hi> lately ſet forth, and thoſe of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> his <hi>Vindication,</hi> and his <hi>Vindicia veritatis,</hi> and their daily practiſes; and I am moſt aſſured if hee will but ſpend a day or two in reading over the writings and the ſermons of the Ill-dependents, they ſhall find little other then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous dealing of all kinds againſt both Magiſtracy, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and all their Presbyterian Brethren and Fellow-ſouldiers; For they ſlight them all, and make nothing of all that ever they have done; for all the Glory of all the famous victories they aſſume unto themſelves, and attribute the honour and glory of them to that Army <hi>they call the praying Army,</hi> as if none of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterian Souldiers either prayed or deſervedany ſhare in the honour of thoſe victories, when it is moſt certainly knowne, that amongſt the Presbyterian ſouldiers there are many thouſands that live as holy and godly, and that pray as devoutly, and earneſtly for all good ſucceſſe upon their undertakings, and for a bleſſing upon their indeavours, as any Independents in <hi>England,</hi> and are as dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of God as any of them; for with God there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, <hi>but every one that worketh Righteouſneſſe, Act.</hi> 10. <hi>of what nation ſoever hee be, God heareth him;</hi> yea, and it is well knowne alſo, that in the Army there is ten, if not twenty Presbyterians to one Independent; and all men know likewiſe, that many of them are experienced ſouldiers, whereas not twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them before theſe times ever ſaw the face of an enemy; and it is likewiſe acknowledged by all impartiall men, that they have ever fought as valiantly as any Independents, and have ſtood to the Battell when many companies of them ran away, as can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; notwithſtanding all theſe things, the Independents aſcribe the honour of all thoſe victories to their owne party, and ſay the Independents got this and that victory, and onely becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of their Colonels, and a few other Independent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders had the leading up of the Presbyterian forces, and they that under God did the worke, looſe their due prayſes amongſt the people, and the Independents arrogate the honour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (which is their daily practiſe) and in its due place will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: And therefore when the Independents doe upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48122:238"/>
derogate thus from their brethren the glory that belongs unto them, and aſcribe it to their owne Fraternity; and when they are culpable and guilty of the foregoing charges, they worke not righteouſneſſe; and therefore unleſ7s;e they timely and cordially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of all their unrighteous dealing towards God, and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this character of <hi>Saints and the generation of the juſt,</hi> will not belong to them; for the Saints indeed, and the generation of the juſt, worke righteouſneſſe, whereas the Ill-dependents worke unrighteouſneſſe. But now to paſſe on to the other characters: the third character of the Saints, and Generation of the juſt, is this.</p>

(ſayes hee) <hi>let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</hi> There were it ſeemes ſuch kind of creatures in his time, as made faire ſemblances of love to others in tongue and word, but did not really and in truth love their brethren, which he condemnes, for they ſpake not the truth in their hearts; all ſuch therfore as contrive all the miſchief they can againſt thoſe whom at every word they call brother and good brother, &amp; yet write whole bookes to the defaming of them, and killing of their good name, which is worſe then the murthering of their very bodies, <hi>they are ſo farre from being Saints, as they are like Cain that wicked one that ſlew his brother, ver.</hi> 12. all ſuch therefore as ſay one thing and practiſe the contrary, are double-minded men, and a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not of the juſt but unjuſt; for they ſpeake not the truth in their hearts: when therefore all the Independents in words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend love unto their Presbyterian brethren, and ſeeme to honour the Parliament, and the Scots, and their godly brethren the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and yet ſeeke by all meanes poſſible they can to render them all odious to the people, &amp; to baptize them into the hatred of all men, and write ſcurrilous and defamatory books againſt them all to this very purpoſe, and rejoyce at any evill that happens to any of them, or to heare of any breach or diviſion amongſt them, and labour to make it greater, and will not ſo much as pray with them, or pray for them, but have beene heard, in their publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations ſay, and that in their prayers, <hi>Now Father we ſhould come to pray for the Parliament and the Aſſembly, but they are not worthy the prayers of the Saints;</hi> thus they ſpeake unto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the Parliament and Aſſembly in their owne congregations, and will not vouchſafe them ſo much as their prayers, as can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be proved; and yet to the world they pretend they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Parliament and Aſſembly, and love all their Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an brethren, and wiſh them all happineſſe, when all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, words, and Pamphlets proclame the contrary; for it is well knowne, that the whole ſcope of moſt of their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is to traduce the Parliament and their government, and to make the Scots and all the Presbyters their brethren the moſt hatefull people in the world, as if all their indeavours were to bring the people under an unſupportable ſlavery, and a greater yoake of tyrannie then that of the Prelates: this is their very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in all their diſcourſe and writings; yea, often in their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

So that when they moſt court them, and faune upon them with the title of brother, and good brother, and ſhew them ſome outward courteſies, they had moſt need to take heed of them; for then they plot miſchiefe, and ſpeake not the truth in their hearts; and therefore the Ill-dependents are no true Saints, for they <hi>speake not the truth in their hearts.</hi> But to goe on to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther characters of the true Saints, they ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>verſe</hi> the 3. <hi>Back bite not with their tongue, nor doe evill to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor take up a reproach againſt their neighbour.</hi> In this verſe there are three other characters together of true Saints, as in the former ver.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48122:239"/>
give eare and credit to the calumnies and reproaches of profeſt Atheiſts in any thing they ſhall falſely report againſt any of their Presbyterian brethren, all ſuch in Gods dialect are no true Saints; <hi>for they that are Saints indeed, back-bite not with their tongue, they doe no evill to their neighbour, nor they will not receive a reproach againſt their neighbour, much leſſe againſt thoſe that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ſay, if it can be proved that the Independents make it their ordinary and daily practiſe, not only to traduce, back-bite, and doe evill, and receive a reproach againſt their fellow brethren, but doe all theſe evils alſo againſt thoſe that are in dignity and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and are made Rulers and Governours of the people, and over themſelves, it follows that they that doe all theſe evils, and all thoſe that aſſent unto them in their ſo doing, are not Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in Gods eſteeme; now that the Il-dependents are guilty of all theſe crimes, the many Pamphlets lately ſet forth by them, as thoſe publiſhed by <hi>Iohn Lilburne,</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and all the other ſcurrilous and libellous Bookes ſet forth by thoſe of that party, and countenanced by them doe ſufficiently witneſſe. And here I ſhall deſire of any man, ingenuouſly to tell mee, what it is to back-bite their neighbour, and do evill to them, and to receive a reproach againſt them, if ſpeaking defamatory words of them all, and writing and publiſhing of libellous Bookes againſt the great Councell of the Kingdome, and thoſe in authority, be not to back-bite their neighbour. Certainly ſuch words and books, as accuſe the Parliament of Injuſtice, tyrannie, and of exerciſing an arbitrary power over the people againſt <hi>Magna Charta, and the Petition of Right, and the priviledges of the ſubject,</hi> and make them all as bad as <hi>Strafford</hi> and the Prelate; and ſuch words, Pamphlets, and writings againſt the Houſe of Peeres and Commons, as tend to the defaming of them, and their juſt power and government, and to diſaffect the people againſt them, and to ſtirre up a faction againſt their juſt authority, and to make them odious to all men; and all thoſe, that either ſpeake ſuch words, or write or print ſuch Books and Pamphlets, and all ſuch as allow of ſuch words and Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, either by their ſilence or connivence, or approbation, or by buying and receiving of them into their houſes, or venting, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and publiſhing of them, and either prayſe or like of the authors and contrivers of them, and all ſuch as ſhall ſcatter and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48122:240"/>
ſpread ſuch books abroad, and ſhall releeve and ſupport ſuch men in this their evill doing by ſupplying and furniſhing them with moneys, or viſiting of them and petitioning for their maintenance and allowance in theſe their wicked practiſes, or by their ſilence fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them; all and every one of them may truly be ſaid, and that by divine and humane authority and by the very teſtimony of my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> to be ſuch as backbite their brethren, and they have all of them a great deal to anſwer for ſuch their doings before the righteous judge of the whole world, and in Gods dialect all ſuch as backbite their neighbour with their tongue and pen, are no Saints; for the true Saints <hi>backbite not their neighbour with their tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that it is the generall practiſe of all the Il-dependents to do this, I refer my ſelfe to thoſe Pamphlets above ſpecified and to their dayly Proceedings, their combinings and confederatings of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together for this very purpoſe; all which do ſufficiently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and declare unto the world as well as their dayly publiſhing through City and Country ſuch words and books as tend altogether for the defaming of the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the traducing of all their brethren; that it is one of their maſter pieces boldly to calumniate all men that ſomething may cleave and ſtick.</p>
               <p>Again, I demande of any man what it is to do evill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if plotting againſt the life and blood of their neighbours be not to do evil unto them, if making rents, ſchiſmes and factions in Church and State, and to vent and publiſh deſperate and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinions and open hereſies, all which are works of the fleſh leading men to perdition <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. I ask I ſay, of any man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the acting of all theſe things be not to do evill to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? And whether or no to violate all the laws of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon needleſſe and unwarrantable pretences, as to divide the husband from the wife, the parents from the children, the ſervants from their maſters, the ſubjects from their governours and them in authority over them, the people and ſheep from their Miniſters and faithfull Paſtors, and to labour for a toleration of all Religions in a State and Kingdome, yea in many Kingdomes, and by this means to bring confuſion upon them all: I demand I ſay, of any mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, whether the acting of all theſe things be not to do evill to their neighbours? And whether to ride and run from one end of the Kindom to another to ſeduce the people, and to do their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours a miſchiefe, and by tongue and pen and all manner of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48122:240"/>
language to wrong them to the taking away of their good name which is better then their life, be not to do evill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Again I demand of any ſolid Chriſtian whether the indeavouring the taking away all means of livelyhood from the Miniſters, as their tythes the onely ſupport of their families, and the making of them odious by their railing Pamphlets, and the hindring Reformation in the Church, and the breaking of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and covenants with their brethren to the prejudice of the whole Kingdom, be not to do evill to their neighbours? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raiſe up falſe and infamous reports againſt their brethren the Scots and them in authority, and to publiſh them in word and print be not to do evill to their neighbours? And whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of their brethren their very prayers, aide, help and aſſiſtance at any time, yea to pray againſt them and for their confuſion, be not to do evill to their neighbours? I ſhall here deſire of any ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Chriſtian to tell me whether the acting or doing of all theſe things or any of them or the conſenting unto them and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of them, be not to do evill to their neighbours? And I am moſt aſſuredly confident, that he will candidly acknowledge that the acting of all this is to do evill to their neighbour.</p>
               <p>Now that the Il-dependents dayly practice all theſe things, can be proved by a cloud of witneſſes, yea all their Actions and Pamphlets can teſtifie it, eſpecially the late conſpiracy of many of them againſt the life of that Honourable Gentleman Mr <hi>Speaker</hi> of the Houſe of Commons and many more of the High Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and their running and riding about to preach up their new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and hereticall opinions to the diſturbing of all order in Church and State for the ſeducing of the people; and their running riding and going from place to place to defame and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their neighbors, for the hindring of them from coming to any imployment by which they might have been uſeful in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the land of their nativity; all theſe paſſages I ſay can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt them; and innumerable preſidents more of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian proceedings againſt their breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n might be produced and may be proved by numberleſſe witneſſes, beſides their owne writings, that all of them do evill to their neighbours, and that this is the generall practice of the Il-dependents. Yea it is notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that there is ſcarce a meeting of them, whether in their feſtivities or in any of their ſolemn aſſemblings of themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48122:241"/>
gether, that they do any other great thing amongſt themſelves, but that that tends to the evill of their neighbours in word and deed, there ſcarce iſſuing any thing out of their mouths but injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words againſt them: Yea they cannot contain themſelves in the very open ſtreets and in the Churches from railing againſt their Chriſtian brethren, as can ſufficiently be proved; Yea let any Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian accidentally but come into their houſes, and they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and raile at him. And if all this be not to do evill to their neighbours, I know not what is to do evill unto them.</p>
               <p>Now in Gods dialect all ſuch as perpetrate any of theſe actions, are not Saints indeed: for the true Saints do no evill to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>The Il-dependents may not here pretend, that their Miniſters can preach and pray well, and that thoſe of their fraternity have many of them excellent gifts; for gifts are not ſufficient to make Saints, but grace is that that makes Saints; For Saint <hi>James</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> have ſufficiently proved That unto all the true Saints; for ſo in the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians ch.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Though I ſpeak</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>with the tongues of men and Angels, and have no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I am become as ſounding braſſe and a tinckling ſymball. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountaines, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burnt, and have not charity, it profiteth nothing.</hi> So that by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> all gifts are nothing without that grace of love. And Saint <hi>James</hi> in the ſecond <hi>chap.</hi> ver. 17. ſaith, <hi>That faith without works is dead,</hi> and that ſuch as ſhall not relieve and helpe their Chriſtian brethren in their neceſſities, their Religion is not ſo good as that of the devills, for they beleeve and tremble; for pure Religion and undefiled is <hi>to viſit the fatherleſſe and the widdow, and to releeve them in their neceſſities,</hi> J am. 1. therefore they that are ſo far from relieving their brethren and doing good to them and loving of them, as they do them all the evill they can, pretend they what they will, they are no Saints. Yea, Saint <hi>John</hi> alſo in his firſt <hi>Epiſtle</hi> ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifes;t and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the devill, whoſoever doth not righteouſneſſe is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother;</hi> For <hi>this is the meſſage that ye heard from the beginning, that we ſhould love one another, not as Cain</hi>

                  <hi>who was of that wicked one &amp; ſlew his brother;</hi> All they therefore that work not righteouſneſſe towards their neighbors, but do them evill and ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And here I ſhall take an occaſion to bring to the memory of the Il dependents ſome paſſages of their uncharitable dealing towards my ſelfe lately, that all men may ſee how unjuſt and partiall jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they are, and how they upon all opportunities will condemne any Presbyterian for that which they count a pleaſantery and an elegancy or matter of mirth in their own mouthes. The ſtory brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this.</p>
               <p>When the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> was in queſtion before the great Councell of the Kingdome, the high Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as if that ſupream tribunall had wanted either judgement or prudence and ſufficient underſtanding and knowledge for the tryall of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, or had wanted courage or reſolution or a minde to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute juſtice againſt ſo eminent an offender as he was, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding carryed on the whole buſineſſe with ſuch wiſdome and moderation and in ſo fair a way, as by which the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath gained an immortall fame to the worlds end; yet at that time thoſe of the Il-dependent party were the chiefe agents of all thoſe tumults at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> who made it their imployment day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to run thither to cry for juſtice againſt the Earle, abuſing him though then in the hands of authority, with all the reproachfull words that with the tongues of men could be uttered, as all the ſtanders by can witneſſe, deſcribing him from all the parts of his body, and from every one of them gathering ſome preſage of evill that ſhould firſt be acted by him, &amp; that ſhould finally bring him to an evill and untimely end, and this for the moſt part was the theam of all their ſpitefull diſcourſe concerning him as he was carryed both to and from the <hi>Parliament:</hi> Amongſt other of their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they ſaid, he looked like the belly of a toad and that his teeth ſtood in his head like a pot-fiſh, and that he was ſo rotten with the poxe, that if they could not by their clamours procure juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yet they comforted themſelves in this, that he could
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48122:242"/>
not continue long; for ſaid they he will fall apeeces he is ſo rotten with that noyſome diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other expreſſions they dayly and openly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>uttered againſt the Earle, ever affirming that he was the uglieſt man that ever they beheld.</p>
               <p>This language I can depoſe I learned amongſt them as never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard it in all my life from any man before that time; and they took no ſmall pleaſure in venting theſe words upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and they uſed them as the flowers of their rhetorick, and it was thought neither blaſphemy in them nor a lie nor any ſcurrility, neither were there any then of that fraternity ſo ſevere, as to think that any that uſed ſuch words could not have the leaſt dram of grace in them. But upon their clamours and through their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant inſolencies againſt him, I being one day at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> waited for his paſſing by that I might ſee what a hideous creature he was, that I might at another time ſay I had ſeen him, and in beholding of him I heard their uncivill and reviling ſpeeches againſt him, but obſerved nothing in his looks and perſon, but had his actions been as ſerviceable to the Kingdome as they were deſtructive to all the Kings Dominions and to himſelfe, there was nothing wanting in the man, either for perſon or courtſhip, or any other accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that might not have made him lovely and venerable in any part of the world. And I may truly ſay this of him, that he had more generoſity in his look then halfe the Il-dependents that ever I ſaw, were they put all together: but thus they did aſperſe him for his very looks and complexion. And in the ſame manner they ſpake of thoſe Cavaliers that accompanyed the <hi>king</hi> when he came to the Houſe of Commons to demand the five Members, of all the which they ſaid they looked like ſo many devills, furies and feinds from <hi>Orco</hi> and Hell it ſefe, and uſed all the odious expreſſions peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could imagine to ſet them forth: And of all the miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> they ſay they are belly-gods and ſuch as run from one end of the Kingdome to another to get preferment and to do miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>Now upon an occaſion not long ſince of a mutinous company of Il-dependents that ſought the life and blood of many honourable Members in the Houſe of Commons; and had entred into a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conſpiracy to that end, whoſe immaculate reputation notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they could not with all the breath of their calumnies in

the leaſt thing blaſt; I ſay upon this occaſion being cited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to appear at the Committee of Examinations about that buſineſſe, and coming thither I found ſuch a rabble rout of odd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that for the illneſſe of their looks, and the badneſſe of their complexions, and the manner of their behaviour, I never ſaw the like, or any man that was there that I talked with, as they are all ready to witneſſe, they being ſo rude and uncivill towards all, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards my ſelf, they being alſo ſuch a company of ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling fellowes, not one of ſix of them having a cloak to his back as if they had come only to make a tumult or an uprore, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had laid aſide all impediments that might have hindred their activity, as thoſe that ſtoned <hi>Stephen,</hi> that they might be the more nimble, left their garments in other mens keeping. When I ſaw ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ude a company, and hearing withall that they were of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and that they had combined themſelves together by ſwearing to take away the life of many in the Houſe of Commons, and that their buſineſſe might go on the better and with the greater ſucceſs, that whiles ſome of them were there acting of their parts in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly and tumultuous manner; others of them were in the city at a private Humiliation, a ſpeciall day being ſet a part to ſeek God, (as they ſaid) that they might have juſtice done againſt ſome of the Members of <hi>Parliament</hi> that were not favourers of the Il-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as <hi>Jezabell</hi> cauſed the Elders of <hi>Jezreell</hi> to call a Faſt when ſhee took away the life of poor innocent <hi>Naboth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This that <hi>I</hi> now ſay, was related unto me by one of that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that not long after went out of the room, who was the onely perſon I knew amongſt them all. But I not knowing the cauſe of ſuch a concourſe of uncivill people, demanded the reaſon of it, and it was replyed, that there was not a third part of thoſe that were to come up; for the whole city would appear there in that buſineſſe the day following, to demand juſtice againſt ſuch and ſuch as guilty of High Treaſon, but that now they were ſeeking God and in private Faſts, and that ſome were aſſembled in ſuch a mans houſe, naming the party. In this formall manner things were related unto me, as the righteous Judge of the whole world knoweth, all which proceedings I ſuppoſe was to do evill to their neighbours.</p>
               <p>Now when I had well viewed and conſidered all theſe men, and ſaw their complections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I in replying to that Pamphlet, in my juſt defence, thought it an abuſe of gravity to uſe it upon ſuch whibling Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and choſe rather by way of merriment to anſwer them, then ſeriouſly to ſpend time about them: and therefore calling to mind ſome of their owne expreſſions againſt the Earle of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> as that hee had got a blow with a French Coulſtaffe, and that hee <hi>looked like the belly of a Toad;</hi> and remembring alſo, what they had ſpake of the Cavaliers that came with the King to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they looked like ſo many Furies and Fiends out of Hell, and recollecting withall what they had often ſpake of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> how that they ran from one part of the Kingdome to an other to get Church preferments, and regarded nothing but their bellies, and ſought nothing but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving of the King himſelfe, and all the Gentry and Nobility of the Kingdome, that they might the more tyrannically domineer over all the people, and how they had polluted all the Church of God, with their idolatries and ſuperſtitions, and with all manner of heatheniſh and antichriſtian defilements and abominations, and remembring alſo many of <hi>Martins</hi> expreſſions againſt the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in his blaſphemous Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, as that of the <hi>Arraignment of Mr. Perſecution, and his</hi>

Eccho, <hi>and his Hue and Cry,</hi> the which Bookes were entertayned amongſt all the Independents, and read with great delight, they making themſelves upon all occaſions merry with them, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with thoſe expreſſions, wherein hee bringeth in all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and Maſter <hi>Simon Synod,</hi> with great ironteeth, and ſuch luxuriant tuſhes, as one might picke them with a Rowling-pin; and I ſay, I calling to my remembrance all theſe their expreſſions, (in which they greatly delighted, and pleaſed themſelves, when at any time they inveighed againſt the Presbytery, and ſtudied to make them all odious to the people, as they have done; in all which they have done evill to their neighbours;) thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to make choyce of ſome of their owne Rhetorick, which I did purpoſely to find out the humour of the Cattle, and that all men might ſee the partiality of the Independents, and indeed the vanity of all unſtable men in generall, who are won with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and loſt with a nut, and will prayſe and diſprayſe they know not for what, and one day commend that in themſelves which an other day they will condemne in any of a contrary mind, and at one time extoll a man for that which upon an other occaſion they will cenſure him for, with all manner of aggravations. The conſideration of theſe things, and with what diſguiſed aſpects, and hideous lookes, and odde complexions they appeared in all the roomes about the Committee, and how they grinned at mee with their teeth, made mee in the deſcription of them uſe the ſame expreſſions that they had formerly done of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the Cavaliers, and the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when both in their countenance and actions they paralleld them, and ſay they looked like ſo many furies, and like the belly of a Toad, and as if they had got a blow with a French Coulſtaffe, and that one might picke ſome of their teeth with a Bedſtaffe, all which were their owne expreſſions; and as they accuſed the Presbyters for belly gods, ſo they alſo were very ſenſible of good cheere, and that as the Presbyters had with their ſuperſtitions polluted the Church, ſo they did pollute them with their ſcummering and piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in them; and that as they ſought to inſlave the Gentry and Nobility, and the whole Kingdome; ſo the Independets if they could but once attaine the maſtery would doe no leſſe; and for this my ſo ſpeaking I had very good reaſon, being well acquainted with their language and dialect, having often heard ſome of them
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48122:244"/>
ſay, that the Gentry and Nobility had beene the cauſe of all the miſeries of the Kingdome, and that if they continued in their greatneſſe, wee might never looke for happy dayes; nay, it can be proved that ſome of the Independent Miniſters have made it part of their imployment, to run from one place to an other to preach their errors, and in their Sermons to bring the Gentry and Nobility into the hatred of the people, accuſing them as the cauſe of all our calamities, publickly declaming againſt them, as the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Gentry and Nobility in the world, ſaying in expreſſe words, that howſoever Noble-mens Mothers were knowne, yet their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were Grooms, or ſome baſe fellows, &amp; that they were nothing but droſſe, dreſſe, droſſe; and this they have ſpake in great and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Aſſemblies; all the which ſpeeches, if they tend not to make the Nobility hatefull to the people, and ſo by conſequence to the ruine and overthrow of them in time, I know not what can; and whether all this bee not to doe evill to their neighbours, I leave it to the judgement of others; and how many of the Independents have vilified the great Councell, let their bookes be examined and they will ſay I wrong them not in any thing, when I affirm they labour to bring in a confuſion of all things; yea, their words daily at the very Parliament dore can witneſſe that howſoever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to honour the Parliament, yet they do accuſe them of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and tyrannicall Government, and aſſert that the Lawyers in the Parliament have betrayed the Liberties of the ſubject, and this is their daily language, and that it may bee the better knowne, it is all extant in their printed Books, by all which they do evill to their neighbours. Now then if I, in my juſt defence made uſe of their owne expreſſions to ſet downe the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their wayes, and to diſcover their bad intentions, there was no juſt cauſe why any rationall man ſhould condemne mee for it, for <hi>ridentem dicere verum quid vetat?</hi> Now that the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents have ſo ſeverely cenſured mee cauſeleſſely for this, they ſhew they are altogether partiall and very unjuſt Judges; and whiles they doe the greateſt evill unto men, that can poſſibly by the malice of men be done unto them which no true Saints doe, <hi>for they doe no evill to their neighbours,</hi> as the Spirit of God ſaith; yet they will condemne others, for but making uſe truly of ſuch expreſſions (as they themſelves have falſely and cauſeleſſely uſed againſt others); for I in diſcribing of them and their proceedings

expreſt my ſelfe but in their owne dialect, and yet they fill the whole Kingdom with clamours againſt mee, for being but their ſcholler. The time was, when I writ my Letany for to make my ſelf and my fellow Priſoners merry in our bands, that when many grave men liked it in private, yet diſſwaded mee from making of it publick, that thoſe that are now the great Sticklers of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent party, againſt all the counſell of my grave friends, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to print it, proteſting, <hi>that they thought it would doe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates more miſchiefe then any booke that was ſeriouſly penned againſt them, and therefore intreated mee by all meanes, that I would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it; yea, they offered mee to ſet it forth upon their owne charges and coſts; and through their importunity they prevayled with mee to give them the copie, and it was printed, and liked ſo wel of by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they commended mee with all the prayſes men could extoll and magnifie a man with, as can be proved, and they have often profeſt unto mee, that they thought it was the beſt way of dealing with any enemies of the Church, and therefore I conceive that</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>uſeth ſo much of this method in his books.</hi> But indeed there have bin many, and grave Divines that have writ many merry and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant books againſt the Prelates in all ages &amp; nations, which have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their vanities more then any thing that was ſeriouſly writ, by which meanes many perſonages of eminent quality, as well as thoſe of low degree, have come to the knowledge of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the Papall Hierarchy, which had they beene ſeriouſly penned no man would have regarded; yea, the holy Prophets and divine Pen-men have made themſelves merry with the vanity of the falſe Prophets, and great men of their time, many preſidents of the which might be produced out of ſacred writ, <hi>ſo that there is no ſinne in writing pleaſantly againſt any ſuch as goe about to ſeduce and miſlead the people, and alienate them from their duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and their obedience to thoſe that are in authority, and from their duty and love to their brethren,</hi> all which are capitall evils, and which no true Saints will perpetrate.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, in this that the Independents did ſo well like of my Letany, and the merry paſſages in that booke, and are ſo highly offended at my mirth in my juſt defence againſt them, that are equally guilty with thoſe they moſt mortally hate, and in that they ſo harſhly accuſe thoſe expreſſions in my booke, which I have but borrowed from them, ſaying, <hi>that none that uſeth ſuch,</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:48122:245"/>
                  <hi>can have a dramme of grace in them,</hi> in all this they are very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and unjuſt Judges, and give unrighteous judgement againſt their neighbour, which is to doe evill to their neighbour, which all true Saints will not doe; and they may remember that the Lord in the 29. of of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> condemned <hi>ſuch as made a man an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a word:</hi> But of all theſe things in their due place, When I upon an other occaſion ſhall anſwer to the <hi>moderate checks,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhall make it appeare, <hi>had thoſe expreſſions beene mine owne, there had beene no blaſphemy in them,</hi> without it be eſteemed blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy with them, to compare a company of rude and rebellious wicked people to a good creature of God, when as the Holy Ghoſt compareth ſuch to a Dog <hi>returning to his vomit, and to a Sow wallowing in the mire;</hi> withall I ſhall then make it evident, that the conſpiracy of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> was not greater againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> then this confederacy of the Ill-dependents at that time againſt ſome of the honourable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Parliament. But letting paſſe their partiality in many other things towards their owne party, in whom they can ſee no ſinne, I will goe on to the other characters of true Saints indeed, as they are ſet downe by the Spirit of God: the third of which, in this verſe, is <hi>that they receive not a reproach againſt their neighbors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The true Saints,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>take not up a reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their neighbours,</hi> they will neither heare much leſſe entertain or receive an evill reproach or calumny againſt their neighbours, for they have learned better things out of Gods holy word, as in <hi>Exodus</hi> 23. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. where the Lord ſpeaking to his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all true Saints, ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not receive or rayſe a falſe report; put not thou thy hand with the wicked, to be an unrighteous wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Neither is there any thing more forbidden through the whole Scripture, then whiſpering, and tale-bearing, as all the <hi>Proverbes,</hi> &amp; indeed all the Propheticall &amp; apoſtolicall writings can witneſſe, <hi>ſo that all ſuch as either raiſe, or receive falſe reports, or reproaches againſt their neighbours, in Gods eſteeme, are no true Saints, but wicked men and unrighteous wretches;</hi> for ſo the Lord proclameth all ſuch; and a greater unrighteouſneſſe and ſinne towards men, there cannot be then to rob them of their good name, which is to them <hi>as a pretious oyntment, and better then gold or ſilver, or great riches, Proverbs</hi> 22. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> the 7. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. and hence it was that <hi>David</hi> compares the tongues of reproachfull
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48122:245"/>
men to Speares, Arrows, and Swords, and all inſtruments of death; for by their calumnies they wounded and murthered the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their innocent neighbours, and killed them whiles they were alive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the worſt of all mortall deaths: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Prophet though otherwiſe a valiant man, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, yet often profeſſeth, <hi>that they had brake his heart with their reproaches;</hi> and truly a ſorer affliction in this life cannot lite upon any men, then to bee wounded in their good name, and to have their due honours and prayſes taken from them, &amp; to be made vile amongſt the people, which is the greateſt of worldly evils, as all judicious and impartiall men will eaſily judge; for there is no fence or ward againſt calumnies in the ſchooles either of wit or art; and all ſuch as either rayſe ſuch reports againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or receive a reproach, and harbour any evill thoughts againſt them, and ſuch as tend to the wounding of their good names and fames, are all in Gods Dialect reputed no Saints; for the true Saints ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>take not up a reproach againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;</hi> for thus the Lord hath declared himſelfe in his holy word concerning all ſuch men as either <hi>raiſe or receive a reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their brethren,</hi> aſſerting <hi>that they are no Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the Il-dependents make it their dayly practice, not onely to receive reproaches againſt their ordinary neighbours and brethren, but againſt both the Magiſtrates, Miniſters and all their Presbyterian brethren both <hi>Scottiſh and Engliſh,</hi> as all the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets of <hi>John Lilburne</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all the other writings and words and the very Sermons of thoſe of the Il-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent party and all their proceedings do daily witneſſe, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evident that they are no Saints: For the true Saints and all ſuch as are Saints indeed, receive not a reproach againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Yea it is well known and can be proved that they hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproaches againſt their innocent neighbours, and will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertain into their companies, but even into their new gathered Churches ſuch infamous perſons as have been a ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to all their kindred, and ſuch as continue ſtill in their wicked and ungodly practices; and
onely for this, that they can impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly reproach their neighbours and raiſe an evill report againſt them; all this I ſay can ſufficiently be proved. Nay ſome of them have been heard ſay, when they have railed at and reviled ſome godly Presbyterian Miniſters that oppoſed the errors and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48122:246"/>
of the times, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were demanded what evil they knew by them, and what they could blame in their lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I ſay when this queſtion has been propounded unto them, they have replyed, this is the miſchief and ſpite of it that they are unblameable in their lives: then the which there could not be a more wicked, malitious and unchriſtian expreſſion, by which they declare unto all men that it troubled and perplexed them that there was no evill in their lives by which they might juſtly defame them; ſo that it is evident to all men that it is matter of rejoycing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Il-dependents when they hear of any failings in their Presbyterian brethren contrary unto the cuſtome and practice of the people of God and the true Saints in all ages; <hi>for they receive not a reproach againſt their neighbour;</hi> innumerable inſtances of this nature might be produced againſt the Il-dependents, but that their practices are ſo obvious to all thoſe that are acquainted with them, or but come in their companies; for a man ſhall not be half an hour in any of their ſocieties but he ſhall hear them either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the <hi>Parliament</hi> or their Proceedings, or inveigh againſt ſome of the Generalls of our Armyes, or ſpeak againſt the reverend Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines and againſt all the Presbyterians their brethren, or againſt the Scots; and all that they ſpeak of them or any of them, tendeth to their reproach or infamy, ſo that they do not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive reproaches againſt their innocent neighbours that live harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly by them, but they raiſe up reproaches againſt them and print them, yea againſt the whole city that has deſerved ſo well from Church and State, and only <hi>for that they deſire to keep their Covenant with their God, and which they have ſolemnly taken, lifting up their hands and hearts to the moſt high, and vowed to perform,</hi> which will be for their immortall praiſe; and yet <hi>for this cauſe onely and no wrong done or attempted againſt them,</hi> they can in the Great Court of the Kingdom &amp; in print alſo reproach them all and accuſe them of black choler, yea blackcoat choler, as if they were the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, rancorous and envyous wicked men in the world, which is ſo unſufferable a reproach againſt the great city of the Kingdome as yet before theſe our times never ſaw the light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if theſe men at their pleaſure will cauſleſſely traduce and that publickly and in print, men in authority and men that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo well from the Church of God and the whole Kindome,</hi> What may any man imagine will not theſe men do and plot in private
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48122:246"/>
to reproach their harmleſſe neighbours when they thus daringly and prodigiouſly reproach them in publick and that in print? <hi>So that I may conclude and that truly of them,</hi> Except they ſeriouſly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dailly repent of this their wicked dealing towards their brethren, this character of the Saints alſo will not belong unto the Independents; for the true Saints, neither raiſe nor receive a falſe report or reproach against their neighbours, nor aſſent to any that do either.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke of the three Characters of all true Saints indeed contained in the third <hi>verſe</hi> of this 15. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> There are yet other four in the inſuing verſes, three of which I will run over briefly, they being all things of practice and well known to all men: And they are theſe; <hi>In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned: and he honoureth them that fear the Lord: and he that ſweareth to his own hurt and changeth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Characters, is, <hi>to contemn a vile perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond is,</hi> to honour ſuch as fear the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third is,</hi> to ſwear to his own hurt and change not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe therefore that are Saints indeed, in whoſe lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation theſe three Characters are evidently viſible and apparent; and thoſe</hi> that either countenance vile perſons, and honour not ſuch as fear the Lord, or break their vows, promiſes and covenants with either God or men, <hi>they in Gods repute are not Saints indeed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they what they will, but are wicked and ungodly men and ſuch as bring down the wrath of God upon the place where they live: For as</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith,</hi> By the bleſſing of the righteous the city is ſaved, ſo by the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown. <hi>Prov. 11. ver. 11.</hi> Wicked and ungodly men are the cauſe of the ruine of Cities and Countryes; <hi>according to that of Saint</hi> Paul <hi>the ſecond of</hi> Timothy chap. <hi>3.</hi> ver. <hi>1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi> This know alſo <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that in the laſt dayes perilous times ſhall come; for men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Parents, unthankfull, unholy, without naturall affection, covenant-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traiterous, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures more then lovers of God, having a forme of godlineſſe, but denying the power thereof, from ſuch turne away: For of this ſort are they which creep into widdows houſes, and lead captive ſilly women laden with ſins, led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with divers luſts, &amp;c. <hi>In the which words, briefly we may take notice that the Apoſtle ſetting down the reaſon of the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſſe</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:48122:247"/>
                  <hi>and danger of the latter times, ſaith</hi> not that either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of wars, or pestilences, or famines, or earth-quakes, or inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or murthers, ſlaughters, and robberies, or for any ſuch calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the laſtdayes and times ſhall be perillous; but they ſhall be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous times, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> for that men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breakers, falſe accuſers, covetous &amp;c. <hi>So that</hi> ſelfe-love, covetouſneſs, falſe accuſations of their brethren and covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp;c. <hi>are the cauſe that makes</hi> times perillous and brings down the judgements of God upon any city and places where the Inhabitants are practicers of theſe ſinnes: <hi>And therefore the Apoſtle after he had forewarned all ſuch as fear God of the cauſe of all the evills that are comming upon the world, commands all the true Saints indeed</hi> to take heed of ſuch men, <hi>and in expreſſe words ſayes,</hi> from ſuch turne away; <hi>have nothing to do with ſuch,</hi> for all covenant-breakers and falſe accuſers, and ſuch as countenance vile perſons and honour not them that fear the Lord, and ſuch as keep not their word and promiſe with neither God nor men, are the cauſe of the perils and miſeryes that ſhall come upon the world, <hi>and therefore all ſuch are not Saints indeed, but ought to be abhorred and avoyded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of</hi> Solomon <hi>Prov. 4. ver. 14, 15.</hi> Enter not <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> into the path of the wicked, and go not into the way of evill men. Avoyd it, paſſe not by it, turne from it, and paſſe away. <hi>Here we ſee the wiſe man, as if he could never have given caution enough to all his ſchollers, by many reduplications of his words gives all the people of God a ſtrict charge</hi> not ſo much as to company with ſuch men: <hi>and that for the many reaſons ſet down in the following verſes; but this reaſon ſpecified by Saint</hi> Paul <hi>may ſuffice, who ſaith,</hi> That all covenant-breakers, and falſe accuſers and ſelf-ſeekers are the cauſes of perillous times: <hi>and ſo are all ſuch, in whoſe eyes</hi> a vile perſon is not contemned, and who honour not ſuch as fear the Lord, and who keep not their covenant and promiſe: <hi>For all ſuch are no Saints in Gods eſteem, and therefore a wicked generation of men and ſuch as make the times wherein they live perillous and dangerous, and therefore ought by all the true Saints and godly to be ſhunned and avoyded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it can be proved that the Independents be ſuch, <hi>as in whoſe eyes a vile perſon is not contemned, and ſuch as honour not thoſe that fear the Lord, and ſuch as keep not their word and promiſe neither with God nor man, but are notorious covenant-breakers, or</hi>

                  <hi>aſſenters to all ſuch perſons,</hi> then it will follow that <hi>they are not Saints indeed:</hi> For the Characters of the true Saints are <hi>to contemn a vile perſon, &amp; to honour thoſe that fear the Lord, and to keep their vowes and promiſes both with God and men;</hi> for not onely the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> thus deſcribeth the true Saints, but Saint <hi>John</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>By this men are known to be Saints if they love the brethren,</hi> by this ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall be known to be my Diſciples, that is Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if ye love one another:</hi> I ſhall therefore demand of any well grounded Chriſtian, <hi>Whether they beleeve that thoſe that run from place to place, and joyn with any wicked and ungodly men and ſeeke their advancement, &amp; that to places of the greateſt truſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and prefer them before ſuch as they dayly acknowledg to be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly religious, and will run from Committee to Committee, to do the moſt wicked and vile men and known Malignants any cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and will both in word, countenance and deeds favour and honour them;</hi> I demand I ſay, whether they think that in ſuch mens eyes as will do all theſe offices to wicked perſons and that in oppoſition to any of their godly brethren, and that will at any time joyn with any ſuch againſt either the godly and painfull Miniſters or their Presbyterian brethren to defame them or do them any miſchiefe or to remove them from their places and livelyhoods, or for the hindring of their preferments, yea and which is more for the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the work of Reformation in the Church: I demand I ſay of any truly godly Chriſtian, whether they think that in any ſuch mens eyes as do all theſe offices and courteſies to wicked and ungodly men, a vile perſon is contemned? when he dayly ſeeth the contrary that they honour them and prefer them <hi>before ſuch as fear the Lord;</hi> I am moſt aſſured he will conclude and affirme, <hi>That in their eyes a vile perſon is not contemned.</hi>

               <p>Now that this is the dayly practice of the Independents, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take upon my life to prove it by a cloud of witneſſes, and that there is not the vileſt perſon nor the wickedeſt wretch that they will not joyn with to do any of their Presbyterian brethren a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, &amp; that they will not give credit to in falſly belying their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; yea it can be proved, <hi>that when the Independents have been demanded by ſome godly and orthodox Ministers why they have left the publick Aſſemblies ſeeing there was now no ceremonies nor any thing in their doctrine that they could finde fault with,</hi> and they have replyed, <hi>That it was in regard that their Congregations were mixt,</hi>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:48122:248"/>
                  <hi>that tagg ragg and all ſorts of men were admitted to the Sacrament, with whom they could not joyne.</hi> Whereupon the Miniſters, that they might remove this ſcandall and offence, laboured by all means to perſwade the people ſo to behave themſelves as they might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt unto all men they were worthy communicants, otherwiſe profeſſing unto them that they durſt not adminiſter the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them; and therefore for ſome moneths abſtained from the publick adminiſtration of the Sacrament and uſed all their beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in that interim by their faithfull and painfull preaching and exhortations, to fit all men for the better receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that by this means they might gratifie their tender conſciences; I ſay in this interim of time it ſhall be proved, <hi>that theſe Independents, who thoſe godly Miniſters had ſuch a deſire to pleaſe, went unto theſe wicked and ungodly men that the Miniſters excepted againſt for their converſation as ungodly and prophane, and joyned with them againſt their Miniſters,</hi> ſaying unto them, <hi>What will you give tythes and maintenance to ſuch Miniſters as ſhall thus deal with you as to deny you the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper? ſurely were I in your condition, &amp; were I a Member of your Congregations, I would never own ſuch a man for my Minister, nor never give any allowance to any ſuch as would not adminiſter the Sacrament unto me:</hi> By which practices of theirs they have made thoſe painful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſo odious to the people by joyning with thoſe wicked var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots as they have not only deprived them of their livelyhoods and maintenance, but ſo perſecuted them with all manner of reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and evill language, as they have forced them to leave their places and to wander about the world to get themſelves a poor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the ſupportation of themſelves and their diſtreſſed fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; by all which proceedings if the Independents do not declare themſelves to be ſuch as countenance a vile perſon, and to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of thoſe that fear the Lord, I know not what ever any men did to deſerve thoſe Characters, by all which they proclaim them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be no true Saints, if the Lord himſelf knoweth how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Saints indeed: This that I have here related I ſhall by Gods aſſiſtance be able to prove by ſuch witneſſes as againſt whom there can be brought no juſt exception.</p>
               <p>And that all the Independents are notorious covenant-breakers, or aſſenters unto ſuch as violate their oathes and promiſes both to God and men, all the Kingdome can witneſſe for me, eſpecially
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48122:248"/>
thoſe Miniſters of the Reverend Aſſembly, with whom the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting brethren have brake all promiſes and ſolemne agreements not once but many times; ſo that it would be a needleſſe work to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate any further, in proving them to be <hi>no Saints indeed,</hi> when they manifeſt by all their practices that they neither <hi>walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor work righteouſneſſe, nor ſpeak the truth in their heart, and when they backbite their neighbours with their tongue and do evill unto them and receive a reproach againſt their neighbours and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vile perſons, and honour not ſuch as fear the Lord, and keep not their promiſes either with God or men;</hi> by all which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the world <hi>that they are not Saints indeed,</hi> when all theſe Characters are the badges onely of wicked men, to do contrary to that deſcription of true Saints.</p>
               <p>Now when all the Churches of the Congregationall way conſiſt of ſuch Members as theſe are, it followes that they are mixt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies as not conſiſting of viſible Saints, &amp; therefore ought juſtly <hi>to be ſeparated from and not to be communicated with in holy things;</hi> and that from their own principles: For they pretend they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from our aſſemblies onely becauſe they are mixt of tagg ragg <hi>and ſuch Saints as Job would not ſet with the dogs of his flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many other Arguments alſo might I here bring againſt both the Miniſters and people of the congregational way to prove them no viſible Saints, and that not from any private information or clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine practices, but for open delinquency and ſcandalous walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and that in the veiw of all men, and ſuch as can be proved by ſuch perſonages, as againſt whom there can be no juſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But before I conclude this buſineſſe let me ſay that which a learned man once uttered reading Chriſts Sermon upon the mount and the holy Evangeliſts, <hi>either this is not the Goſpel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, or if it be the men now living are no Chriſtians:</hi> After the ſame manner I may truly ſay of thoſe of the Congregational way, that either this diſcription of the true Saints is not the word of God, or if it be, thoſe of the Independent Aſſemblies are no Saints: for there is no agreement between them and the deſcription of thoſe Saints there ſpecified, as all their practices ſufficiently and apparently declare.</p>
               <p>And now the fourth and laſt part of my Minor Propoſition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth only to be proved: <hi>viz. That the Independents and all thoſe of the Congregationall way despiſe their Chriſtian Brethren</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:48122:249"/>
                  <hi>and ſeparate from them as being more holy then they;</hi> which is ſo apparently true, as beſides their words and Pamphlets in all which they proteſt againſt us, <hi>as enemies of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt &amp; his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and as an Antichriſtian brood,</hi> their dayly practice declareth it, who have moulded themſelves into innumerable ſucking Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which they terme the onely true Churches, and have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from our Aſlemblies as from ſo many Synagogues of Sathan, for this is their language. So that it may be thought a needleſſe ſpending of time, to uſe any Arguments to evince that which is in the view of all men, &amp; which the Independents themſelvs avouch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having therefore thus proved all the parts and branches of my</hi> minor <hi>propoſition, the</hi> major <hi>being undeniable, the concluſion will neceſſarily follow,</hi> That the Churches of the Congregationall way, are not true Churches after the New Teſtament forme, as not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of all viſible Saints, but are mixt Congregations, and therefore by truly godly people ought not to be communicated with in holy things, and that from their own principles.</p>
               <p>So that now, it is apparently evident to the judicious Reader from that I have formerly ſpake &amp; from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> words and from their own definition of a Church, <hi>That neither the Church of Ieruſalem, nor any of the Primitive and Apoſtolical Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, were true formed Churches after the New Teſtament form, if my brother</hi> Burtons <hi>and</hi> I. S. <hi>his words and their definition of a Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be true, and that the very Churches of the Congregationall way, as not coming within the bounds of that definition, are no right conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches, as not conſiſting of all viſible Saints &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating in all Ordinances,</hi> and which is more, <hi>That if they will be right formed churches they muſt al be dependent.</hi> All this I ſay is ſufficiently proved f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the foregoing diſcourſe to any intelligible &amp; impartiall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the which I have been the more large, that if it be poſſible, I might undeceive the poor deluded people, and perſwade them to take no notice of them (as the Independents do not of thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; Chriſts diſciples) as formed into a church or Churches after the New Teſtament form: for the firſt formed Church we read of is <hi>Acts</hi> the ſecond, that conſiſted onely of viſible Saints, and yet had neither Deacons nor Presbyters at that time, nor diſtinct Officers and Members united into one Church body reſpectively, and wanted that part of Diſcipline alſo of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out corrupt Members (as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> aſſerteth <hi>pag.</hi> 10.)
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48122:249"/>
So that by this it evidently followeth, <hi>That thoſe Congregations that conſiſt of viſible Saints, though they have not diſtinct Officers within themſelves and want Diſcipline, may be true formed Churches after the New Teſtament form,</hi> as the Church here of <hi>Joruſalem</hi> was, which at that time it was a true formed Church (by my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> confeſſion) had no Deacons, nor Elders nor dictinſtion of officers &amp; members, nor that part of Diſcipline for caſting out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Members, and yet I ſay notwithſtanding it wanted all theſe things (by their own conceſſion) it was at that time <hi>a true formed church,</hi> &amp; that becauſe the Members of that Church conſiſted of <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Saints:</hi> from all which I may draw theſe two infalliblecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Firſt,</hi> that all ſuch congregations as conſiſt of viſible Saints, ſuch as beleeve the Goſpel, and make profeſſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, and are baptized, and continue ſtedfaſtly in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles, in breaking of bread, and in prayer, are true formed Churches after the New Teſtament forme; although they want both diſtinct Officers, and Members united into one Church body respectively, and although they want that part of diſcipline for caſting out of corrupt Members. <hi>This firſt concluſion, I ſay, I infallibly gather from the Independents doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond is this,</hi> That whatſoever Congregations and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies they be, that have both diſtinction of Officers and Members, and Church diſcipline, and all other outward performances, if the Members of them bee not viſible Saints, they are not true formed Churches after the New Testament forme; for all true formed Churches after the New Teſtament form, are ſuch as conſiſt of viſible Saints, without which they are but ſhadows of Churches, and no true churches for ſubſtance; but all the Independent congregations are ſuch as only glory in outward performances &amp; conſiſt not of viſible Saints. Ergo. <hi>And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake to all that Mr</hi> Knollys I. S. &amp; <hi>my Brother had to reply againſt all my Arguments, for the proof of my firſt Propoſition,</hi> viz. that there were many Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies of beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, in the which they injoyed all acts of worſhip, and all the ſaving and ſealing Ordinances amongſt themſelves, and that before the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and under the perſecution, and after the perſecution.</p>
               <p>And now I come to what Maſter <hi>Hanſerdo, I. S.</hi> and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> have to anſwer to my ſecond, third and fourth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48122:250"/>
inſuing; and after I have diſpatched that worke, I will then in like manner reply to whatſoever either Maſter <hi>Knollys, I. S.</hi> or my brother <hi>Burton</hi> have to ſay to all my Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the gathering of Churches, and touching the liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or the toleration of all Religions;</hi> and becauſe they are not ſo large in their anſwers to them, as they were to my fore-going reaſons; and to ſpeake the truth, ſpeake little to the purpoſe, but for the overthrowing of their owne opinion, and for the corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of mine, I ſhall be the briefer in them. But firſt, <hi>I will ſet downe my Propoſitions, and ſhew how farre the Jndependents aſſent unto them; and I will then alſo faithfully relate their owne words, ſo far as they are for their purpoſe, or any way make againſt my Arguments, or are in any respect advantagious to their cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ſecond Propoſition now followeth, <hi>viz. That all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies made but one Church.</hi> And for proofe of this I ſhall not need to uſe many words, or any great diſpute; for the brethren themſelves acknowledge, <hi>that all the beleevers in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>were all Members of that Church,</hi> and they accord farther, <hi>that it was but one Church.</hi> And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt out of the holy Scripture; <hi>for it is</hi> ſaid, they <hi>that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, were added to the Church; and therefore Members of it, and that they continued in the Churches communion, and in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine, and put their eſtates in the Churches common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hoſe Officers for the Church; and all this</hi> (I ſay) our brethren doe acknowledge, and take this fellowſhip of theſe Members for a paterne of ordinary Church-communion; and therefore this my ſecond aſſertion is without controverſie, it being in expreſſe words ſet downe in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and many places in the ſame Storie, and aſſented to by the brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Propoſition, and the Reaſons of the ſame, Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>in the eleventh page of his Pamphlet thus replyes.</hi> To which J alſo <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> conſent; but the brethren have not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, neither bath the Doctor by Scripture proved, that in this one Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there were divers Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies of Beleevers; and therein I muſt manifeſt my diſſent from the Doctors opinion, promiſing him, if he ſhall ſoundly prove it in expreſſe words of Scripture (which he hath undertaken) I will acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:48122:250"/>
This is all Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> hath to ſay to this Propoſition. I will firſt therefore reply to him, and in doing that, inſert my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> anſwer to it, with what <hi>I. S.</hi> hath to ſay, and anſwer to them all in order. Now whereas Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmes, <hi>that the brethren have not acknowledged, nor the Doctor by Scripture proved that in this one Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>there were divers Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies of Beleevers;</hi> in all hee ſaith, I am moſt aſſured all that ſhall without prejudice reade my fore-going Arguments, and ſeriouſly weigh and conſider what my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> have written, will conclude, <hi>That Maſter</hi> Hanſerdo <hi>is a man of very ſhallow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and of as little honeſty, and no way to be credited in what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee ſaith or writeth.</hi> Neither ought Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> in this controverſie (eſpecially when the debate is yet <hi>ſub Iudice)</hi> to bee both <hi>party, witneſſe, Iury and Iudge,</hi> in his owne cauſe, as all wiſe men will gather: and therefore I leave it to the judgement of the learned, whether or no I have not by Scripture ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>there were many congregations, and ſeverall Aſſemblies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in that one Church; and whether I have not by expreſſe words of Scripture, and from my brother</hi> Burtons <hi>and Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>his owne words abundantly evinced it;</hi> all this, I ſay, I leave to the judgement of all impartiall and underſtanding Chriſtians, who I am confident will grant that I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved <hi>there were many congregations of beleevers in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem; and therefore I challenge Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his promiſe, and expect that hee ſhould acknowledge his error; and ſo relinquiſh his fond opinion of Independency, which if he doe not, hee cannot be an honeſt man, and a true Saint, as not keeping his word; for <hi>David</hi> deſcribing a true Saint, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 4. ſaith of ſuch an one, <hi>that hee ſweareth to his owne hurt, and changeth not.</hi> Now if hee bee in the number of thoſe Saints, and will keepe his promiſe, hee will abandon his tenent of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> ſo peremptorily aſſerts, <hi>that the brethren have not acknowledged that there were many congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies of Beleevers in the Church at Ieruſalem;</hi> I ſhall deſirehim and all thoſe of his fellowſhip to hear my brother <hi>Burton</hi> who eſteems of himſelfe as none of the weakeſt brethren, but accounteth himſelfe a Champion, and therefore cometh out to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48122:251"/>
dare all the world of Presbyterians; and yet hee in the name of all that Fraternity acknowledgeth, <hi>that there were many aſſemblies of Beleevers and Saints in the Church of Jeruſalem,</hi> and this his book is allowed of and highly approved of by many of them: And if I have not been miſ-informed, it was licenſed by their Batcheler of the black-art of Il-dependency that ſhotten hering in divinity, who alloweth of all their other Pamphlets and ſets his <hi>Imprimatur</hi> to them; So that what he licenſeth is approved of by them all.</p>
               <p>Now I deſire Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> and all thoſe of his ſociety to liſten unto their great <hi>Rabbi,</hi> old <hi>Harry,</hi> my courteous and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned brother, whoſe words are theſe in the ninth Page of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>The first formed Church <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> we finde is in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which though conſisting of five thouſand, yet it was one entire particular Church and not Churches; and they continued dayly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with one accord in one place together <hi>(v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.)</hi> and in the Temple <hi>(ver. 44. 46.)</hi> growing from an hundred and twenty <hi>(Acts 1. 15.)</hi> to three thouſand more <hi>(chap. 2. 41.)</hi> and then in all five thouſand <hi>(ch. 4. 4.)</hi> and all theſe but one Church which aſſembled together to hear the word in the Temple, and though they wanted a convenient place ſo ſpacious as wherein to break bread or to receive the Lords Supper all together, ſo as they were conſtrained to ſever themſelves into diverſe companies in ſeverall private houſes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, yet this ſevering was not a dividing of this Church into ſo many diſtinct formall Churches or Church bodies, being but ſo many branches of one and the ſame particular Church, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe are my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> words in the name of all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and therefore they may abundantly ſatisfie Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and all men that the brethren have acknowledged there were many Congregations of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But for the farther confirmation of this truth, <hi>that the brethren have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged there were ſeverall aſſemblies of beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> I will unto the teſtimony of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> add the teſtimony likewiſe of another faithfull brother againſt whom I preſume Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> can have no juſt exception; ſo that this truth being confirmed by the mouth of two approved and ſeraphicall witneſſes, the brethren can never doubt of it any more: and this witneſſe is one Saint <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> one of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> for <hi>England</hi> his Chaplaines, a man worthy of eſteeme who uſually preacheth on
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48122:251"/>
horſeback to the Country Courtiers <hi>all the the truth</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>of the Goſpel;</hi> And therefore I know Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> will give great heed to Saint <hi>Hanſerdo's</hi> teſtimony concerning this matter, and he touching this point in the tenth page of his learned book ſaith <hi>that the Apostles and all the Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem met together with one accord in one place, to wit, the Temple, and in</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons <hi>Porch, and brake bread from houſe to houſe</hi> domatim, <hi>and thus they did</hi> quotidie <hi>day by day</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the which two teſtimonies the one of my brother</hi> Burton <hi>the other of Saint</hi> Hanſerdo, <hi>all intelligible men may eaſily gather,</hi> that there is very little credit at any time to be given to what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> or thoſe of his party ſhall affirme either concerning the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their brethren or what they ſhall relate concerning other men: <hi>For he in the name of them all aſſerteth theſe two things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt touching themſelves:</hi> viz. that the brethren <hi>(meaning all the Illdependents)</hi> have not acknowledged that there were many congregations in that one Church at Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond concerning my ſelfe, of whom he ſaith,</hi> that the Doctor hath not by Scripture proved that there were ſeverall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Beleevers in that one Church.</p>
               <p>Now for the latter of his aſſertions, I have not only from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proved it, but from my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hanſerdos</hi> their owne conceſſions made it good: <hi>viz. that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do to all the world accuſe Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> of calumny and diſhoneſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the firſt of his aſſertions:</hi> viz. That the brethren have not acknowledged it, <hi>for the conviction of him of an apparent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in this, my brother</hi> Burton <hi>and Saint</hi> Hanſerdoes <hi>teſtimonies do it for me; for in their above mentioned words, and that in the name of all the Independents, and that in books approved of by many of that way, in thoſe I ſay my brother</hi> Burton conceptis ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis <hi>ſaith,</hi> that though it was but one entire Church, yet for want of a convenient place ſo ſpacious as where to break bread, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſever themſelves into divers companies in ſeveral private houſes to communicate. <hi>And Saint</hi> Hanſerdos <hi>his teſtimony is as full as my brother</hi> Burtons, <hi>for he ſaith</hi> the Apoſtles and beleevers met day by day in the Temple and in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch and brake bread from houſe to houſe, <hi>that is they did communicate from houſe to</hi>

                  <hi>houſe or in every houſe; So that Saint</hi> Hanſerdos <hi>witneſſe to prove many aſſemblies is moſt evident. So that both theſe brethren in the name of all their fraternity acknowledge,</hi> there were may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, and that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall private houſes, <hi>and my brother</hi> Burton <hi>ſaith moreover,</hi> that they were ſo many branches of one and the ſame particular Church.</p>
               <p>Now I refer my ſelfe to all the world, whether there be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard at any time to be given either to Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> or any of his faction, when he and they at pleaſure dare publiſh ſuch noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious untruths as theſe, for he in the name of all the Independents affirmeth, <hi>that the brethren have not acknowledged that there were many congregations of Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> when my brother <hi>Burton</hi> notwithſtanding and Saint <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> have in expreſſe words, and that in the name of all their fraternity aſſerted, <hi>That when there were but five thouſand yea but three thouſand belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, for the largneſſe of the Church at that time and for want of ſo spacious a room as could contain them all to injoy all acts of worſhip, they were then forced to ſever themſelves into divers companies and that in ſeveral private houſes and to break bread from houſe to houſe.</hi> So that for Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and thoſe of his way they are not to be regarded: for all they of that fraternity are generally ſo given to tell untruths, that for my part, I never believe them; neither when they ſay true, nor when they ly; for they wil ly by the day &amp; by the night.</p>
               <p>But out of my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> words and that in the name of all their brethren, I deſire the Reader to obſerve what they both grant.

there he aaknowledgeth <hi>that the Church of Ieruſalem was but one Church,</hi> notwithſtanding in the ſame page he granteth <hi>that that Church conſiſted of diverſe Congregations;</hi> for he acknowledgeth, <hi>that they had a congregation in the Temple, that is one place;</hi> and he grants alſo, <hi>they had an Aſſembly in</hi> Solomons <hi>Porch,</hi> that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, and he acknowledgeth moreover, <hi>that they brake bread from houſe to houſe</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na fidelia duos parietes,</hi> hath done both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For firſt, he acknowledgeth</hi> there were many Congregations there.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he proveth it by Scripture as out of the firſt 5 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Acts:</hi> So that Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> I hope will not hereafter ſay <hi>that the brethren have not acknowledged that there were many Congregations in Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I do verily beleeve that Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>and all the brethren of the Congregationall way, when they ſhall duly and maturely conſider what my brother</hi> Burton <hi>and Saint</hi> Hanſerdo <hi>have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, will give them little thanks for their paines;</hi> for their doctrine is not onely contrary to all the Independents principles, but totally ſubverteth and overthroweth the tenent of the Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall way: <hi>For all the Independent Miniſters through the World preach up and publiſh in all their Pamphlets,</hi> that in all the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches there were no more beleevers in any one of them, no not in the very Church of Ieruſalem it ſelfe, then could all meet together
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48122:253"/>
at one time and in one place to communicate in all Acts of Worſhip: <hi>And this doctrine they have broached to all people whereſoever they come, perſwading them that this is Gods way, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell way, and the right way of gathering Churches, and therefore they call it</hi> the Congregationall way, <hi>affirming,</hi> that all the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Churches we read of in the holy Scriptures, each of them in their ſeverall Cityes and Precincts conſiſted but of as many as did all meet in one Congregation, and this they call Gods Ordinance. <hi>And many of the brethren both aſſembled and not aſſembled, have been heard ſay and promiſe,</hi> that if it could evidently be made appear unto them, that there were many Congregations and diverſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Beleevers either in the Church at Ieruſalem or in any other of the Apoſtolicall Churches, that then they would relinquiſh their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Independency, and acknowledge that the Congregationall way had not any warrant and footing in Gods word, and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Preſbyterians concerning the combining of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under one Preſbytery and their Dependency upon it, and their making of a ſubordination of many Aſſemblies under one Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy to be governed by the Common Councell and joynt conſent of many Elders, was Gods Ordinance.</p>
               <p>This I ſay, all the Independents that I have ever talked with or or by relation heard of, have promiſed and by proteſtation engaged themſelves, that if it could be made appear unto them by the word of God, <hi>that there were many Congregations of Beleevers either in Ieruſalem or in any of the Primtive churches that then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy amongſt the brethren would be at an end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although I have in the foregoing treatiſe ſufficiently evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and made it evident, that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that they were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon that one Presbytery; yet becauſe it is the chief point of controverſie between us, and the which being ſufficiently clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is that, that will put an end to the whole debate; and becauſe alſo Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath ſo peremptorily affirmed, That the brethren have not acknowledged that there were divers Aſſemblies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers there, for his farther ſatisfaction and for the ſatisfaction of all thoſe of his party, and for the ſatisfaction of all men, and that at laſt the brethren may be the more fully convinced of the error of their wayes, and that the ſimple people alſo may be undeceived, I ſhall deſire them all ſeriouſly to weigh and conſider what both my
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48122:253"/>
brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> are forced to confeſſe (though I muſt needs ſay thus much of them both, That they withhold much of the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, as I ſhall by and by make appear) but this (I ſay) I deſire all men adviſedly to weigh, what they are both conſtrained to acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore I will again ſet down my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> words, and in the ſecond place I will repeat Saint <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> expreſſions: For my brother <hi>Burton</hi> his words are theſe, <hi>They were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>constrained to ſever themſelves into diverſe companies, in ſeverall private houſes to communicate;</hi> and which is more, he granteth, <hi>That thoſe ſeverall companies were but ſo many branches of that one and the ſame particular Church,</hi> &amp;c. thus he. Maſter <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> words are theſe, <hi>All the beleevers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Church of Ieruſalem, met together with one accord in one place; to wit, the Temple, and in Solomons Porch, and brake bread from houſe to houſe, and that day by day:</hi> theſe are Saint <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> own words. Now I ſhall deſire all judicious Chriſtians duly to conſider both their expreſſions; for all men know, that branches either of a vine or tree, as we ſee it in the fifteenth of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and in the eleventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they are all dependent upon the Vine and root, as drawing life and ſap from them; for being ſevered and cut off they do forthwith dye and wither. Now then, if according to my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and learning, and if his ſimilie be good, <hi>That there is the ſame relation between the ſeverall companies in thoſe ſeverall private houſes and the whole particular Church in Jeruſalem,</hi> that is <hi>between either the branches of the Vine or Tree,</hi> which ever depend upon their ſtock or root for ſap and life, and for the compleating of them: then I ſay, by my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> own conceſſion, There were not onely many Congregations of beleevers in that Church, but they all of them were dependent of that one particular Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Church, and were all ſubordinate unto it, and were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and governed <hi>Communi conſilio Presbyterorum.</hi> And the ſame may be concluded out of the words of Saint <hi>Hanſerdo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whether this be not true or no, I refer it to the judgement of all ſuch Chriſtians, as have not either morgaged their reaſon; and put it out of their own poſſeſſion, or abſolutely ſold the fee ſimple of their underſtanding; and to all ſuch I ſay, as have not been prodigall in eyther of theſe kindes, or have not forfeited all their wit and knowledge, and ſo are to be begged for punies and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48122:254"/>
fools, I refer my ſelfe as moſt aſſured they will all ſay and affirme, That my brother <hi>Burton</hi> with one ſtroke of this his Phocions hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet hath cut in two the long thred of all the alribiadian fluent, and luxuriant rhetorications (to uſurpe his own words) of all his brethren of the Congregationall way, by which they bound and tyed up their ill-ſhrouded Ill-dependency, and by this hath given a fatall ſtroak to that their <hi>Hydra,</hi> and indeed utterly overthrown their whole Congregationall Fabrick, and the ſame they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude concerning Saint <hi>Hanſerdo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, I dare in this controverſie between us, make my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> their greateſt friends, and my greateſt enemies arbiters and judges, eſpecially if they be not ſo wedded to their own reſolves and opinions, that be they never ſo adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are yet reſolved never to give them a bill of divorce; except I ſay, they be men deſperately beſotted and doting upon their filthy and deformed novelties: were they I ſay, much their friends, and very much my enemies, I dare leave the deciding of this buſineſſe and difference between us unto their judgement and determination. And I ſhall reſt moſt aſſured, and be ever confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent if my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> words be true, and to be credited, and if they both ſtand to what they have ſaid, to wit, That there were many companies of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that in ſeverall houſes, where they did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and that all theſe congregations were but ſo many branches of that one particular Church, which brake bread from houſe to houſe or in every houſe, (as they both affirme) that they will all accord, judge, and conclude, That they both of them have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the Doctrine of Independency and that of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall way, and delucidately proved, That the Church of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> was Dependent, and Presbyterianly and Claſſically gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And withall, by that I have now ſaid, I hope that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> himſelfe will in time be convinced of his errour, and will not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſo boldly affirme, That the brethren have not acknowledged it; eſpecially when he ſhall deliberately read what my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> that faithfull brother and witneſſe hath written.</p>
               <p>But as I accuſed my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> before of jugling and of indirect dealing in this ſo ſerious and weighty a matter: ſo here I will make it good; for,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:48122:254"/>
Firſt, <hi>They make all the beleevers of Ieruſalem, till the receiving of the gifts of the holy Ghoſt</hi> (which we read of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. ver. 1.) <hi>to amount to no more then an hundred and twenty names,</hi> and ſo would perſwade the poor ignorant people, <hi>that there were no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then in Ieruſalem,</hi> which I affirm is a great wickedneſſe in them both, ſo to betray the truth and to give the ſpirit of God the lye, when it is manifeſt out of all the Evangeliſts, that there were infinite multitudes of beleevers then in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> all inhabitants there; and when in expreſſe words, in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That there were devout men and true worſhippers from out of all the Nations under heaven, at that time in that City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas it is related in the ſecond chapter, That there were three thouſand ſouls at the firſt miracle and ſermon of <hi>Peter</hi> converted, beſides many others <hi>that the Lord added dayly to the Church, ver.</hi> 47. And whereas it is recorded in the fourth chap. <hi>That there were five thouſand men more converted by another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and Sermon:</hi> and whereas it is ſtoried in the 5 chap. upon the miraculous and fearfull death of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, and through the other ſigns and wonders the Apoſtles wrought, <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers were more added unto the Lord multitudes both of men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> v. 14. mark <hi>I</hi> pray the expreſſion, it is ſaid, <hi>there were multitudes;</hi> now multitudes among the Romans and in all nations is ever taken for <hi>turba</hi> or <hi>agmen,</hi> a great company, that is, for a great Aſſembly or Congregation; and here the word of God affirmes in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, That by that miracle and by thoſe other wonders of the Apoſtles, <hi>multitudes both of men and women were added to the Lord,</hi> that is to ſay, many more great Congregations and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of beleevers then were before were added to that Church in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> all this <hi>I</hi> ſay is evident out of thoſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas it is farther related in the ſixt chapter ver. 7.</hi> that the word of God increaſed and the number of the Diſciples multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Ieruſalem greatly, and a great company of the Priests were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the faith. <hi>And whereas in divers other places of the</hi> Acts <hi>it is witneſſed that there was increaſe upon increaſe of beleevers in that Church: And whereas in the 21. of the</hi> Acts <hi>it is recorded</hi> that there were many ten thouſand beleevers there &amp; all Inhabitants; <hi>my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>and Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>in their enumeration of the Beleevers in</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>at firſt and laſt make them but five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in all. My brother</hi> Burtons <hi>words are theſe:</hi> Growing <hi>(ſaith</hi>

                  <hi>he)</hi> from an hundred and twenty <hi>(Acts 1. 15.)</hi> to three thouſand more <hi>(chap. 2. ver. 41.)</hi> and then in all five thouſand <hi>(chap. 4. ver. 4.)</hi> and all theſe but one Church. <hi>Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>his words are theſe, Page 8,</hi> Thoſe places in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke (ſaith he)</hi> tell us of very many who were baptized by <hi>John</hi> and by Chriſts Diſciples; but do not declare how many of theſe baptized perſons were of the Church of Ieruſalem; and for ought I know <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> or the Doctor either, many of thoſe baptized perſons might be in the other Churches of Iudaea, yea the most of them and but few in Ieruſalem, it may be no more but thoſe hundred and twenty mentioned <hi>Acts 1. 13, 14, 15.</hi> to whom were added about three thouſand ſoules. <hi>And in the ninth page he ſaith</hi> the text well conſidered onely holds forth, that the number of men was made up five thouſand. <hi>Thus he. So that in the reckoning of my brother</hi> Burton <hi>and Maſter</hi> Knollys, <hi>the whole number of beleevers in</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>at firſt and laſt was but five thouſand in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I refer my ſelfe unto the judicious and godly Reader whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe men have not made falſe Muſters or no to uſe ſome of <hi>I. S.</hi> his language, and whether or no my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> have not <hi>with-held the truth from the people in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 1. And whether they have not done moſt ſacrilegiouſly, unjuſtly and wickedly in thus robbing the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> of ſo many thouſand Members?</p>
               <p>For firſt they ſubduct and cut off all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt and Chriſts diſciples, and all thoſe devout men, and true worſhippers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſpake of in the ſecond chapter, and take no notice of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas it is related in the ſecond chapter, verſe 47. that beſides thoſe three thouſand ſoules that were converted by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>that the Lord added daily unto the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> they ſubduct and cut off thoſe likewiſe, and make no mention of them. And whereas in the fourth chapter the number of thoſe that were converted by the ſecond miracle, and ſermon, is related to be about five thouſand men, they cut off three thouſand of theſe alſo; and whereas in the fifth chapter it is ſaid, that <hi>Beleevers were more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,</hi> that is to ſay many more great Aſſemblies and Congregations then were before, all thoſe in like manner they ſubduct and pare off: and whereas in the ſixth chapter it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48122:255"/>
                  <hi>that the word of God increaſed, and the number of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples multiplyed in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>greatly, and a great company of the Prieſts were obedient to the faith,</hi> all thoſe likewiſe they defalcate with all the other increaſes of multitudes the Scripture ſpeaks of, with the many ten thouſands recorded in the 21. chapter, neither doe they make any mention of them, or take any notice of them, but caſting up the whole ſumme, they bring in the totall recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and number of all the Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> at firſt and laſt to be but five thouſand in all; and all this they have done out of their perverſe wilfull and obſtinate wickedneſſe, <hi>to the end they may deceive the ignorant and ſimple people,</hi> (which is a moſt horrid ſinne and wickedneſſe in them thus to juggle) who they could not delude, if they were indeed truly informed, and did not they and their complices <hi>with-hold the truth from them in unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> for were the people truly informed, <hi>that in the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>there were many ten thouſands; al intelligible, yea, but ordinary underſtanding men and women, yea very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would conclude, That they could not then all poſſibly meet in one congregation or a few to partake in all acts of worſhip, and therefore of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into divers congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aſſemblies, all which notwithſtanding made ſtill but one Church,</hi> and therefore they would gather that they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be combined under one Presbyterie, and be dependent upon it. This I affirme every rationall creature would from grounded reaſon be able to gather, if they were rightly inſtructed; whether therefore it be not the higheſt point of diſhoneſty, both in my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and all thoſe Teachers of the congregationall way, thus to abuſe the people, and whether this be not in them all <hi>to with-hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> I leave it to the judgement of all the truly godly, and ſuch as make conſcience of their wayes and dealings.</p>
               <p>And now I come to what <hi>I. S.</hi> that Groll hath to ſay to my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition; for hee muſt be anſwered alſo, or elſe he will exceedingly triumph. In the 11. page of his <hi>Flagelli</hi> hee hath theſe words by way of anſwer. <hi>I am not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſatisfied by any thing that hath beene alleaged by the Doctor, that the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>conſiſted of many congregations and aſſemblies, and that upon the ſcruples before inſtanced.</hi> Thus <hi>I. S.</hi> expreſſeth his non-ſatisfaction in that place; and in the tenth page for farther
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48122:256"/>
anſwer, hee thus declareth himſelf. Firſt (ſaith he) <hi>you ſay the brethren themſelves acknowledge, that all the Beleevers in</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>were all Members of that Church. If you meane that Church spake of</hi> Acts <hi>the</hi> 15. 4. <hi>J deny, and ſay it is a groſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and begging of the queſtion, to ſay that wee acknowledge all the Beleevers in</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>to be Members of that one mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Church, eſpecially if you reckon all</hi> Iohns <hi>Diſciples and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to thoſe Beleevers: for as there was a good ſpace of time after there were multitudes of Beleevers, ere there was ſuch a Church; ſo for any thing hath yet beene brought to the contrary, it is probable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enough, that the true Beleevers, which were not ſo many, after you have cut off</hi> Iohns <hi>converts, I meane thoſe that did ſticke in</hi> Iohns <hi>Baptiſme, which were multitudes and temporary Beleevers, which ceaſed to walke with Chriſt, which were not a few and ſtrangers, which did afterwards diſperſe themſelves into ſeverall countries, thoſe that did remaine at</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>did gradually gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For what</hi> (ſaith <hi>I. S.) if that be to be underſtood of the Church Catholick, and not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church? It may not be denied that the word Church, is often ſo uſed in the New Teſtament, and it is ſuſpicious that the three thouſand converted at once, were not ſo ſoone inſtructed in church fellowſhip as converted,</hi> &amp;c. Thus worſhipfull Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, whoſe words are a very farrago of errors and vanity, by which hee ſufficiently declareth unto the world, that hee is in the number of thoſe Maſters Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 1. verſe 7. <hi>who deſiring to be Teachers of the Law, underſtand neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirme:</hi> and confident I am, that there was never a more arrogant, and a more preſumptuoas ſot that ever put pen to paper, then this <hi>I. S.</hi> and whoſe words are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> guilty of more ignorance, and fuller of the emptineſſe of ſelfe conceitedneſſe, and more lyable to exception; for hee is not only a ſtranger to the Independent doctrine, and to the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> hee ſpeakes of (as all the learned wil eaſily by his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions perceive) but hee is a meere novice in all divine learning, and al good literature, &amp; a fellow very wretched &amp; worthleſſe, and ſuch an one as deſerves to be exploded out of the ſchools of the learned,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48122:256"/>
and to be thruſt out of the ſociety of all orthodox and conſcientious honeſt Chriſtians, and indeed if he were dealt with according to his merits, hee deſerves to be ſpewed out of the ſeven new chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of whom, before I come to my reply, I will take liberty to ſay yet a little more, and as of him, ſo of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> that as they are <hi>fratres in malo,</hi> ſo they are equally guilty of the ſame ſacriledge &amp; unrighteous dealing, foras <hi>I. S.</hi> ſo they alſo rob the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> of all thoſe Members that were converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, Chriſt himſelfe, and his bleſſed Apoſtles and Diſciples before Chriſts death, as is manifeſt from their words quoted before, and from <hi>I. S.</hi> his ſcruples hee ſpeakes of, page 8. and 9. where hee unchurches and unchriſtians all thoſe that were converted by <hi>Iohns</hi> and Chriſts miniſtry, hee alſo with them with-holds the truth from the people in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes: and as if that had not been enough, in the words, I have now quoted out of the tenth page, beſides his denying, that I have proved my firſt Propoſition, which indeed <hi>is a meere Preſumptiou and begging the queſtion,</hi> to uſe his grolliſh expreſſion, hee to all his iniquity adds tranſgreſſion and ſinne, which is the height of wickedneſſe accumulating error upon error, as will frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; for here againe hee firſt <hi>cuts off all thoſe that</hi> were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Baptiſt <hi>from the Beleevers in Ieruſalem</hi> whom hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridingly cals <hi>Iohns</hi> diſciples and converts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee affirmeth of them all that they ſtucke in <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſme, and were but temporary Beleevers, and ceaſed to walke with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hee affirmeth that thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt did afterwards diſperſe themſelves into ſeverall countries.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, <hi>Hee aſſerteth, that thoſe that did continue at</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>did gradually grow up into church fellowſhip.</hi> Every one of the which aſſertions of Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> howſo ever they are preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly laid downe by him, as ſo many certaine and infallible truths, yet I atteſt, there is not the leaſt warrant for any of them in the whole word of God; no not ſo much as a ſhaddow of any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to cover or colour them over; yea, they are all as egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and notoriouſly erroneous as they are uncharitable; for they are all contrary to the word of God, and to the law of love and kindneſſe which thinkes no evill; yea, they contradict the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of God, as wee ſhall ſee in ſome particulars: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48122:257"/>
hee arrogantly amongſt other of his falſe aſſertions ſaith, <hi>That thoſe that did remaine in</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>did gradually grow up into Church fellowſhip,</hi> as if they had not by Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtry been made perfect Chriſtians, I ſay this is contrary to the expreſſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> the 7. where hee giveth this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny concerning all thoſe that came out of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Iohns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, all which were Inhabitants and innumerable companies, for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> the 3. and <hi>Marke</hi> the 1. <hi>That</hi> Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>went out to him, and they of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>that they juſtified God, and rejected not his counſell againſt themſelves to their owne deſtruction, as the Phariſees and Lawyers did, but they embraced Gods mercy to their ſalvation.</hi> So that by Chriſts own teſtimony and witneſſe, the Phariſees and Lawyers onely excepted, all the other were good and perfectly made Chriſtians, and in ſuch a Church fellowſhip as with which they grew up to a perfect ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any new Church-fellowſhip: and therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> not onely ſaying, that they were temporary Chriſtians, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to follow Chriſt, but that thoſe of them that remayned in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, did gradually grow up in Church-fellowſhip afterwards, in all hee ſaith, I affirme, hee giveth the ſpirit of God the lye, who hath recorded the contrary, as that they were perfect good Chriſtians, as having not rejected the counſell of God to their owne perdition, but imbraced the promiſes to their ſalvation; ſo that they were all by <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtry very well inſtructed in their duty in all reſpects. Therefore both <hi>J. S.</hi> my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all the Ill-dependents, are moſt abominably wicked thus with their ſcriblings to unſettle the minds of the people, ever pratling about a kind of Church fellowſhip, of which they have neither Precept nor Preſident in all Gods holy Word, and which they themſelves could never declare unto the world what it was, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>three thouſand converted at once, were not ſo ſoone inſtructed in church-fellowſhip as converted.</hi> Theſe are his expreſſions.</p>
               <p>From which I gather that Sir <hi>I.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48122:258"/>
certainly there is no act of church fellowſhip, that was omitted by them, and although I love not ſuch as will groundleſſly be ſuſpicious as <hi>I. S.</hi> is here and thoſe of his Fraternity; yet <hi>I</hi> am confident the Independnnts will never be induced to imitate the example of thoſe three thouſand, and <hi>I</hi> have very good reaſon to make mee continue in this beliefe for what <hi>I</hi> already know in their daily practiſes, and therefore they are rather to be ſuſpected that they are not well inſtructed in church fellowſhip, they make notwithſtanding ſo great a noyſ about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore whether this be not a great temerity in theſe men, thus upon all occaſions, not onely to cenſure their chriſtian brethren that live harmeleſſely by them, but to ſuſpect all thoſe that were converted by the Baptiſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves before Chriſts death; yea, and to ſuſpect even thoſe three thouſand alſo that were converted by <hi>Peter,</hi> after Chriſts aſcenſion, and to adjudge both Paſtors and people to bee all ignorant, what church government and church fellowſhip was, <hi>I</hi> leave it likewiſe to the judgement of the prudent, &amp; adviſed Reader? And yet this is the daily practiſe of al the Ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>dependents thus to ſpeake of them all, as if they had not learned their leſſon as well as the congregationall Predicants and their diſciples, and knew not how to caſt them into a church mold after the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament forme, and to inſtruct them concerning church fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when not withſtanding it is recorded of thoſe Miniſters that they revealed the whole counſell of God, and whatſoever was needfull to be knowne or practiſed by all chriſtians to the end of the world, <hi>Acts</hi> the 20. and therefore could bee ignorant of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that tended to edification, and the building up of beleevers in their moſt holy faith.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding <hi>I. S.</hi> and his brethren are ſtill full of ſuſpicions and yet never ſatisfied in any thing that can be produced out of the holy Scripture to confute their erroneous novelties: for although I had ſufficiently confirmed my firſt propoſition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by both Scripture and reaſons, that all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> and Chriſts Diſciples were good Chriſtians and true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet <hi>I. S.</hi> page 11. ſayes, <hi>He is not ſatisfied by any thing that hath been alledged by me, that the Church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem conſiſted of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, and that upon the ſcruples before inſtanced.</hi> And Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> in his 11. page
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48122:258"/>
affirmeth the ſame. So that it is certain theſe men are reſolved never to be ſatisfied though things be never ſo evidently proved unto them.</p>
               <p>And it is no wonder that there is at this day ſuch a brood of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world; for there has ever been a generation of ſuch men in all ages, that will never be ſatisfied. Chriſt the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of his Church with all his bleſſed Apoſtles and faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters could never ſatisfie the Jewes, <hi>but they ever reſiſted his spirit</hi> Acts 7. Neither can the holy Scriptures now ſatisfie all gainſayers but they will ſtill be doubting, amongſt the which Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> and Saint <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> with many of their fraternity may well be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. But for all ſuch Chriſtians <hi>as whom the god of this world hath not blinded their eyes that they ſhould not ſee the glorious light of the Gospel of truth.</hi> I am confident they will be ſatisfied that I have ſufficiently proved that there were many Congregations and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſemblies of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp; from that ſatisfaction they will learn to abhor the errors of all the ſectaries and ſtraglers of our times, and to decline &amp; ſhun their company and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip. And for all ſuch as they are that will receive the good ſeed of the word into good and honeſt hearts, I deſire ever to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, and not thoſe that are reſolved to be ever ſcepticall and ever learning, yet never attaining or coming to knowledge, or at leaſt withhold the truth from others in unrighteouſneſſe: And for all ſuch I ſhall not much ſtudy to give them ſatisfaction as being a company of unreaſonable men from whom we ought daily to pray to be delivered, for all ſuch the Lord hath given over to ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, <hi>that they ſhould beleeve a lye, becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they may be ſaved,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.

and content others. And to the reaſons I ſhall produce, I will alſo adde ſome teſtimonies of thoſe of his own party for his farther ſatisfaction or conviction at leaſt.</p>
               <p>All ſuch as have read <hi>I. S.</hi> his learned works, know, that he hath not only cut of all thoſe that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples before Chriſts paſſion and aſcenſion from the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but razed them out of the Kalender and Roule of the Saints, abſolutely denying them ſo much as the very name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; all this I ſay, thoſe that have read his ſcruples, very well know: They know likewiſe that he granteth there were three thouſand converted by the firſt Miracle and Sermon of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> though he uncharitably ſaith, <hi>That it is ſuſpicious that they were not ſo ſoon inſtructed in Church fellowſhip as converted.</hi> So that here by his own confeſſion we have a very ample Congregation conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three thouſand and ſix ſcore perſons. And in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is related, <hi>that there were devout men true beleevers out of every Nation under Heaven all Inhabitants and Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers there, and that the Lord added dayly to thoſe, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> and theſe were without doubt great numbers they being indefinitely ſet down. And in the fourth chapter we finde a new addition of five thouſand men more converted; and withall <hi>I</hi> may tell <hi>I. S.</hi> that <hi>it is ſuſpicious</hi> (to uſe his own language) that the three thouſand firſt converts were all men likewiſe, for ſo many learned men conceive of thoſe converts: but for the five thouſand it is out of doubt: for the holy Word of God ſaith in <hi>terminis</hi> that they were <hi>all men:</hi> And by the law of charity we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that all thoſe converts were as zealous for the publiſhing and ſpreading abroad of the truth of this their Chriſtian Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as any other people ever were; and therefore that they did make known the wonderfull things of God and what he had done for them to all their acquaintance and neighbours, eſpecially we are obliged to beleeve that they did teach and inſtruct their wives, children and ſervants and their whole families in the nurtrature and fear of the Lord, and in the knowledge of the Goſpell. And it is alſo to be believed that the women and all ſorts of people were then as docible and intelligible, and as ready to give attendance unto wholeſome and ſound words and to imbrace any truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, as our giddy-headed people and women are now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to imbrace and follow novelties: eſpecially we may with all
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48122:259"/>
reaſon be induced to beleeve this that they would then be the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perſwaded to receive the doctrine of the Goſpell, in regard it came ratified and confirmed unto them with ſuch mighty ſignes and wonders; for the Iewes had often before deſired ſigns and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſaying unto Chriſt, <hi>What ſigne ſhe west thou that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in thee?</hi> intimating that if he could ſhew unto them any ſign that then they would beleeve in him, and ſo they ſaid unto him when he was upon the croſſe, <hi>If thou wouldeſt have us beleeve in thee</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>come down from the croſſe and ſave thy ſelfe,</hi> and then thou ſhalt perſwade us that thou art indeed the ſonne of God.</p>
               <p>Now then when the Lord by his Apoſtles and Diſciples did day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratifie them with ſuch ſignes and wonders as that the very high Prieſts and Rulers themſelves were forced to confeſſe upon the cure of the criple, that no body could deny but it was a wonderfull miracle; I ſay therefore, when the preaching of the Goſpell was concomitated upon all occaſions with ſuch mighty wonders, it cannot be doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed but that the ordinary people both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were eaſily perſwaded to beleeve it, (when the Magiſtrates themſelves were aſtoniſhed to ſee thoſe wonders) and therefore yeelded the more credit unto their husbunds and maſters inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yea we read of many women <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 27, 28. <hi>that mourned for Chriſt when they carryed him to crucifying:</hi> And if we look alſo into the ſtory of holy writ we ſhall finde that there were many women that followed him in his life time, &amp; thoſe honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones which miniſtred dayly unto him. Now then if we beleeve, which we ought in charity to do, that there were but as many belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving women converted as men (as we may for ought any thing can be ſaid to the contrary) then we have already ſixteen thouſand belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> according to the new ſtile of the Church. Neither did the Church ſtand then at a ſtay: For in the fifth chapter upon the dreadfull death of <hi>Ananias and Saphira</hi> and by reaſon of ſome other miracles, <hi>Beleevers,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>were more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this word <hi>multitude</hi> as I ſhewed before, in all languages it ever ſignifies ſome great company, or ſome great aſſembly or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people whether it be taken in a good ſenſe or a bad, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the holy Scripture <hi>follow not a multitude to do evil;</hi> So that here many new great congregations of beleevers were added to the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48122:260"/>
Church, beſides all thoſe before ſpecified; and in the 6. chapter v. 7. it is recorded, <hi>that the word of God increaſed, and the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in Ieruſalem greatly, and a great company of the Prieſts were obedient to the faith.</hi> In the which words there is theſe four things obſervable.</p>
               <p>The firſt, <hi>that the word of God increaſed,</hi> that is brought forth many children which were begotten to the Faith by the preaching of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in expreſſe words it is ſaid, <hi>that the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in Ieruſalem,</hi> the place it ſelfe <hi>where</hi> being ſpecified, that is to ſay they were increaſed and that in no ſmall companies in that very Church and City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid, <hi>that they multiplyed greatly,</hi> both the words having a great emphaſis in them, <hi>the number of Diſciples multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>and that greatly,</hi> to ſhew the miraculous and wonderful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> increaſe of them, as if the Scripture ſhould have ſaid that the number could not be ſet down.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is ſaid alſo for the ſetting forth of the efficacy of the Goſpell, <hi>that a great company of the Prieſts were obedient to the faith,</hi> not a few but a great company alſo of the Prieſts, thoſe inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate enemies of Jeſus Chriſt; every one of theſe words hath weight in it, and being but a little pondered, will create belief from any ordinary underſtanding man that there were by this means and after their converſion infinites of people dayly added unto the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not onely by the powerfull preaching and miracles of the Apoſtles, but by the helpe and preaching of theſe Prieſts alſo, of whom we ought to harbour this opinion, that now they were as diligent (conſidering the great love of Chriſt towards themſelves) to convert and bring men unto him, as ever they were before to diſſwade the people from following him; this I conceive the law of charity binds all men to beleeve, that they being now converted would ſtudy to convert others. For we ſee that as ſoon as <hi>Andrew</hi> had found <hi>Chriſt</hi> John 1. he brought his brother <hi>Simon</hi> to him. And after Chriſt had called <hi>Philip</hi> unto him, he finding <hi>Nathaniel</hi> bringeth him alſo unto Chriſt. And if we obſerve it, it is the nature of true grace that it is ever operative and fruitfull and will looſe no opportunity of doing good and gaining friends unto it: So that all thoſe that are really and truly converted, they will ever ſtudy and indeavour to convert others, yea they are bound
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48122:260"/>
unto it, according to that of Chriſt, <hi>who when he related unto</hi> Peter <hi>that the devill ſoughts to winnow him as wheat, and told him farther that he had prayed for him that his faith might not faile,</hi> added with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all this leſſon unto <hi>Simon Peter</hi> ſaying, <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> This duty lay not only upon <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> but it lies to this day upon all Miniſters and people; and all thoſe Prieſts knew very well that this duty lay alſo upon them, and that by a ſpeciall command from God long before given them, who had ſaid <hi>that the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge,</hi> and that the people ſhould ſeek the law, will and good pleaſure of God from their mouth.</p>
               <p>Now then if all Chriſtians and all the Servants of the Lord in all ages ſtudied to teach their friends and families <hi>the knowledge and fear of the Lord,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> and all the Patriarks, and they had a ſpeciall command alſo to do it as we ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> the ſixt and <hi>Deut.</hi> the eleventh, and when it was the practiſe of all people truly converted to do the ſame, as I ſaid before, and we ſee it likewiſe in the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> how quickly ſhe brought her neighbours and fellow citizens unto Chriſt after ſhee was converted; then I ſay we ought to think, yea we ought much more to beleeve <hi>that theſe Prieſts being thus wonderfully converted spent their ſtrength and might now to gain Diſciples unto Chriſt and that by how much the more they had been his enemies and perſecutors.</hi> And the people without all controverſie would be the readier by far to give heed unto what they taught them <hi>becauſe they knew that they were learned and in that they had a command from God himſelf, to ſeek the law of God from their mouths,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>that the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge and wiſdome.</hi> Yea Chriſt himſelfe ſent the lepers at any time when he had cured them to the Preiſts, and the Scriptures ſufficiently declare, <hi>that the Prieſts were in great eſteem among all the people and that they did mightily prevaile with them, ſo that they could perſwade them to do any thing they would have them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the people ſaw that their Prieſts in great companies were converted, without doubt they ſtill followed their Paſtors and waited upon their Miniſtry; and the law of love binds us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>that abundance of the people alſo were dayly converted and added to the Church by their Miniſtry and Preaching,</hi> and this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reaſon and dayly experience will perſwade every man to
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48122:261"/>
beleeve: for we ſee here amongſt us what miſchiefe a few whib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and unlearned fellows that were Miniſters, have done in ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the people after they revolted from the truth, upon whom they ſtill depend, and what diſtractions among all ſorts of men and women a few unſtable and unconſtant <hi>Preſbyters</hi> hourly make, when for baſe ends they fall from their principles and turne <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Praedicants,</hi> and <hi>Itinerany</hi> Preachers; we ſee I ſay that they have in a very ſhort time with the leaven of their doctrine &amp; with their ſottiſh, wicked and groundleſſe opinions ſowred the whole lump of the ſweet truth of the Goſpell, and ſeduced many thouſands both of men and women (if their gloriation be true.) Now if a few illiterate ſeducers in theſe our dayes have miſled and perverted ſuch multitudes with their novelties, and that without any miracles, without all controverſie that great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Prieſts that were converted, preaching then unto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>the truth of God and the glorious Gospell of glad tydings,</hi> and not their own fantaſies, and the people ſeeing it alſo dayly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them with ſuch ſtupendious miracles, they prevailed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the converting of thouſands: for the example of ſuch men as the Prieſts were, wrought very much upon the people; yea we ſee how it has been in all ages when great and rich men whether Magiſtrates, Miniſters or people, imbrace any new opinion, what way they go, the common people ordinarily follow whether it be truth or error, rather following example then precept, as we may ſee it, <hi>When Moſes was but gone up into the Mount, and that Aaron had built them a calf, they all began to dance about it;</hi> and when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> ſet up his calf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But if any great Noble man, or Courtier, or Parliament man, or ſome of our temporizing Presbyterian Miniſters but turn Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, or is but rumor'd to favour that way, we ſee what revolt amongſt unſetled and ungrounded people their examples make in many places. Whereas the truely godly, &amp; ſuch as are well grounded, know <hi>that the ſtars ſhall fall from heaven, and that they uſually chang themſelvs into Angels of light and ſeem to be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:48122:261"/>
                  <hi>of righteouſnee, that they may the better ſeduce;</hi> yet I ſay, ſuch as fear God and are rightly inſtructed, are not moved, but they abhor the evill of their wayes, and cleave the faſter to the truth, and are of ſuch diſcerning ſpirits as they can well perceive, <hi>that it is for baſe ends and worldly reſpects that many have turned Independents;</hi> and it is well known and can be proved, That the Independents have perſwaded many if they would proſper in the world, that they ſhould turn to their party, for that was (as they ſaid) the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way. And it is taken notice of alſo, that very few but Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents are either greatly countenanced or preferred, or at any time rewarded for any ſervice they have done their Country. Now every generous ſpirit, eſpecially a conſtant well grounded Chriſtian deteſts and abominates all ſuch baſe dealings, and ſuch baſe fellows as will be of any religion for earthly fading momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and uncertain things, and therefore ſtand more ſtoutly to the truth and their ancient principles: yet ſuch as have a mind ſpeedily to get into the chayre of preferment, or to be in any Office, or to grow rich, they turn Independents; and I am moſt confident, that whereas the Independents brag, <hi>that many of the Lords are Independents,</hi> they notoriouſly belye them: but this <hi>I</hi> dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that if Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> can from his great and rich Independent friends, procure a yearly and certain pention to be confirmed upon my lord Tapps, that upon that condition he would turn indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſo then they ſhould be ſure to have one lord of their party; and then alſo Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> might haply attain unto the honour to be my lord Tapps his Chaplain which he is very fit for, and might alſo reſide in <hi>Cambridge</hi> where he may ſo indoctrinate his plumbeous cerebrocities, as he may ſpeedily be able to diviſinate a ſnayle pye or a muſhrome into two particles.</p>
               <p>But to be ſerious, if a few obſcure Presbyters here amongſt us that were never really guilty either of learning or honeſty, revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting once from the truth <hi>through covetouſneſſe and other baſe ends,</hi> have notwithſtanding with their <hi>fayned holineſſe, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their long prayers devoured ſo many widowes houſes, and ſeduced and deceived ſuch multitudes of ſimple people as they have done, and that in a ſhort time, what multitudes of people may all men thinke thoſe learned Rabbies, thoſe Prieſts with all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles daily converted in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>when their doctrine was ſo crowned with ſo many miracles?</hi> If the holy Scripture ſhould
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48122:262"/>
never have delivered it unto the world that they converted innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable companies, yet common reaſon would perſwade every man that they muſt needs have converted many thouſands by the Miniſtry of them all; but when the Scripture relateth unto us, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. and <hi>Marke</hi> the 1. and in many other places, <hi>that all Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem went out to the Baptiſme of</hi> John, <hi>and that they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by him in</hi> Iordan, <hi>and were made good Chriſtians; and when it farther alſo recordeth, that there were three thouſand converted at one Sermon and Miracle,</hi> and ſaith in the ſame chapter <hi>that the Lord added daily unto the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> and when in the fourth chapter it relateth the converſion of five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men more, and in the fifth chapter ſaith, that more <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes both of beleevers of men and women were added to the Lord,</hi> and when in the ſixth chapter it ſaith, <hi>that the word of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and that the number of the Diſciples, multiplyed in</hi> Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem greatly, <hi>and a great company of the Prieſts were obedient to the faith;</hi> all theſe places witneſſe unto the world that they came into the Church in ſuch great bodies as they could not now bee told; for when they came in by by three thouſand at a time, and five thouſand they could ſpeedily be reckoned; but when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe grew ſo great, they were forced then to ſet them downe as it were by whole ſale, not in enumerate parcels, and ſpake of them as of numberleſſe companies, ſaying <hi>multitudes of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, both of men and women,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>mighty congregations and great aſſemblies of both ſexes, in ſuch abundance came in, as they could not be told,</hi> and as if this had not beene enough the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture ſpeakes upon all occaſions of the increaſe of the Word, and ſets downe in generall termes, <hi>that the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>greatly, and a great company of the Prieſts were alſo obedient to the faith,</hi> and as if this had not beene ſufficient in many other places of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there is mention made of the increaſe of Beleevers, and in expreſſe words in the 21. of the <hi>Acts</hi> it is ſaid <hi>that there were many ten thouſands of Beleevers in the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem; now all men know, <hi>that all theſe could not poſsibly, no not a quarter of them meet in any one place or a few to communicate in all Ordinances to edification;</hi> neither was there any place or roome ſpacious enough to containe the very bodies of the tenth part of them, and if any place could have held the tenth part of them, yet then it had beene impoſſible
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48122:262"/>
                  <hi>that they could then have partaken in all acts of worſhip to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for they could not have heard the voice of their Miniſters preaching unto them: for by daily experience wee ſee it, that in one of our Churches here in <hi>London,</hi> which will not, nor cannot hold halfe ten thouſand, that halfe of them ordinarily cannot well heare the voice of the Miniſter, though hee have a ſtrong paire of Lungs; yea, I heare men daily complaine that they could not underſtand the Miniſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preaching they ſtood ſo farre off from him, when notwithſtanding there were not three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand then in the Church; yea, and I my ſelf have been in leſſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where all the people could not heare to edification: and therefore all reaſon will perſwade any man, that is not reſolved ever to reſiſt the truth, that there muſt of neceſſity be many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where there were ſuch infinite multitudes; eſpecially they are bound to beleeve it when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ſo many places, as I have quoted, ſaith there were many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and aſſemblies of Beleevers in that Church, which I have at this time briefly related, that if be poſſible I might at laſt ſatisfie Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> and perſwade him to beleeve the Scripture, and be ſatisfied with it, if hee will not beleeve mee, or be ſatisfied with any thing I can ſay to convince him of his error.</p>
               <p>But if all I have hitherto writ will not ſatisfie his tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and take his ſcruples out of his mind, <hi>I</hi> ſhall now before <hi>I</hi> conclude this point for a Corallary, deſire him to heare what my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> Saint <hi>Hanſerdo, two faithfull brethren</hi> of his ſociety, have writ concerning this buſines. It may be <hi>I.

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> cannot but often make mention of my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>Saint Hanſerdo,</hi> becauſe all the Ill-dependents judge them to bee very honeſt men, and ſuppoſe that they will ſpeake the truth, and I beleeve alſo that Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> hath a very venerable opinion of them both for their ſingular wiſdome and erudition; I intreat <hi>I. S.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt place to heare my brother <hi>Burton ſapientum octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum;</hi> it may be his words may ſatisfie his ſcrupulous and tender conſcience, who in the ninth page of his wiſe booke ſayes, <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:48122:263"/>
                  <hi>the beleevers in</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>when there were but three thouſand of them, and five thouſand at moſt were conſtrained to ſever themſelves into divers companies in ſeverall private hou es to communicate. Saint Hanſerdoes</hi> words are theſe, page 10. &amp; 11. <hi>The Apoſtles and all the Beleevers in</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>met together in one place, to wit, the Temple, and in</hi> Solomons <hi>Porch, and brake bread from houſe to houſe.</hi> Thus they both declare their faith, and opinion cencer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the number and aſſemblies of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that in the infancy of it. Now then when there were but about three thouſand and ſix ſcore ſoules at the firſt and five thouſand in all at laſt, according to the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hanſerdo,</hi> they were then forced into many congregations and companies, as having no convenient place ſpacious enough <hi>as wherein to break bread:</hi> ſo that they were forced to heare the Word <hi>in the Temple,</hi> that is one place, and in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> that is another place, and <hi>to communicate in ſeverall private houſes,</hi> according to my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> doctrin, <hi>and to break bread from houſe to houſe; or houſe by houſe, and that dayly or day by day,</hi> according to Saint <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> learning, that is in innumerable places; I ſay when by the teſtimony of theſe two Seraphicall Doctors it is evident that in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and childhood of that Church <hi>There were many Aſſe blies and Congregations, and that in ſeverall private houſes or from houſe to houſe:</hi> how many congregations and aſſemblies of beleevers may we ſuppoſe were then in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more great congregations and Aſſemblies of Beleevers, <hi>were dayly added to that Church,</hi> and when the holy Word of God in expreſſe termes, in the 21. chap. of the <hi>Acts</hi> ſaith, <hi>There were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ten thouſands of beleevers there?</hi> without all controverſie there muſt needs at that time be a mighty many of Aſſemblies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and yet in the very infancy of it, and when there were but five thouſand beleevers, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerdo</hi> do both witneſſe, <hi>they then had divers Aſſemblies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and communicated in ſeverall private houſes, and brake bread from houſe to houſe, that is to ſay, in every houſe.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have now great hope, that not onely Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the brethren have acknowledged <hi>That there were many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Aſſemblies of beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> but that Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> his ſcrupulous conſcience alſo will be ſatisfied
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48122:263"/>
about this point, eſpecially when it commeth ratified not onely by Scripture, but by the teſtimony and witneſſe alſo of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>Hanſerdo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall ſtill perſevere in the error of his wayes, and ſhall be ſo far from beleeving <hi>that there were many Congregations and Aſſemblies of beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> as he will yet ſwear, <hi>there were no more Saints there, then could or did dayly all meet in one place or congregation,</hi> then I will conclude of him that he is a gentleman very fit to be made a Knight of the poſt, whether <hi>I</hi> ſend him, to be whipped out of his grol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries.</p>
               <p>Having for the gratifying Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and Sir <hi>I. S.</hi> and for the undeceiving of all cordiall and well affected Chriſtians, and ſuch as deſire to know the truth, been the more large in this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; I ſhall now refer my ſelfe and all that I have ſaid concerning my firſt and ſecond propoſitions, to the judgement of every indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reader, whether I have not ſufficiently proved, not onely <hi>that there were many congregations of beleevers in the Church at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, but that it is likewiſe acknowledged by the brethren, that there were many Aſſemblies of them there,</hi> if any credit may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven either to my brother <hi>Burton</hi> or to Saint <hi>Hanſerdo:</hi> and if they ſhall judge that I have ſufficiently proved it, both from Scripture and Reaſon and from the teſtimony of two prime witneſſes of the Independent party, againſt whom there can be no juſt exception by any of the Congregationall way, they being of their own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, Mr <hi>Henry Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> by name; I ſhall again challenge Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his promiſe, who hath ingaged himſelfe, <hi>That if I could by the expreſſe word of Scripture evince there were many congregations of beleevers in the Church at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that he would relinquiſh his grolliſh opinion of Independency.</hi> Now therefore when I have done it both by Scripture and the two witneſſes above ſpecified, I ſay again I challenge his promiſe, and if he notwithſtanding all I have writ, will not abandon this his error, I ſhall never eſteem him to be either a man of faith or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſty, and ſhall for ever hereafter proclaim both himſelf and all ſuch teachers as he is <hi>fighters againſt God and his truth, and reſiſters of his holy Spirit, and ſuch as withhold the truth from the people in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> And ſo I conclude this ſecond Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and come now to ſee what they have to ſay to the third.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:48122:264"/>
My third Propoſition is this, <hi>viz. That the Apoſtles and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Governed, Ordered, and Ruled this Church, conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny congregations and Aſſemblies, by a common Councell and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi> This is my third Propoſition, which is evident out of many places of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and ſundry other places of holy Writ, ſome of which with my Arguments, I ſhall here relate in order as they were firſt ſet down in my book called <hi>Independency not Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> the which Mr <hi>Knollys, I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Anſwer unto. And after I have faithfully related the Arguments I deduced from thoſe ſeverall Scriptures, by which I then made good my third Aſſertion, I ſhall alſo truely ſet down the Anſwer of <hi>Hanſerdo Knollys,</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> to all thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The places therefore of Scripture, with my Arguments gathered from thence, are theſe following,</hi> Acts <hi>11. 27.</hi> And in thoſe dayes there came Prophets from Ieruſalem to Antioch, and there ſtood up one of them named Agabus, and ſignified by the Spirit, that there ſhould be great dearth through all the world, which came to paſſe in the dayes of Claudius Caeſar; then the Diſciples every man according to his ability, determined to ſend reliefe unto the brethren that dwelt in Iudaea, which alſo they did and ſent it to the Presbyters by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. <hi>Here in theſe laſt words we ſee that the Presbyters, and none but the Presbyters received the Almes; for it is ſaid,</hi> They ſent it to the Presbyters by the hands of Barnabas and Saul, <hi>which ſufficiently proveth,</hi> That the Presbyters in all Churches were the men in government, as who had the Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and authority of appointing unto the Deacons, how they ſhould diſtribute thoſe monyes, that they might be beſt improved and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, which is an act of government, as all men (that know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto government) will acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Now ſhould it be granted that theſe Presbyters here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>were the Presbyters of Iudaea,</hi> which notwithſtanding is not ſpecified, <hi>but onely the diſtreſſed brethren in Iudaea;</hi> yet had it been in expreſſe words ſet down, <hi>That the Almes had been ſent to the Presbytery of Judaea, the Presbytery of Ieruſalem muſt neceſſarily have been included in it, as being the Metropolis of Iudea;</hi> and it was an ordinary thing for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that were abroad, and particularly that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to ſend to the Apoſtles and Presbyters of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as we may
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48122:264"/>
ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And by all probability <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> brought theſe Almes to the Presbyters of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> for he in the fifteenth chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> maketh mention of <hi>a contribution that was made in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia <hi>for the poor Saints in</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>Whether the Apoſtle,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was going to Miniſter unto them, and deſired the</hi> Romans <hi>to pray for him, that he may be delivered from the unbeleeving</hi> Jews, <hi>and that his ſervice for</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>might be accepted of the Saints,</hi> which by the learned Interpreters is generally taken that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of this time, and that they were then ſent to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi> But howſoever, it ſhould be underſtood, that theſe almes were ſent to the Presbyters in <hi>Iudea,</hi> yet theſe two concluſions neceſſarily reſult from it.</p>
               <p>The firſt, that this expreſſion comprehends alſo the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> as being the chiefe City of <hi>Iudea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, that the Presbyters in all Churches were the men to whom the government and ordering of buſineſſes was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in whoſe hands the power and authority lay of diſpoſing of the very charity and bounty of the brethren to all the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Diſciples within their juriſdictions, and who gave directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Deacons how they ſhould be diſtributed to the beſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument and benefit of the poor, and according to the intention of theſe benefactors, which, as it is an act of Government, and that a principall one, ſo of neceſſity the Presbyters muſt then meet together, that by their joynt and common conſent and councell, all things may be rightly ordered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in the</hi> chap. <hi>15.</hi> v. <hi>2. 4. 6. 22. the Presbyters of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>by name are expreſſed, and in</hi> chap. <hi>16. and in</hi> Act. <hi>21.</hi> v. <hi>17. 18. in theſe words,</hi> Then they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certaine other of them ſhould go up to Ieruſalem unto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Preſbyters, about this queſtion, and they were received of the Church, and of the Apostles and Preſbyters, to whom they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all things that God had done with them, and how that there roſe up certain of the Sect of the Phariſees which beleeved, ſaying, that it was needfull to circumciſe them, and to command them to keepe the law of Moſes, and the Apostles and Preſbyters came together to conſider of this matter, &amp;c. <hi>ver. 22.</hi> Then pleaſed it the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Preſbyters with the whole Church, &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> chap. <hi>16.</hi> v. <hi>4.</hi> And as they went through the Cities they delivered them the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees

to keepe, that were ordained of the Apostles and Preſbyters which were at Ieruſalem, &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> chap. <hi>21.</hi> v. <hi>17, 18.</hi> And when we were come to Ieruſalem, the Brethren received us gladly, and the day following Paul went in with us unto Iames, and all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were preſent, <hi>and</hi> v. <hi>25.</hi> As touching the Gentiles which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, we have written and concluded, ſay the Preſbyters, that they obſerve no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Out of all which places, before I forme my arguments to prove <hi>That the Church of Ieruſalem, conſiſting of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, was governed by a Preſbytery,</hi> that is, <hi>by the joynt conſent and common Councel of the Apoſtles and Preſbyters, which made but a grand Preſbytery: I</hi> ſhall deſire all men to conſider, that howſoever the Apoſtles in the places above ſpecified, are differenced by that title from the Presbyters, yet in all acts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment performed by them in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they were for the ſubſtance of them ordinary acts, ſuch as Presbyters dayly performe, and therefore anſwerably the Apoſtles themſelves are in them to be conſidered as Presbyters, that is, men governing in an ordinary way, as ſuch as had received the keyes, which is the power of juriſdiction, and therefore were in their ordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (though at other times in their ſeverall miniſtries, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Nation to Nation to preach, as Chriſts extraordinary Ambaſſadours; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. they uſed ſuperlative authority, which God had inveſted them with and graciouſly beſtowed upon them for the benefit of the Church and the good of his people) and I am induced ſo to beleeve, becauſe the Apoſtles in holy Scripture are called Presbyters, that is, the ordinary Governours and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the Church, though the more principall and primary ones, and therefore did act as Presbyters in ordinary acts of Church Government, and for a pattern to all Churches in like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration: Neither may any ſuppoſe, for all this, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did fall lower in their power, in that they acted as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for our brethren do acknowledge, <hi>that at Ieruſalem the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles acted as Preſbyters of a particular Congregation;</hi> Now then if they did not fall lower in their power by acting as Presbyters in a particular Congregation, what reaſon will dictate to any man, <hi>that they ſhould fall lower in their power by acting as Presbyters in a joynt Presbytery?</hi> The truth is, to govern and to rule the Church was the ordinary imployment of the Apoſtles, and therefore they
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48122:265"/>
are ſtiled Presbyters, which is to ſay, the Rulers, Councellours, Magiſtrates, and Governours of the Church; neither, for all this, did their Presbyterſhips exclude their Apoſtleſhips, nor did their acting as Presbyters, deprive them of their Apoſtolique power, nor of that Apoſtolique ſpirit which guided them, even in theſe things wherein they acted as Presbyters; for although under one notion we looke upon the Apoſtles as extraordinary men, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another, as in all thoſe affaires of publique concernment, and in matter of government, and for that end the aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, we do not conſider them as Apoſtles, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did not act as Apoſtles, with a tranſcendent and infallible authority, and in an extraordinary way, but as Presbyters, and ordinary Governours and Councellours, and in ſuch a way <hi>as makes their meetings and actions a patterne and preſident to ſucceeding ages, and of the Presbyters congregating of themſelves together for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acts of Government, whether in a Presbyterian or Synodicall way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as it is in civill affaires, and in the government of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and States, ſo it was then in the Church of God; in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſome of the Counſellors are of the more ſecret admiſſion, and are generally called Cabbinet Counſellors, and are counted of as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary men, and others of the generall &amp; ordinary Councel; yet when all theſe ſit in a Common Councell together, to conſult about matters of State and publique concernment, <hi>they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it then together as ordinary Councellours, and every one of them has as much authority and liberty to debate things by reaſon and diſpute in way of conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to give his vote about any thing, as well as any of the moſt extraordinary Councellors;</hi> and this hath been the practiſe of all ages.</p>
               <p>We read that <hi>Huſhy</hi> when he was by <hi>Abſalon</hi> called into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, had his voice and gave his vote as well as <hi>Achitophel</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of that time; and as in the Common-Councels and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Kingdomes, whatſoever honour, dignity, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary imployments any of them were taken up in before their ſeſſion and meeting, or whatſoever dignity or titles of honour they have extraordinarily above others, and take their places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly before they come together into the Parliament, yet they all ſitting as Judges and Peeres in the Kingdome, <hi>the meaneſt Lord in the Kingdome hath as much authority there as the greateſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:48122:266"/>
and ſo in the Houſe of Commons: as they are Judges, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the people for that purpoſe, have all of them, <hi>even the meaneſt, as much voice and authority in way of conſultation as the greateſt:</hi> And ſo likewiſe in the Synod or Aſſembly now of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, the meaneſt Presbyter hath as much voice and liberty in way of debate and voting, as the greateſt Prelate there.</p>
               <p>And even ſo it was in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Apoſtles thoſe extraordinary gifted men, and the Ordinary Presbyters met together in counſel, they all acted there as counſellors and ordinary presbyters; and therefore in all thoſe particular actions of the Apoſtles, wee have mention of in their ſeverall meetings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee conſider them by themſelves alone, and not joyned with the Presbyters, or in common councell with them, thoſe actions, I ſay, were done and acted by men which were Apoſtles, but not as they were Apoſtles excluſively, ſo as they might not act them under another notion, neither will our brethren affirme it; for if the Apoſtles did preach, take the truſt of the goods of the Church, ordaine Officers, as Apoſtles excluſively and in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, and as by a priviledge peculiar to themſelves, it would follow from thence, <hi>that none may doe any of thoſe things but Apoſtles,</hi> which the Brethren will not aſſent unto: as for ſome inſtances.</p>
               <p>In that ordination of Deacons in the ſixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles there acted partly as Apoſtles, and partly as Presbyters; for in conſtituting an Office in the Church, which was not before they acted their Apoſtolicall authority: but in ordaining men to that office which the Church had choſen, they did act as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and there is no doubt but the Brethren will yeeld to this; for if they will not grant <hi>that the Apoſtles did herein act partly as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, &amp; partly as Presbyters, they muſt then accord, that they acted either onely as Presbyters, or onely as Apoſtles:</hi> If onely as Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, thence it will follow, <hi>that all Presbyters have power, not onely to ordaine men, but to erect a new office in the Church:</hi> If onely as Apoſtles, <hi>then hence is no warrant for Presbyters, ſo much as to ordaine men into any office, nor for ſo much as to meet together to conſult about acts of government, either in a Presbyterian or in a Synodicall way:</hi> and by this meanes all Church government would ſpeedily be overthrowne.</p>
               <p>Neither is it a difficult thing in our Brethren, or any other man
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48122:266"/>
to diſtinguiſh betweene theſe two: for looke by what infallible rule they make ſome thing in the practiſe of the Apoſtles, to bee not onely a patterne and preſident for imitation, but even a proofe of inſtitution, yet decline other things practiſed by the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles as things not onely by inſtitution, not commanded to us, but not permitted to bee imitated by us: By the ſame rule, they may infallibly diſtinguiſh betweene what they acted as Apoſtles, and what they acted as Presbyters, and as ordinary Counſellors, Iudges and Governours; and withall they may infer and conclude, <hi>that what they acted as Presbyters, and by joynt and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it was to give a patterne and preſident to all Presbyters and Synods in all ſucceeding ages;</hi> and as the taking in of the conſent of the Church in the choice of Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. was to give a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for the ſufferage and voice of the people in all Churches to the end of the world, in choſing of their Deacons; ſo for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance, <hi>as there were many Congregations in the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>and divers, Aſſemblies, and all theſe congregations made but one Church, and the Apoſtles and Presbyters who were Officers governed that joyntly and by a common Councell, (as our Brethren acknowledge:) Here likewiſe they left a patterne and preſident to all ages, for ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies in a Citie, or vicinity, to unite into one Church; and for the Officers and Presbyters of theſe Congregations to governe that Church joyntly in a Colledge and Presbytery,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for a third inſtance, as the Apoſtles and Presbyters meet together in a Synodicall way, and the Apoſtles in that Aſſembly acted not by an Apoſtolicall and infallible ſpirit, no more then the Presbyters did, (as when they were writing of Scripture) but ſtating the Queſtion, and debating it from Scripture in an ordinary way, as it is at large diſcuſſed in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. (which wee never reade they did when they writ the Scripture,) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by diſputing, arguing and ſearching the Scripture, found what was <hi>the good and acceptable will of God;</hi> thereupon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the queſtion, ſaying, <hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and us,</hi> as the Aſſembly now of Divines, or any other, for ought I know, upon like aſſurance of Scripture warrant, may doe. In this action alſo, and their ſo doing, the Apoſtles and Presbyters left an example and preſident to all the Presbyters in all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages, what they ſhould doe upon the like occaſions, for the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48122:267"/>
deciding of controverſies and differences of opinions in Religion. viz. <hi>To congregate and meet together in ſome one place, to ſtate the queſtions, and to debate from Scripture, and to follow the written Word, as their rule in all things; and whatſoever they doe, to doe it by joynt conſent, and the the Common-councell of them all, or by the moſt voices;</hi> but in all theſe their proceedings they muſt ever cleave to the rule of the Word of God, or warrantable authority and evidence of reaſon deduced from thence, as then the Apoſtles and Presbyters did; yea, the very name of the Presbyters in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſignifieth the Iudges, Counſellors, Magiſtrates and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of that Church, who had the Keyes committed unto them as well as the Apoſtles: <hi>and by their place were more peculiarly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of that Church, as they were tyed unto it, then the Apoſtles;</hi> as the Presbyters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were in that Church, and were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in their ſeverall places to execute their office, and to looke to their particular charges in the government; ſo that whether the Apoſtles were preſent or abſent, the Presbyters had the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment laid upon their ſhoulders; <hi>and if the Apoſtles themſelves had taught contrary to this Conſtitution, or an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Gal.</hi> 1. I am confident the Presbyters would not have obeyed them, nor have relinquiſhed their authority, neither ought they, but would ſtill have kept that rule, power and authority which God had put in their hands: ſo that for my owne particular, I looke upon the Apoſtles in all theſe ſeverall actions, and in all thoſe acts of government, joyned and met together with the Presbyters, as I looke upon Counſellors and Iudges in the great Councell of both Kingdoms, where all the Iudges have equall power and authority in deciſive voting, and doe verily beleeve, that the Presbyters ſitting at any time in councel with any one or more of the Apoſtles, did act as authoritatively as the Apoſtles themſelves, and I am ever able to prove it and make it good againſt any man, that the Presbyters might as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</hi> as well as the Apoſtles: and may ſay, <hi>we have written and concluded,</hi> as well as the Apoſtles: As any two or three of the Parliament, whether of the Lords or Commons, may as well ſay, wee have made ſuch an Ordinance, as any twenty of them, or the whole Councell, and that without diſparagement or impeaching the dignity of any, when they joyned with them in that worke, and aſſented to it;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48122:267"/>
and in this very notion I looke upon the Presbyters in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> joyned with the Apoſtles, and conſider them, as in my contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations I looke upon the Lords and Commons now ſitting in the great Councell, as the grand civill Presbytery of the Kingdome, where all binding Ordinances are to bee paſſed by the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Common-counſell of them all, and whoſe place and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to command and rule, and the peoples office and place to obey and yeeld ſubjection to whatſoever they command and injoyne, <hi>according to the will of God and for the common good and preſervation of themſelves and the whole Kingdome;</hi> and that whoſoever ſhould reſiſt this their juſt authority, are guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy and are high offenders and delinquents; <hi>for God hath laid the government upon them, and left the duty of obedience to the ſubjects who may not without a publicke call intermeddle with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of government.</hi>

            <div n="401-500" type="pages">
               <p>And ſo in the matters of Church-government, I look upon the Presbyters as Gods <hi>peculiar ſervants,</hi> and as upon the <hi>Stewards, Councellours</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> in the Church, <hi>as men ſet apart by God himſelfe for this purpoſe to be the Teachers and Rulers of their flockes committed unto them in the Lord;</hi> to whom in the matters of their ſoules all people under their ſeverall Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, <hi>ſo farre as they command in the Lord, and according to the written word, are to yeeld obedience, and much to reverence and honour them, and this according to Gods command, for it is his Ordinance.</hi> And they are not to be looked on and ſlighted as the fagge end of the Clergy, as many black mouthes and prophane lips ſpeake of them: for the Presbyters, they have their authority as well grounded in the word of God, as Kings and States have theirs; and therefore as they are imployed in a more ſupreame orbe, and in matters of eternall concernment, ſo they ſhould bee venerated as men watching over our ſoules; and all contumelious ſpeeches againſt them deſerve ſevere puniſhment and ought not to be tolerated: and ſo much the more the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of this Kingdome in theſe our dayes, have deſerved better from the Church, the Parliament and the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kingdome, then any of their Predeceſſors, not onely in their <hi>deſiring a perfect and through Reformation in both Doctrine and Diſcipline, but in that they have ſtood now ſo cordially to the common cauſe, and more for the liberty of the Subject then any before them, and have</hi>

                  <hi>cleaved moſt faithfully to the Parliament, and have beene alſo a moſt ſingular meanes of keeping the people whereſoever they were ſuffered to Preach, in obedience to that great Conncell.</hi> In all theſe reſpects, I ſay, they deſerve well, yea better, not onely from the Church but from all the Kingdome for the preſent, than any of their Predeceſſours, and their memories ought to be famous to all poſterity for this their good ſervice. And that governement that God has given unto the Presbyters, if the Lords and Commons ſhall now labour to eſtabliſh it in the Kingdome, and to ſettle it on them, they may not onely promiſe unto themſelves a bleſſing from heaven, and peace unto the Church and State, but alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall praiſe from all ſucceeding ages. Having taken leave to make this digreſſion, I will now to my buſines, and prove <hi>that the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>conſiſting of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, were all governed by a common Presbytery; and that the Apoſtles there acted as Presbyters among the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that</hi> in the Holy Scripture are called Presbyters, and acted and ordered things in a joynt body and Common-councell, with the Presbyters, and exerciſed that ordinary power that was committed to them in the <hi>18.</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> they acted ruled, and governed as Presbyters; <hi>but the Apoſtles in governing the Church of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> conſiſting of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, acted and ordered things in a joynt body and Common-councell with the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of that Church as Presbyters, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Chuch of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was Presbyterially governed, and by a Common-counſell of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> of this Syllogiſme being proved, the concluſion will neceſſarily inſue. And for proofe of the <hi>Major</hi> the Scripture is cleare, as 1 <hi>Tim. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. where <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto <hi>Timothy</hi> ſaith, <hi>neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee to preach, with the laying on of the hands of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery:</hi> in the which Presbytery <hi>Paul</hi> was one that laid his hands on him, and ordained him, as is evident in the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, ch.</hi> the firſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, where putting <hi>Timothy</hi> in mind of his duty, hee ſaith, <hi>ſtirre up the gift of God which is in thee, by the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of my hands:</hi> ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> joyning in this publicke action of ordination, though an Apoſtle, yet acted as a Presbyter, and counts himſelfe in the number of them, as any of the Presbyters
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48122:268"/>
that now ordaine the Miniſters, may ſay as well as all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to any new ordained Miniſter, <hi>neglect not the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.</hi> As men ordinarily in a Iury, may aſſume that unto themſelves that all may doe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Actors in common. So <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cals himſelfe a Fellow-presbyter, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his ſecond and third Epiſtle ſtiles him ſo alſo, <hi>The Presbyter unto the elect Lady, &amp;c. The Presbyter unto the well beloved</hi> Gajus, &amp;c. So that his Presbyterſhip did not exclude his Apoſtleſhip, nor the acting at any time of a Presbyter, deprive him of his Apoſtolicall power; for at that very time hee cals himſelfe a Presbyter, hee wrore Scripture by an Apoſtolicall and infallible ſpirit, and yet continued ſtill a presbyter. So that for the <hi>Major,</hi> although I ſhould ſay no more it is ſufficiently proved; yet for a further cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration of it, it is not good to reject the conſent of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in this point; for they acknowledge, <hi>that the Apoſtles are called Presbyters vertually,</hi> becauſe, as they ſay, <hi>Apoſtleſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all offices in it;</hi> yea, they further aſſert, <hi>the act of miniſterial power to bee the ſame in the Apoſtles and Presbyters,</hi> the onely difference they ſeeme to inſinuate, is, <hi>in the extent;</hi> from which it may be inferred, that in all the affaires tranſacted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, properly concerning the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they did act as presbyters, becauſe in ſuch acts there was no extent of their power to many, much leſſe to all Churches. But when they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <hi>that the Apoſtles power over many congregations, was founded upon their power over all Churches, and ſo cannot be a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne andpreſident for the power of Presbyters over many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer, firſt I ſay, that the Brethren, in my opinion, take more upon them then beſeemeth them, and uſurpe a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited authority to themſelves, that they can make what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them exemplary only, and reject whatſoever agreeth not with their opinion and humour, though they were all the acts of all the Apoſtles, and tranſacted by joynt conſent, and common agreement and accord, and left in the church of Chriſt, as well for a patterne and preſident for the Presbyters and Miniſters to follow in al ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages to the end of the world, as any of their other acts; and ſo they pick and chooſe at pleaſure, and in ſo doing (under refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be it ſpoke) I ſay they aſſume unto themſelves a greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then beſeems them; for they can make the Apoſtles joynt
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48122:269"/>
governing of one congregation, (for ſo they take it <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> that the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was but one congregation,) to bee a patterne of many Miniſters governing one congregation; but whereas it is moſt evident, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>conſiſted of many congregations, and were yet under but one Presbytery, and was governed by the joynt conſent of the Apoſtles and Presbyters, as under a grand Common-preſbytery;</hi> this at pleaſure they reject and make it no way exemplary and binding.</p>
               <p>But for a further anſwer I aſſert, <hi>that the Apoſtles power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over many aſſemblies, as one Church, to rule and governe them all as one Church, joyntly and in common, was not grownded upon their power over all Churches, but upon the union of thoſe Aſſemblies and Congregations into one Church, which union layeth a foundation for the power of preſbyters ruling and governing many Congregations;</hi> and the Apoſtles practice in governing many Aſſemblies joyntly as one Church, is the patterne and example of that government to all ſucceeding ages; and this preſident of the Apoſtles, the presbyters in all churches ought to ſet before their eyes in all reformation; for what the Apoſtles did in the publicke affaires of government, <hi>they did as preſbyters, and for imitation.</hi> Neither doe our Brethren onely grant the act of miniſteriall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be the ſame in the Apoſtles and presbyters, ſaving in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but they acknowledge alſo, <hi>that they were called preſbyters vertually</hi> as I ſaid before; and that the Apoſtles acted in a joynt body and by common conſent, and affirme <hi>that it was fit that they ſhould ſo doe,</hi> and ſay withall, <hi>that the Apoſtles wherever they came, left the preſbyters and people to the exerciſe of that right which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, although they joyned with them:</hi> Theſe are their formall expreſſions, out of which their conceſſion my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, the whole Syllogiſme, is not onely confirmed and ſtrengthened, but the truth doth more evidently ſhine forth; for if the Apoſtles left the presbyters and people to the exerciſe of that right which belonged unto them, in all churches, and the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters right be to rule as Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrates, as to whom the <hi>power of the Keyes peculiarly belongeth by Gods inſtitution: and the right of the people in all churches, bee to obey, as they are every where commanded;</hi> then it followeth neceſſarily, that it doth not belong unto the people to ordaine either Deacons or Presbyters, whatſoever they may doe in the chooſing of them:
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48122:269"/>
                  <hi>nor to excommunicate or cast out any out of the Church, or to make Members whom they pleaſe, nor to rule and governe the Church,</hi> which is the peculiar right of the Presbyters, left unto them by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for none of all theſe things were ever left unto the people, neither is there any Preſident of it in holy Scripture; ſo that while the brethren ſeeme to contend for the liberty of the people, they plainly overthrow it; for they grant, <hi>That the Apostles left the Presbyters and people to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that right that belonged unto them in all Churches;</hi> the right therefore of the keyes of Government and Juriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth properly unto the Presbyters in every Church, who are the Officers and Magiſtrates appointed by God himſelfe for that purpoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. and therefore when the Apoſtles writ to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to excommunicate that inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, although his Epiſtle be not directed to the whole Church, yet the Presbyters in that Church onely executed that act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which of right belonged unto them, though the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſented unto it, even as we ſee dayly, and experience teacheth us in all well ordered Corporations, when the King or Counſell writes unto any City or Corporation, though their mandates be directed to the whole City or Corporation, for the raiſing either of men or moneyes, or about any other imployment of publike concernment, the Mayors, Aldermen, and Common Councell, and the Officers under them onely manage the buſineſſe; for that is their right and place; and the people under them do yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſubmit themſelvesto what they order and command, and intermeddle not in that imployment, as knowing very well it is their right and place onely to obey. And even ſo it was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Presbyters onely exerciſed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ordered all according to the Apoſtles injunction, and the people aſſented unto it, and ſubmitted themſelves to their order; and the miſtaking of that place and many more hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been the cauſe of ſo much confuſion in the Church at this time, when not onely the men in every Aſſembly, but the very women in many of the new Congregations, as Members, challenge a power and right both in the electing of Church Officers, and of admitting of Members, and of caſting out and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which before theſe our times was never heard of in the world, <hi>when as the right of Juriſdiction and of the Keyes,</hi> (as I
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48122:270"/>
have often proved) <hi>peculiarly belongeth unto the Presbyters; and that the people neither men nor women, ought to intermeddle with it; for if they ſhould, in ſhort time it would overthrow all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Church and State, and bring confuſion into the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I conceive the cauſe of ſo groſſe a miſtake of that place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the excommunicating of the inceſtuous perſon, aroſe from this, <hi>that they look upon the Church of Corinth and the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſpoken of in the New Teſtament, not as Corporations,</hi> as they were indeed, <hi>but as on their now ſucking Independent new Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and Aſſemblies conſiſting of twenty or thirty Members,</hi> ſuch as many of thoſe be, whereas thoſe ſeverall Churches are to be conſidered under another notion, as conſiſting of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, (as that of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem)</hi> united into one Church or body in the ſeverall Corporations, and each of them governed by a Common Councell of Presbyters, and by the joynt conſent of their ſeverall Presbyteries, all theſe ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations making but one Church, though never ſo much dayly increaſed, and keeping ſtill the name and denomination of ſuch a Church, either from the place, City, Country, or Nation, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall language, as the Church of the Jewes, the Greeke Church; the Latine Church: or from the Cities, as the Church of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. All the <hi>which</hi> though they conſiſted of never ſo many Congregations and Aſſemblies, yet they ever kept the name of unity, &amp; were accounted but one Church, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places and Precincts, as at this day the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> though it conſiſt of many Congregations, is counted but one Church, as it is: ſo that I ſay, <hi>the conceiving of the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>and thoſe ſeven Churches in</hi> Aſia, <hi>under the notion of one of their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> cauſed through this miſtake, that great confuſion that is now in the Church, and was the originall cauſe of the opinion of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, when notwithſtanding it is manifeſt, that thoſe very churches were not Independent, but made their appeale to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Presbyters at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> upon all occaſions, as that of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and it is ſaid, that <hi>the Apoſtles and Presbyters came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſider of that matter;</hi> which meeting of the Apoſtles and Presbyters, for Synodicall acts of Government is no weake proofe of their meeting for Presbyteriall acts of Government, unleſſe men will ſuppoſe, that they who were carefull to aſſiſt other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48122:270"/>
did neglect their owne Churches committed to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar charge, and took no courſe or care for the governing of them.</p>
               <p>Yea <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. it doth moſt certainly prove a Presbyteriall government in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> out of the which place I thus argue; <hi>Where the Apoſtles and Presbyters did governe, and many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations were by them ordered and governed, yet ſo, that all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were one Church, there was a Preſbyteriall Government; but in the Church of Ieruſalem the Apoſtles and Preſbyters did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, and many Congregations were by them governed, yet ſo that all theſe Congregations were one Church;</hi> Ergo, <hi>in the Church of Ieruſalem there was a Presbyterian Government; all which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſt out of the places above specified, and from all the former diſcourſe.</hi> For in the 21. chapter it is aſſerted, that there were many ten thouſands of beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which could not all be contained in a few places, but muſt of neceſſity be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into many and ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies, all which notwithſtanding made but one Church, as is evident, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. and many other places, the which congregations could not be one politique miniſteriall Church, except onely becauſe they were united under one Presbyteriall Government, and therefore of neceſſity the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratically and Presbyterially governed, yea, the very mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo often of the Preebyters meeting together, proves <hi>that they met together about acts of Government,</hi> from which I thus argue.</p>
               <p>That Scripture which proves a Presbytery in Jeruſalem, or an Aſſociation of Presbyters in that Church, proves that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church of Ieruſalem did meet together for acts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and did really governe that Church. But, the places above quoted prove a Presbytery in Ieruſalem, or an Aſſociation of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in that Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they prove that they did meet together for acts of Government, and did really governe that Church, and that the Church of Ieruſalem, conſiſting of many Congregations, <hi>was</hi> Presbyterially governed.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Major,</hi> the Brethren cannot deny it; for the very name of Presbytery, ſignifieth a company or common-councell of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, governours, and magiſtrates; now all men know, that gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in common cannot do their duty, but muſt of neceſſity neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48122:271"/>
the work committed to them, <hi>if they do not meet together for acts of Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither can they deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> unleſſe they will deny the Scripture; for that expreſly declareth, that <hi>Iames</hi> and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters met together, and our brethren take their warrant from that place, for their Presbyters meeting apart from the multitude to conſult, and to prepare matters: Yea, it is not onely ſet downe, that <hi>Iames</hi> and the Presbyters met together, which had it onely been for the entertainment of <hi>Paul,</hi> it is an argument ſufficient to convince any rationall man, that if the Presbyters would meet together for a ſalutation, they did much more meet for acts of government: But I ſay it is not onely ſpecified, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters met together, but what they did in conſultation in that their meeting, and what they acted upon deliberation, and that <hi>was to adviſe</hi> Paul, <hi>and to direct him what he ſhould do,</hi> which councell of theirs was not <hi>lax,</hi> but reſtrictive and binding, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>Do therefore that which we ſay unto thee.</hi> By all which it is evident that they met about acts of Government, when they gave an order and rule to <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, how he ſhould behave himſelfe at that time; and we reade <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>followed their councell, and ſubmitted himſelfe to their order;</hi> by all which it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, <hi>that the Church of Ieruſalem was ordered and governed by the joynt conſent and Common Councell of Preſbyters, though conſisting of many Congregations, and was Preſbyterially go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I further thus argue,</hi> Where there were many Aſſemblies in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and many Presbyters, and theſe Aſſemblies were all one Church, and theſe Presbyters all of them Presbyters of that one Church, there of neceſſity there were many Congregations under one Presbytery, and that Church was preſbyterially governed; but in the church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there were many aſſemblies, and many preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and thoſe Aſſemblies were all one Church, and thoſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters all of them Presbyters of that one Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> in the church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there were many congregations under one preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and that church was preſbyterially governed.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Major,</hi> no man of ſound reaſon or judgement will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</p>
               <p>And for the firſt part of the <hi>Minor, that there were many Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in that Church,</hi> it hath ſufficiently been proved in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48122:271"/>
diſcourſe, and is evident out of the 21. chapter, where it is ſaid there were many ten thouſands.</p>
               <p>And for the other parts of it, that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was but one Church, and that all the Presbyters there were Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that one Church, the Brethren themſelves do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it; and they do alſo accord and grant that the Church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was governed by a Presbytery, and that it was Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianly ruled; but withall they conceive the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to conſiſt of no more beleevers than might all meet together in one place and congregation; ſo that the difference between us and the brethren is not whether the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terianly governed or no, for that they do acknowledge, and would have their churches governed after that manner; but this is the debate between us and them, whether there were no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> then could all meet in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which is their opinion; but whether or no it hath not by the foregoing diſcourſe been ſufficiently proved that there were more congregations and aſſemblies in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and a greater number of beleevers then could all meet in any one place or congregation, and that all theſe were under one Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: that I refer to the underſtanding Reader to judge of. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the third concluſion or propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>

                     </gap>t Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>and</hi> I. S. <hi>have to ſay to theſe my arguments. And in the firſt place I will begin with Mr</hi> Hanſerdo <hi>who pag. 11. and 12. thus replyeth to my firſt argument.</hi> The words of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Acts 11. ver. 27. (ſaith he)</hi> which the Doctor maketh uſe of to prove his aſſertion, are theſe, <hi>ver. 30.</hi> and ſent it, <hi>viz.</hi> the reliefe to the Elders by the hands of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> Here in theſe laſt words ſaith the Doctor, we ſee that the Preſbyters and none but the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters received the Almes, which ſufficiently proveth that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in all Churches were the men in government. <hi>To the which argument of mine, Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>page 11. replyeth as followeth.</hi> It is not denyed by the brethren <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that the Presbyters in all churches were the men in the government of the Churches in which they are Elders. But this I conceive (by the Doctors favour) doth not prove it; to wit, becauſe the almes were ſent unto the Elders. Much leſſe doth that Scripture prove that the Apostles and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48122:272"/>
governed and ruled the Church in Ieruſalem by a common Councell and Preſbytery. But in the <hi>15.</hi> chap. ver. <hi>2. 4. 6. 22.</hi> and and chap. <hi>16. 4.</hi> and chap. <hi>21. 17, 18.</hi> The Preſbyters of Ieruſalem by name (ſaith the Doctor) are expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe are Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his own words with his reply and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my firſt argument by which I proved my third aſſertion, in the which I ſhall deſire the Reader to conſider, what he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and what he granteth. <hi>It is not denyed (ſaith he) by the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (meaning the Independents) <hi>that the Preſbyters in all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were the men in the government of the churches in which they are Elders.</hi> Take I pray his own expreſſion. He acknowledgeth, <hi>that the government in all churches was committed to the Preſbyters, and that it lay only in their hands as to whom it was ſolely delegated,</hi> ſo that he granteth as much as I contended for by that argument, by which all judicious and underſtanding men may now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and the brethren do accord unto this truth; <hi>viz. that the people have nothing to do with the government of the churches in which they are Members;</hi> ſo that I have as much aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto by him and all the brethren as I deſire, by the which (if I am not miſtaken) he hath utterly excluded the people in all their ſeven new churches, and in all their new gathered aſſemblies of the congregational way, from any hand in the government of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is not denyed by the brethren that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in all churches were the men in the government of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in which they are Elders.</hi> So that hereafter I hope the brethren will not be ſo inraged againſt me, if I beleeve as the ſeven new Churches beleeve and as all the brethren of the congregationall way beleeve thoſe confiding men: when Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith, <hi>that it is not denyed by them that the government in all Churches is laid upon the Presbyters ſhoulders; and therefore not upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> So that now there is little need of farther conteſting between us about this buſineſſe; ſeeing he granteth, <hi>that the Preſbyters in all churches ought to have the government of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will not be amiſſe a little to take notice of the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the mans ſpirit who grants the thing, and yet wrangles about words, and that wretchedly and poorly; and therefore I ſhall deſire the Reader to conſider what he denyeth in my argument with the reaſon of it: <hi>viz.</hi> theſe two things. Firſt, <hi>that this doth prove it, to wit, becauſe the almes were ſent unto the Elders.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48122:272"/>
                  <hi>that that Scripture proveth that the Apoſtles and Preſbyters governed and ruled the church in Ieruſalem by a common Councell and Preſbytery:</hi> Theſe two things Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmes will not inſue from that portion of Scripture upon which I grounded my argument.</p>
               <p>Now before I come to reply to both theſe cavills of Maſter <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerdo,</hi> I ſhall take this liberty to ſay unto him that as he is a meere novice in Divinity and a foreiner to all good learning, ſo he is but a ſucking polititian, not knowing either his Primer in that art, or his Catechiſme in Theology, or any thing in the government either of Church or State, which is one of the grand errors and hereſies of all his fraternity, who while they pretend to learning and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world they are excellent Stateſmen and Grandees in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they will in time prove themſelves (as they are indeed) a company of grolls and ninnyes; and I hope yet to ſee that day that they wil be as much exploded &amp; bafled out of their fond whimſies, as ever the Prelates were or any diſtempered Sect in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that all men may the better ſee the truth and diſcerne Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>his errors and the groundleſſeneſſe of his denyall of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, who ſaith,</hi> it doth not prove that the preſbyters were the men in government, becauſe the almes were ſent unto the Elders; and that the Apostles and Preſbyters governed and ruled that church by a common councell and preſbytery, becauſe the relief was ſent unto the Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall now upon this occaſion ſpeak ſomething concerning po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, and ſhew wherein the ſoveraign power and authority in all governments conſiſts, and in whoſe hands it reſides; and what are the eſſentiall properties or rather parts of Government in either of them:</hi> So that whereſoever they are exerciſed in any country or common wealth, thoſe men only who are inveſted with them or to whom they are betruſted either immediately by God himſelf or by the election or choice of the people, the ſoveraign authority in thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall governments lies and is depoſited in their hands that mannage them, and in no bodies elſe but ſuch as are allowed of by their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or good liking and love.</p>
               <p>And if men will then ſeriouſly conſider and weigh the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſecular in all States and Countries, and compare the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall with them; which (without any offence) they may do, the truth will more gloriouſly ſhine forth, and the ſtrength and force
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48122:273"/>
of my Argument will be the more obvious to every intelligible creature.</p>
               <p>Now all men know, that have either read or obſerved any thing in Politicks, and the government of the world, <hi>that in whoſe hands ſoever the legiſlative power lyeth, ſo that they can either make or enact new Lawes and Statutes, or repeale or abrogate any old ones, and ratifie</hi> both with ſanctions, <hi>and who have alſo the power of life and death, and the authority of puniſhing all Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricators againſt their Lawes, all men I ſay, know, that the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power and authority</hi> reſides and lyes ſoly and only in thoſe mens hands that exerciſe it: And this is the firſt eſſentiall part or property of ſoveraigne and ſupreame authority in any ſtate, and that declares unto all men who are the men in government there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Eſſentiall part of ſoveraigne power in any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſts in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that they can erect and create new Offices, and new Officers within their juriſdictions, and ſet up new Courts and Iudges, and can conferre Names, Honours, and titles of Dignity upon them ſeverally, and inveſt them all with power and authority to execute their ſeverall places, Offices and Iudicatures; <hi>and this is the ſecond eſſentiall property of ſupreme authority in any ſtate, ſo that in whoſe hands ſoever this power reſides, they onely are the Rulers in that government, and no other perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Eſſentiall part of ſoveraigne power in any ſtate, is this, <hi>to make warre and peace at pleaſure, either forraigne or domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, upon any juſt occaſions, and to have the managing of the Militia,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that thoſe only, in whoſe hands this authority lyeth, they are reputed, and indeed are the ſupreme Rulers in that ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth Eſſentiall property of ſuperlative power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in any government or ſtate is this, to</hi> have a Court of ultimate reſort, to the which all men may fly for reliefe, and to the which all Appeales, by all perſons from all parts, within their juriſdictions, and from all inferiour Courts are made upon any unjuſtice done them there, or upon any preſſures or grievances by any one in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in whoſe power it is to end and determine all controverſies and differences, or to redreſſe all abuſes, and to relieve the oppreſſed, <hi>ſo that in whoſe hands ſoever this authority reſides, they onely are ſaid to exerciſe the ſoveraigne power, and to bee the ſole</hi>

                  </gap>eſideth of diſpoſing the treaſury or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, they and they onely are the ſupreme Magiſtrates and Rulers in that ſtate, as at this day it reſides <hi>with all the former eſſentiall properties</hi> in the hands of King and Parliament, that great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Kingdome; by all which it ſufficiently appeareth, that all ſoveraigne power reſides in them onely, and is ſoly exerciſed and managed by them, ſo that if Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> ſhould ſay that it doth not prove that the government lyeth now in the hands of King and Parliament that great Court, becauſe the contributions, collections, and exciſes from all parts of the Kingdome are ſent unto them, and are now at their diſpoſing, I beleeve the great Councell would teach him a little more wit, and all thoſe his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that ſhould joyne with him in this his argumentation a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better manners.</p>
               <p>Now if wee will compare things together, wee ſhall find, that whatſoever can prove the ſoveraigne power in all ſecular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be in thoſe mens hands which exerciſe it; the ſame may be ſaid concerning the Eccleſiaſticall Government in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and of the Apoſtles and Presbyters of that Church, who were the chiefe Officers, and men in authority in it, that the government and ſoveraigne power in that Church lay in their hands onely. So that it will then undeniably follow, that my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will for ever ſtand good againſt Maſter <hi>Knolly</hi>'s fond ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils for the proving of theſe two truths, <hi>viz. that the Preſbyters in the Church at</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>and in all other churches were the onely Governours in thoſe churches,</hi> and that from this reaſon, becauſe <hi>the almes were ſent unto them, and becauſe they had the dispoſing of the treaſury of the Church:</hi> This I ſay, will in the firſt place
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48122:274"/>
neceſſarily follow. The ſecond truth, that will reſult out of the words, is this, <hi>that the Apoſtles and Preſbyters governed and ruled that Church by a common-councell and Preſbyterie,</hi> both which Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> vainely denyeth, will follow from my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But for the farther elucidation of this truth, and that it may the better appeare unto all men, I will briefly run over the eſſentiall properties, and parts of ſupreme and ſoveraigne power that were exerciſed in that church, and ſhew that they reſided onely and ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Apoſtles and Preſbyters hands, who were the Governours of that church, and that the people had nothing to doe with them; and for the firſt, to wit, the <hi>legiſlative power</hi> it was in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and committed onely into the hands of the Apoſtles and Preſbytery of that church, as who had received the Keyes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. For ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chapter the 2. verſe 2. <hi>out of Zion ſhall goe forth the Law; and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem; and <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. verſ. 2. 3. it is ſaid that Chriſt, for the time that hee remained upon the earth after his Reſurrection, <hi>through the Holy Ghoſt gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements unto the Apoſtles whom hee had choſen, ſpeaking to them of the things pertaining to the Kingdome of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them that they ſhould not depart from</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>but waite for the promiſe of the Father, which was that hee would ſend them the Holy Ghoſt the comforter which ſhould teach them all things, and bring all things unto their remembrance</hi> whatſoever Chriſt had ſaid unto them, <hi>and that hee ſhould abide with them for ever, Iohn</hi> 14. verſe 26. <hi>and leade them into all truth,</hi> and in the fifteenth Chapter hee cals his Apoſtles his <hi>friends, telling them that hee had made knowne unto them all things that hee had heard from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, verſe</hi> 15. and hee promiſed, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould bring all thoſe things to their memories, and in the ſame Chapter in the 26. verſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>when the comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the spirit of truth, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Father hee ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi> From all which places, and from the 28. of <hi>Matth.</hi> verſe 18, 19, 20. <hi>Mark.</hi> the 16. verſe 15, 16, 17, 18. and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 20. verſe 21, 22, 23. and many more that might be alleaged, it is apparently evident that the Apoſtles and Presbyters in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a legiſlative power, ſo that whatſoever they preached
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:48122:274"/>
or writ that wee find recorded in the Holy Word of God, they are all the Statutes and Lawes of the King of his Church Chriſt Jeſus, and by the which all Chriſts ſubjects to the end of the world are to be regulated and governed. The Apoſtles and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had power alſo to abrogate old Lawes, and to enact and eſtabliſh new ones, as wee may ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16. yea, they had power of life and death, of which wee have one example in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Act.</hi> 5. yea, they rayſed the dead, cured the lame, and healed the ſicke with their very ſhadowes, and all this power was given unto them for the ratifying of their authority, and to ſhew they were ſent of God; withall they had the power of erecting new offices and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting new Officers, not onely in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but in all the Churches, as that office of Deacons in the ſixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the office of Elders or Presbyters in the 14. chapter, where it is ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas ordained them Preſbyters in every Church,</hi> and therefore they appointed them firſt in the Mother-church <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, for out of Zion,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>ſhall goe forth the Law and the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem;</hi> yea, they gave thoſe Officers their names, and inveſted them all with power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their ſeverall Offices, as is manifeſt, <hi>Acts</hi> the 6. and in the 20. of the ſame booke, and in the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> They alſo had the power of making warre and peace with the Nations, and all the Inhabitants of the earth; for they preached and publiſhed the glad tydings of peace to all ſuch as received the Goſpel, and denounced warre and death with all manner of judgements to thoſe that obeyed not the Goſpel of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. verſe 8. and to the Apoſtles and Presbyters in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> likewiſe, as to their ultimate and extreme refuge, and reliefe and helpe, all appeales were made (as we may ſee in the fifteenth of the Acts, and in the 6. and in the 9. and in the 15. of the ſame booke) as to the ſupreme Tribunall upon earth in Gods matters, in whoſe hands all the higheſt power and ſoveraigne authority for Eccleſiaſticall matters then reſided, and whoſe place it was not only to hear the controverſies and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of greateſt concernment in Chriſts Kingdome his Church, but alſo to decide and determine them, and put a finall period unto them, the which example of theirs was left as a preſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to all ſucceeding ages for Miniſters to doe the like upon the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48122:275"/>
like occaſions, as in that controverſie that aroſe among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at <hi>Antioch</hi> through falſe Teachers, by whom that hereſie was broched, <hi>viz. that it was neceſſary to ſalvation that the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law ſhould be obſerved, and that Beleevers could not be ſaved without it,</hi> by which great ſcandall was given to the weak lewes, who by this meanes were alienated from the beleeving Gentiles, becauſe they did neglect thoſe Ceremonies, whereupon there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a great ſchiſme and rent amongſt the brethren to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Now for the deciding and determining of this controverſie, the Chriſtians of <hi>Antioch</hi> appeale to the Apoſtles and Presbyters at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as knowing that all power was given unto them both <hi>Dogmaticall, Diatacticall and Criticall,</hi> yea, authoritative and commanding, who entring into a Councell and Synod, and there debating the buſines, <hi>by Reaſon, Arguments and Diſputation,</hi> and finding by diſquiſition of the whole matter, what was the good will and pleaſure of God, what hee had revealed concerning the Gentiles, and the New Covenant under the Goſpel, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whole matter according to the written Word of God, not pretending any new Revelation or new light or any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or ſuperlative aſſiſtance in the deciding that debate, but only exerciſed that ordinary ſoveraigne power in the church of God, which God had inveſted them with, and given unto them in his holy Word the rule and ſquare of all Doctrines, and not onely unto them, but to all his faithfull Miniſters his ſervants to the end of the world; and in the deciding of this controverſie, they firſt ſhewed and put forth their <hi>dogmaticall power confuting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the hereſie, and vindicating the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, they declared their</hi> diatacticall authority, making a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall Canon or Law for avoyding of ſcandall, and abſtaining from ſuch things as gave occaſion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, they exerciſed</hi> their criticall power and judiciary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, verſe <hi>24.</hi> condemning and branding thoſe Teachers with that infamous and blacke marke of Lyers, ſubverters of ſoules and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the Church.</p>
               <p>Fourth. and laſtly, <hi>they ſufficiently manifeſted their imparative and authoritative power in ſending thoſe Decrees unto the Churches of the Gentiles with doe this and live, v.</hi> 29. <hi>for ſo much the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,</hi> all which are acts of ſoveraigne power and authority in all
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48122:275"/>
governments whatſoever, as the learned know which when they reſided in the Apoſtles and Presbyters of the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and were exerciſed by them there; it is ſufficiently manifeſt that all the power of government likewiſe remained, and reſided wholly and ſolely in the Apoſtles and Presbyters hands, and that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed it by joynt conſent, and the Common-councell of them all, for all acts of government ever run <hi>in the name of all the Apoſtles,</hi> or in the name of the Apoſtles and Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they had the diſpoſing of the treaſury of that Church in their hands, as all the Presbyters of all the other Churches had, for they brought the monies alwayes to the Apoſtles, and laid them downe at their feet, as it appeareth, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. and afterwards all the monies and almes were ſent to the Presbyters through all Churches, as in whoſe hands the ſoveraigne authority lay, which they never gave out of their hands or relinquiſhed, but upon all occaſions gave directions to their ſeverall Deacons how to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them for the good of the church, and for the common emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument of the poore Saints: for otherwiſe to what end ſhould the almes and benevolences of the Gentiles be ſent unto the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the churches in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> if they had not beene the men in authority in thoſe churches, and to whom the government of them belonged, and who only and wholly had the diſpoſing of them. Now then when the contribution and releefe was ſent unto the Presbyters of the church in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> as wel as the other churches; it followeth that they and they only had the power and authority in that church which they ever exerciſed by the joynt conſent and common councell and agreement of them all, for it was ſent unto all the Presbyters in every church, and therefore they were in common to diſpoſe of them. Now before this reliefe was ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and long after that, as the ſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> declareth, moſt of the Apoſtles reſided there, and all the Apoſtles were Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (as the Independents themſelves doe acknowledge) and the ſame Scripture that relateth that the <hi>almes and reliefe</hi> were ſent ſpeaking in the plurall number, ſaith, <hi>they were ſent unto the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> now they were all Presbyters, and therefore they were ſent unto them in common; and if wee obſerve the Dialect of holy, writ through the whole ſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> wee ſhall find for the moſt part, if there be any mention made of any act of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that either all the Apoſtles, or ſome more of them are ever made</hi>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:48122:276"/>
                  <hi>mention of to be the chiefe Moderators and prime Agents in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, which was never carried by any one of them, or by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or people;</hi> and it it is credibly beleeved that moſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles reſided in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> or in <hi>Judaea</hi> till after the Councell and Synod at <hi>Ieruſalem, Act.</hi> 15. and for the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> it is the opinion of moſt of the Eccleſiaſticall Writers, that hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Preſident of the Presbytery in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> his whole life time, as hee was Preſident in that Councell in the 15. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and it ſtands with very good reaſon; <hi>for many yeares after he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill the prime man in authority there amongſt the Presbyters, and knew very well the condition of all the Beleevers there, and what numbers and multitudes of Diſciples there were Inhabitants in that Church, all which ſufficiently demonſtrateth</hi> that hee had his reſidence continually, or for the moſt part in <hi>Ieruſalem, ſo that</hi> Paul <hi>comming thither to the Feaſt,</hi> as it is related, <hi>Acts</hi> the 21 chapter, was informed by him, not onely <hi>that there were many ten thouſands of Beleevers in that Church, but what thoſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had heard concerning his preaching,</hi> which ſheweth not onely <hi>that Saint</hi> Iames <hi>had his aboad in that Citie, but that thoſe belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers likewiſe were dwellers and inhabitants there, and that now hee had very good acquaintance and familiarity with them; yea, which is more, at that very time that</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>were ſent to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>with thoſe almes, Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> were then in that Citie, if not other of the Apoſtles alſo, as the twelfe chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> abundantly ſheweth; and without doubt they all joyned with the Presbyters, and in a Common-councell ordered how the Alms ſhould be diſpoſed of by the Deacons to the neceſſity of the Saints; yea, it doth moſt neceſſarily follow (what ſo ever Mr. <hi>Knollys,</hi> and thoſe of his Fraternity ſhall be able to ſay to the contrary) for the Scripture recordeth, that the reliefe was ſent to the Presbyters through <hi>Iudaea,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was the Metropolis citie in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and in the 12. chapter, v. 25. it is related, <hi>that</hi> Barnabas &amp; Paul <hi>returned from</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>whither they had carried the almes,</hi> ſo that many of the Apoſtles being at that time in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the princiall and chiefe Presbyters in that Church amongſt the other Presbyters, it may not bee credited that they I ſay being the prime Magiſtrates and Governours did ſit ſtill and leave the rule, ordering, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Church to other of their fellow Presbyters, and them of inferiour ranke, but they alſo acted their parts in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48122:276"/>
at that time, as well as at others, and therefore I ſay when the diſpoſing of the treaſury of the Church or State, is an Act of ſoveraigne power, and belongs only to thoſe that are in authority in either, and when all the Apoſtles and Presbyters go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned that Church by a Common-councell and joynt conſent, and when the almes were ſent unto all, it neceſſarily followeth, notwithſtanding all Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his garrulity, that my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of that Scripture will ever ſtand good to prove <hi>that the ſending of the reliefe to the Elders, makes good theſe two things;</hi> the firſt, <hi>that the Preſbyters were the onely men in authority there:</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>that the Apoſtles and Presbyters of that Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and ruled it by a Common-councell and Preſbytery:</hi> yea, Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his owne words confirmes mee in my opinion, who ſaith, <hi>it is not denyed by the brethren, that the Presbyters in all Churches were the men in the government of the Churches in which they are Elders;</hi> ſo that all buſineſſes of publicke concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were to bee tranſacted and managed by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and agreement of them all, and not by the determination of any one particular Presbyter in either of thoſe Churches; much leſſe by any other perſons or people in them but the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake concerning the confirmation of my firſt Argument grounded upon that Scripture, <hi>that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and almes were ſent unto the Presbyters of</hi> Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now I come to what he hath to ſay againſt my ſecond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by which I proved my third propoſition, which is this, as he himſelfe ſet it down in the 12. Page of his book.</hi> They that in the holy Scripture are called Preſbyters, and acted and ordered things in a joynt body and common Councell with the Preſbyters, and exerciſed that ordinary power committed to them in the <hi>18.</hi> of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> they acted as Preſbyters: But the Apoſtles in governing the Church of Ieruſalem conſiſting of many Congregations and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, acted and ordered things in a joynt body and common Councell with the Preſbytery of that Church as Preſbyters. <hi>Ergo:</hi> the church of Ieruſalem was Preſbyterially governed, and by a common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Preſbyters. The Major and Minor of this Syllogiſme being proved (ſaith the Doctor) the concluſion will neceſſarily inſue.</p>
               <p>Thus Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> relates this Argument, wholly paſſing by all the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:48122:277"/>
                  <hi>And to this argument he firſt thus replies.</hi> I know not <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that the brethren ever deny ed that the Church of Ieruſalem was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterianly governed. <hi>So that he aſſenteth unto the concluſion, which is all I contended for by that argument; So that by this it followeth that the people had no hand in the government for they are not Presbyters by office. And yet ſuch is his ambition to be thought ſome body in the art of diſputation, that he quarrels the forme of my Syllogiſme, and takes upon him to ſhew me how I ſhould have framed it aright; but all thoſe that know indeed what really belongs to learning will eaſily perceive the man doth but babble, and if I ſhould ſpend time in trifling with him</hi> about forms, moodes, and figures in Syllogiſms, <hi>who knows no more in Logick then the horſe he preaches on, I might be thought as vain as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; therefore intreating him hereafter to learn his Grand-dame to ſuck and not mee to make Syllogiſms, paſſing by all thoſe his grolleries I will ſet down what he hath farther to reply to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the 13. page, and then anſwer to that, and after I have done with him, I will come to</hi> I. S. <hi>that learned Gentleman and profound Clerk. Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>to this argument thus farther anſwereth,</hi> Though the Apoſtles <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> were called Preſbyters in the Scripture, yet it followeth not, that they acted as Preſbyters, but as Apoſtles, <hi>Act. 15.</hi> And they cannot therein be a pattern and preſident for Preſbyters; Firſt, becauſe the Apoſtles had the care and charge of and over all Churches <hi>2 Cor. 11. 28.</hi> But the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters had the care and overſight of ſome one Church onely as <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> Act. <hi>20. 28.</hi> or <hi>Philippi</hi> Phil. <hi>1. 1.</hi> and this the Doctor often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts in his book. That all the Churches we read of in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament (though they were preſbyterially governed) were Dependent upon their ſeverall Preſbyters <hi>page 12.</hi> And ſecondly, becauſe this would make the Preſbyters Independent indeed; for ſo the Apoſtles were in the government of all the Churches; the Preſbyters of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and of all the Churches were Dependent upon the Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles only Dependent on Christ; by whoſe holy spirit they were alwaies guided in the government of their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and therefore they ſaid <hi>Acts 15. 28.</hi> It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and us. And though the Doctor ſay the Preſbyters might ſay ſo, as well as the Apoſtles becauſe the Elders and Preſbyters are mentioned there. The Doctor might have alſo conſidered that the brethren, even the whole Church, the multitude (how many ſoever
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48122:277"/>
the Doctor can make of them) were preſent as well as the Preſbyters <hi>Acts 15. 4. 12. 22. 23, 25, 27, 28.</hi> and ſo have made the brethren, the multitude, even the whole Church Independent alſo; and the Doctor might as well have affirmed, that the brethren even the whole Church might ſay, it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and to us.</p>
               <p>Thus Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> pleaſeth his own humour in heaping up a ſenſeleſſe and confuſed multitude of words and that onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the people.</p>
               <p>But ſhould I make a full diſcovery of all the errours of this his babble and nonſenſe and give a full anſwer to them, truly I might make a very large diſcourſe, I will therefore ſtudy brevity and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him in a few words, though I will omit nothing worthy to be taken notice of. But by the way I may ſay thus much <hi>that this his anſwer is nothing to the purpoſe and his reaſons are as vain, frivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and fond as by the ſequell will appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas he denyeth, that <hi>the Apoſtles though they be called Preſbyters acted as Preſbyters and that they cannot therein be a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and preſident for Preſbyters,</hi> it is a meer begging the queſtion and a fond trifling in a ſerious and weighty matter, when it was ſufficiently proved and that out of the holy Scripture that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles were not onely called Presbyters but that they were Presbyters really as well as virtually (which the Independents themſelves deny not) and that they acted alſo as Presbyters at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> that is, as ordinary rulers and officers in all acts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as alſo in that Councell in the 15. of the <hi>Acts;</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe their example could not indeed have been a pattern of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to all Miniſters and Presbytes in all ſucceeding ages, if in either of them they had acted as extraordinary men, by a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent and ſuperlative power and by an inimitable authority and as men immediately aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt as when they wrought Miracles and when they writ the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now that the Apoſtles in all thoſe acts of government were and are to be a pattern to all Miniſters in the ages to come, all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt of the Independent tribe and all their brethren of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do acknowledge it, and take the ordination of Deacons and Elders in their new Churches from the example of the Apoſtles in the ſixth of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the fourteenth chapter of the ſame book, and they acknowledge and accord that Synods and Councells in like manner are one of Gods Ordinances and ground it upon the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48122:278"/>
Apoſtles and Presbyters meeting in the 15. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and take their example for a pattern and preſident of gathering into Synods and Councells upon the like occaſions, all which they could not do if the Apoſtles in all thoſe acts of Government had acted and managed them onely as Apoſtles and in an extraordinary way with a tranſcendent and infallible authority and by a ſpeciall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from heaven and as only peculiar unto themſelves as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and extraordinary governours. So that whiles Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> fights againſt the truth and againſt mee, he with the ſame weapon wounds his own cauſe and overthrows the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents doctrine, who from the examples of the Apoſtles though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary men take their ordination of Deacons and Elders and of calling Synods. And therefore in the firſt place this may ſerve for the diſcovering of his ignorance and futility.</p>
               <p>As for his reaſons of his denyall that the Apoſtles cannot be a paterne and preſident for Presbyters, becauſe the Apoſtles (as he ſaith) had the care of all churches, and the Presbyters were limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and confined to their particular charges, they are fooliſh and vain, and make nothing for the enervating or weakning of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: for it doth not follow as the learned well know, that becauſe the Apoſtles in ſome reſpects were extraordinary men and rulers, therefore in all acts of Government they did nothing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or for the imitation of other Church governours; I ſay this can never follow with any good reaſon, neither will any judicious man thus argue becauſe the Apoſtles were extraordinary men and officers, therefore they did not the acts of ordinary governours; whereas when they aſſembled themſelves about the affaires of the Church and for the good of it, it was for this very end and purpoſe that they might leave an example and preſident to the ages to come and to all Miniſters that ſhould ſucceed them of doing the like; and therefore we are ever to conſider the Apoſtles in all acts of government to have acted as ordinary governours and rulers, and for a preſident and pattern to all Miniſters to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But whereas Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>grolliſhly ſaith,</hi> that the Apoſtles were Independent in the Government of all the Churches, and that the Preſbyters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Epheſus</hi> and all the Churches were Dependent upon the Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles onely Dependent upon Chriſt by whoſe spirit they were alwayes guided in the government
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48122:278"/>
of their Churches, and therefore they ſaid <hi>Acts 15. 28.</hi> It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and to us. <hi>In every ſentence, I might ſay word, there is an error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For firſt, the Apoſtles were not Independent at all no more then the Presbyters, but they were ever tyed unto the word of God and his revealed will and that by Chriſt himſelf who ſaid <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 14. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them;</hi> Yea Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt. chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19. teacheth us, <hi>That we have a more ſure word of prophecy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we do well to take heed,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Apoſtles themſelves were tyed to the Scriptures. And <hi>Paul</hi> the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles in the 24. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and in many other places makes the Law and the Prophets the rule of his faith, profeſſing that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved all things according to them. So that when <hi>Peter</hi> ſwarved from that rule &amp; began amongſt the <hi>Galatians</hi> to halt &amp; temporize <hi>Paul</hi> reſiſted him to his face and accuſed him openly of prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nay which is more ſo far they were from being indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that they were alwayes to follow the guidance of the ſpirit; they were not to move but as he directed <hi>Act.</hi> 16. Yea the Apoſtles themſelves were ſubject to the Presbytery at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and were to give an account of their actions to them at any time, as we may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 11. where <hi>Peter</hi> was queſtioned, and was forced to give in his anſwer for ſatisfaction; the other Apoſtles alſo were ſubject unto that Presbyterie, and gave an account how they had ſpent their time amongſt the Gentiles; yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe received orders from the Presbyterie in <hi>Ieruſalem, Acts</hi> 21. and was ruled by them: yea, they were not onely ſubject to the Church in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> but to all other Churches alſo, and were ſent on their meſſage at any time. For <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ſent to <hi>Samaria</hi> by the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> the 8. and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſent from <hi>Antioch</hi> by that Church there to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> they were ſent againe to <hi>Antioch, Syria, &amp; Galatia,</hi> ſo that they were as much dependent as any other Miniſters of the Goſpel; and therefore M. <hi>Knollys</hi> is altogether in error in aſſerting that the Apoſtles were independent; neither is that true alſo that the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were dependent upon the Apoſtles any farther then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Lord; for there was a ſpeciall caution &amp; caveat made to the contrary, not only by Chriſt himſelfe, who ſaid to all his Followers and Diſciples <hi>beware of falſe Prophets and falſe</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſts,</hi> but alſo by the Apoſtles themſelves, and that in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at <hi>Ieruſalem, Acts</hi> the 15. who bad all the Gentiles beware and take heed that they liſtned not to any as comming from them, unleſſe they taught according to the word of God and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; yea, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Galatians, <hi>Gal,</hi> 1. verſe 7, 8. gives them and all Chriſtians a ſpeciall charge, that if <hi>hee himſelfe or any of the Apoſtles, or an Angell from heaven ſhould teach otherwiſe then hee had taught them, that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him accurſed,</hi> and the ſame doctrine hee delivereth to the Corinthians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and 11. charging them to take heed of falſ Apoſtles, although they transformed <hi>themſelves into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and injoynes <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to doe the ſame, and in them warnes all Chriſtians to beware of falſe Teachers, though they come in the name of Apoſtles, if they bring not the doctrine of Chriſt, and teach not according to ſound words; and the ſame doth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epiſtles, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in all his Epiſtles, and commandeth them withall that they ſhould not receive them into their houſes, nor bid them God ſpeed; and the ſame doth Saint <hi>Iude</hi> in his, and the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Revel.</hi> the 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. is commended for diſcovering and caſting out the falſe Apoſtles, by all which and many more proofs and reaſons that might be alleaged, it is apparently evident, that the Presbyters did not depend upon the Apoſtles themſelves, but upon Chriſt <hi>whoſe Miniſters and Angels they were, and the ſtars in his right hand, Apocalyp.</hi> the 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. who had their authority and Commiſſion as well from Chriſt as the Apoſtles themſelves had theirs, and who preſerved and protected them as well as hee did the Apoſtles, bidding them not to be affraid what man could doe againſt them, as the ſecond and third chapters of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſufficiently declare: and therefore they were all dependent upon Chriſt, and not upon the Apoſtles (as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> fondly ſaith) who were their fellow ſervants, though in a higher degree and order; and if wee duly conſider the tranſaction of all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines in the Synod at <hi>Ieruſalem, Acts</hi> 15. the Presbyters were as much guided by the ſpirit in that Councell as the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as I ſaid in my Argument, and ſhall by and by, by Gods aſſiſtance more abundantly prove, that all the world may ſee the vanity of Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> who thinkes all men ſhould take for an Oracle every word that fals from his pen, though it be never ſo

erroneous and never ſo lyable to exception and juſt controule as that other of his expreſſions is, where he ſaith <hi>that the Apoſtles were alwayes guided by the ſpirit in the Government of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> in the which words there is a twofold error; for <hi>Peter</hi> was not guided by the ſpirit, neither when Chriſt called him Sathan, neither when he denyed his Maſter, nor when he temporized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Galatians;</hi> beſides the Churches were not the Apoſtles Churches, as he erroneouſly and ignorantly ſpeaketh, <hi>but they were Chriſts golden Candleſticks</hi> Revel. 1. ver. 20. <hi>who walked amongſt them:</hi> And the Apoſtles profeſſe 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. ver. 5. <hi>that they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not themſelves, but Jeſus Chriſt the Lord and themſelves the ſervants of the Church for Jeſus his ſake,</hi> and in the firſt of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> chap. 3. ver. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22, 23. <hi>Therefore let no man glory in men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for all things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollo or Cephas, or the World, or Life, or Death, or things preſent, or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> If the Churches therefore be Chriſts golden Candleſticks, and his Churches and his houſes, as <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 of <hi>Timothy</hi> averreth ch. 3. ver. 14, 15. where he ſaith, <hi>Theſe things I write unto thee, that thou mayest know how thou oughteſt to behave thy ſelf in the houſe of God which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth:</hi> if therefore, I ſay, Churches be the houſes of God and the Churches of the living God, and the golden Candleſticks of Jeſus Chriſt, and he be the Lord of them, and there be alſo a ſpeciall prohibition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Chriſt himſelfe to all his Apoſtles and to all miniſters that they ſhould not Lord it over his people as the Princes of the <hi>Gentils</hi> did over them that were their ſubjects; how then can Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> ſay <hi>that the Churches were the Apoſtles Churches?</hi> Every man I conceive that hath any ordinary underſtanding, that with delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhall read Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> ſcriblings, will conclude of him, <hi>That he is altogether ignorant in ſacred things, and if he had not been a frontleſſe man and without all ſhame, he would never have publiſhed ſo many errors and ſo much ignorance as he hath done to the view of the world,</hi> neither would he ever have ſaid <hi>that though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were called Preſbyters in the Scripture, yet they acted not as Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> eſpecially when it was proved unto him and all thoſe of his fraternity in my firſt book <hi>that they acted in all acts of Government and in that Synod at Jeruſalem</hi> Acts 15. <hi>as ordinary Preſbyters.</hi> But becauſe Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> is not yet ſatisfied about that point nor perhaps
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48122:280"/>
never will be, for the more ample ſatisfaction if not to him, at leaſt to others, I will here prove that point a little more fully; <hi>viz. that the Apoſtles acted as Preſbyters in an ordinary way as the other did,</hi> and after I have done that, <hi>I will briefly alſo anſwer Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>his grolleries concerning the fufferage and votes of the Church and people in that Synod in Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But firſt I will prove,</hi> that the Apoſtles in the debate and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie in the Synod and in that whole buſineſſe did not act as Apostles with a tranſcendent and infallible authority, but as Preſbyters in ſuch a way as makes their meeting a preſident and pattern to ordinary Councels and Synods.</p>
               <p>For firſt <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> though both extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men and indued with an infallible ſpirit, yet were at that time ſent to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ver. 2. as ſervants of that Presbytery, who willingly and in obedience to the order of that Church ſubjected themſelves to their determination, which they would not have done had they acted as Apoſtles and not as Members (for that preſent) of the Presbytery of <hi>Antioch;</hi> now all men know <hi>that they that are ſent as Meſſengers by command and appointment, as they were, were not greater then thoſe that ſent them,</hi> which is one of the reaſons all orthodox Divines uſe againſt <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy, in that the Apoſtles which were in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (Acts 8. 14.) ſent him and <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and therefore they conclude <hi>that the Colledge of Apoſtles had authority over him and that they were not ſubject to him:</hi> And the ſame may be concluded concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Paul and Barnabas</hi> that they were ſubject to the command of the Church: And it is yet more evident out of the ſecond <hi>verſe</hi> of the 15, <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>Acts, Where</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>that when Paul and Barnabas had no ſmall diſſention &amp; diſputation with them, that then they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them ſhould go up to Ieruſalem unto the Apoſtles and Elders about this queſtion,</hi> out of the which words every one may obſerve theſe concluſions following: Firſt, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> uſed not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranſcendent extraordinary and Apoſtolicall authority in that Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither did they challenge unto themſelves an infallible authority for the deciding of that difference, which they might have done if they had then and there acted as Apoſtles and put forth their Apoſtolicall power; yea which is more, it is in <hi>terminis</hi> ſaid, <hi>that Paul and Barnabas had no ſmall diſſention and diſputation with</hi>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:48122:280"/>
                  <hi>them,</hi> intimating by thoſe words <hi>that they argued and debated the matter by Reaſons and Arguments, as the other ordinary Preſbyters of that Church did, which they would never have ſuffered if they had acted there as Apoſtles and with an infallible authority;</hi> and this is the firſt concluſion may be gathered out of thoſe words to prove that <hi>Paul &amp; Barnabas</hi> acted there as ordinary Presbyters, and were not onely at that time ſubject to that Church, but Members of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concluſion that may be gathered out of thoſe words is this, <hi>That they were ſent as the other ordinary officers, and the ſame commands laid upon them that were laid upon the other:</hi> Now if they of <hi>Antioch</hi> had looked upon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Meſſengers indued with Apoſtolicall authority, they would have made ſome difference between them and the certain others ſpake of in that place; but ſending them all with equall authority and with one and the ſame Meſſage and making no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, it ſufficiently proveth <hi>that they of</hi> Antioch <hi>in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment lookt upon them but as ordinary Preſbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third thing obſervable is this,</hi> that Paul and Barnabas with thoſe certain others were ſent as well to the Elders or Preſbyters at Ieruſalem about the queſtion, as to the Apoſtles, <hi>for ſo runs the text,</hi> they were all ſent unto as having equal authority and as the ordinary Governours and Councellours of the Church and as to ſuch as ſat by one and the ſame Commiſſion, Writ, or Charter, and governed with a joynt conſent and by a Common Councel and Agreement: <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are all to be conſidered as ordinary Presbyters in that Councel and Synod; and all this I ſay may be gathered out of that text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are many other Arguments to prove it, becauſe the Presbyters all of them and that all along through the whole debate acted as authoritatively as the Apoſtles: For <hi>as the Preſbyters were ſent unto as well as the Apoſtles and aſſembled themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly</hi> v. 6. <hi>So they did decree and write the Epiſtle as well as the Apoſtles</hi> ver. 22. 23. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>they are called alſo the decrees of the Apoſtles and Elders,</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 21. the Presbyters ſay, <hi>Wee have written and concluded,</hi> manifeſting unto all the World that they in that Synod ſat and acted by the ſame authority and were aſſiſted and guided by the ſame ſpirit the Apoſtles were as ſitting by the ſame Commiſſion or Writ: And therefore when the holy
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48122:281"/>
Ghoſt makes no difference between them in reſpect of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but only in regard of their names, it is a very great raſhneſſe in Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and thoſe of his fraternity to ſay <hi>that the Apoſtles acted not as Preſbyters,</hi> which is indeed to confute the Scripture and all this to delude the poore people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many Arguments more might be produced to prove</hi> that the Apoſtles acted as Presbyters, and were no more then guided by an Apoſtolicall and infallible ſpirit then the other Presbyters; <hi>but for brevity ſake I ſhall only name one more, which is this, in that</hi> they stated the question, and debated it from the holy Scripture in the ordinary way diſputing <hi>Con and Pro,</hi> arguing and reaſoning what they ſhould write, and what they ſhould judge of that buſines, as it is apparent in the <hi>7.</hi> verſe, and many more places in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by their deliberate ſuffrages and diſcourſes in that Councell, and having by ſearching the Scripture <hi>(ſaith the Holy Ghoſt)</hi> found what was the good and acceptable will of God, thereupon they ſay it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us; <hi>as any Synod or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Divines upon the like aſſurance of Scripture warrant may doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I affirme, had the Apoſtles at that time acted by an apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and infallible Spirit, a when they writ the holy Scripture, and not as Presbyters, <hi>they would never have admitted any dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor entred into a ſerious debate and conſultation what they ſhould write and judge of that matter, but would speedily have diſpatched the buſines, and by their Apostolicall authority, and that infallible Spirit they were led with, they would have decided the matter,</hi> and either have ſaid, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old did, or take notice that what wee write are the commands of the Lord, dictated unto us by the Spirit of God, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have</hi> gone to conſult with others about it, or debated the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Arguments and reaſons; which when they did, it is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument to prove <hi>that the Apostles acted as Presbyters in that Councel;</hi> and therfore from all that I have now ſaid it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently evident that all the Apoſtles at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> acted as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that the other Presbyters had equall authority and power with them, notwithſtanding all Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> his bable. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake by way of anſwer to that part of his fond cavill: and now I come to reply to his Grolleries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the votes and ſuffrage of the people in the Church at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:48122:281"/>
whom Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> joyneth with the Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and makes them equall with the Elders in authority, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiving what is meant by brethren there; his words are theſe, page 13. <hi>The Doctor</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>might have alſo conſidered that the Brethren, even the whole Church, the multitude (how many ſoever the Doctor can make of them) were preſent as well as the Presbyters,</hi> Act. 15. 4. 12. 22, 23. 25. 27, 28. <hi>and ſo have made the Brethren the multitude, even the whole Church independent alſo; and the Doctor might as well have affirmed, that the Brethren, even the whole Church might ſay it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us.</hi> Thus Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> diſputeth not onely againſt all ſound Divinity, but againſt all reaſon, whiles hee would make all the people to have equall ſuffrage and voices or votes with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in that Councell; and therefore Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> ſhall never be my Maſter, who had hee known any thing concerning govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either in Church or State, or had hee ever read any thing concerning Councels in either, hee would never have ſo argued: <hi>For Councels in all governments conſiſt of peculiar and ſelect men, who for their Gravity, Wiſedome, Learning, and their inveterate experience are made choyce of, and ſet apart for that purpoſe, and to whom the rule and government of the Kingdomes and Countries wherein they live is committed:</hi> ſo that the ordinary people are not to intrude or intermeddle in thoſe affaires whoſe place it is only to obey and to yeeld ſubjection to their Ordinances, and they that would goe about or indeavour to change this order appointed by God himſelfe, would ſpeedily bring confuſion upon themſelves and others; and as it is and ever has beene in the matters and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the State, and in the Kingdomes of this world; ſo it is in the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt which is his Church, all things are to be managed with order and decency, and by ſuch men only as upon whoſe ſhoulders God hath laid that government, and into whoſe hands he hath committed the Keyes thoſe enſignes of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; now when Chriſt the King of his Church hath given the Keyes to his Apoſtles, and to the Presbyters only, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their hands to the end of the world, they only are to manage the affaires &amp; government of the Church to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all things, whoſe calling and place it is to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, as who have the care of the churches, who are the prime men in authority in them, for the ruling and governing of them,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48122:282"/>
and the people are onely to obey them, and their Ordinances in the Lord, and are not to intermeddle in the government of the Church, or have their voices or votes in matters of government, as hath beene often proved. And therefore Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> in ſaying, <hi>That the Brethren, even the whole Church, the multitude (how many ſoever the Doctor can make of them) were preſent as well as the Presbyters, and had their voices there,</hi> is altogether miſtaken in his commentary expoſition: for he by <hi>Brethren, underſtanding</hi> that the <hi>whole Church, the whole multitude of Believert, men, women and children then in Jeruſalem</hi> (for ſo his words doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) were preſent in that Councell, ſpeakes hee knows not what; for it is moſt certaine by the holy Scripture, <hi>that the tenth part of the Believers that were in</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>could not have met together in any one place, and therefore all the many ten thouſands that were there could not poſſibly have come together in one Synod or Councell;</hi> and beſides the impoſſibility of it, all men know, <hi>that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Synods, and ſuch as have their voices there, are Presbyters and Ministers of the Gospel only, and ſuch as are ſent Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and delegated out of the ſeverall Presbyteries to thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels for the right ordering and well managing of the government in them;</hi> and this is their calling; and for the other people as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Magiſtrates, Maſters of Families, Wives, Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>they are every one of them to continue in that calling and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou God had placed them in,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. and all under authority, are therein to abide, and every one of them to follow their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular negotiations and affaires, yeelding obedience in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places to thoſe that are over them; and women eſpecially by a ſtatute Law from heaven, 1 Cor. 14. <hi>are injoyned ſilence in all the Churches, and are commanded if they have any doubts, to aske their Husbands at home, and to be ſubject and obedient unto them,</hi> they are not to vote it in Synods, neither were women ever that I have read or heard of, before ſuch Teachers as Maſter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and his Fraternity appeared in the world, permitted to have their voices in the Churches and Synods, which when it is an apparent tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of God, I am confident that the Apoſtles and Presbyters then aſſembled in the Councell of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> would not have ſuffered any women to have brake the Lawes of God before their faces; and therefore I may with good authority out of Gods Word conclude, that there was not a woman in that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod;

and agreement had, by ſearching the holy Scripture, found out <hi>what was the good and acceptable will of God,</hi> and from thence had decreed the aboliſhing of the Ceremoniall Law, I ſay, if all the beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the whole Church and multitude as many as can be made of them, as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirms, had been preſent in the Synod with the Apoſtles and Presbyters and ſhould have voted with them <hi>it ſeemed good to the holy Ghost and to us, to abrogate the Ceremoniall Law, and to free the Gentiles from it:</hi> they could not then have been diſpleaſed with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their Order and Decrees, and for obeying their injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but when they were diſpleaſed with him, <hi>for but hearing he taught the Gentiles againſt the Law of Moſes and the Temple,</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently evident, <hi>that by brethren ſpake of in the text,</hi> &amp; by <hi>the whole church &amp; the multitude,</hi> cannot be underſtood <hi>all the beleevers in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, how many ſo ever could be made of them,</hi> as he grolliſhly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth, <hi>could they have all poſſibly met together in one place:</hi> for then they themſelves ſhould be tranſgreſſors of their own Decrees and be offended with others for obſerving what they themſelves had commanded, which is a ſin; and therefore <hi>by brethren there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, all ſiſters are excluded; for they are not numbred amongſt them, and ſo then not <hi>all the beleevers,</hi> for ſiſters alſo are beleevers and of the multitude: and,</p>
               <p>Secondly, all thoſe zelots ſpake of in the 21 chapter, had no vote in that Synod, and were not preſent there; for they were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for Preaching according to thoſe Decrees made and Voted there; ſo that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> in time may come to ſee his Error, and <hi>by brethren there,</hi> and <hi>the multitude,</hi> and <hi>the whole Church,</hi> may very well underſtand that they were ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> were: <hi>viz.</hi> Prophets and choſen men, and aſſiſtants to the Apoſtles, members of the Church in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of which they had ſtore, for many of the Prieſts were converted and were members there, though not fixt Officers and Presbyters, and Elders, as the other were who Synecdochically were called the Church, a part being underſtood for the whole, which is uſuall in the holy Scripture: and to theſe may be added all the Presbyters that came out of all the Churches of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> from among whom thoſe falſe teachers were gone, and had taught among the Gentiles the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Ceremoniall Law, as neceſſary to Salvation, which was a cauſe of their meeting together; and with theſe alſo may
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:48122:284"/>
be reckoned thoſe that came with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to that councell from the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which were the brethren ſpoken of as the Text doth ſufficiently declare, ſo that to all men that read but the 15 chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> with judgement, they will ſoon be ſatisfied, That by brethren and the whole Church, and the multitude there ſpoken of, are to be underſtood, ſome cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen men, men of eminency for all divine knowledge, Prophets who diſputed and argued the buſineſſes there, and debated the matter by reaſon, ſuch as <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> were, for ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh, <hi>and not the people men and women, the whole Church, the multitude, how many ſo ever the Doctor can make of them;</hi> as Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and thoſe of his fraternity dayly though falſely aſſert, and upon this falſe ground and rotten foundation laid in their own brain, would erect and build their new confuſed Babel of Independency, admitting all people both men and women, not onely to Votes in their new Congregations but alſo in Councells and Synods, and free them from all dependency upon other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which tends to nothing elſe but to the bringing in of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in Church and State, and to meer Anarchy, and therefore from all that I have now ſaid theſe two concluſions will evidently inſue and plainly ariſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all the Apoſtles and Presbyters, were all equally Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon God and his Word, and that all the Churches we read of in the New Teſtament were all likewiſe Dependent one upon another, and upon their ſeverall Presbyteries.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the people neither brethren nor ſiſters in thoſe dayes were to have their Votes or ſuffrage in the Government of the Churches, and admiſſion of members and Officers, much leſſe in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi> that imployment belonging wholly to the Presbyters in each Church, whom God had made Rulers in his Church over them, and commanded the people to yeeld obedience unto them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. and therefore that all the new gathered Churches, affecting an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, and challenging their Votes and ſuffrage in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their Churches, are all tranſgreſſors againſt both precept and example. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake in way of Anſwer to Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his vain jangling againſt my third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

Ordination <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> Election belongs to the brethren, but impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands is proper to the officers, where there are officers as in a Church conſtituted and compleat. <hi>Thus profound</hi> I.

               </p>
               <p>Firſt he grants <hi>that the Preſbyters did rule the Church of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem and ordinarily other Churches,</hi> and ſaith, that my Argument hits not the Independents; for they, as he in the name of them all aſſerteth, grant <hi>that it is the Preſbyters part to rule.</hi> So that if he had ſtayed here, there had been ſome ingenuity in him, but with the ſame breath he blaſteth yea bloweth down all that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſet up, and that with a windy vain <hi>American</hi> diſtinction (which he hath borrowed out of ſome of thoſe monſtrous Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets that come from thence, called <hi>the way and the keyes,</hi> &amp;c. which are fraught with nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut Peacocks, Parrets, and Jackanapes or more miſchievous things though gayly ſet forth) with the which he befooles himſelf and amaſes yea deceives the poor and ignorant people whiles they go gazing after them: For ſaith he, <hi>We diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between authority and juriſdiction on the one hand and power and intereſt on the other, and this latter belongs unto the people, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is proper to the officers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But before I come to my anſwer, I muſt tell <hi>I. S.</hi> that from whom ſoever he hath borrowed this diſtinction it is groundleſſe and has no Warrant for it in ſacred writ; yea I hope to make it good that it is contrary unto it, and therefore it was well ſaid by a learned Profeſſor of Divinity in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> that it was an eaſie thing to finde diſtinctions in ſchoolmen to mocke God and deſtroy their own ſouls, and thereupon exhorted all his Scollers to be very carefull leſt out of reſpect to mens perſons and from the conceipt they had of their piety and abilities in learning they were not deceived: And the ſame exhortation may now in theſe our dayes be of very good uſe, eſpecially when a lying ſpirit is gone out into innumerable falſe Prophets as it did in <hi>Ahab</hi> his time and when a ſpirit of error is gone out into the world and is to be found in every houſe of the Independents in all theſe regards, I ſay the <hi>caveat</hi> and exhortation of that reverend Divine may now be very uſefull and ſerviceable for theſe our times. And therefore it ſtands all men upon <hi>to prove and examine all things</hi> according to the Apoſtles rule 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, <hi>and hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:48122:286"/>
Now in Divine matters and in the matters of our God we muſt be eſpecially careful that we ſee a ground &amp; warrant out of his word, or from excellent reaſon or good conſequences deduced from thence; for whatſoever opinion or diſtinction in ſacred things ſhall be brought and propounded unto us, and if it have not its authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ground from thence or ſome example or preſident or ſollid reaſon or good conſequence out of the ſame word to warrant and confirm it, it is to be rejected by all good Chriſtians, eſpecially if it conſiſt of captious, doubtful and ambiguous expreſſions, and which will admit of various and different interpretations, and to all the reſt be found contrary to the word of God, as this grolliſh diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought by <hi>I. S.</hi> doth: for he makes a diſtinction <hi>between au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and juriſdiction on the one hand, and power and interest on the other,</hi> as if there were ſome vaſt difference between them when all learned men know, <hi>that authority, juriſdiction and power are all one,</hi> as when a Magiſtrate making uſe of either of theſe words ſays ſuch an one is under my authority or juriſdiction or power, all men know that either of thoſe words ſignifies his authority over him and thoſe expreſſions intimate one &amp; the ſame thing. But as for the word <hi>intereſt</hi> which he makes a Synonima with power, it is a meer grollery, for that is a word of ambiguity and of various ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, and admits of divers interpretations, and therefore cannot be the ſame with power, the meaning of the which I am confident that <hi>I. S.</hi> himſelfe knoweth not, but this word ſerves the turne of our <hi>American</hi> brethren and thoſe of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall way here to juggle withall: But if a man would but ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider and weigh what the meaning of this word <hi>intereſt</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth in their dialect, and what they underſtand by it, if they would ſpeak out, they ſhall finde that <hi>by that diſtinction of power and intereſt in the people,</hi> by <hi>intereſt</hi> they mean and underſtand a title or right or due in the people, both to the property and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the power in Church and State and beleeve that it is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and radically in the people and that it is properly their due and right, and from them onely delegated to the officers of Church and State, whom as they do betruſt with it, ſo they may at pleaſure take it from them again; and this that <hi>I</hi> now ſay the Pamphlets of theſe times many of them can witneſſe is their meaning by <hi>intereſt;</hi> amongſt others that of <hi>Englands</hi> birth right and <hi>John Lilburns</hi> learned Letter who in the 14 Page of the ſame hath theſe words.</p>

                  <hi>For my part</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I looke upon the Houſe of Commons as the ſupreme power of</hi> England, <hi>who have reſiding in them that power that is inherent in the people, who yet are not to act according to their owne wils and pleaſures, but according to the conſtitutions and customes of the Land,</hi> &amp;c. out of whoſe words it is apparently evident, that they make all power to be inherently in the people as their birth-right, to which they may at any time make as good title and claime as to their inheritance, and that they in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage call <hi>intereſt,</hi> &amp; this alſo can be proved out of many of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents Pamplets, and from their words, that if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Parliament uſe not that power they are intruſted with, according to the <hi>conſtitutions and cuſtomes of the land,</hi> they may at any time by the people be deveſted of it, or at leaſt queſtioned; I am confident I ſay there would be no great difficulty to prove as <hi>much as I now ſay has beene uttered by the Sectaries of theſe our times,</hi> and I am moſt aſſured if they increaſe but to a little greater number, that unleſſe the Lord ſhew his mighty power in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Parliament, if they ſhould in the leaſt diſpleaſe them, and not humour them to their content, they would put that in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and really act what now they but mutter in corners, and ſet forth in libellous Pamphlets, and in warning peeces, as in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons late Warning-peece;</hi> ſo that this truth is very wel knowne that by power and <hi>intereſt</hi> in the Independents language, which they place in the people and not in the officers, they meane <hi>the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and ſupreme authority,</hi> and all ſay <hi>that it is their peculiar birth-right,</hi> and that they are the Parliament and Iudges, and that the officers are but their ſervants, either to prepare matters for their hearing, or for executing of what they would have them to doe, and that whatſoever they ſpeake <hi>of authority and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the officers,</hi> it is onely to pleaſe them a little by putting a rattle into their hand that may looke gayly, and make a little noyſe but have no ſtrength in it: for they keepe all power in their owne hands, and this I hope to make good out of <hi>I.

               <p>To all that I have ſaid for proofe that all the Independents by their doctrine diſthrone Chriſt and ſet themſelves in his place whiles they moſt of all pretend they ſet him up upon his Throne, I may for a corallary add their new traditions and practiſes which they impoſe upon all the Members of their ſeverall new gathered churches as the commandments of God and as the practiſes of the Saints of old, and injoyne them and urge them as the ſtatutes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and decrees of God; yea I might here farther ſhew how they practice contrary unto Chriſt's the King and Lord of his Church commands: For whereas he ſending out his Diſciples and Apoſtles ſetting down the conditions upon which all men ſhould be admitted into the Church, which were <hi>to repent and beleeve and to bebaptized in token of their belieſe and repentance,</hi> which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould accept of and imbrace, they ſhould thereupon be received into Church fellowſhip; the Illdefendents notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding regard not Chriſts commands, but unto it add their own vain traditions, for the which they have neither precept nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in all holy writ nor the practice of any well reformed church; and they force men to conforme unto them, or elſe there can be no admiſſion; howſoever they offer themſelvs to do as much as <hi>Christ</hi> their King commands them to do.

ſuch as theſe are I ſay, make Chriſt a Pagent King and ſalute him with <hi>haile Master</hi> as the Jews did, to uſurpe ſome of their own rhetorick and learned elequence, but indeed they diſthrone him: For what is it to diſthrone a King if writing of <hi>Warning Peeces, and Pamphlets againſt Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſervice and Kings-honour be not?</hi> And what I pray is it to diſthrone a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if this be not to paſſe all acts of Government in the peoples name, and to ſend out all their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and mandates in the peoples name, and to command all their officers to manage all their imploiments in the peoples name, never ſo much as mentioning or taking notice of the King in a publique act of Government? Are not all theſe actions and paſſages to any rationall creature a ſufficient demonſtration that the King in that Kingdome is either abſolutely diſthroned or is but a King to them in ludibry as Chriſt was to the wicked Jews? I am confident that all underſtanding men will ſo conclude.

               <p>
                  <hi>And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken concerning the firſt part of my undertaking againſt</hi> I. S. which was to ſet forth the wickedneſſe of the Independents and to ſhew how by their doctrine they rob Chriſt of his honour and Kingly dignity when they pretend they ſet him upon his Throne, which is an unſufferable blaſphemy in them.</p>
               <p>And now I come to prove againſt <hi>I.

               <p>I undertake therefore now to prove that by this their doctrine, they not onely rob Chriſt the King of his Church of his honour and dignity, which I made good before, but all the holy Apoſtles and Presbyters his Miniſters and Servants alſo of their honour, power and dignity, which the King of his Church the Lord Jeſus had inveſted them with and beſtowed upon them, all which will clearly appear if we ſhall again briefly conſider and but take notice, Firſt what power and authority God gave unto his Apoſtles and to his Miniſters, which was <hi>the power of the Keyes</hi> Matth. 16. <hi>and</hi> Matth. 18. <hi>that is all power in his Church under him</hi> Matth. 28. <hi>and</hi> Mark 16. <hi>I ſay if we ſhall duly in the firſt place but conſider that all the Apoſtles Chriſts speciall Miniſters and Servants were by Chriſt himſelf inveſted with all authority and guided in their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

And ſecondly, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto the people, that which pertained not to them and to which they had no right nor could lay no claime and with which they were not to meddle.</p>
               <p>But take notice of his Doctrine, what hee holds and beleeves concerning the ordinary Miniſters, page 12. <hi>In ordination</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>election belongeth unto the brethren, Jmpoſition of hands is proper to the Officers, where there are Officers, as in a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and compleate,</hi> otherwiſe if the Church be not compleate, according to his learning the people may doe it. Thus <hi>I.

The Officers</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, they excommunicate, they leade and direct in all government and diſputes, they have the executive power, but the people have a power and intereſt too,</hi> that is, in his dialect as hee declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the words going before, the Officers muſt exerciſe all their authority and juriſdiction in the name of the Church, and muſt doe as the people ſhall direct them, for their power is onely the executive power, they are onely the executioners of the church, they can neither elect any officers, nor excommunicate any without they have the leave and good liking from the people; for the radicall and originall power lyes in the people and church, which if it be not utterly to overthrow the authority of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and to make them nothing but cyphers in the Church, and moſt ſacrilegiouſly to rob them of that power Chriſt the King of his Church hath given them, and to arrogate it, and aſſume it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, and whether this be not the greateſt wickedneſſe and injuſtice in the Independents that can be committed againſt men, I leave it to the conſideration and judgement of all conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious and learned men: and whether ſuch temerarious and bold impudent theives and Church-robbers ought not with greateſt ſeverity and juſtice to be proceeded againſt for this their malefice and unſufferable wickedneſſe, who doe not onely take from the Miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>whom they ought ever to have in great reverence for their workes ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. that honour, power and authority Chriſt hath given them, but labour likewiſe now with all their might to take from them alſo that that God hath put into the hearts of men his ſervants to give them, <hi>viz.</hi> their tythes and lively-hood, and all that by which they ſhould ſupport themſelves and their poore Families, which is as intolerable an in juſtice and ingratitude, both towards God and men, as can by mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bee committed, which wickedneſſe of the Independents and Sectaries, if the Magiſtrates ſhall ſuffer to goe unpuniſhed, I moſt confidently beleeve, that the Lord and King of his Church, the Lord of heaven and earth will take the quarrell of his righteousſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants into his hand, and will poure downe his plagues, both on them and all their complices and abettors.</p>
               <p>And now I have made it evident, how they rob all the ordinary
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:48122:293"/>
Miniſters and Presbyters of the Goſpel of their due honour and power, I will make it likewiſe appeare that the Apoſtles alſo are by their doctrine in the ſame predicament, and that they deale no better with them whom they have robbed alſo and ſpoyled of their honour, power and authority, and count of them all no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then of ordinary and common Miniſters, and but as of a company of Executioners: for wee muſt take what <hi>I. S.</hi> ſpeakes in this buſines, to be uttered in the name of all the Independents; for hee is but their mouth, and his booke came forth by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and approbation of them all, and was eſteemed of as a goodly peece, and he highly honoured amongſt them for it.

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:48122:294"/>
as a man doubting and wavering in his opinion, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in uncertainties, ſaying, that perhaps the Apoſtles did not count it ſafe to admit the weake to the diſpute while it was intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ſo that here all men may ſee that hee makes it ſuſpicious and doubtfull, whether the brethren, the multitude, the whole Church were preſent there or not, and that for a double reaſon, both in reſpect of the Apoſtles diſcretion and wiſedome, as alſo in regard of the weakneſſe of the Brethren, ſaying, that the Apoſtles and Elders were but as a Committee to prepare the diſpute, and after reported it for the churches aſſiſtance and concurrence, and ſo hee learnedly concludes and determines by all this his babble that they were all there, and they were not there; where can any man find this creature, and what man of underſtanding is hee that ſhall behold the levity, vanity, raſhneſſe and ignorance of this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to ſay no more, that would not conclude that hee is a meere <hi>Catechumenos, and that one had need to inſtruct him inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing him: for as much as it may ſeeme to any man unmeet that a man ſhould be polemically exerciſed before hee be poſitively princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled;</hi> theſe are <hi>I. S.</hi> his wiſe expreſſions concerning mee in his 16. page, which whether or no they may not fitly be applyed to himſelfe, I leave to the judgement of the wiſe and learned, who <hi>whiles hee will bee a Teacher of the Law,</hi> according to that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. chap. 1. verſe 7. <hi>underſtands not neither what he ſayes, nor whereof he affirmes.</hi> I am moſt aſſured there ſcarce ever in the world appeared upon the Theater of learning a more unlearned payr of wicked triflers then this <hi>I.

S.</hi> by which hee laboureth to prove that which hee himſelfe had firſt poſitively ſet downe to be a truth; to wit, that all <hi>the brethren, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and the whole Church</hi> were together in the Synod; and yet he after doubteth whether they were preſent there or no, I ſay it will not be amiſſe to conſider the reaſons, by which hee affirmes theſe two things; the firſt, <hi>that all the whole Church were preſent in the Synod;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>that they all had their vote and concurrence, without which there had beene no great commendation of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Councell as hee prattles, and without which the Decrees of the ſame had not beene ratified;</hi> his firſt reaſon is this, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>Paul and Barnabas were received of the Church,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they were ſent unto the Church as well as to the Apostles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:48122:294"/>
                  <hi>as if one ſhould thus conclude, the Embaſſadours of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Swede <hi>were ſent unto the King and Parliament, and the Citie of</hi> London <hi>entertained them,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they were as well ſent unto the Citie of</hi> London <hi>as to the King and Parliament; againe, the Citie of</hi> London <hi>aſſented unto whatſoever the King and Parliament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded unto to gratifie thoſe Embaſſadours after they had made them acquainted with what they had done,</hi> Ergo, <hi>all the Citie and the whole multitude of Citizens had not onely their votes and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in thoſe great buſineſſes, and were Iudges alſo in the Parliament, but they were altogether in the great Councell, and that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament could have ratified nothing without them;</hi> would not all men that ſhould heare any man thus argue, gather that that man that ſhould make ſuch inferences from ſuch premiſes, and ſhould ſo conclude, that hee were craſed in his braine, or elſe a very Nin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and void of all reaſon?</p>
               <p>And yet this is the manner of <hi>I.

And that <hi>Iames</hi> after they had held their peace gave in his judgement, to which the whole multitude and Church aſſented: ſo that out of all theſe words it neceſſarily and undeniably

followeth that <hi>by the brethren there, the multitude and the whole Church are to be vnderſtood,</hi> not the common people, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> For it is ſaid they were brethren and therefore all the ſiſters were excluded, who were not at any time permitted to vote in churches 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. And therefore the whole multitude of beleevers were not there, for women were part of the multitude; neither were the weak brethren to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to doubtfull Diſputations by a ſpeciall command from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 14. v. 1. and this is accorded to by the wiſe <hi>I.

S.</hi> from ſuch uncertainties as hee goes upon, to raiſe and make ſuch concluſions as he doth, which tend to no other end, but <hi>for the taking away all the authority and power from the Apoſtles themſelves, which God notwithſtanding had inveſted them with, and to put it into the hands of the people, which they had nothing to doe with;</hi> for as his words declare, hee accounteth the Apoſtles and Elders but a Committee onely, to prepare the diſpute, and then to report it, that they might have the aſſiſtance and concurrence of the people, <hi>without the which</hi> (as hee affirmeth) <hi>there were no great commendation of the reſolution,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>if the people had not aſſented unto the Decrees, they had beene of no effect,</hi> which if it be not wholly to deveſt the Apoſtles of all power and authority, and lay it and place it upon the people, I leave it to the judgement of the learned, then the which there cannot be a greater ſacriledge, and injuſtice perpetrated againſt Miniſters and ſervants of God in the world by any; and as this dealing and proceeding of <hi>I. S.</hi> is moſt injurious to the Apoſtles, ſo this his doctrine is contrary to all divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning; yea, contrary to the very opinion of the learnedſt of the Independents: for this <hi>I. S.</hi> his judgement is, <hi>that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Presbyters without the concurrence of the people and Church, could not have made the Decrees valid and binding,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all the Independents (beſides himſelfe) joyning with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt the Proteſtants, affirme, that the Apoſtles onely in that Synod and Councell, by their infallible authority ratified thoſe Decrees; and ſo they exclude all the Presbyters, ſaying, <hi>that the Apostles acted not as Presbyters in that Councell, but as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>

               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice by way of Anſwer to have replyed to what both theſe Gentlemen Maſter <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> had to ſay to my third Propoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:48122:297"/>
I come now to my fourth, which I will firſt ſet down with their Anſwers to it, and then make my reply as I have done to all their former cavills; and I will go on in the ſame order, firſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> and then to <hi>I. S.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My fourth Propoſition is this,</hi> viz. That the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the government of the ſame, is to be a pattern for all Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and Aſſemblies in any City or Vicinity, to unite into one Church; and for the Officers and Preſbyters of thoſe congregations to govern that Church joyntly, in a Colledge or Preſbytery.</p>
               <p>And for the proofe of this there needs no great diſpute; for all men acknowledge that the mother Church muſt give an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of government to all the daughter Churches; now then when it doth evidently appear, that this mother Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in her moſt flouriſhing condition, and by her firſt conſtitution, was conſiſting of many Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies, and that they were all governed by a Presbytery, or a joynt and common Councell of Presbyters: then it followeth, that all other Churches ſhould be governed after the ſame manner as the mother Church was, to the end of the World; neither doe the brethren deny, but the government of the church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> muſt be the patterne of government to all churches; and therefore out of that miſpriſion and miſtake, that ſhe was conſiſting of but as many as could meet in one congregation, they take the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for imitation, and teach all their ſeverall congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to do the ſame, and to exerciſe the ſame power among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Independent, and to govern with as abſolute an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their ſeverall Congregations, as the whole Colledge of the Apoſtles and Presbyters did in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and from the which they allow of no appeale, as all that know their tenents can witneſſe: So that this laſt Propoſition being ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both by reaſon and the conſent of the brethren, needs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now to this my fourth Propoſition and the Arguments contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſame, Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>thus replyeth Page 14.</hi> Neither do the Brethren deny, but the Government of the Church of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem muſt be the pattern of Government to all Churches. But the Doctor knows, that the brethren deny that the Church of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem conſiſted of divers Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies under a common Councell, Conſiſtory, Colledge, or Court of Preſbyters.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48122:297"/>
And this they have not granted, neither hath the Doctor proved. And this may be ſufficient to be ſaid in Anſwer to the four Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the firſt Question.</p>
               <p>This is all Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath to ſay by way of Anſwer to this my laſt Propoſition; in the which Anſwer of his, I deſire the Reader to obſerve what he in the name of all the brethren granteth and aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth unto, and what both he and they all deny (at leaſt as he ſaith); for he perſonateth them all. He grants in behalfe of them all, <hi>that the Church of Ieruſalem muſt be the pattern of Government to all churches:</hi> And this is as much as I deſire.</p>
               <p>But by the way take notice that Maſter <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> reckons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his hoſt; for <hi>I. S.</hi> is one of the brethren, and yet he Page 13. aſſerteth that the example of that Church is not <hi>bindingly preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.</hi> Now what he and all the brethren deny, if Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> be worthy of credit, are theſe two things, viz. The firſt, <hi>That the Church of Ieruſalem conſiſted of divers congregations.</hi> Secondly, <hi>they deny that the Doctor hath proved it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all the brethren deny (as Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> ſaith) that the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> conſiſted of many congregations, is not altogether to be believed: For my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> none of tne meaneſt of the Brethren, doth not deny it: yea he not onely grants it, but by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments proves that there were many Aſſemblies of Believers in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and therefore Mr <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> in this alſo his aſſertion reckons before his hoſt.</p>
               <p>But whereas in the ſecond place he ſaith that the brethren deny that I have proved there were many congregations of Believers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he being better acquainted with their denyalls then I am, may ſpeak according to his information, and ſo is not ſo blame worthy as in the former of his concluſions; but if it were any thing materiall, or to the purpoſe, I could name ſome of the Brethren of the congregationall way, that told me diſcourſing with them, that by reading of my book they were convinced that there were many Aſſemblies of beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and therefore to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all the Brethren do not deny that I have proved it: But whether or no I have not abundantly evinced there were many Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that not onely out of the holy Scripture, but from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> own words, I leave it to the judgement of all ſuch men as have any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and without prejudice ſhall read the foregoing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:48122:298"/>
courſe, whither I ſend them, intreating them likewiſe with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to peruſe it: and then I doubt not, but whatſoever they have beleeved concerning that buſineſſe, or whatſoever they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly denyed, they will be convinced that I have ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both from Scripture and from my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> own conceſſions that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and withall I am moſt aſſured they will alſo for time to come take heed how they beleeve Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and thoſe of his fraternity upon their bare words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other ſufficient and approved witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice for Anſwer to Maſter <hi>Knollys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I deſire the Reader to hear what learned <hi>I. S.</hi> hath to ſay; He in the 13. Page anſwers thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, ſaith he,</hi> They are not (meaning the Congregations and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Aſſemblies) an example of uniting or aggregation, except it be found that there were many Churches aggregated, which a very facile and ſwaſible Reader may well doubt of, for any thing that hath yet been ſaid to make it good.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer to <hi>I. S.</hi> I ſay that he that is but a very facile and ſwaſible reader, that will vouchſafe to peruſe and conſider but what I have wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t in way of Anſwer both to himſelfe, <hi>Hanſerdo Knollys</hi> and my learned brother <hi>Burton,</hi> will never doubt but that I have ſufficiently made it good that there were many Aſſemblies and Churches aggregated in <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſend all ſuch as are ſtudious to finde out the truth, and to ſhun error and to decline all trivall and fond ſeducers, to what I have written in the foregoing Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſerve for Anſwer to his firſt Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, ſaith he,</hi> If this were granted that many Churches did aggregate and unite in the beginning, yet would not this example be bindingly Preſidentiall, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall deſire the Reader to take notice of the vanity of this Novice, and worthleſſe man who is ſo farr from all learning and knowledge, as he is not acquainted with the very principles of any ſound reaſon or with the Independents doctrine; for he hath the whole Army of the Independents againſt him in this point as well as the Presbyterians, who all acknowledge that the church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> is for its Government to be the patterne of Government to all churches to the end of the World; and that hath been all the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48122:298"/>
controverſie between the Presbyterians and the Illdependents, whether that Church conſiſted of many Congregations and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which if it could be proved they profeſt that then the cauſe was loſt and the day was the Presbyterians; for they all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> muſt be a pattern of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and this Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> in the name of all the brethren aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto in the foregoing words, ſo that theſe brethren are not ſo well acquainted with one anothers minde and principles as they perſwade others they are.</p>
               <p>Now profound <hi>I. S.</hi> denyeth that were it ſo that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> conſiſted of many Aſſemblies, yet for all this that it could not be <hi>bindingly Preſidentiall,</hi> theſe are his words by the which he beats up all the Independents Quarters, to uſe his own rhetorick, and utterly overthroweth that cauſe he as a Champion came out to maintain. Neither hath he onely beat up the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents Quarters, but indeed all the Apoſtles Quarters: For that Government they eſtabliſhed in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Primitive Churches, was left for a patterne of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Churches in all ſucceeding Ages, as not onely the Independents but all orthodox Divines doe accord, yea the Scripture it ſelfe hath commanded it, <hi>Iſaih</hi> 2. ſaying, out of <hi>Zion ſhall come the Law, and the word of the Lord from Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: Ieruſalem</hi> therefore muſt be a paterne, both for doctrine and government, and this al the Independents themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the Scripture in many places ſaith, whatſoever was written was written for our inſtruction; therefore the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Primitive Churches, eſpecially that of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the example of all the Apoſtles, are left for our imitation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. Now when the Apoſtles conſtituted all churches after one way, and aggregated many Churches or Congregations all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Presbyterie, in each of them ſeverally, as in that at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> that Church principally, and all the reſt are left for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of imitation of Church government to the end of the world, and this is confirmed by the Holy word of God, and aſſented unto by all the Learned, from all which when <hi>J. S.</hi> moſt raſhly and wickedly diſſenteth, I leave him to the cenſure of the ſeven new Churches, who I hope will whip him out of their Aſſemblies, with his fooliſh <hi>Flagello flagelli,</hi> for thus ſottiſhly beating up of all their quarters, and renouncing all the Independents Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:48122:299"/>
whiles hee laboured to maintaine them; and this ſhall ſuffice for anſwer to <hi>I. S.</hi> his grolleries to the former Propoſitions concerning the firſt Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Now before I come to my ſecond queſtion, concerning the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Churches, I will ſay thus much by way of Preface concerning <hi>Hanſerdo, I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that as they are very confuſed in their replyes, jumbling things together, that are heterogenious, leaping backward and forwards, picking and chooſing, ſnatching and carping, yea, and trifling about words, as the cuſtome of all the Ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>defendents is, ſo they deale not fairly with mee, nor ingenuouſly, nor Saint-like with the people, whom they deſire to delude, and therefore they paſſe over the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Arguments, never ſo much as making mention of them, and ſlighting all as not worthy the anſwering to, and by ſuch arts as theſe are, they moſt prodigiouſly abuſe the well minded people, and by theſe their unchriſtian, unbrotherly, and wicked dealings, they every day broach their errors with more facility, and abuſe all their ignorant and credulous followers, to the utter deſtroying of many of their poore ſoules, ſome of the which as I am able to prove, were men eſteemed of to be godly, as walking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably, being alſo diligent hearers of the word before they knew them, yet after their acquaintance with them, being firſt by their meanes ſeduced from our Churches, after ſome time they fell from their congregations alſo, into wicked and deſperate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in a ſhort time after, became ſo prophane and beaſtly; yea, ſo atheiſticall, as it would exceed ordinary beliefe to relate, and truly if I had not very good witneſſe to prove what I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my owne knowledge and experience, I would not have mentioned it; but becauſe if occaſion ſerves I ſhall be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many Preſidents of fearefull Apoſtaſies, even amongſt thoſe that were their Schollers, and the Diſciples of the Independent way, I am the willinger to ſpeake of it, that I might arme all men with ſome caution in reading their Pamphlets,
which they write againſt the Presbyterians; for they never deale candidly, neither with them, nor with their own brethren: for firſt they either wholly diſſwade them from reading our bookes, or elſe by their emiſſaries, and rayling Libels they moſt ſhamefully vilifie and belye them ſo, that they come prejudicated to them, and then they ſend their owne putrid and corrupt ſcriblings amongſt thoſe
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:48122:299"/>
of their Fraternity, whom they miſerably cozen and abuſe with their fraudulent jugglings, and that againſt all the Lawes of piety and common honeſty, to the diſturbance, both of Church and State. This I thought fit (I ſay) to ſpeake before I come to my ſecond queſtion and ſeverall Queries ariſing from it, concerning the gathering of Churches, and their anſwers unto them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they rather trifle then diſpute, as will by and by appeare; I ſhall therefore in my replying unto them, firſt ſet downe the queſtion fully with all my queries, and then anſwer to all the materials of their fond cavils and evaſions, with their ſilly reſponſals to them, and after I have done that, I will ſet downe Gods method, and the Apoſtles practiſe in the gathering of Churches, with the manner of their admitting of Members, and then reply to whatſoever they have to ſay againſt my Arguments and Reaſons deduced from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and for further confirmation of the truth, I will adde many more Preſidents, and them undeniable ones of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles receiving of Members, and that into Churches formed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the New-Teſtament forme, according to their owne deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; beſides, thoſe that were received into the Catholike viſible Church, and all without any of thoſe conditions they now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of their Members, and I ſhall by Gods aſſiſtance evidently make it appeare, that God by his holy Apoſtles and Miniſters uſes but one way of admitting of members into the church, whether it be the catholike viſible church, or any particular presbyterian church, whether they be admitted in an ordinary or an extraordinary way, I ſay by thegrace of God I ſhal clearly elucidate this truth, that God uſeth one and the ſame method in gathering his people out of all nations into Church fellowſhip, and the communion of the Saints, which ought to all Miniſters to be a rule to walke by in the receiving in of Members into their Congregations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus ſet downe what order I will proceed in, I come now to the ſecond queſtion betweene us and the Brethren, which is, concerning the manner of gathering of Churches and admitting of Members and Officers,</hi> viz. Whether Miniſters of the Goſpel may out of already congregated Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of `Beleevers, ſelect and chooſe the moſt principall of them, into a Church-fellowſhip peculiar unto themſelves, and admit of none into their ſociety, but ſuch as ſhall enter in by a private co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and are allowed of by the conſent and approbation of all
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:48122:300"/>
the Congregation. And this queſtion brancheth it ſelfe into theſe ſeverall Queries: The firſt, whether for the gathering of Churches there bee either Precept or Preſident in the Holy Word of God, that the Preachers and Miniſters of the Gospel did ever leave their owne ordinary charges, to which they are called, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are fixed, with a command not to leave them, and under pretence of a new way, or a new borne truth, or a new light, did runne about and alienate the minds of the people, well affected formerly to their ſeverall Miniſters, as of duty they were bound, as who had converted them to Chriſt by their Miniſtery, and fed them ſtill with the ſincere milke of the Word, and built them up in their moſt holy Faith: I ſay, the firſt <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether there be precept or example in the Word of God of any true Ministers ſo doing? and whether it was ever heard of in the Apoſtles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, that any beleeving Chriſtians were in great numbers congregated from among other beleeving Chriſtians, and moulded into ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies, as ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct bodies and Churches from them, and who had no Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the other Congregations, nor communicated with them in the Ordinances, but were independent from them, and abſolute among themſelves? and whether this way of gathering of Churches was ever heard of before theſe dayes? and whether this be to ſet Chriſt upon his Throne, to make diviſions and ſchiſmes in Churches, and among Beleevers and brethren, and that upon groundleſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether for the making of any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a Member of the Church, it be requiſite or neceſſary, to the beleeving and being baptized, that they ſhould walke ſome dayes, weeks, moneths, perhaps yeares with them, that they may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their converſation before they can be admitted, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, a confeſſion of their faith ſhould be publikely made before the Congregation, and the evidences of their converſion, as, the time when, the place where, the occaſion how they were converted, ſhould likewiſe openly be produced for ſatisfaction to the Church before they can be admitted to be Members, and if any, either men or women ſhall except againſt their evidence, that then they are not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; this is the ſecond <hi>Quere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is, whether for making any man or woman a Member, or an Officer of a Church, the conſent of the whole Congregation
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:48122:300"/>
or the greater part of them beſides the Presbyters and Miniſters be requiſite?</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether for the admiſſion of any one into Church-fellowſhip and Communion, a private ſolemne Covenant be requiſite or neceſſary for the making of any one a Member, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or refuſall of the which, makes them incapable of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-ſhip and admiſſion? There is no queſtion betweene us and the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, about a publike covenant, for we have Preſidents of that in holy Scripture, in all publike reformations.</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether the women and people, as well as the Presbyters and Miniſters have the power of the Keyes, and whether the women have all their voices in the Church, both for election and reprobation of Members and officers, as well as the men, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conſent of all the women, or the greateſt part of them, bee requiſite for the making of any one a Member or Officer, ſo that if they gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſay it, being the greater number, or allow of it, the moſt voices carry the buſines? this is the fifth <hi>Querie,</hi> the practiſe of the which, as of all the former, the brethren in ſome of their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations hold for orthodox, and thinke all theſe things required of any that offer themſelves to be a Member.</p>
               <p>The laſt <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether the practice and preaching of all theſe things, and the gathering of Churches after this manner, be to ſet up Chriſt as King upon his Throne? and whether Churches and Aſſemblies thus congregated be the onely true Churches, and in the which onely Chriſt rules aud reignes as King, and all other that are not moulded up after this faſhion, bee no true congregated Churches, and in the which Chriſt is not ſet up as King upon his Throne, which is the opinion of the brethren, as wil afterward appear.</p>
               <p>If I have failed in any thing in ſtating the queſtion, or in any of theſe <hi>Quaeries,</hi> the brethren muſt pardon me; for I ſpeak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practice of ſome of their Congregations, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine many of them teach, not onely in their owne Aſſemblies, but in every Pulpit through the Kingdome where they come, as I ſhall be able to prove: And therefore if I have been miſtaken in any thing, they may blame their own practice and teachers, and thank themſelves alſo, that in the ſpace of almoſt three yeares (though it has been again and again deſired at their hands) they have not ſo much as ſet down the modell of their government, and what they would have, with all the appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:48122:301"/>
belonging unto it, that all the world might be out of doubt. What therefore I find practiſed amongſt ſome of the moſt zealous of them, and the moſt approved for integrity, and what I ſhall be able to prove, that I have without any ſpirit of bitterneſſe ſpecified.</p>
               <p>And now according to my method propounded I will ſet down their Anſwers to what all of them have to ſay to the ſeverall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and parcells of the inſuing diſcourſe concerning the gathering of Churches; onely in this I ſhall refer every cavill they make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſeverall quaeries and arguments to their right place; whereas I ſaid before, they had in a confuſed and diſorderly way by ſnatches anſwered to what they thought themſelves beſt able to deal with, eitherwholy paſſing by the main arguments with ſilence, or ſlighting of them with contempt, wherein I ſhall in their due places diſcover their diſhoneſt dealing.</p>
               <p>But before I come to my anſwer, I ſhall deſire the Reader to hear, firſt what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> ſay concerning me about this ſecond queſtion.</p>
               <p>Hanſerdoes <hi>words are theſe Page 14.</hi> And this queſtion <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the Doctor brancheth into ſix Quaries, wherein the judicious Reader may perceive the Doctor (through miſ-information I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) hath miſtaken the ſtating of the queſtion, which he partly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth. <hi>Thus Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>ſpeaks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. S.</hi> his words are theſe Page 15, 16.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion, ſaith he, is of the manner of gathering of Churches and of admitting of Members and Officers propoſed by him: <hi>1.</hi> in the Chaos it ſeemes. <hi>2.</hi> orderly, (as he ſuppoſes) drawn forth into ſix Quaeries, though I dare not ſay there is not interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, tautologie and great confuſion. The nature in which the things are: <hi>viz.</hi> of Quarie, incourages me rather to do ſome thing in them, for that I hope the Doctor will not be great of his own ſenſe, but take an Anſwer of theſe things from thoſe that know the way better then himſelfe, who it ſeems is but a Catechumenos therein. I ſhall here therefore indeavour to inſtruct him inſtead of refuting him, for as much as to me it ſeems unmeet, that a man ſhould be polemically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed before he be poſitively principled. <hi>Thus ſpeakes learned</hi> I. S.</p>
               <p>For my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> good opinion of me and his kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his love towards me I ſhall in their places record them with my due thanks to him for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:48122:301"/>
But whereas Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> accuſeth me of ignorance in the ſtating of the queſtion, and ſaith that <hi>I</hi> have partly acknowledged it, and conceives that this miſtake in me aroſe from a miſ-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: In all he ſaith he playes the vain man; for I am able to prove from their dayly practice all that I there ſet down, and know the queſtion as well as any Independent living, and can at any time make it appear that Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> knows not the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents principles. And ſo far as their New Lights have illuminated the world, ſo far I know of their wayes; and that I acknowledged and no other thing: But why did not Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> in this place, if <hi>I</hi> were miſtaken, honeſtly ſhew me my error? And why did he not as beſeemed a Chriſtian and a man truly fearing God, now ſet down fully and plainly what their Way is that all men may know where to finde them? Theſe ungodly men are not ſo honeſt as to ſet down their way, and yet they pretend others are ignorant of it: when notwithſtanding they know it better then themſelves. In the ſame ſteps of <hi>Hanſerdo</hi> doth <hi>I. S</hi> tread <hi>in accuſing me of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, tautologies and great confuſion, and that I am great in mine own ſenſe, and that I am but a Cateshumenos, and that he knows the way better then my ſelfe, and that he will endeavour to instruct me instead of refuting me, for as much as to him it ſeems unmeet that a man ſhould be polemically exerciſed before he be poſitively prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this wretched man tramples upon me for my ignorance, and vapours at no allowance of his own knowledge, and yet keeps not his promiſe with me, to inſtruct mee, or to ſhew me my error, wherein he proclames himſelfe to be a very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy creature, that <hi>I</hi> ſay no more: for it had been his duty to have ingenuouſly here ſhewn unto me my failings if <hi>I</hi> were in ignorance, and to have truly and uprightly ſet down what their Way is (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he affirmeth he knoweth it ſo well) that all men might at laſt be undeceived if in error. This <hi>I</hi> ſay had been the part of a ſincere Chriſtian and one truly fearing God, in the number of the which <hi>I</hi> cannot think or beleeve <hi>I. S.</hi> to be ſo long as he fondly boaſteth of himſelfe and keepeth not his promiſe: and it is moſt apparently evident to all that have read his wicked Pamphlet that he is in the gall of bitterneſſe and band of iniquity where they find nothing but brutiſh impiety and apparent ignorance: <hi>For he himſelfe, though a great teacher, knoweth not neither what he ſaith nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:48122:302"/>
                  <hi>he affirmeth; who is as apparently neſcient as</hi> Hanſerdo <hi>of the Independents Doctrine, and had need himſelfe to be poſitively prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled before he be polemically exerciſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas <hi>J. S.</hi> accuſes me to be a <hi>Catechumenos</hi> in their principles. I will undertake this upon my life before the whole Kingdome to make it good, that I know the Independent way as well as any Independent in <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> farther undertake if the great Councel of the Kingdome ſhall call me and all the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Brethren before them, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall be better able in halfe a dayes ſpace to deliver in, what modell they would ſet up (if they will deal ingenuouſly before God and the world and ſpeak their conſcience) then they all put together ſhall be able to do; I may perhaps be thought ſomething preſumptuous; But <hi>J. S.</hi> his fond expreſſions makes me ſpeak that I do, which notwithſtanding <hi>I</hi> ſtill undertake to make good.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>I</hi> have not been miſ-informed, there was one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way, and none of the meaneſt of them, hearing my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſpeaking very trivially of me, after he was gone out of his preſence and paſſing a long with a friend of his and of the ſame fraternity, much blamed my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> ſaying, that he had heard him ſpeak as hyperbolically of me both for my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and honeſty as ever he heard man ſpeak of another, and added moreover, that though <hi>I</hi> differed from them in opinion, yet he conceived that <hi>I</hi> was the ſame man ſtill in all reſpects that <hi>I</hi> was when my brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſpake ſo well of me, and ſaid withall that he did verily beleeve, whatſoever Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> ſpake in a vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner of me, that I was better acquainted with their Way then he himſelfe. And there will be no great difficulty if occaſion ſerve to prove all that I now ſay. And therefore <hi>J. S.</hi> playes the child to babble thus to me, who by Gods aſſiſtance and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his might ſhall be able to confound ten thouſand ſuch as he is, and to teach both him and all his complices whether aſſembled or not aſſembled, that their tenents are moſt wicked and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And <hi>I</hi> hope that ſucceeding ages will ſay that God ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to be as good as my undertaking, for in his might <hi>I</hi> ſhall ever come out againſt all the Independents and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries.</p>
               <p>And now I come to anſwer to all their Replies to my <hi>Quaeries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:48122:302"/>
And firſt whereas they babble about the generall ſtating of the queſtion and divide thoſe things that I had joyned together and made but one generall queſtion of, they ſhew themſelves but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers and not ſerious Chriſtians. For I never made any; doubt but that the Miniſters of the Goſpell may gather Churches for God in all ages ſent his Prophets and Miniſters for this very end to gather in the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and all ſuch as belong unto his election into his houſe; for <hi>I</hi> know that the ordinary way to bring men to the knowledge of God and of Chriſt, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts life eternall, is by the miniſterie of the Goſpel, this I ſay is the ordinary meanes God uſes <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of Chriſt,</hi> and this I have learned from the holy Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28.</p>
               <p>And therefore all the pudder that <hi>I. S.</hi> and my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> make with their grolliſh Interrogations about that buſines is but to beate the ayre, and nothing to the purpoſe, and no anſwer to my <hi>Quere,</hi> as the Reader may well perceive, if hee lookes but backe to the <hi>question</hi> and firſt <hi>quere,</hi> neither can my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> or <hi>I. S.</hi> make it good by any one example out of the holy word of God, that the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel, did ever leave their owne ordinary charges, to which they are called, and whereto they are fixed, with a command not to leave them, and that under a pretence of a new way, or new light did run about to gather converted men, from among converted men, and ſo picke out of other mens folds and flocks the beſt and fatteſt ſheepe, and molded them into ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies, as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſtinct bodies and Churches from them, and who had no Church-fellowſhip with other Congregations, but were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent from them, and abſolute amongſt themſelves: I ſay and affirme, that neither my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> nor <hi>I. S.</hi> nor any predicant of the congregationall way can ſhew me any one Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this kind, either in the Old or New Teſtament; and this was the queſtion, whether there were any ſuch thing to be found in the Scripture; and not whether the Miniſters of the Goſpel may gather Churches, as both <hi>J. S.</hi> and my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully make it. Now whereas in the 12. page hee compareth our Churches and Congregations with the Popiſh Aſſemblies, and ſaith, that they profeſſe themſelves to be Chriſtians as well as the Proteſtants, and that their gathering of people out of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48122:303"/>
flocks is as tolerable as gathering them out of Popiſh Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and Aſſemblies; for this is the drift of his reaſon; hee dealeth moſt uncharitably, and unchriſtianly with his brethren; for hee himſelfe in his booke called <hi>Babell no Bethell,</hi> hath there by the helpe of learned <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Chemnicius,</hi> and other Orthodox Writers, proved that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is both Idolatricall and hereticall, and errs in the foundation, and that all the Papiſts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dying in that their Faith and beleefe, are in the ſtate of damnation. So that they being conſidered in his notion, are as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and aliens from the common wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of churches out from amongſt the Papiſts is to open their eyes and to turn them from darkneſſe to light &amp; from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God, and as bringing men out of heatheniſh idolatry or from Jewiſh obſtinacy, from the companies and congregations of the which all Chriſtians have an injunction to come out, they being commanded to come out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ſay in that my brother <hi>Burton</hi> compares all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian brethren in our congregations to the idolatrous Papiſts, he ſheweth the uncharitable opinion he hath of us all, ſo that now it is no wonder that upon all occaſions he proclames us all the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt and his Kingdome. But bleſſed be God, <hi>We beleeve that through the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt we ſhall be ſaved</hi> as well as any Independents think they ſhall be ſaved <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Seeing God hath put no difference between us &amp; them puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our hearts by Faith.</hi> And therefore he deals very unchriſtianly &amp; unbrotherly with us to compare us to the Papiſts, eſpecially when according to our Covenant our Pariſhes and Churches are purged both of the Service Book &amp; Hierarchy and all Popiſh Superſtition, as he himſelf acknowledgeth in the 13. <hi>page</hi> of his uncharitable Pamphles: and therefore this his inſtance of gathering Churches out of our congregations who beleeve in God as well as they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers not to the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for his other inſtance in the 13. Page,</hi> Where he asks me if I know not that the ancient Church of the Jews was then a Church when the Apoſtles by their preaching gathered a Church out of it? a Christian Church out of the Iewiſh Synagogues?</p>
               <p>For Anſwer, I ſay firſt, that I well ſee (and that without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles) that by theſe ſtones he hurls at all his brethren, and caſts up duſt yea dirt thus in their faces (to uſurp his own expreſſion) <hi>pa.</hi> 13.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48122:303"/>
that he ſhews his want of love and charity to us, comparing our congregations and Churches at every turn to the Popiſh and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Synagogues, and eſteeming of the gathering out of people from amongſt us, to be the ſame with gathering men and women from out of their Idolatricall and Jewiſh Aſſemblies: for why otherwiſe if this be not his meaning, doth he bring his inſtances from both the Papiſts and the Jews at every turn? and therefore for his ſo dealing, in the firſt place I anſwer, that he is very injurious to his Brethren and muſt ſeriouſly repent for this uncharitable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer that my brother <hi>Burton</hi> is much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: for the Apoſtles did not gather Chriſtian Churches out of the Jewiſh Synagogues, as we may ſee in the ſecond of <hi>Iames</hi> and through the whole ſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where we finde that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in all their peregrinations ever frequented the Synagogues and preached unto them there, and our Saviour himſelfe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſcandalls in that Church and all their traditions, preached daily in the Temple and in their Synagogues, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture relates; yea and the Apoſtles themſelves after Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection preached dayly in the Temple and in all Synagogues wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they journyed; yea Chriſt himſelfe commanded all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, the whole multitude with his own Diſciples and Apoſtles to hear the Phariſees <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. And without doubt they did obey their Maſter and made no ſeparation from the Synagogues and S <hi>Paul</hi> in the 10. to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> blameth thoſe that did leave the aſſembling of themſelves together: therefore he did not allow of a ſeparation from the Synagogues and from Chriſtian Aſſemblies and moulding themſelves into ſeparate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, under a pretence of a more refined holineſſe and pure partaking in the ordinances, which is the pretence of all ſtraglers; all ſuch proceedings were contrary both to the precept &amp; example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles who taught and practiced the contrary, Chriſt commanding the man out of whom he had caſt the devills, and that would have followed him, that he ſhould go to his own friends and abide amongſt them ſtill; and he ever ſent all thoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers he cured to the Prieſts; he never gathered Churches out of the Jewiſh churches, neither did ever any of the Apoſtles or godly Miniſters do any ſuch thing, but blamed it in all; and therefore the Independents going againſt both precept and example, are
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:48122:304"/>
highly diſobedient to God, and have for theſe their wicked and ungodly practiſes a great deal to repent of and to anſwer for: And if we will compare times with times, we may beleeve it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews as it was amongſt us under the Prelates raign and power, thoſe godly and powerfull Miniſters ſuch as my reverend Tutor Maſter <hi>Richard Rogers, Mr John Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham</hi> and Mr <hi>Dod</hi> and others; when they ſometimes went to viſit their friends through City and Country by their preaching they gained many Souls unto God in many Towns and Villages, where after they had (through the bleſſing of God upon their Miniſtery) conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, they left them ſtill abiding in their ſeverall Pariſhes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning them diligently and carefully to wait upon their Miniſters there, diſſwading them from ſeparation upon all occaſions; and ſo it was amongſt the Jews, they came out to the Miniſtry and Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> and heard him upon every opportunity, but never left their own Synagogues and their own Miniſters, as the Scripture relateth, when they returned to their ſeverall abodes, and ſo they went out to hear Chriſt and his Diſciples as occaſion ſerved, and then returned home again to wait upon the ordinances in their ſeverall dwelling places, and they had Chriſts command to do this, neither is it ever recorded in all the New Teſtament, but in the tenth <hi>chapter</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, that the Chriſtians relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the Jewiſh Aſſemblies,</hi> for which they are greatly blamed by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> And I am confident if all the Independents doe not ſeriouſly repent of their wicked and phariſaicall ſeparation from our Aſſemblies, the Lord will ſhew at laſt ſome fearfull judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them. For I affirme it, they have not one preſident for all theſe their practices in the whole Book of God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> inſtance of the Apoſtles gathering of Chriſtian churches from out of the Jewiſh Synagogues, as it is in all reſpects unchriſtianlyand and deceitfully done to delude his fellows, ſo it is not true that he averreth: <hi>For the Apostles did never gather Chriſtian Churches out of the Iewiſh Synagogues:</hi> for they had a command from Chriſt to the contrary; <hi>neither was there any cauſe for any Chriſtians to ſeparate from them; for they exerciſed at that time nothing but the Morall Worſhip in their Synagogues, having Moſes and the Prophets dayly read and interpreted unto them</hi> Acts 15. 21. <hi>and to thoſe Synagogues that unerring Councell at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, conſisting of all the Apoſtles and Preſbyters</hi> Act. 15. <hi>did</hi>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:48122:304"/>
                  <hi>ſend all the people and their ſeverall cities to be inſtructed in Moſes;</hi> therefore the Apoſtles and Miniſters of thoſe times never gathered Chriſtian Churches out of the Jewiſh Synagogues, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> would infer to make good their wicked ſeparations from us; and <hi>their gathering of their Churches out of our Chriſtian and beleeving Aſſemblies,</hi> which, I am ever, by Gods aſſiſtance, able to make good, is nothing to the queſtion that I propounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the gathering of Churches out of already gathered Churches.</hi> And therefore hitherto my brother <hi>Burton</hi> hath befooled himſelf to no purpoſe but to diſcover unto the World how little skill he hath in Divinity when he is out of a common place wherein every child may learn as much and far more then he can teach him. And this anſwer to my brother <hi>Burton</hi> concerning <hi>gathering of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches out of Iewiſh Synagogues for the juſtifying of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable ſeparation,</hi> may ſerve to the ſame objection whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Reader ſhall meet with it, as Page 18, &amp;c. And this might ſuffice to have anſwered to what my brother <hi>Burton</hi> had to ſay to the firſt <hi>Quaerie</hi> concerning <hi>gathering Churches out of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> But becauſe my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> conceives that if they ſhould not ſeparate themſelves from our Chriſtian Aſſemblies (whom he ſaith do not come up cloſe to the rule) into their ſeveral new gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Congregations, they could not ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne as not making his word the rule of reformation or a ſufficient rule up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we muſt neceſſarily depend, for the form and law of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and that we ought not to wait on men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon propoundeth a <hi>quaerie</hi> to me Page 19. thinking by this means the better to juſtifie their unwarrantable proceedings: therefore I ſhall firſt gratifie my brothers deſire and anſwer to his demand and then I will paſſe on to reply to what he and his complices have to ſay to my five other <hi>quaeries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will ſet downe my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> oowne words which are theſe, p. 19. <hi>ſeeing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wee have all bound our ſelves by ſolemne Covenant to reforme our ſelves, and thoſe under our charge, according to the word of God; yea, and every one to goe before others in this Reformation; tell me now Brother</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>if it were not a matter worth the while for our Reverend and Learned Aſſembly, ſeriouſly to take into debate, whether the general tying up of men to waite neceſſarily on the Synod for its finall reſolution about Church government, be not an uſurpation upon our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>

               <p>But for anſwer, I expected that he ſhould have produced ſome command or example out of Gods Word, for the ratifying of this their practice in their new congregations; for that is ever to be the rule of Chriſtians obedience, and where our King Chriſt Jeſus hath ceaſed to command, there all his ſervants muſt ceaſe to obey; now when theſe of the congregationall way have neither precept nor preſident for theſe their proceedings in their admiſſion of Members, it is but a vaine tradition of their owne braine and ought by all Chriſts true Diſciples to be abhorred and abominated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But whereas my brother</hi> Burton <hi>ſaith,</hi> that they that are to walk together, ſhould first be agreed together, <hi>and cites theſe words out of third of</hi> Amos ver. <hi>3.</hi> Can two walke together except they be agreed? <hi>To this I thus Reply:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that if the Independents were Gods, and all the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians went on in wicked and ſinfull courſes, then this queſtion of his had been to the purpoſe; but when it is certain that the Illde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents are ſinners as well as the other Sonnes and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> and many of them known to be notoriouſly ſcandalous, not onely for their damnable and hereticall opinions and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall doctrines, but for their lying, rayling, hypocriſie, pride, covetouſneſſe, &amp;c. and all of them guilty of the ſin of ſeducing and miſleading the poor people; I ſay in all theſe regards, I ſee no reaſon why there ſhould be any neceſſity layd upon Gods heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and people to be acquainted with them and their ways, except it be that all ſuch as fear God and will walk in his pathes, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, may ſhun them and their by-wayes, which they are bound to do both from precept <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and from the example of our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. where it is ſaid <hi>that Ieſus did not commit himſelfe unto them, becauſe he knew them.</hi> And ſo all good people and ſuch as truly fear God ſhould make uſe of their knowledge to ſhun ſuch ſeducers and deceivers, and to decline all their by-wayes.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer that God hath no where injoyned or required that thoſe that either are to be made Chriſtians, or to be admitted into Church fellowſhip ſhould either know the faces of all the Members of the congregation, or ſhould be particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the whole church that he is to be admitted a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:48122:308"/>
of: For we have no warrant for ſuch practice in the whole Scripture, neither is there any example of it from one end of the Bible to the other; and therefore it is meer Will-Worſhip and a ſerving of God after the commandments of men, which is ſo often condemned in holy Scripture, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. and therfore ought to be abhorred as an intolerable yoke of bondage, <hi>which neither we nor our forefathers could bear</hi> Acts 15. <hi>Whereas Chriſts yoke is eaſie and light, and they that take his yoke vpon them finde reſt unto their ſoules</hi> Matth. 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29, 30. who ſaith unto his people, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you reſt.</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>If you will come to me and be admitted into church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fellowſhip, you must firſt walk ſometime with my people and be acquainted with them;</hi> I ſay Chriſt the King of his church hath given no ſuch command either to thoſe that are to be admitted or to his Miniſters and ſtewards of his houſe which is his church of any ſuch practice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I anſwer that as there is an impoſſibility almoſt for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man or woman to be acquainted with a whole Church, ſo it is neither neceſſary nor uſefull: For that knowledge that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as neceſſary to ſalvation and for the making of any fit to be church Members, conſiſts in theſe things, <hi>that they repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and be baptized, and that they ſhould know the onely true God and whom he hath ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> John 17. And this is the firſt thing abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation which is required of all ſuch as will be Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is, <hi>the knowledge of our ſelves, which conſiſts in ſelf-denyall and regeneration,</hi> For <hi>if any will be Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they muſt deny themſelves and take up his croſſe dayly;</hi> For ſo ſaith Chriſt our King <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. And again <hi>John</hi> 3. ver. 3. Chriſt ſpeaking unto <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> ſaith to him and in him to all men, <hi>Except a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God</hi> ver. 5. <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdome of God: He muſt be a new creature,</hi> ſaith he. And this is the knowledge that Chriſt the King of his church requires as neceſſary for their ſalvation, ſo for their admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into church fellowſhip, and he that has theſe qualifications has as much as Chriſt requires; and there is no need of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or familiar acquaintance with all thoſe of the congregation or with the whole church or that they ſhould walk ſome time with
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:48122:308"/>
them, therefore it is wickedly done in all thoſe of the congregational way to impoſe laws of their own making upon the people of God their brethren who are a free people: and therefore they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſerve their King <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> and to hear and obey his voice only, ought to deteſt all theſe falſe teachers that would ſo inthrall them, eſpecially they ought to abominate their practices becauſe they make theſe their traditions <hi>Gods Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But whereas my brother</hi> Burton <hi>ſaith that</hi> abundans cautela non nocet, <hi>and</hi> that they look not ſo much at circumſtances in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as the ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>I affirme it is a moſt arrogant expreſſion in any ſo to ſpeak; for in his thus ſpeaking, <hi>he makes as if it were in the power of poor mortall creatures to ſearch mens hearts and judge of the ſecrets of the ſame which is onely Gods peculiar:</hi> but that is not all, but in this his expreſſion there is a high ſtrain of confidence in the man that he will ſeem to be wiſer then <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe that was <hi>the King and Lawgiver of his Church and the mighty Councellour;</hi> and yet he gave no precept for this <hi>abundans cautela:</hi> and yet it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>that he revealed the whole will of his Father, and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alſo delivered unto the church the whole counſell of God</hi> Act. 21. And yet neither <hi>Chriſt</hi> nor his Apoſtles did ever deliver this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of walking with the church ſometime, nor never ſpake of this <hi>abundans cautela;</hi> therefore I gather it is neither part of the will or councell of God that they injoyn this walking upon his people: therefore all the true ſubjects of Jeſus <hi>Chriſt</hi> and all his leige people ought to abominate and abhorre all ſuch uſurpers as my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices are, <hi>that trample down the Laws of Chriſt our King and impoſe their own inventions and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon his people for Christs Ordinances and Statutes.</hi>

                  <hi>The firſt is this,</hi> that no man ſhould judge his brother any more:
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:48122:309"/>
                  <hi>and this ſtatute is ratified by many other and from moſt warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and divine reaſon; the other ſtatutes that confirme this are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the ſame chapter with the reaſons thereof: For ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi> What art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth <hi>ver. 4. therefore thou oughteſt not to judge him,</hi> For to this end <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> ver. <hi>9.</hi> Chriſt both dyed, roſe again and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. <hi>Chriſt ſaith he is our Lord both</hi> by donation, by conqueſt, by purchaſe, by covenant, by fellowſhip with the ſonne and with the Father, <hi>we were given unto him by God the Father,</hi> and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all our enemies and led captivity captive, and vanquiſhed the ſtrong and armed man and diſarmed him, and reſcued all his ſervants out of his ſlavery, &amp; he hath redeemed us by no leſs price then his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood, and we are his people alſo by covenant and by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his graces and reſurrection and glory injoying with him all feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and everlaſting happineſſe with an eternall Kingdome; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he in the 12. verſe,</hi> Why doſt thou judge thy brother, and why doſt thou ſet at naught thy brother? we ſhall all ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt. Therefore judge not thy brother. <hi>And St.</hi> James <hi>ſaith,</hi> my brethren be not many Maſters. <hi>And this I ſay is the firſt obſervable out of that text;</hi> that we ought not to judge one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any more.</p>
               <p>The ſecond obſerveable is that no man <hi>ſhould put a ſtumbling blocke, or occaſion of fall in his brothers way.</hi> Now I appeale un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any man, what greater ſtumbling blocke, or occaſion to fall can be put in any mans way, then when men on their own heads impoſe a Law upon their brethren that Chriſt our King never gave to his people, or what greater ſcandall and offence can be given to a poore ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt his King, then to be thruſt out of their Maſters doores, or to be kept out of their Maſters houſe, and to be judged at the will and pleaſure of his fellow ſervants, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee be fit to come into his Maaſtars family or not; if this be not to judge his brother, if this be not a ſcandall; yea, if this be not an intolerable tyrannie, there was never any either judgement, ſcandall or tyrannie in the world, nor greater rebellion and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy againſt the King of his Church, and againſt his ſubjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and redeemed ones: and therefore if the Pope and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates were ſo much abominated and abhorred of all men for their uſurpation over Gods heritage and clergies, how much ought
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48122:310"/>
ſuch ſquanderling fellowes as this <hi>I. S.</hi> and his complices be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, who thus take upon them to diſcerne into the very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their brethrens hearts, and to judge them fit or not fit to be received into Church fellowſhip, and into the communion of Saints, and according to their conceit and opinion, ſo to bring in their verdict of admiſſion or non-admiſſion, when Chriſt our Lord and King ſayes, <hi>judge not leſt ye bee judgod, Matth.</hi> 3. and bids all men <hi>that are heavie laden to come unto him, Matth.</hi> 11. and ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> the 6. <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Him that comethunto me I will in no way caſt out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Lord the King of his Church gives free admittance to all his ſubjects and ſervants to come into his Kingdom and houſe; but here is my Lord <hi>Taps</hi> his Chaplaine and his aſſociats, and they all take upon them this power and authority, that except it be by their good leave &amp; liking, they ſhall not be admitted into the houſe of God; for they have a charge over that houſe, and an intereſt alſo; theſe are <hi>I. S.</hi> his owne expreſſions.</p>
               <p>Now I do here againe appeale to any that have but any ordinary underſtanding, whether there was ever ſuch a ſupercilious brood of creatures in the world before theſe Ill-dependents were hatcht that can thus trample all the Lawes of Chriſt under their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted feet, and yet pretend they onely ſet him up upon his Throne, when notwithſtanding it is apparently evident, they practiſe the contrary, and violate all his moſt holy Statutes, and preferre their owne traditions before his commandements, as this is one of judging their Brethren, and not admitting of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſts Church and houſe, without the conſent of the whole Church, when Chriſt nevertheleſſe hath enacted ſo many Lawes to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake in way of anſwer to what <hi>I. S.</hi> had to ſay to my third <hi>querie;</hi> the fourth followes concerning the covenant, whether neceſſary to admiſſion? To which my brother <hi>Burton</hi> thus replyes, page 14. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the very name of a Covenant is become a bug-bear to many,</hi> and tels us more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over what hee hath ſaid concerning their covenant in his vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (that learned peece of ſtuffe, ſuch an other as his <hi>Truth ſhut of doores) and his Proteſtation proteſted,</hi> and then hee makes a briefe Deſcription of their covenant to no purpoſe, and then concludes, <hi>that it is not the name of Covenant that is ſo terrible, but the order</hi>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:48122:310"/>
                  <hi>of Church-communion; and this is to thoſe onely, that having uſod to walke without a yoake, as the Scripture cals ſonnes of</hi> Beliall, <hi>love not to come under the yoake of Chriſt, then which to a willing bearer nothing is more eaſie and ſweet.</hi> I expected from my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> eſpecially, who talkes ſo much of ſetting up <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon his Throne, as hee counts all men enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and Converts but in part, when they come not up cloſe to the rule of Reformation, Gods Word;</hi> for thus my brother ſpeaks, page 18. I ſay I expected from him, that hee ſhould have ratified their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in admitting of their Members by a particular explicite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant from the Word of God, and from either ſome command, or ſome example, both which when this their practice wanteth, it can not be of faith, and therefore is ſinfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I deſire the Reader to obſerve ſome particulars in my brother</hi> Burtons <hi>expreſſions, not to ſhew the vanity, ſinne and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe of them all, for that would require a tractate by it ſelfe. But firſt; I pray obſerve,</hi> the very name <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> of a covenant is become a Bug-beare to many, <hi>that is to ſay</hi> a terrour againe a few lines, <hi>after he ſaith,</hi> that it is not the name of a covenant that is ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, but the order of Church-communion. <hi>Here I leave my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>to reconcile his owne contradiction,</hi> the very name of a Covenant <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> is a Bug-beare, and it is not the name of a covenant that is ſo terrible.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee acknowledges that this covenant is a yoake, and ſo it is indeed; but withall it is worthy of obſervation, hee cals it Chriſts yoake, and yet it was never impoſed upon the people of God by Chriſts command, nor was it appointed by him: ſo that whatſoever they bring into the church upon their owne braines they impoſe it upon the people as one of Gods Ordinances, which is an inſufferable inſolencie in theſe men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> accounteth of all ſuch as will not ſubmit it themſelves to their government, and goe in their church way to receive or take their covenant, <hi>to be the ſonnes of</hi> Belial, <hi>and not under Chriſts yoake;</hi> theſe are his words, page 14. Thus charitably the Independents thinke of all the Presbyterians their Brethren, becauſe forſooth wee will not enter into their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which notwithſtanding they can neither give us either Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or Preſident for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the whole Word of God, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count us the ſonnes of <hi>Belial.</hi> Now wee are taught, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:48122:311"/>
                  <hi>is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> and whatſoever is not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Word, all men know is not of faith, which when their Church practiſeth without it, it is moſt apparent that they are in a ſinfull way, and therefore are rather the ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> then wee. But learned <hi>I. S.</hi> page 18. whiles hee goes about to defend the covenant, ſayes enough utterly to overthrow it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth</hi> querie <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> of an explicite covenant, whether neceſſary to admiſſion.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>I know not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>why it ſhould be more incove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient then a publicke nationall Covenant. But neceſſary</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wee hold it not;</hi> all the world may ſee that <hi>I. S.</hi> is but a novice in the Independent Principles: yea, that hee is a very <hi>catechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos:</hi> For all thoſe that are any thing acquainted in the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents Principles, hold this explicite covenant to be the forme of the church, without the which the church cannot be a church, nor without the taking of the which, there can be no admittance into church-fellowſhip with them; yea, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> cals it Chriſts yoake, and proclaimes all thoſe that will not weare it to be the ſonnes of <hi>Belial.</hi> So that theſe men do not agree amongſt themſelves, the one party of them holding the particular cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant abſolutely neceſſary, the other ſaying, <hi>but neceſſary wee hold it not.</hi> So then by <hi>I. S.</hi> his owne confeſſion, who ſpeakes in the name of all his party, it is none of Gods Ordinances, for all Gods Ordinances are neceſſary in their ſeaſon, and whoſoever ſhould contemne or ſlight the leaſt of them ſinneth greatly. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>I. S.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>hee knoweth not why a particular explicite cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould bee more inconvenient then a publicke nationall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> I affirme this is fondly ſpake of <hi>I. S.</hi> For wee have divers Preſidents and examples in holy Scripture and precepts for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into publicke covenants, and wee have read of the benefit that hath from them redounded to the whole nation &amp; country by them for incouragement to all men, upon juſt occaſions to enter into ſome ſolemne covenant with our God: but wee have neither precept nor example in all Gods Word of an explicite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular covenant taken in any church; and therefore it muſt needs be inconvenient as not being of faith: for whatſoever is not of faith is inconvenient; yea, very hurtfull to him that doth any thing in Gods matters without it; for it is ſinne to him, and will bring downe puniſhment upon him for it. But for <hi>I. S.</hi> I will ſay no
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:48122:311"/>
more to him about this point, who I finde to be a very <hi>catechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> in the principles of Independency, when notwithſtanding he promiſed me he would teach and inſtruct me in the Independent way.</p>
               <p>But I will now examine the Reaſon that the Author of the Book called <hi>Truth gloriouſly appearing from under the ſad and ſable Cloud of Obloquy,</hi> giveth for this their covenant. He <hi>Page</hi> 126 labors to prove their particular explicite covenant out of that place, <hi>Acts</hi> the 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>Where when</hi> Paul <hi>was come to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, he aſſayed to joyn himſelf with the Diſciples.</hi> Now ſaith he, the word <hi>joyn in the original</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſignifies to joyn by Covenant,</hi> and intimates <hi>ſuch a joyning of</hi> Paul <hi>to the Church, as the joyning of a man to his wife:</hi> For in <hi>Matthew</hi> (ſaith he) the ſame word is uſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>For this cauſe (ſaith our Saviour) ſhall a man leave father and mother, and</hi>

                  <hi>ſhall cleave to his wife. Now (ſaith he) we know that a man cleaves to his wife by a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and therefore why not ſo to the Church?</hi> If he had ſaid, why not ſo, unto Chriſt, he had ſaid ſomething to the purpoſe; for we are married onely unto Chriſt, and not to the Church, knowing that the Church is Chriſts Spouſe, and Chriſt is the Churches Husband; and we are married unto Chriſt, and not to the Church and one to another; neither did any Chriſtian yet ever deny, but that all thoſe that would be joyned unto Chriſt, and ſo be received into his houſe and family, and be ſubjects of his Kingdom, they muſt take the oath of Allegeance unto their King Chriſt, and therefore muſt enter into his houſe, which is his Church, by the covenant of Baptiſm; this I ſay all men accord unto, when men are firſt admitted into the Church: And this covenant, I ſay, all that will be Chriſts Diſciples, and of his Kingdom and Family, muſt take before they can be admitted. But that they ſhould after they are baptized, enter into another particular explicite covenant, and by that binde themſelves to the Church; I affirm, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precept nor preſident for it in all the holy Scripture, either of the old or new Teſtament; neither is there any ſuch myſtery in the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as to imploy ſo much; for we know the ſame word is uſed in the eighth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> verſe 29.

to the Eunuchs chariot <hi>by a particular explicite covenant.</hi> No more ought any wiſe man to conceive, that when <hi>Paul aſſayed to joyn himſelf to the Diſciples,</hi> that by that he would have taken a particular explicite covenant of Church fellowſhip: This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to beg the queſtion, and to amuſe the ſimple, and to deceive them by taintering the words of Scripture, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them beyong their native ſignification, to make them fit for their occaſions, that they may juggle the better to delude the poor people, which is a great wickedneſſe in theſe men thus to triſle about words, till they looſe the Truth, which is the ſubſtance to the deſtroying of their poor ſouls. The truth is, that word is often uſed in the holy Scripture, and is uſed metaphorically as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from Joyners and crafts men, that joyn many things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by Glew: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o ordinary diſcourſe it intimates a cloſe joyning, whether natural as a branch to the Vine, or an arm to the Body, or artificial, as <hi>when two ſticks are joyned to become one in Ezekiels hand,</hi> Ezek. 37. <hi>As when Maſons joyn ſtones together, or Carpenters timber to make a houſe.</hi> But that this word <hi>joyn</hi> ſhould alwayes imploy a particular explicite covenant to any Church or Congregation, when any man takes on him a new relation to it and is made a member of it: I affirm, there is not one example of it in all the Word of God; and as for any command, that every member of a Church ſhould do it, there is none: And therefore, it is a meer Will-worſhip, and one of their own Traditions, and ought to be abandoned of all Chriſts Diſciples, and with ſo much the more deteſtation, becauſe they make it one of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and part of his Service and Worſhip, and the very form of a Church, whereas it is a batch of their own leven, by which they have of late much ſowred the Truth. But as I ſaid before, ſo I ſay now again, that Chriſtians are to ſwear fealty onely to their King and Lord Chriſt Jeſus, who is their husband, and who is the onely Maſter of his own Houſe and Church, and whoſe voice is onely to be heard, and whoſe Laws are onely to be obeyed and liſtned unto; &amp; we ſwear no allegiance or fealty to the Church, for we are all his ſervants &amp; domeſticks, and have no authority one over another, to impoſe Laws upon each other, or to enter in to any covenants amongſt our ſelves, without a ſpecial command from Chriſt: And as when Stewards of Princes or Noblemen, take any in to their maſters families, they ſwear them onely to their lords
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:48122:312"/>
and maſters; we never hear that the ſervants enter into any cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant among themſelves, or joyn or unite themſelves in covenant one to cleave unto another: Such proceedings amongſt ſervants would never be allowed or tolerated amongſt men, it would be thought rather a conſpiracy or a confederation to do miſcheif, if they ſhould attempt ſuch a thing. As when thoſe men enterd in to a covenant amongſt themſelves, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed <hi>Paul;</hi> yea, it hath ever been obſerved in all countreys, That when ſervants began once to combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to joyn themſelves by ſecret covenants, they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes plotted miſcheif, and therefore there hath been ſpecial care uſed to prevent ſuch conſpiracies. And all men may well perceive by this their covenanting in their new gathered Churches, what it tends to, if God of his infinite goodneſſe prevents not their deſigne: Therefore, I ſay, we being Chriſts domeſticks and his Church, and being his houſe, and he being the onely Lord of it, and our King, we are to ſmite our covenant onely with him, and to ſwear fealty and obedience to him onely, and his Laws, and we are not to be the ſervants of men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. And therefore the Lord ſaith in <hi>Malachi</hi> the firſt, <hi>If I be a father, where is my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; if I be a Lord, where is my honor?</hi> How is it that ye obey me not? We are onely therefore to obey his voice, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the traditions of men, or to ſerve God after the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men: Now then, when the Independents impoſe this their covenant upon the people as a part of Gods worſhip, and will not admit of any into their new Churches, without entering in to this conſpiracy; I ſay, by all their proceedings in as much as in them lies, they diſ-throne Chriſt in preferring their own laws before his; wherein they commit a deteſtable wickedneſſe. And this ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And now I come to the fifth, <hi>of womens votes, whether they are to be admitted in elections?</hi> To which my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> thus replies, <hi>Page</hi> 15. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tie not the keys to womens girdles.</hi> And <hi>I.

               <p>For anſwer to both, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> I ſay thus much, That they cannot be ignorant of the practice of the Churches, in many of which, and thoſe the principaleſt and the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:48122:313"/>
choiceſt ones, to my knowledge the women had their voices both for the receiving in of members, and for the caſting of them out upon any ſcandal; ſo that there were none admitted, either men or women, though of never ſo great rank and quality, without the leave and good liking of the women; ſo that if at any time they oppoſed the entrance of any, though it were but upon meer jealouſies that they were not godly, they could not be admitted members of thoſe Congregations: But it ſeems they are now aſhamed of this their practice, and therefore plead ignorance in the buſineſſe. But that the world may ſee I write nothing in my firſt Book concerning womens voting of it in Churches, I ſhall recite ſome two or three ſtories, omitting many to prove their practices in thoſe dayes. And what I ſhall relate, and much more I undertake to prove by ſufficient witneſſes whenſoever the Independents ſhall put me upon it. And withall I ſhall make it appear, there was never greater juggling then hath been amongſt thoſe of the Congregational-way, in admitting of members.</p>
               <p>The ſtories briefly are theſe: A Gentlewoman of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance coming up to <hi>London,</hi> ſince theſe <hi>New Lights</hi> broke out, was ſo infatuated with them, that ſhee had a great deſire to joyne her ſelfe to one of the prime Churches of the congregationall way, concerning the which Gentlewoman I can ſay thus much upon my owne experience, and it can be proved by many, that whatſoever ſhee is now, before ſhee became an Independent, ſhe was a woman not onely of an emaculate life and converſation, but a woman of ſingular piety and charity towards all to her ability, and who ordinarily twice or thrice a week was wont to ſet dayes apart in private to ſeeke God, and to humble her ſelfe by faſting and prayer, and this was her conſtant courſe of life. Yet this woman aſſaying to joyne her ſelfe unto theſe new diſciples, and being to make the confeſſion of her faith before the congregation, and to bring in the evidences of her converſion, ſhee not having had many moneths acquaintance with them, and having not wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with them above halfe a yeare, or there-abouts, was forced the better to make the Church underſtand the worke of grace wrought in her heart, to recite unto them her courſe of life, how ſhee had conſtantly walked with God, and what communion ſhe had with him, ſignifying with all that ſhee had ever loved the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48122:313"/>
Saints and brethren, a ſufficient token of converſion, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of Chriſts diſciples, if either Chriſts owne teſtimonie or Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> may be beleeved. Yet when ſhee had made an end of her confeſſion of her faith, and produced her evidences, a Wench roſe up in the Congregation, and profeſt before them all that ſhee was not ſatisfied with her evidences that ſhee was a beleever, for as much as the Phariſees for all outward performances could ſay as much as ſhee did, or uſed words to this effect. Vpon which the Church could not admit her, for the ſiſter was not ſatisfied: So that the Gentlewoman ſince joyned her ſelfe to another Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>An other preſident is of a young man, reputed amongſt his neighbours very godly, who being much inamoured with the new way of Church-fellowſhip, aſſayed to joyne himſelfe to one of their congregations, not that I ſpake of before, and being to make his confeſſion, and to bring in his evidences, and having to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Church, done as much as they injoyned him to doe, two of the women in that Aſſembly oppoſed his admiſſion; ſo that without their good liking hee could not be admitted a Member, and hee applying himſelfe unto their Paſtor, and to the Elders gave many ſignes of his true converſion, ſo that they related unto him that for their parts they had nothing to ſay to him in way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but wiſht him to apply himſelfe to thoſe ſiſters, telling him, that without their conſent they could not admit him into Church-fellowſhip, whereupon hee makes his addreſſes to them, and ſometimes hee courted them for their favour, ſometime hee expoſtulated with them, deſiring to know their reaſons why they were ſo adverſe to him, and would not grant their conſents, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of them if they knew any thing by his converſation, and they replyed, no, but they could not beleeve he was godly and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and fit for Church fellowſhip; and whether or no hee was ever admitted in that Congregation, I know not; but at that time hee could not be admitted, and for no other reaſon that can be given, but that the ſiſters did not give their conſents, and they could alleage no other ground of their not agreeing to his admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but that they conceived he was not godly.</p>
               <p>The third Storie is of one that was reputed a very honeſt and godly man amongſt all his acquaintance, and who had alſo wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſometime amongſt them in one of their new congregations,

and earneſtly deſired to be admitted a joyned Member, and hee bringing in his evidences, and making the confeſſion of his faith, ſatisfactory enough to many of the Church, for the proving of himſelfe fit for Member-ſhip, a married woman roſe up in the congregation, and profeſt before them all ſhe could not beleeve he was fit tobe admitted as a Member of that church, and uſed ſome triviall reaſons, for her not aſſenting to his admſſion, and for that time hee could not be received into the congregation, having not given the good ſiſter plenary ſatisfaction; and whether hee be yet received into church-fellowſhip, I know not, but that he was by the woman at that time put off, that I ſhall be able to prove, with the other two Stories, and be able likewiſe to produce many ſuch Preſidents more. Now I referre this to any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding mans judgement, whether the Keyes in many of the new gathered churches be not tyed unto the womens Girdles, and whether my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> are alwayes to be credited, either in their denials or affirmations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake of the fifth</hi> querie. <hi>And now I come to the ſixth and laſt</hi> querie, viz. Whether the practiſing and preaching of all theſe things, &amp;c. be to ſet up Chriſt as King upon his Throne? <hi>to the which</hi> querie <hi>my Brother</hi> Burton, <hi>and</hi> I. S. <hi>anſwer as two Jugglers, nothing to the purpoſe. My Brother</hi> Burtons <hi>words are theſe, page 19</hi> Thoſe Churches <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> that are for matter and forme true Churches, and are governed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Word, doe ſet up Chriſt as King upon his Throne: and for ſuch as are otherwiſe, let them conſider whether they doe as they ought, ſet up Chriſt as King upon his Throne.</p>
               <p>This is my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> anſwer to my ſixt <hi>querie.</hi> Now whether this be a direct anſwer to my <hi>querie,</hi> I leave it to the judgement of the Learned. But from this his anſwer I may boldly conclude, that their new congregations doe not ſet up Chriſt as King upon his Throne, they fayling both for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forme of true churches, and being not governed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God; all which I have ſufficiently proved in my foregoing Diſcourſe. As for <hi>J. S.</hi> hee anſwers nothing to the queſtion, as all that ſhall reade his words may well perceive, which are theſe. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>no queſtion but the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and purifying of Church Ordinances and Fellowſhip, which ſome contend for, is to ſet Chriſt upon a higher Throne viſible to the</hi>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:48122:314"/>
                  <hi>world, then by ſome other wayes hee is,</hi> &amp;c. Now w hether this be a ſatisfactory anſwer to the <hi>querie,</hi> I leave it to others to judge of, but from his words I thus argue; Where Chriſts Ordinances and Church-fellowſhip are polluted, there Chriſt is not ſet up upon his Throne; but in all the new congregations Chriſts Ordinances are polluted, and Church-fellowſhip contaminated, as I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt is not ſet up there on his Throne. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake by way of anſwer to all they had to ſay to my <hi>queries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now I ſhall ſet down Gods method, and the Apoſtles practice in gathering of churches, and the manner they uſed in making Members in every Church, and compare it with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod our brethren the Independents uſe in gathering of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, that all men may the better diſcerne truth from error, and may all be undeceived in this buſineſſe of ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I will firſt begin with Chriſts Commiſſion given to his Apoſtles, and in them to all Miniſters, and then conſider the practice of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and of all the Apoſtles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Primitive Church and the order that God himſelfe uſed for the gathering of thoſe that belong unto his election, and for the congregating of the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fold of Jeſus Chriſt, who is that great Shepherd and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of our ſoules; and I conceive that Gods order and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles practice is rather to be followed then any other new found way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to begin with Chriſts Commiſſion to his Apoſtles,</hi> Matth. <hi>21.</hi> verſe <hi>19, 20.</hi> Go ye therefore, <hi>ſaith Chriſt,</hi> and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them, In the Name of the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I command you; and lo! I am with you even to the end of the World, Amen. <hi>And in the 16. of</hi> Marke verſe <hi>15, 16. He ſaith unto them,</hi> Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospell unto every creature: He that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not ſhall be damned. <hi>And in the 26. of the</hi> Acts, <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>after he had declared the manner of his converſion to King</hi> Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, <hi>he likewiſe made known unto him the commiſſion he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt Jeſus, in the words following,</hi> verſe <hi>15, 16. 17, 18, 19, 20.</hi> And I ſaid, who art thou Lord? and he ſaid, I am Ieſus whom thou perſecuteſt; but riſe and ſtand upon thy feet,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:48122:315"/>
for I have appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and a Witneſſe, both of theſe things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things in the which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee to open their eyes, and to turne them from darkneſſe to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith which is in me; whereupon I was not diſobedient to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly viſion, but ſhewed firſt unto them of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and through all the coaſts of <hi>Judea,</hi> and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turne to God, and do works meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe ſeverall places, from the Commiſſion of Chriſt given to his bleſſed Apoſtles, and to all Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpell to the end of the World: here obſerve theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that their bounds and limits were ſet them, how farre they ſhould go in their teaching all Nations, and beyond which they might not paſſe; <hi>and they were theſe,</hi> that they ſhould teach no other things but what Chriſt commanded them and appeared to them in, and for the which they had his Word and Warrant; and ſo long as they ſhould do this, he promiſed them and all that ſhould ſucceed them in the Miniſtery, to the end of the World to be with them.</p>
               <p>We alſo further obſerve the condition in the executing of this their commiſſion, they were to propound unto all Nations and people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what condition they were to be admitted into the Church, and that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith &amp; repentance; and they were to receive all ſuch as beleeved and were baptized, and that upon the profeſſion of their faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without any further teſtimony of others, unleſſe they had been formerly known to be open enemies and perſecutors of the church, and then they were juſtly to be ſuſpected, till they had given publike evidence by witneſſe to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of their true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as it hapned to <hi>Paul,</hi> whom for a time the Diſciples feared, <hi>Acts 9. 26, 27.</hi> till they had better information and proofe that he now preached the faith that he had once perſecuted, and had ſuffered for it, which is the onely preſident we have in all the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of any that were refuſed to be admitted into the communion and fellowſhip of the Apoſtles, as I remember (for he was a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter before) but all the other that came in were admitted upon their

own offer, if they tendred themſelves and imbraced the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and were baptized, and that without any reluctation or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruple.</p>
               <p>Now before I come to my third obſervation out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given to the Apoſtles, I muſt wait here a little upon the motions of my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> pen which as it marches along, makes now and then ſome whibling incurſions into my quarters; and therefore that all men may ſee my forces are ever in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that I am alwayes willing to fight him whereſoever I meet him, and that my brother <hi>Burton</hi> alſo may ſee how ready I am to gratifie his deſire, who Page 7. ſaith, <hi>Come on brother, let you and I try it out by the dint of this Sword.</hi> I will here skirmiſh a little with him to breath him, and then go after him; in the 15. Page of his book he puts me upon the reconciling of a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he conceives I made: For ſaith he, Page 101. of your book, <hi>you ſay, The Apoſtles and other Miniſters of the Gospel were to receive all ſuch as beleeved and were baptized, and that upon the pr ofeſſion of their faith and repentance without any further teſtimony of others, unleſſe they had been formerly known to be open enemies, and then they were juſtly to be ſuſpected, till they had given publique evidence by witneſſe to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of their true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion as concerning</hi> Paul. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Now here <hi>(ſaith my brother</hi> Burton) I obſerve.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a notable contradiction to what you ſay <hi>Page 115.</hi> As Gods command to all Miniſters was that they ſhould admit all ſuch into the Church, as beleeved and were baptized upon their deſiring it, without any confeſſion either private or publike. Here <hi>(ſaith my brother</hi> Burton) I leave you to reconcile your own contradiction, upon their profeſſion and without any confeſſion.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer, I aſſert that my words are ſo far from <hi>a notable contradiction</hi> to any men that know what a contradiction is, that there is not at all ſo much as a very ſimilitude of a contradiction in them: For what contradiction I pray is there in theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? <hi>The Miniſters of the Goſpell are to receive all ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and are baptized, and that upon the profeſſion of their faith and repentance, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods command to all Miniſters, is, that they ſhall admit all ſuch into the Church as beleeve and are baptized upon their deſiring it without any confeſſion &amp;c. <hi>Here as all the world may ſee is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:48122:316"/>
                  <hi>But if I had in thoſe places expreſſed my ſelfe thus:</hi> viz. the Miniſters of the Gospell are to admit none into the Church but upon their publike confeſſion of their faith.</p>
               <p>And in the ſecond place if I had ſaid, <hi>God commands all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to admit all ſuch into the Church as beleeve and are baptized, without any confeſſion of their faith.</hi> Then my brother <hi>Burton</hi> might have had a poor occaſion of making obſervations; but if upon a conceipt of ſo ſmall a thing as a contradiction, he will call for the attention of the whole world, and cry out a <hi>notable contradiction!</hi> how would this man vapor if he could get ſome great advantage againſt me? without doubt he would cry <hi>Victoria Victoria.</hi> I do beleeve that Saint <hi>Cretenſis</hi> would not more radomontadoe it over even to be honoured Maſter <hi>Edwards</hi> then he would over me: But as I ſaid before and as all the judicious wil obſerve, there is no contradiction in thoſe two expreſſions; for to deſcribe one and the ſame thing in a various manner, is no contradiction, which as the learned know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſiſts in denying and affirming of one and the ſame thing, which the ſaying, <hi>upon their profeſſion, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confeſſion,</hi> does not; <hi>for profeſſion is one thing, and confeſſion is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> they are two diſtinct things; and therefore there was no denying and affirming of one and the ſame thing; and therefore no contradiction. But by ſuch triflings as theſe are, my brother <hi>Burton, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. S.</hi> and <hi>Hanſerdo Knollys,</hi> like thoſe <hi>evill workers</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. whom he commands all Chriſtians <hi>to beware of,</hi> they ſquander away their pretious time to delude and deceive the ignorant people, whereas they might better by far imploy themſelves if they were all now this hot weather in the Butchers ſhambles a killing of flyes. And this ſhall ſerve in way of Anſwer to his firſt obſervation of <hi>a notable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I come to his other obſervation in the ſame page, but to what it hath relation I know not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor how he brings it in to be an anſwer nor what he intends by it: for the man is very rambling, but thus he ſpeaketh there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly ſaith he,</hi> I anſwer, that in theſe dayes of profeſſed and covenanted for Reformation, there is required the profeſſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of one ſpeciall point of faith (which in words none dare, but in practice moſt do deny) touching Chriſts Kingly office and his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſole ſoveraignty, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:48122:316"/>
Thus he there expatiates, but againſt whom or what he makes that anſwer I know not: For thus much I can ſay in the behalfe of all the godly and learned Presbyterians there are no men upon the earth that more endeavour both in word and deed to profeſſe and confeſſe that ſpeciall point of faith <hi>touching Chriſts Kingly office and his abſolute ſoveraignty</hi> (as by all their practices they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare) then they, as all their learned Sermons and Writings can witneſſe: and on the other ſide concerning all the Illdependents and Sectaries I can truly ſay thus much, that never any people made a greater noiſe in words of advanceing Chriſt and ſetting him up naked upon his Throne (for ſo they ſpeak) then they do, and yet never did any people more diſhonour him or diſthrone him then they, as in the foregoing diſcourſe I have ſufficiently proved. And therefore if this his ſecond Anſwer concerns any, it belongs to the Independents, and it highly indeed concerns them all, to conſider their erroneous wayes and now at laſt to ſeek after the wayes of <hi>Truth, Peace</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and not thus with their tongues and penns to ſet the whole world on fire and then to warm and heat themſelvs by the light of it, like thoſe that danced about their calfe, <hi>who did eat and drink and roſe up to play.</hi> And this ſhall ſerve for anſwer to that.</p>
               <p>And ſo now I go on to my third obſervation out of the Apoſtles Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The third thing we may obſerve, is, that this commiſsion was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only to the Apoſtles and Ministers of the Gospel, and that it was their place only, who had the Keys delivered unto them to open and ſhut the doors of the Church, to admit ſuch as they thought for their faith, knowledge and repentance were ſufficiently qualified and fitted to be made Members; and to refuſe ſuch as they conceived not fit to be received into the fellowſhip of the Church, either for their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or other ſins and offences, and to caſt ſuch out of the Church, as through their malverſation declared themſelvs to be no beleevers: for the commiſsion was only delivered unto the Apoſtles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <hi>that they ſhould admit whoſoever beleeved and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;</hi> and they that beleeved not and would not be baptized, were not to be admitted. This Commiſsion I affirme, was only given to the Apoſtles and Ministers, and it was and is that office that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly belongeth unto them.</p>
               <p>And if we looke into the method of Gods dealing with his
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:48122:317"/>
Church in all ages, under the Law and under the Goſpell, both for the admitting of any into the Church as Members and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or the caſting out of any; and to all the practice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Prieſts of the Old Teſtament, or the practice of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and the bleſſed Apoſtles in the time of the New Teſtament; we ſhall finde, that they that were admitted into the ſociety and fellowſhip of the Church, were by the Miniſters onely under both the Teſtaments received, and to them the people by God himſelfe were ſent, and they ſent unto the people for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="500-610" type="pages">
               <p>And for proofe of this I now ſay, I will firſt begin with the Old Teſtament, a few teſtimonies of the which may ſerve for the confirmation of that truth, as that of <hi>Malachi</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>And ye ſhall know that I have ſent this my commandement unto you, that my covenant might be with</hi> Levy, <hi>ſaith the Lord of hoſts. My covenant was with him of life and peace, and I gave them to him, for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my Name. The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips, he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity; for the Prieſts lips ſhall keep know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and they ſhall ſeek the Law at his mouth; for he is the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger or Angel of the Lord of hoſts.</hi> A ſufficient teſtimony to prove, that the Miniſters onely under the Old Teſtament had the power given them of admitting of any into the fellowſhip and communion of the Church, and that all the people were directed to them as the Meſſengers and Angels of the Lord of hoſts, if they deſired to be admitted into the Church. And ſo <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel,</hi> as we read in the firſt chapters of both their Propheſies, and the ſame may be ſaid of all the Prophets, they were ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people. The people were to be directed by them, and the Prophets and Prieſts onely had that power delegated unto them, of proclaming both mercies and judgements, and of receiving into the Church ſuch as ſhould come unto them. And under the New Teſtament, in the third of <hi>Matthew,</hi> we finde <hi>Ieruſalem and all Iudea, and all the regions round about Ieruſalem,</hi> going out to <hi>Iohn the Baptist, and were baptized of him,</hi> and admitted into the Church by him alone, without the people; and the ſubſtance of his Preaching, with his manner of admitting of members into the Church, and the conditions upon which he received them, and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:48122:317"/>
what the people did before their admiſſion, is all fully ſet down in the third of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the ſeventh. And for the ſum of his Preaching, it is ſaid, verſe the third, That it was <hi>the baptiſm of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the remiſsion of ſins.</hi> And for thoſe that came unto him, as the common people, the Publicans and the Souldiers, they all ask <hi>Iohn</hi> what they ſhould do? And after he had inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſeverally their duties, and told them upon what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they might be admitted, it is ſaid in the ſeventh of <hi>Luke</hi> Verſe 29. <hi>That all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juſtified God, being baptized with the Baptiſm of</hi> John: <hi>But the Phariſees and the Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being not baptized of him,</hi> Verſe 30. So that by Chriſts own teſtimony (the Phariſees and Lawyers onely excepted) all that came to him were baptized and admitted into the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the people. And ſo we finde in the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> chap. 3. 4. yea, through the whole Book, That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple every where made their addreſſes to <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> and to Chriſt and his Apoſtles onely; and that as many as came to Chriſt unfainedly, were received by him, and his Apoſtles; and none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the offer of themſelves, if they accepted of the conditions and were baptized, were ever refuſed. And we finde further, that when our Saviour had at any time clenſed and cured the Lepers, he ſent them to the Prieſts, for to be admitted by them into the communion of the Church, from which their noiſome diſeaſe, as a type of ſin, had for the time excluded them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for</hi> Iohn Baptiſt <hi>(ſaith my Brother</hi> Burton, <hi>Page 16.)</hi> (about whoſe gathering you have ſo beſtirred your ſelf before, and to as little purpoſe.) You may obſerve, that thoſe beleevers in Chriſt then to come, according to the Papiſts doctrine, were not formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chriſtian Church, or Churches, as after Chriſts reſurrection the beleevers were. And when you come to viſit thoſe Chriſtian Churches once conſtituted in their Goſpel form by the Apoſtles, you ſhall finde, that the power of admitting, and rejecting or caſting out of members, was not in the Apoſtles and Miniſters alone, but in the Churches. For this, read <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>5.</hi> where the whole Church of the Saints in Corinth, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, were to caſt out the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon; as alſo, afterward upon his repentance, to re-admit him, <hi>2</hi> Cor. <hi>2. 6, 7.</hi> This one inſtance <hi>(ſaith my Brother</hi> Burton) is a ſufficiens preſident for all Churches. <hi>Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:48122:318"/>
And this is all he hath to ſay there, concerning <hi>Iohn Baptiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Now although I have formerly anſwered, and that in many places in the foregoing Treatiſe, to every ſeveral branch of this my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> cavil; and although it be nothing to the enervating of my Argument, as all underſtanding men will well preceive, if they duly conſider it; yet becauſe I perceive by his whole diſcourſe, the main deſigne both of himſelf, and all thoſe of his faction (that now trouble the world with their ſcribbling) is to deceive, and delude ſilly ſouls, that they may the better bring all the Presbyters into the hatred of the people, as men Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and more then Prelatical, and as affecting a more lordly power over the people, then ever the Biſhops exerciſed over them; (for this is the language all their Pulpits and Pamphlets ſpeak:) I ſay, in this regard, though I have often formerly fully anſwered to every branch of this cavil, I will here ſay ſomething to it, for the better diſcovery of the vanity and triviality of the man: And that I may declare unto all men how little his aſſeverations are to be regarded.</p>
               <p>But I deſire the Reader to take notice of his grolleries (waving that ſlighting paſſage of his, where he ſaith, <hi>That I have ſo beſtirred my ſelf, and to ſo little purpoſe about</hi> John Baptiſts <hi>gathering,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>And firſt, That he joyns here with the Papiſts in unchriſtianing and unchurching all thoſe that were baptized by the <hi>Baptiſt:</hi> And ſo in this point he is a Papiſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he makes the form of a Church, which he calls the <hi>Gospel form,</hi> to confiſt in excommunication.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Take notice of his peremptory aſſertion, and in it, of an other notable error, where he ſaith, <hi>You ſhall finde, that the power of admitting and rejecting of members, was not in the Apoſtles and Ministers alone, but in the Churches.</hi> And for proof of theſe his grolleries he quotes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7. and makes the example of that Church to be <hi>bindingly preſidential</hi> (to uſe <hi>I. S.</hi> his Rhetorick) to all Chriſtian Churches: Whereas in his tenth page he tells me, <hi>We are neceſſarily to take all the Churches in the New Teſtament together, to make up one entire and perfect Church patern.</hi> Theſe are his words there; and yet here he makes the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to be a ſufficient preſident for all Churches. So that every one of their Inſtances muſt be a ſufficient patern to

all other Churches; and yet when I produced the example of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Mother Church, for a patern of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for all other Churches, he rejected it, affirming, that it was not a perfect patern. And in that his expreſſion alſo, we may take notice of a parcel of good Divinity, where he makes the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> a more perfect Church then that at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> which not withſtanding he ſayes, was the firſt formed Church. Now if excommunication and diſcipline, as my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> ſayes, be the <hi>Goſpel form of a Church,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> wanted that part of diſcipline, then it was not a formed Church; but ſo he ſpeaketh of it in the tenth page, where <hi>I obſerve a notable contradiction</hi> (to uſurpe his one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:) And here I leave him a while to reconcile it. But now to ſpeak breifly by way of anſwer to theſe my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> grolleries.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whereas he joyning with the Papiſts, unchriſtians and unchurches all thoſe that were baptized by the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> he is very erroneous in ſo doing, and dealeth moſt wickedly and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly with all thoſe glorious Saints; for they were as good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and beleevers; as he or any Independents in the world: As who all of them have Chriſts own teſtimony for their true faith in him, and their unfained repentance towards God, which are ſufficient characters ever to make any people good Chriſtians; and of all them our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30. <hi>That they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God; and rejected not his counſel againſt themſelves, as the Phariſees and the Lawyers did;</hi> that is; all thoſe that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the <hi>Baptiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> repented, and beleeved in Chriſt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Promiſes; and therefore, by our Saviours own wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they were all good Chriſtians as any in the new gathered Churches. And therefore, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> as a notorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and a calumniator, ought to be reproved, eſpecially by the ſeven new Churches which hold, That all that were baptized by <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> were beleevers and good Chriſtians. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake to his firſt grollery.</p>
               <p>His ſecond is, That he makes excommunication the form of a Church, as we may ſee page the twentieth of his Book, where anſwering unto my Argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which I proved our Churches to be true Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz. Becauſe the ſaving Truth of the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt was preached, received, and profeſt in our Churches.</hi>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:48122:319"/>
To the which Argument of mine, he there thus replyes. <hi>If you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>mean the whole truth of Chriſt, it is well. But do not you know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there dre three ſpecial viſible marks of a true viſible Church, The Gospel purely Preached, the Sacraments duly administred, and Diſcipline rightly practiſed? All which marks to gather the Church of</hi> England <hi>(for ought I know) is yet to ſeek.</hi> So that by theſe words of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, That in his opinion the Goſpel-Form of a Church is to have <hi>Diſcipline rightly Practiſed.</hi> So that where Diſcipline is wanting, by his learning, there is no true Goſpel formed Church.</p>
               <p>But before I anſwer to this his grollery, I will ſay thus much to my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> That <hi>Diſcipline rightly practiſed,</hi> is not one of the ſpecial viſible marks of a true viſible Church; and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Holy Ghoſt who better knew the eſſential marks of a true viſible Church, then my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> yet he in ſetting them all down, omitting that of Diſcipline, ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. <hi>That they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers:</hi> So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this unerring diſcription of the eſſential marks of a true viſible Church; Whereſoever the <hi>Gospel is truly Preached, and where the Sacraments are rightly administred, and where there is the true Invocation of God</hi> (which is the third eſſential mark in Gods Dialect of a true viſible Church) there, there is a true Church, although there be no Diſcipline; and therefore I gather, that Diſcipline though a moſt excellent Ordinance, and much to be deſired, and had long ſince been obtained, had not the Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents hindred it, makes not for the <hi>eſſe</hi> but the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of a Church. And I will ever beleeve the Holy Ghoſt in this point, rather then my Brother <hi>Burton.</hi> And withal, I will live and die in this opinion, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a true Church (notwithſtanding, whatſoever all the Sectaries can ſay to the contrary) becauſe in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Goſpel is truly Preached, and the Sacraments are rightly Adminiſtred, and the Name of God is truly called upon; all which, if they were ſufficient to make the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> a true formed Church, yea, and the firſt true formed Church, according to my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> own learning, then they are ſufficient to make the Church of <hi>England</hi> a true formed Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="505" facs="tcp:48122:319"/>
But a ſecond Reaſon to prove that Diſcipline rightly practiſed is not the forme of a church, is from my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> owne words; for hee everywhere ſaith, that the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was a true formed church, and yet ſhee wanted that part of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, of caſting out corrupt Members;</hi> ſo that Diſcipline there could not then be rightly practiſed, if that church wanted that part of Diſcipline, and if it were not there at all as hee ſaith; and therefore for that marke it does not make for the <hi>eſſe</hi> of a church, and for the <hi>bringing in of a Gospel forme</hi> (as is ſaid before:) and which is yet more, if excommunication be the Goſpel forme <hi>of a true viſible church</hi> then all the Synagogues in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> time were true formed churches after the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel forme; for Synagogue and Church in the holy Scriptures are all one; and in all the Synagogues they had excommunication, as in many places it is evident; and for inſtance theſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 22. <hi>For the Iewes had argued already, that if any man did confeſſe hee was Chriſt hee ſhould be put out of the Synagogue;</hi> and in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verſe, <hi>in terminis</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>that they caſt out the young man,</hi> and in the twelfth chapter, verſe 35. it is ſaid there, <hi>that amongst the chiefe Rulers many beleeved in him, but becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſſe him, leſt they ſhould bee put out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many places more to the ſame purpoſe might be produced to prove <hi>that there was that part of diſcipline even in the Synagogues, and that in</hi> Johns <hi>time,</hi> how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oever it was abuſed, as excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication daily is amongſt all the Sectaries at this day; and if we duly weigh and conſider all things, this part of diſcipline was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Jewiſh Synagogues, and from them brought into all Chriſtian Churches; ſo that if that part of diſcipline be the Goſpel forme of a true viſible Church, or one of the eſſentiall markes of a true viſible Church, as my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſaith, I ſhall not need to take a great journey from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> Churches, as my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> would have me goe to viſit all the other Chriſtian Churches, to find in them excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <hi>that Goſpel forme of a Church.</hi> I will leave that journey to their Itinerary Independent Predicants, who have nothing elſe to doe, and will content my ſelfe with the Chriſtian Synagogues and Churches, amongſt the which <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe both converſed, preached, and performed all the offices of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:48122:320"/>
true Paſtors; <hi>and in thoſe Synagogues and Churches of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>in all and every one of them I find the Gospel truly preached, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments rightly adminiſtred, and the name of God rightly called upon; and all thoſe eſſentiall marks made that Church a true formed Church after the New-Teſtament forme, if the Scripture and my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>may be beleeved;</hi> and therefore I take notice of this as a ſpeciall error in my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that hee makes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication the Goſpel forme of a true Church, for which his tenent I beleeve he will find ſome moderate check or other from ſome of his brethren of the congregational way, who hold, <hi>that their particular explicite Covenant is the forme of the Church;</hi> and this ſhall ſerve for anſwer to that ſecond Grollery of my Brother <hi>Burton.</hi> His third Grollery is, that hee ſaith, <hi>that the power of admitting, and caſting out Members, was not in the Apoſtles and Miniſters alone, but in the Churches,</hi> which is a notable error in my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and Contrary unto many places of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for <hi>God gave the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpel only the Keyes,</hi> Matth. 16. &amp; Matt. 18. <hi>and</hi> Matth. 28. <hi>and they that had the Keyes, and were the Stewards of Gods family, could onely open and ſhut the doores to whom they pleaſed without the people:</hi> and we ſee that the Apoſtles onely in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> without the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>received into the Church thoſe three thouſand firſt Converts; yea, and received</hi> Paul <hi>into their Fellow-ſhip, contrary unto the Diſciples and peoples mind,</hi> Acts 9. <hi>and wee know that</hi> Paul <hi>by his owne power did excommunicate and deliver to Satan</hi> Hymeneus, <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>and others,</hi> 1 Tim. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. and we learne in the ſecond and third of the <hi>Revelation, that the Lord writing unto the Churches ſends his Epiſtles to the Angels as the chiefe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and blames them for neglecting their duty, in not casting out thoſe wicked ones that were amongſt them:</hi> by all which teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and many more that might be produced, it is ſufficiently evident, <hi>that the Miniſters only ought by themſelves to manage the government of the Church, and that it is their peculiar office, and the place of the people to yeeld obedience to what they do:</hi> and even out of 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. the ſame may be gathered where it is ſaid, he was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by many not al. And therefore it is a marvellous great error in my brother <hi>Burton</hi> to conclude, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for the caſting out of the inceſtuous perſon, therefore the power and authority lay in the peoples hands, and not in the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:48122:320"/>
Apoſtles and Miniſters alone: But theſe are the unſound concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that thoſe of the congregationall way gather too too often from the holy Scripture for the ingratiating of themſelves amongſt the people, whom they pretend much to honour, in telling them, <hi>that they have a power and interest in the government, as well as the Miniſters have, and that the Presbyterians challenge this to themſelves joly,</hi> it is onely to inſlave the people, and to Lord it over them, and that worſe then the Prelates; and for no other end I am moſt aſſured, did my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> bring in this cavill in oppoſition to my Argument: which not withſtanding ſtands firme to prove <hi>that</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt did by himſelfe, and without the people execute his Commiſsion, and receive Members into the Church,</hi> and that from his and the bleſſed Apoſtles examples, all other Miniſters may take this example, and doe the ſame, and that by Gods owne appointment, as wee ſhall ſee more fully in the following Diſcourſe; and this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpake to this cavill alſo of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and all the Grolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the ſame concerning the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and his gathering of churches.</p>
               <p>But now to goe on, after the Reſurrection and Aſcention of Chriſt, and that the Apoſtles had received the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and at their firſt entring upon their Miniſtry, had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the people, and that the people were pricked in their hearts when they heard them, it is ſaid that the people addreſſed themſelves onely unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall wee do?</hi> Then <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the remiſsion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gifts of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 2. 23, 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>Here wee may obſerve theſe two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> firſt that the Apoſtles by themſelves alone, without the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or church admitted the people into the ſociety and company of beleevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, that in the execution of their commiſsion, they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but according to their warrant, and according to their injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was given unto them by Chriſt; they propounded no other condition or termes for the making all and every one of them Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, but Baptiſme and Repentance; the which when</hi>

                  <hi>the people had accepted of, they were forthwith admitted, and that upon their own word and teſtimony, without any more adoe, or further inquiry, concerning the ſoundneſſe of their repentance, without any witneſſe from others of their converſation, and without the voyce, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance or approbation of the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the multitude of beleevers in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>much leſſe of the whole Church,</hi> who were never joyned with the Apoſtles in their Commiſſion, or conſulted with by them, whether they ſhould be admitted or no into the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the faithfull, or demanded or asked by the people, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were not fit that they ſhould take ſome time of further conſideration, that they might walke with them, to the end that they might behold their converſation, and by their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience might further be confirmed, that their converſion was ſound and well: Neither did any call for at their hands, that they ſhould make a publicke confeſſion of their faith to the Church, and give in their evidences to the Congregation, that they were converted really, or that they ſhould take a private covenant, or enter into the Church by way of a peculiar covenant: nothing of all this ſpecified: But it is onely related, that the people upon their being pricked in their hearts, applyed themſelves unto the Apoſtles, and that the Apoſtles by their owne authority, and that power that was delegated unto them without reference to the Church or people, admitted them into the number of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>I expected in this place to have met with Generall <hi>Burton,</hi> or cavalier <hi>Hanſerdo,</hi> Saint <hi>George</hi> his chaplaine, knowing what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men they are, that they would have fought me here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, and that they would have indeavoured with all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to have beate mee from this ground, a place ſo advantagious, that they that are Maſters of it may bid defiance to the powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, and potenteſt enemies of the truth: and indeed I did ſo much the more expect their incounter here, and that they would have given mee Battell, and that wee ſhould have had a pitcht field for it, becauſe they have ever pretended an intereſt in it; yea, and challenge a right unto it, ſaying, <hi>that the church of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>is theirs, and which is more, they had by uſurpation got this church into their hands, and had the poſſeſſion of it,</hi> and having thus attained unto their deſigne, being backt with great friends, ſome <hi>Tobiaſſes</hi> and <hi>Sanballets,</hi> they began to build caſtles in the ayre, and made
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:48122:321"/>
Fortifications in their braine, and laid a foundation in their phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, upon which they built an Independent Church, conſiſting of no more then could all meet in one place, to enjoy all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Gods ſervice, and pretended that this Church being the Mother-church, was to bee an example and paterne to all the Daughter-churches, and that all Churches through the world muſt be governed after that modell; and being by the aſſiſtance of many <hi>Sanballats</hi> and <hi>Tobieſſes</hi> much ſtrengthened, as I ſaid before, they began to inſult, and to give Lawes of government to all Churches, and to gather and ſet up churches after their owne modell, and being much aſſured of their owne ſtrength, they bad defiance to the whole world, flinging and caſting their Gloves to all their enemies aſſembled and not aſſembled; whereupon I being a Commander in the Presbyterian Army, and taking up the Glove came out againſt them, and by divine aſſiſtance reduced this place, and tooke it from them which they had ſometime unjuſtly detayned from the Presbyterians, to whom indeed it belonged by the right of inheritance and ſucceſſion: I ſay I having by conqueſt taken this ſtrong citie from the Independent Vſurpers, that now labour to mannage all government by ſea and land, in church and ſtate, pretending they are Saints, and that the Saints muſt governe the world; and being in the poſſeſſion of it, I expected that thoſe two confiding Commanders, <hi>Saint Hanſerdo,</hi> valiant and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old <hi>Henry</hi> being ſo compleatly armed as he was, with his ſword, and <hi>Phocions</hi> Hatchet, and with his great white basket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilted beard, that both of them aſsiſted alſo with <hi>I.

much for all their honours now to have ſhewen their valour: and therefore, they all of them not ſtriking a ſtroke, proclaime unto all the world their want, both of animoſity, and all heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and their want alſo of honeſty, in that they pretend a right unto that they have no juſt title or clayme to, and for which they dare not fight, in that they amuſe the people, and ſtirre up facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on every ſide, and all to ſtrengthen their owne party, for the making of a groundleſs combuſtion in Church &amp; State, telling the people that they have <hi>power and intereſt in the government of the Church,</hi> and that <hi>authority and jurisdiction only</hi> belongeth unto the Presbyters, which they ought alwayes to exerciſe in the name of the Church, and thereupon they perſwade them, that if they relinquiſh this their right unto the Presbyters, they will more Lord it over them then ever the Prelates did; and they teach them farther, that this right is derived unto them from the example of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the other Primitive Churches, who when they were caſt into a Goſpel forme, as they ſay, the Apoſtles and Miniſters had not the ſole power of governing them, but the people alſo were joyned with them, and that they are all of them to have their voices, both in electing of officers, and in receiving in of Members, and caſting out of any offenders as well as the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Miniſters, and wiſh all the people to ſtand and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that liberty wherein Chriſt hath made them free; theſe and ſuch like unſound Principles they ſeaſon the people with, for the inraging of them againſt the Presbyters, and take all occaſions to pervert the holy Scripture, for the maintenance of their new-found way of Independency, and labour continually by ſhifts and jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to evade the dint of any Arguments that are brought againſt them, for the proving that the power of government in the church reſideth in the Presbyters and Miniſters hands, both for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Members, and the caſting of them out, as it did in the hands of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles, and Diſciples, who onely had the authority with the Keyes committed unto them by God himſelfe, and who onely exerciſed it in their dayes, as by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable examples may be proved, as by that of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which latter example, both my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>J.

               <p>Now, what a heighth of wickedneſſe is it in theſe men, thus to trifle for the deluding of the ſimple people, and to pretend unto them, that there are divers wayes of admitting of members into Chriſts Church? one way of admitting members into the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viſible Church, and another of admitting members into a particular Church, when in truth there is no difference; for he that is a member of any particular Church, is a member of the Catholike, and ſo on the contrary, as by the examples both ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and extraordinary by me produced, is ſufficiently apparent; for they were all admitted after one and the ſame way; and I had two examples of receiving in members into Churches conſtituted after the New Teſtament Form; as that of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſeus,</hi> both Churches according to the Goſpel-Form; and there were there three thouſand received members at one time in the church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> without any of thoſe conditions they require at their members hands; and <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was received a member of the Church of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> upon the ſame terms that all the reſt were; and therefore the example is bindingly preſidential: And theſe two examples are taken no notice of, but are paſſed by; and all the other counted extraordinary by them: And the people by this means are deluded and miſerably abuſed.</p>
               <p>Now can there be a greater impoſture or deceit in any that pretend unto Religion and honeſty, then that in theſe men? When they ſay in their writings upon all occaſions, produce us ſome examples of Churches according to the New Teſtament
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:48122:323"/>
Form, wherein any members were admitted by the Miniſters ſole authority, and without the conſent of the people, and without thoſe conditions we require of all ſuch as are to be admitted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into our Churches, and then you do ſome thing? Can there, I ſay, be a greater deceit in any men, then this of theirs, to make the people beleeve that there hath never been any ſuch example produced; when notwithſtanding I had ſet that example of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> both conſtituted after the Goſpel-Form before their eyes? in both of which, their members were admitted by the ſole and alone authority of the Miniſters of thoſe Churches, without the conſent of the people, or without any of thoſe requiſites they now demand of their members in all their new gathered Churches; By which their proceedings, they make themſelves guilty before God, and all men of indirect dealing, and of withholding the Truth from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in unrighteouſneſſe; and manifeſtly declare unto the world, that they are reſolved againſt all the Light of the Truth, obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perſiſt in their erroneous wayes, which is the greateſt height of impiety and wickedneſſe in the world, and no leſſe then to reſiſt the Spirit of God: For if there had been but the leaſt dram of candor and fair dealing in them, they would never have uttered ſuch words; and had there been but any Chriſtian honeſty, and love to the peace of the Church in them, they would not have paſſed by the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> unſaluted, and without taking any notice of them, and fell upon the examples of the <hi>Eunuch Cornelius, Lydia, and the Goaler,</hi> and then pretend that they were extraordinary.</p>
               <p>But that all men may ſee my fair dealing with them, and (if it be poſſible) that I may undeceive the deluded people, I will in this place to gratifie my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>Abſurdo Know-leſſe,</hi> ſet before their eyes the examples of the two Mother Churches in their <hi>Goſpel-Form:</hi> viz. that of <hi>Ieruſalem &amp; Samaria,</hi> that ſo by the mouth of two witneſſes, the Truth may the better be confirmed.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe they took no notice of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in my former Book, but paſſe it by as not worth the regarding, I ſhall deſire them at this time, and all thoſe that read this Book, duly to conſider how members were admitted there, not onely at one time, but always: And I ſhall deſire them likewiſe, ſeriouſly to weigh the practice of that Church in the admitting of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:48122:324"/>
the example of which, according to their doctrine, muſt ever be followed and imitated.</p>
               <p>And becauſe my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> ſays, That the other Churches alſo are to be taken in for the making up of a compleat patern, I will produce two other formed churches after the New Teſtament Form among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and them eminent ones, that there may be no want of witneſſes; for the confirming us in the right way of gathering Churches, and for the receiving in of members.</p>

                  </gap>ſion there were three thouſand ſouls taken in and made Members of that Church by the ſole power of the Apoſtles, and where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had no voice in the admiſſion of them: neither was it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they ſhould walk ſometime in fellowſhip with them, that they might have experience of the truth of their converſion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it required of them that they ſhould make every one of them a publike confeſſion of their faith, and bring in the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their converſion, or that they ſhould enter into a particular explicite Covenant, or that they ſhould have the conſent of the whole Church; nothing of all this was required there; neither had the people any hand in the admitting of them, but the Apoſtles by themſelves and by their ſole authority managed the whole buſineſs; for thoſe that were converted and pricked in their hearts applying themſelves unto the Apoſtles ſaid, <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do;</hi> and the conditions upon which they admitted them upon their repentance were theſe onely; <hi>beleeve and be baptized in the Name of our Lord Jeſus;</hi> the bleſſed Apoſtles were not acquainted with our new modell, nor with the conditions of the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. But by the way let me tell the Illdependents that the Apoſtles and Diſciples had then a juſt ground of making ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, if ever any had; for they might with great reaſon have ſaid, howſoever theſe ſouls be not miracle proof, but that they are wounded to the heart by them, and by the Sermon of <hi>Peter;</hi> yet we are not by and by to confide in them and to admit them into church fellowſhip, unleſſe they will walk ſome time with us that we may have experience of the truth of their converſion; and unleſſe alſo they will make all and every one of them a publike and particular confeſſion of his faith, and bring in the evidences of their converſion, and enter alſo into a particular explicite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48122:324"/>
for obſerving all the Laws of memberſhip, and that they come in by the generall conſent and approbation of the church. I ſay if ever there was a time that theſe conditions might have been required by any, it might then eſpecially have been, becauſe all thoſe had had their hand in crucifying of the Lord of life, as <hi>Peter</hi> told them; and therefore they might all be well ſuſpected that howſoever for the preſent they were all ſtruck into a trembling condition, yet that they could not judge upon ſo ſhort a time of the ſoundneſſe of their converſion, and therefore they might well have urged all the former conditions, and chiefly becauſe they had our Saviours own example freſhly before their eyes in the ſecond of <hi>John</hi> where it is related <hi>that he would not commit himſelfe unto men</hi> which had been convinced by his miracles, although <hi>they beleeved in him;</hi> ſo that I ſay in that regard, <hi>when Chriſt would not commit himſelfe unto them,</hi> the Apoſtles and Diſciples might much more have pretended in all theſe regards that they had no reaſon to confide in theſe men until they had had better experience of them for the truth of their converſion. But when neither the Apoſtles nor none of all the Diſciples ſo much as urged any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon them beyond the commiſſion given them by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to wit, <hi>Repentance, Faith and Baptiſm:</hi> the example of this church is for ever binding to all churches, that they in the admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Members ſhould do the ſame, and they that propound other conditions do no leſſe then accuſe the Apoſtles of injuſtice and imprudency, as of taking that authority into their own hands from the people, and of ſo ſuddenly and without any deliberation admitting of Members into church-fellowſhip which ought, according to my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> doctrine, ever to be done with great caution, who ſaith in his 14. Page <hi>Multa cautela non nocet;</hi> adding moreover <hi>that in things weighty we cannot be too wary,</hi> in regard <hi>they look not ſo much at circumſtances in converſion as the ſubſtance; and in regard alſo there ought to be a provident care for preventing inconveniences and ſcandalls; ſeeing</hi> turpius ejici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="516" facs="tcp:48122:325"/>
of all the Apoſtles of deficiency, why do they not follow their examples? and why do they impoſe new laws of admitting of Members and other conditions, then either <hi>Christ</hi> the King of his church, <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> or his holy Apoſtles did? Which whether or no it be not one of the preſumptuous and blaſphemous wickedneſſes, both in the Miniſters and the people that exerciſe this new Government, that ever was in the world, I leave it to the judgement of all conſciencious and ſolid Chriſtians. This one example in the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> might be a ſufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident for all churches imitation for ordinary admiſſion of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into church-fellowſhip. But I will produce other admiſſions in the ſame church, that there may be no want of witneſſes to corroborate this truth.</p>

               <p>In the fifth chapter, <hi>upon the ſudden and miraculous death of</hi> Ananias &amp; Saphira, <hi>and through the other wonders and miracles that were wrought,</hi> it is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>that beleevers were the more added unto the Lord, multitudes both of men and women:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>many more Congregations and Aſſemblies of beleevers were added to the Lord and admitted to be Members of that Church; And all theſe alſo were admitted to be Members by the Apoſtles ſole authority, and that as ſoon as they offered themſelves to be entertained without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe conditions they now require in their new gathered Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> And yet let me tell the Independents by the way, that at this time alſo the Apoſtles and Diſciples might have challenged a right to have propounded thoſe conditions, if they might at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time have been urged upon the people: for they might have ſuſpected, that this ſuddain converſion proceeded more from the miracles then from any ſound conviction of them from the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their ſinne: And therefore they might have urged that it was now very fit that they ſhould propound ſome other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of admiſſion then they had formerly impoſed upon them; and that it was requiſite and convenient that they ſhould now walk ſometime in church-fellowſhip with them, that they might
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:48122:326"/>
have more &amp; better aſſurance of their real and true converſion, and that they ought therefore before their admiſſion be urged to make all and every one of them <hi>a particular confeſſion of their faith, and bring in the evidences of their converſion, and enter into a particular explicite Covenant for the better preſerving of Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> eſpecially they ſeeing now before their eyes a preſident of ſo groſſe hypocriſie and falſe dealing in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and what a conſternation came upon the whole church by it, and by the which alſo God was ſo much diſpleaſed: therefore I ſay in all theſe regards they might then with very good reaſon, if at any time, have urged all thoſe conditions, and withall they might well have added, that they ſhould not be admitted without the conſent of the whole church, of all which when there is no mention, it is abundantly evident that they were received into church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion without them and that by the ſole authority of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here we have neither any walking required at their hands, for he better aſſurance, either of <hi>Philip</hi> or the Church, of the ſoundneſſe of their converſion: Here is no publike confeſſion of their faith required before their admittance into Church-fellowſhip: Here is no evidences of their converſion called for: Here is no particular explicite covenant demanded of them: Here is no conſent of the people deſired before their admiſſion into Church communion, and yet this was a Church eſtabliſhed according to the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. So that according to the practice of the two Mother churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all beleevers were admitted members, and received into Church-fellowſhip, without the conditions thoſe of the Congregational way now require of all thoſe of their new gathered Churches: Whether therefore it be not a high preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and arrogancy in all the Independents, to ſlight the Laws of Chriſt, the King of his Church, and the example of Chriſt himſelf, and the example of all the bleſſed Apoſtles, I leave it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all prudent and adviſed Chriſtians. I will now to ſatisfie my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> deſire, viſit ſome Churches of the Gentiles, formed according to the New Teſtament Form; and I will firſt in this viſitation, begin with that Church which he himſelf hath ſet before all Churches for a patern of imitation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>

                  <hi>In the eighteenth of the</hi> Acts <hi>it is recorded, that when</hi> Silas <hi>and</hi> Timothy <hi>were come unto</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Corinth, <hi>the Jewes refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to receive the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that hee ſhooke his ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, and ſaid unto them your blood be upon your own heads, I am cleare, from hence-forth I will goe unto the Gentiles, and departing thence, hee entred into ones houſe named <hi>Iuſtus,</hi> one that worſhipped God, <hi>and preaching the Goſpel there, it is ſaid, that</hi> Criſpus <hi>a chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue,</hi> beleeved on the Lord with all his houſe, and many of the Corinthians hearing, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and were baptized.</p>
               <p>Here wee ſee in a Church put into a Goſpel forme, the Members of that church were admitted by the ſole authority of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and that barely upon their hearing and beleeving; for the Apoſtle required no other conditions of them for their admiſsion into church Fellowſhip, hee ſaid not unto thoſe many that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, that before they could be made Members of that church they muſt walke ſome time with the church, that they might have
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:48122:328"/>
experience of the truth of their converſion; neither did he injoyn them for ſatisfaction of the people, to make a publicke confeſsion of their faith, or to bring in the evidences of their converſion, or to enter into any particular explicite covenant, or to have the conſent of the whole church, nothing of all this did <hi>Paul</hi> require of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this church after the Goſpel forme; but following Chriſt the Kings commiſsion upon their Faith, Repentance, and Baptiſme, hee hy his owne and ſole authority admitted them. The ſame way of admitting of Members wee ſhall find in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as it is at large to be ſeene in the nineteenth chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the manner of admiſſion of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers there is fully ſet downe, and that was a Church alſo my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> ſets downe amongſt thoſe that muſt be brought in for the making up of a compleate paterne, now in all thoſe Churches they were all admitted upon Chriſts owne termes, and by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Miniſters ſole authority, without either walking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with the Church, or without any publicke confeſſion of their faith to the Congregation, or bringing in their evidences, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into any private explicite Covenant, or without the conſent of the people. How unſufferable a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>therefore is it now then in all thoſe of the congregationall way, to demand other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all their Members before they can be admitted into Church-fellowſhip with them, then thoſe that Chriſt the King of his Church, and all his bleſſed Apoſtles demanded? If this be not the higheſt point of preſumption that was ever heard of, I leave it to the conſideration of the very ruggedeſt Independents upon due deliberation, deſiting they may all ſeriouſly lay it to heart, and timely repent of it: for if they doe not they will indeed be found fighters againſt God, and diſ-throners of Chriſt the King, when they ſhall ſlight both his Lawes and example, and the example of his bleſſed Apoſtles, and the practiſe of all thoſe glorious Goſpel formed Churches, and ſet up new Lawes and examples of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Churches, and of admitting of Members, whereas in all the New Teſtament wee have but one way of admitting of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whether in an ordinary way, or an extraordinary; for they that are made Members of any particular Church, by vertue of that they are made Members of the Catholike, and thoſe likewiſe that are made Members of the Catholike Church, may by vertue of their admiſſion into it, be Members in any particular Church, as
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:48122:328"/>
I ſhall prove by the Independents owne Principles. And as for the ordinary way of admitting of Members, I have proved it from the fore-going examples, and the Primitive practiſe, that it was upon condition onely of Repentance, Faith, and Baptiſme, and Chriſt required no more; and for the extraordinary way if it bee evinced that that was after the ſame manner, and upon no other conditions, then all men may ſee into what a deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Rebellion all the Independents have by their new wayes plunged themſelves into, and may withall well perceive the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all thoſe cavils my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> made againſt my following Arguments. Now that they may ſee how, and upon what conditions all Chriſtians were admitted into the catholicke viſible Church, it will be worth their paines to looke upon the practice of the holy Miniſters of the Goſpel, both Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, who were all directed in what they did, by the ſpeciall command of Chriſt himſelfe; And therefore farre more worthy of imitation then our Independents practiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now we may take notice, that when the Angel appeared unto <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> in the tenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> hee ſent him unto <hi>Ioppa,</hi> to call for one <hi>Simon,</hi> whoſe ſurname was <hi>Peter;</hi> hee did not ſend him unto the Church in <hi>Joppa.</hi> And it is related that when <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and that hee had recited unto him the manner of the viſion, and that hee was commanded by the Angell to ſend for him; it is further alſo declared what <hi>Peter</hi> there did, and that he ſaid, <hi>of a truth J perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation, hee that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſſe is accepted with him.</hi> And after a Sermon made unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and all that were aſſembled there with him; It is ſaid, that <hi>the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the Word, and that all the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that came with</hi> Peter, <hi>were aſtoniſhed at it, for they heard them speake with divers tongues, and magnified God. Then anſwered</hi> Peter, <hi>can any man forbid water that theſe men ſhould not bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as wee? And hee commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.</hi> Here wee ſee firſt, that <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent unto, and not the Church: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he admitted <hi>Cornelius</hi> and thoſe that were with him into the number of beleevers, and into the fellow-ſhip of the Church by his owne authority, and never conſulted with the Church to aske their leave or voyce, but concludes the buſines
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:48122:329"/>
with an interrogation, which hath a greater force of binding that no man ought to hinder any beleever from comming into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the church and communion of Saints, in whom the graces of Gods ſpirit evidently appeare, as in theſe; ſo that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Miniſters come into their houſes, or they goe into the Miniſters and make ſufficient teſtimony by themſelves of their faith, and that they feare God, of what nation ſoever they bee, they are by the Miniſters to bee admitted; the congregation hath nothing to doe to hinder any ſuch, nay, they may not, it is more than belongs unto them; neither did thoſe that came with <hi>Peter</hi> intermeddle in that buſines, or require a covenant at their hand, or a publik confeſsion of their faith.</p>
               <p>Againe, when the Lord of his infinite mercy was purpoſed to reveale himſelfe unto the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in the 8. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he ſendeth <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangeliſt unto him, whom hee found reading in his chariot, the propheſie of <hi>Jſaiah,</hi> and after that hee had interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him that propheſie, and preached unto him Ieſus and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in his name it is related, <hi>that when they came unto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine water, the Eunuch ſaid unto him, what doth hinder me to be baptized? and</hi> Philip <hi>ſaid, if thou beleeveſt with all thine heart, thou maiſt:</hi> And hee anſwered and ſaid, <hi>J beleeve that Ieſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God: and hee commanded the chariot to ſtand ſtill and they went downe both into the water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the Eunuch, and hee baptized him.</hi> Here wee ſee that <hi>Philip</hi> and not the church was ſent unto the Eunuch, and that <hi>Philip</hi> by his owne authority, and upon the Eunuch his owne teſtimony, without any reference unto any church, or without conſulting with any Congregation, admits him into the number of beleevers, and makes him a member of the church, and here was neither a publicke confeſſion required of him by any of the church, or any Covenant exacted by the people: and ſo when <hi>Saul</hi> in the 9. of the <hi>Acts</hi> was fallen downe out of aſtoniſhment, and afterwards was converted as the Storie there fully declareth the whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, the Lord ſent one <hi>Ananias</hi> a Diſciple, and Miniſter unto him; hee did not ſend the church unto him, neither did <hi>Ananias</hi> when hee came to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſay unto him, I will conſult with the church to ſee whether they will admit thee to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for thou haſt greatly waſted the church, and made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocke of the Saints, and therefore I will have their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and conſent, and I will have thee firſt walke with the Church ſome time, that they may behold thy converſation, and then thou ſhalt make a confeſſion of thy faith publickly before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and give in thy evidences of the truth of thy converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and enter in a private and ſolemne covenant, and ſo be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and admitted. But without all this adoe he baptizes <hi>Paul</hi> and admitteth him into the number of beleevers, and makes him a member of this formed Church, &amp; that by his ſole authority, and he was received immediatly among the Diſciples at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> without any reluctation, or ſo much as any ſcruple, and <hi>ſtrait-way hee preached Chriſt in the Synagogue that hee was the Son of God;</hi> hee was both ordained and put in office without the approbation and conſent of the people, who knew nothing of the buſines, but <hi>onely ſtood amazed,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Is not this hee that deſtroyed them which called on this name in</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>and came hither for that intent, that hee might bring them bound unto the high Prieſt?</hi> The Miniſters in thoſe dayes when they were all taught of God, they only admitted Members by their owne authority into the church, without the approbation of the people; but in theſe our dayes, wherin people have gotten itching eares, and teachers after their owne humours (ſuch as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to <hi>Timothy)</hi> they teach a new doctrine, and bring forth new borne lights, to the darkening of truth it ſelfe, and to the bringing in a confuſion of all things. See what Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith in his fifth chapter to all churches and chriſtians in the world, <hi>Is any man ſicke,</hi> ſaith hee? <hi>let him ſend for the Presbyters of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and let them pray over him, &amp;c. and the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſicke, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up, and if he have committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> here ſends all chriſtians to the Presbyters of every church, who had the power of the Keyes delegated unto them for ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and whoſe office onely it was to pronounce pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes unto the ſicke upon their true Repentance, if they had offended and ſinned againſt God in the time of their health, and ſo ſcandalized the Goſpel and the Church; and it was the Presbyters place and office to admit them againe into the fellowſhip and communion of the Saints upon their co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:48122:330"/>
offenders out of the Church, ſo they onely had the authority of receiving them in againe upon their repentance, and not the Church; ſo if wee looke into all thoſe Epiſtles that were written unto the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the 2. and 3. of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> we ſhall find them all directed to the Angels of the ſeven Churches, which is as much as to ſay, to the preſidents of every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Presbytrie eſtabliſhed and conſtituted in every one of thoſe Churches; which is a ſufficient Argument to me, to prove a Counſell or Colledge of godly Miniſters in every one of thoſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 1. verſe 5. <hi>for this cauſe left I thee in</hi> Creet <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt ordaine Presbyters in every Citie,</hi> not one but many. And in the 14. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> verſe 23. <hi>and when they had ordained them Presbyters in every Church,</hi> &amp;c. many Presbyters, a Colledge of them was appointed to every Church: and ſo in the 20. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there were many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who had the charge and government of that Church commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them in common, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. there was a Colledge of them conſtituted in that church, and therefore for order ſake (which the light of nature teacheth) they muſt have a Preſident, who by the way of excellencie, and to diſtinguiſh him from the other, is called an Angel, as the inſcription of the Epiſtle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, ſaying, <hi>Vnto the Angel of the Church of Epheſus.</hi> As in our dialect, when we ſpeake of the great counſell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or of the reverend aſſembly of Divines, if there be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diſtinguiſhing the Preſidents of thoſe councels from the other Judges in thoſe aſſemblies, wee ſay, Maſter Speaker in the houſe of Lords or Commons; or of the Preſident of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, we ſay, Maſter Prolocutor; and if any have occaſion to write to either houſes or to the Aſſembly, they direct their letters to the Speakers, or to the Prolocutor, who communicates them to each Aſſemblies, as being the Preſidents of each Society, and yet none of all theſe Preſidents by that their place of honour and eminency have any more power or authority then the reſt, but onely in the caſting voyce when the parties upon any occaſion are for number equall, and for appoynting of the times and places of meeting, and for the methodicall and orderly carriage of the buſines; yea, it is ever obſerved, whereſoever there is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, there is a colledge or councell, or a court; nature dictates this, and the cuſtome of all nations proves it: and withall, by the
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:48122:330"/>
ſame light of reaſon that counſell or colledge to whom God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe writes and directs his letters for redreſſing of abuſes, has the power in their hands for the rectifying of things amiſſe, and that it peculiarly belongeth unto them, as to the Magiſtrates inveſted with authority, to order things according to direction, and to puniſh and caſt out offenders; and that by their own power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent and approbation of the people, as it is now in the great Councell and Parliament of the Kingdome; who make not the people acquainted with what they have to do, but ſo far as it pleaſeth themſelves, and not out of any duty: And ſo it was in the government of Gods Church by the firſt conſtitution, every Church conſiſting of many congregations, were governed by a colledge of Presbyters, as that of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and this of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the other ſix Churches; in all the which the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters by their ſole authority governed them according to Gods Word, without taking the people into councell with them, who were no where joyned in commiſſion with them: and therefore it is moſt apparent by thoſe examples I have now produced, and many more that might be added; and from the commiſſion that Chriſt gave to the Apoſtles, and in them to all Miniſters, that the people had not their voices, either for the admitting of any to be Members in any church, or in the caſting out of any for their delinquency, much leſſe have they authority to require a publike confeſſion of their faith to be made unto the congregation, or to exact of them to bring in the evidences of their true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or to require that they ſhould walk with them ſome time before admiſſion, or to enter into a ſolemn private Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be admitted as Members, for we have no preſident for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe things in Gods Word, much leſſe any command, only in <hi>Acts</hi> the ſixt, there is mention made, that the Apoſtles for the freeing of themſelves from all unneceſſary incombrances, and that they might the better attend upon their Miniſtery and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, gave the people liberty to make choice of their own Deacons, but ſtill keeping the power of ordaining them in their own hand, which always was arbitrary in them whether they would exerciſe it or no, neither would the Apoſtles have ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, unleſſe thoſe that were to be ordained, had been men ſo qualified as they had appointed; for otherwiſe, it lay in their choyce whether they would ordain them or no. But that ever the
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:48122:331"/>
congregation or people had the power of admitting of members, or of ordaining of Officers, it is no where extant in Gods Word: But that the women ſhould have a voice in the Church, either for receiving in, or caſting out of members or officers, or ſhould have any thing to do with <hi>Peters</hi> Keys, it is againſt the law of God and nature: For <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> 14. makes it one of the marks of confuſion in any Church where women have their voices, ſaying, <hi>God is not the Author of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the Saints;</hi> and in the next verſe following in expreſſe words ſaith, <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in the churches, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak, but they are commanded to be under obedience, as alſo ſaith the law: and if they will learn any thing, let them ask their huſbands at home, for it is a ſhame for women to ſpeak in the Church.</hi> And what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writ to this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> he writ to all Churches, and proclames that what he writ to them <hi>were the commandments of the Lord,</hi> ver. 37. ſo that God had commanded that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould not ſpeak in the Church, and ſaith <hi>that it is a ſhame they ſhould:</hi> and yet in theſe our dayes, in many of the new congregations, they have their voices in chooſing of officers and admitting of Members, and have all of them <hi>Peters</hi> Keys at their Girdle, and make learned parts of ſpeech in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſpute queſtions and debate of matters and give their reaſons <hi>con &amp; pro</hi> as it is credibly reported and others of them ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as if it had been the ſpeciall care in the Apoſtle to prevent this evill of womens intermedling in matters of the Church, he foreſeeing the confuſion that would be brought in upon it: In his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all Miniſters, to whom the Government of the Church was
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:48122:331"/>
committed, he gives him direction <hi>how to behave himſelfe in the houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God;</hi> in chap. 2. verſe 11. 12. hee ſaith. <hi>Let the women learne in ſilence, with all ſubjection; for I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurpe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the man, but to be in ſilence; for</hi> Adam <hi>was firſt made, then</hi> Eve; <hi>and</hi> Adam <hi>was not deceived, but the woman being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was in the tranſgreſſion,</hi> &amp;c. Here the Apoſtle againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, twice in theſe few words, enjoyns them ſilence in the church, and impoſes upon them ſubjection and obedience: <hi>I ſuffer not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a woman to teach or to uſurpe authority over the man, but to be in ſilene;</hi> and he giveth his reaſons of this his command, <hi>becauſe</hi> ſaith he, Adam <hi>was firſt made,</hi> not by the woman nor of the woman, but the contrary; and therefore ſhee may uſurpe no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the maſculine ſex, eſpecially in Gods matters, and ſhe is to be the diſciple of the man, and not the man her ſcholar: and therefore that ſuperiority that the God of order had eſtabliſhed upon the man in the firſt creation, hee doth now re-eſtabliſh upon him againe in his holy Word, after all things through ſinne had beene diſordered and confuſed; and commands the woman to be both ſubject and ſilent, eſpecially in the Church. Another reaſon of this his command is, becauſe the woman was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, and was the cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as hee accuſes her, and her diſputing and voycing of it then brought confuſion upon all man-kind; and for this her ſo doing, S. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hereafter, that ſhe ought to hold her peace &amp; be in ſubjection to her husband, and ought to learne in ſilence at home, but more eſpecially in the Church; for if they come to voice it once againe in the Church, as <hi>Eve</hi> brought confuſion upon man-kind by her diſputation and reaſon, ſo theſe with their loquacity and babble and confuſion of voyces will bring in a new <hi>Babel</hi> into the Church and State, as they have prettily well already begun to doe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurpe authority over the man, but to be in ſilence.</hi> Here the Apoſtle as in the place above cited, out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 14. commands them ſilence, and permits them not to ſpeake, and expreſſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to uſurpe authority over the man, that is, the viril ſex. Now I appeale unto any underſtanding creature, whether or no, to make large parts of ſpeech in the Church (as many of them upon occaſions doe) and diſpute and give their reaſons <hi>con &amp; pro,</hi>
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:48122:332"/>
be not to ſpeak in the Church? and whether to have their voices in either admitting of Members or Officers, or in the caſting of them out, be not to uſurpe authority over the man? for all the world knows, that they that have the power in their hands of either admitting of any into the fellowſhip or communion of the Church, or of hindring their coming in, or have their voices for the caſting of them out when they are received, exerciſe and uſurpe authority over thoſe they ſo deal with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there-fore they do againſt the expreſſe prohibition of the Apoſtles, and all thoſe women that have uſurped this authority, and all thoſe Miniſters that have permitted them ſo to do, or taught this doctrine unto them, are all guilty of great contumacy againſt God, and ought ſeriouſly to repent for this their temerity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and it will be the imortall honour of thoſe women that have not intermedled; and if there be not ſome ſpeedy courſe taken by authority to forbid ſuch diſorder, we may promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Church and whole Kingdome but confuſion. It hath ever been obſerved, that Hermaphrodite councels in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or Country, when women that are ſubjects intermeddle in government and matters of ſtate, that that Kingdome and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is very craſed and not far from ruine and deſtruction; and we need not look into many ages or countries for preſidents of this kind; and if Hermaphrodite counſels in Kingdoms have ever been ſo fatall unto them, what may any man think in time will become of this Church and Kingdome, when the women have gotten <hi>Peters</hi> Keys at their girdle, and have their voices in many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and a power of ordering and diſpoſing of things in Church affairs? Certainly, nothing but confuſion can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; for this their doing is againſt the expreſſe command of God, who is the God of order, and injoyns the contrary: Yea, it is not onely againſt the law of God, but againſt the very law of nature and the practice of all Nations; for never was it yet heard of in any well governed City, or Commonwealth, or Kingdome, that women that were ſubjects had their voices in chooſing offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or Burgeſſes, or making of freemen, or disfranchiſing of them, or were permitted ſo much as to ſit in counſell with them, much leſſe to rule and give laws to others out of their own houſes: And therefore as it is a thing odious to God and man, and that which is a ſhame to that ſex, it ought to be caſt out of all
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:48122:332"/>
wel-governed Churches and States; and as the women ought to know their places, ſo ought all men that are under obedience to learne their duty, and not to take upon them that which God never gave unto them, as to have their voice either in making of members in Churches, or caſting of them out, or of ordaining of officers, or of impoſing laws upon others, either of making pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confeſſions before the congregations, or of producing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their converſion, or that they ſhould walk with them ſome time that they might behold their converſation, or of impoſing a Covenant upon any that ſhall be admitted; for all rule and government in the Church is put into the hands of the Presbyters, and does not belong unto the people or multitude, neither may the Presbyters uſurpe authority, but they alſo muſt exerciſe it onely, according to the commiſſion given unto them by Chriſt, they may not tranſgreſſe it or go beyond it in the leaſt thing; and therefore when many of the brethren call for a publike confeſſion of mens faith to be made in their new congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and the evidences of their converſion to be produced, and impoſe a Covenant upon them before they admit them to be members of their Church, (as if they had lived before in infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Who notwithſtanding were known to be holy and godly Chriſtians, and as true beleevers as any that now live in the world) and think them onely Chriſtians and Beleevers that doe as they would have them, and count of others that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelves to their cuſtomes and novelties; but as the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcowring and refuſe and no Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay it is an intolerable uſurpation, and a thing that was yet never before practiſed in the world, in any Church either Jewiſh or Chriſtian till theſe dayes, and therefore they go beyond their commiſſion in ſo doing; for God in his commiſſion to his Apoſtles and all Miniſters, bids them admit of all that come in and beleeve and are baptized, he quencheth not the ſmoaking flax nor breaketh the bruiſed reed; now then, when they know thouſands in this Kingdome that do beleeve, and are men of unblamable lives, and ſuch as would lay down their lives for the faith once delivered unto the Saints and are baptized; what have they to do to lord it over them, and to hinder them from communicating in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and to be admitted into Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fellowſhip with them, or to debarre them from the communion of the Saints? <q>Me thinks
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:48122:333"/>
the viſion to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the tenth of the <hi>Acts</hi> ſhould teach ſuch men their duty, <hi>when God ſaid unto</hi> Peter <hi>riſe kill and eat,</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid not ſo Lord, for I have never eaten any thing that is common and unclean; and the voyce ſaid, what God hath cleanſed call not thou common.</hi> And this, ſaith the Scripture, was done thrice, that by the mouth of two or three Witneſſes this truth might be confirmed to <hi>Peter</hi> and all other Miniſters, not to call thoſe people common, prophane and unclean, and to count them but rubbiſh, whom God hath graced with the gifts of his holy Spirit, and hath ſanctified, and ſuch as beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt and are baptized as well as themſelves, and ſuch as ſtood to the truth when they durſt not ſhew their faces, but ran from the Cauſe and deſerted it, or at leaſt temporized, and ſuch as if the like occaſions were offered, would manifeſt unto the world (by Gods aſſiſtance) that their lives and all they have ſhould not be dear unto them for the reſtimony of Jeſus; and yet ſuch as theſe muſt be debarred from the communion in their Aſſemblies, unleſſe they will conforme to their new-born traditions; for theſe are no traditions of the Elders, but of the younger: and if Chriſt in his time ſharply reproved thoſe that brake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God through the traditions of men, and deeply reproved the Miniſters in thoſe dayes for teaching the people to preferre the traditions of the Elders before the commandements of God, and for teaching them the fear of God after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men: What ſhall we think thoſe Miniſters will have to anſwer at the dreadfull day of judgement, when they ſet up their traditions in the Church of God and preferre them before the Commandements of God? and what can any man think of the condition of that people, that account of ſuch novelties as the Oracles of God, and violate the law of Love, and make rents and ſchiſms in the ſeamleſſe garment of the church through theſe traditions?</q> Surely whatſoever they may promiſe to themſelves, their condition is very dangerous; for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Woe be to thoſe by whom offences come,</hi> Matthew 18, <hi>and whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that beleeve in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his necke, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea.</hi> And whether this be not to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the the Commandements of God through their traditions and to offend thoſe little ones that beleeve in Chriſt, when they
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:48122:333"/>
will not receive ſuch into the communion and fellowſhip of the church, as beleeve and are baptized, but count them as aliens and ſtrangers, yea, infidels and rubbiſh, I referre my ſelfe to any that is but of ordinary underſtanding. For Gods command unto all Miniſters was, that they ſhould admit all ſuch into the church as beleeved and were baptized upon their deſiring it, without any confeſsion, either private or publicke, or entring into any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Now this command of God they trangreſſe by their traditions, and keepe out many thouſands of Beleevers through the Kingdome, as unholy, and as having no right to the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe forſooth they will not obey their new-borne Lawes and Traditions; for where did ever God command that no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſhould bee admitted into the church except they made a publicke confeſsion of their faith, and walked ſome time in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip amongſt them, and then gave in the evidences of their converſion, and entred into a private covenant, and gave the Church ſatisfaction? Or where was it ever practiſed by any of the Primitive chriſtians, either by thoſe that were converted by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Sermons and the other Apoſtles, or by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching? was <hi>Lydia</hi> (when God opened her heart to beleeve <hi>Pauls</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching) admitted into the church upon any ſuch termes? was the Goaler and his converted family forced to make a publicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the church of their faith, and to give in the evidences of their converſion, and to enter into a private convenant before they could be made Members of the Church, or was the Churches aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent required before they could be admitted and made members of it, or were ever any of theſe things they impoſe upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now, required at beleevers hands before theſe our times? and therefore they are to be abominated as vaine traditions, and ſuch as by which they breake the Lawes of God, making diviſions in the Church and Kingdome, and through all the families, and houſes of the ſame, ſo that neither Maſters of families nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have any rule over their wives, children or ſervants: their husbands goe out one way, the wife another, their children to this Aſſembly, their ſervants to that Congregation, and as it was among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> blames in them, one ſaid, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> another I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the third I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and ſo they flutter about like a company of chickings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either heads or wit, and none will bee under obedience
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:48122:334"/>
to either Parents or Maſters (not withſtanding God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded children to obey their Parents and ſervants their Maſters) no farther than pleaſeth their owne humours, and all this they have learned by the traditions of the younger: and whether I have wronged the Brethren in any thing I have now ſaid, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my ſelfe to all the diſtracted Families in the Kingdome where they have beene preaching, and the daily experience of any moderate minded Chriſtian: and if ever there was a Panthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Religions in the world, it is now in <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of theſe new teachers, to the great diſhonour of God, the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Reformation, and the alienating of the affections one from another of thoſe that are joyned together in nigheſt relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now whereas Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>and my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>paſſing by the Church of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>in their march (as I ſaid before) make ſome poore weake skirmiſhes againſt my forces drawne out of the Garriſons of holy Writ, as that of the</hi> Eunuch, Paul, Cornelius, Lydia, <hi>and the</hi> Goaler, <hi>which I had formerly brought into the field, pretending they were extraordinary and not binding, becauſe they were not (as they ſay) admitted in any particular Church conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, according to the Goſpel forme, but into the catholike viſible Church: I cannot paſſe by their trifling without ſome anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their bravado; and therefore I thought good in this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I march on to fight them, that they may not hereafter boaſt, &amp; vapour, that I durſt not incounter them, or looke upon their moſt materiall Reſerves, which is concerning</hi> Cornelius, <hi>and thoſe that were with him, which they eſpecially pitch upon, conceiving they have a great advantage againſt mee, for the making of this ground good,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> the ſole power of admitting any to bee Members of any Church, doth not reſide, and lye ſoly in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Gospel, but that the people alſo have a hand as well in their admiſſion as they; and if they ſhall diſlike the reception of any, that then the Miniſters cannot by their owne and ſole authority ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them though never ſo well qualified, for this muſt neceſſarily be the ſcope of their incounter; <hi>for to what end otherwiſe ſhould it be made; yea, their very words manifeſt as much, which are theſe, firſt Maſter</hi> Knollys, <hi>page 15. and 16. thus declareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> that the brethren did not intermeddle in that buſines <hi>(ſaith he) viz.</hi> of the admittance of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and thoſe that were with him
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:48122:334"/>
by Baptiſme into the Church, I conceive the reaſon why the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did not intermeddle to hinder their admittance to that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſme, was not becauſe they had not that liberty, but becauſe they had no juſt objections to declare to <hi>Peter.</hi> Now that the Brethren had a liberty to declare any thing which might juſtly have hindred, doth appeare by the queſtion the Apoſtle expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>(ſaith hee) I conceive hee meant propounded, verſe 47.</hi> Can any man forbid water that theſe ſhould not bee baptized? And the Doctor himſelfe <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> acknowledgeth that the Brethren or Diſciples of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which muſt be a paterne of all Churches, had this liberty to except againſt ſome ſort of perſons, in caſe that ſuch perſons have beene formerly knowne to have beene open Enemies and Perſecutors of the Church, and then they are juſtly to bee ſuspected untill they have given publick evidence by witneſſe to the Miniſters of their true converſation, and there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a plaine inſtance to prove this out of <hi>Acts</hi> the ninth, where <hi>Paul</hi> comming to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> aſſayed to joyne himſelfe to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but they were all affraid of him, beleeving not that hee was a Diſciple. <hi>Thus Maſter</hi> Knollys <hi>ſpeaks, and then concludes,</hi> that all the Diſciples in the like caſe have the ſame liberty, becauſe <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> the Mother-church is to bee a paterne to all other Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-churches: therefore <hi>(ſaith hee)</hi> when it doth evidently appeare, that the Diſciples or Brethren of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in her moſt flouriſhing condition had this liberty to declare their feares and their ground thereof againſt <hi>Paul:</hi> How can the Doctor <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> make good that the Presbyters alone, without the conſent of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren may admit Members, and caſt out Members, and that the Brethren and the Congregation have nothing to doe to hinder any ſuch thing? <hi>I have faithfully ſet downe his words, and the force of his Argument, to which I will by and by give my anſwer after I have ſet downe alſo what my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>hath to ſay in this buſines, and then I will reply to them both in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Brother</hi> Burtons <hi>words are theſe, page 17.</hi> It is one thing <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> to preach, and inſtrumentally to convert ſoules, which chiefly pertaines to thoſe that are called thereunto, but in the caſe of Church-government, of admitting and casting out, it is otherwiſe. And here let <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe <hi>(whoſe words you alleage)</hi> reſolves us; who when the Holy Ghoſt ſo wonderfully fell on all of them that heard the Word, ſaid, can any man forbid water, that theſe men
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:48122:335"/>
ſhould not be baptized? &amp;c. Which words imply, that if any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions could have been made, it was in thoſe Jews preſent, to give forth their allegations, why thoſe beleeving Gentiles ſhould not be admitted to become one Church with the beleeving Jews: So as your Obſervations fall to the ground: as that firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot the Church: And ſecondly <hi>Peter</hi> commanded them to be baptized: Again this example was extraordinary in all the circumſtances of it: Your inſtance of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> Act. <hi>8. 8.</hi> of <hi>Lydia</hi> Act. <hi>16.</hi> as many other, are meer extravagants. We <hi>(faith he)</hi> ſpeak of Churches constituted, not of ſingle converts here and there one, not yet joyned into a particular Church-body.</p>
               <p>Thus my brother <hi>Burton</hi> declareth himſelfe, whoſe words I have faithfully ſet down and all he hath to ſay againſt all thoſe examples.</p>
               <p>But before I come to my anſwer I ſhall deſire the Reader to take notice of theſe mens dealings, they make all theſe examples either extravagants or extraordinary, and yet they would from the example of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> queſtion to the brethren that came along with him, inferre that the authority of admiſſion of Members, lay not onely in the Miniſters hand but in the peoples alſo, as who had the liberty to bring in their exceptions againſt any for their not admiſſion. So that theſe men at pleaſure will make the ſame Scripture they except againſt as not authoritative and binding for us, yet to be bindingly preſidentiall for themſelvs; So that as far as in their own opinion it makes for their grolleries and ſerves their turn it ſhall be for a pattern of imitation to bind all Churches to the end of the world, which both Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> learnedly inferre; but as far as it makes for the advantage of the Presbyterian opinion and to ſhew that the Presbyters have the ſole authority of admitting Members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fellowſhip from the example of <hi>Philip, Ananias, Paul</hi> in baptizing the <hi>Goaler</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> baptizing of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and admitting of him and thoſe that were with him Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into Church communion by their ſole authority without thoſe conditions they propound and without the conſent of the people, then they cry out that they are extraordinary examples or meer extravagants. Now whether this be not with the Papiſts to make the Word of God a noſe of wax or a leaden rule that they may either work and mould it or bend it into what faſhion
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:48122:335"/>
they pleaſe, I leave it to the judgement of the learned and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Chriſtian. But by the way alſo I deſire the Reader to take notice what my brother <hi>Burton</hi> granteth: <hi>viz. that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of thoſe Gentiles, and the admitting of them by</hi> Peter <hi>into the Church by Baptiſm, was to make them one Church with the beleeving Jews;</hi> theſe are his own words: From which it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently apparent, that be men baptized and admitted into the Church either after an ordinary way or after an extraordinary, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to incorporate them into Church-fellowſhip both with the beleeving Jew and Gentile and to make them Members of <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> which is as much as I contend for: So that it is moſt certain as thoſe that are Members of any particular Church, are by vertue of that, Members alſo of the whole Catholique viſible Church: ſo in like manner thoſe that are made Members of the Catholique viſible Church may alſo by vertue of that, be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any particular church: for the Church of Chriſt is his Kingdome, and it is but one Flock and one Sheepfold, and there is but one Shepherd of it and King that governs it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in whatſoever part of this Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt they are admitted Members, and after what manner ſoever they be admitted, whether in an ordinary or an extraordinary way, they are Members of the whole Church and may communicate in all ordinances with any particular Church whatſoever as being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Chriſts Kingdome and injoying all the immunities and priviledges that any of Chriſts ſubjects can challenge. And all this I learn from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> doctrine, who ſo long as he holdeth out any truth unto me, I will liſten unto, as he hath done in this point, but no farther. Again as all thoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eunuch, Paul, Cornelius, Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>Goaler,</hi> were admitted to be Members of <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> by the ſole authority of the Miniſters, Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, and without any of thoſe conditions urged by the brethren; ſo are all other Chriſtians by the ſole authority of the Presbyters to be admitted into church-fellowſhip, and that upon Chriſts own conditions: <hi>viz. Faith, Repentance and Baptiſm.</hi> Having upon the occaſion of my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and <hi>Hanſerdoes</hi> words ſpake thus much, I will now come to my Anſwer to them both.</p>
               <p>And firſt whereas they peremptorily affirme from the interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Peter</hi> to thoſe that came along with him; where he
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:48122:336"/>
ſaith, <hi>Can any man forbid water that theſe men ſhould not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> &amp;c. that it doth imply that the brethren have power alſo of admitting Members into the church and ought to have their voices, as in the receiving of them in ſo in the caſting of them out. It is a meer <hi>non ſequitur</hi> and a very groundleſſe illation and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: for the interrogation plainly manifeſts the contrary: as will appear from other preſidents and reaſon: as for example in the eighth of the <hi>Romans ver.</hi> 33. 34. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? Who is he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> All the which interrogations do not imply as the Apoſtle himſelfe anſwereth, that any creature can lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, or that any creature can condemn, or that any creature can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Elect from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus. Another inſtance (to omit many) we have of the ſame nature with that of <hi>Peter</hi> Acts 8. 35. <hi>Where the</hi> Eunuch <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Philip, <hi>See here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> I demand of any whether or no this interrogation of his doth not imply as much as if he had ſaid, no creature now can hinder me from <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> ſeeing that we have water that element that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it, and I do beleeve: And ſo much may be gathered from <hi>Philips</hi> Anſwer to him, who ſaith, nothing could hinder his baptiſm and admiſſion into the Church, <hi>if he did beleeve in Chriſt with all his heart;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Eunuch</hi> anſwered, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Jeſus Christ is the Son of God;</hi> and he was forthwith baptized. So that by this it is ſufficiently manifeſt that that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they would gather from <hi>Peters</hi> words cannot groundedly be made: <hi>viz. that it is in the power of the people to hinder any:</hi> as is yet more evident from <hi>Peters</hi> own words and reaſons when he was queſtioned about this buſineſſe in the 11. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the ſtory whereof is there ſet down at large with <hi>Peters</hi> Anſwer to all their Objections, <hi>Who told them</hi> ver. 12. <hi>that the spirit bad him go with thoſe that came from</hi> Cornelius <hi>nothing doubting,</hi> &amp;c. ſaying in the concluſion of his diſcourſe and that with an irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible reaſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>For as much then as God gave them the like gifts as he did unto us, who beleeved in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, what was I, that I could withſtand God?</hi> All the which diſcourſe of <hi>Peter</hi> and this his reaſon do ſufficiently prove that his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, ſaying, <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not</hi>
                  <pb n="539" facs="tcp:48122:336"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed?</hi> Doth not imply as my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Knollys</hi> would have it, that it was in the power of thoſe that were with <hi>Peter</hi> or any other to have hindred their baptiſm and admiſſion into the church of Chriſt ſeeing they beleeved: For if <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe ſhould have refuſed it he had been diſobedient to God himſelfe and had doubted, which he was forbidden and withall had reſiſted in as much as had been in him the ſpirit of God; For ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, What was I, that I could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God?</hi> From which I gather and that by very good reaſon that all thoſe of the congregationall way that will not admit all ſuch as beleeve and are baptized into their new gathered churches without they walk ſome time with them and without the making of a publike confeſſion of their faith, and the bringing in of their evidences of their converſion and entring into a particular expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite covenant and without the conſent of the whole church are all fighters againſt God and withſtanders of his ſpirit: And if they do not ſpeedily repent for all their wickedneſſe, and relinquiſh their ungodly, unchriſtian and unbrotherly practiſes the Lord from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will ſhew his wrathfull diſpleaſure upon them all, for he will vindicate his honour and the honour and priviledges of his people? <hi>Shall not he avenge his own Elect and that ſpeedily?</hi> Luke 17.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice for anſwer to that impious cavill of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>Hanſerdo.</hi> Now for that inſtance that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Knollys</hi> bringeth, it quite overthroweth their doctrine, for it is point banke againſt it and their practiſe. For although it be not denyed, but that all true beleevers may at any time make their complaint to the Church, that is to ſay to thoſe that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church; to wit, the Presbyters, as the extreameſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge upon juſt offence; yet it muſt ever be granted that it lyeth in the breſt of thoſe that are Iudges to determine of the buſines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the allegations and probations, ſo that thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine may not be both Plaintifs and Iudges; this I ſay is ſo known a maxime that none can deny it. Beſides, we muſt take notice that we never read inall the New Teſtament, that the diſciples ever ſo much as queſtioned any that deſired to be admitted into church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſhip, or refuſed communion to any but <hi>Paul;</hi> &amp; the reaſon was as the Scripture relateth, becauſe they knew that hee had beene a mortall enemy unto them, and had beene a great Perſecutor, and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:48122:337"/>
were then ignorant of his converſion, and therefore it is ſaid they were affraid of him; and upon the like occaſion I beleeve any of the brethren in any church may doe the ſame, and they may feare ſuch an one, and ſuſpect him, and complaine of him, and that is all they can doe, but power they have none to keepe him out of Church-fellowſhip if upon the Miniſters and Presbyters exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the buſines they find that the man is a beleever, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from his ſinfull courſes; for by their ſole authority without their good liking, or the conſent of the people they may admit him into church fellowſhip; and if the people ſhould refuſe to receive him upon his aſſaying to joyne himſelfe with them, hee may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from them to the Presbyters and Miniſters who are Gods Stewards, and who have the power of the Keyes to open the doore of the church to whom they conceive are fit: and for this his ſo doing, and for the Presbyters accepting of his appeale they have the Apoſtles and Presbyters of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for an example; for when the Diſciples feared <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſeemed to be unwilling to admit him into communion with them: Hee forth with appeals to the Apoſtles, who upon his appeale admitted him into church fellowſhip according to their commiſſion, which was, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeved and was baptized, hee ſhould be received into the church and that without the conſent of the people, or any of thoſe conditions the Independents now impoſe upon their Members, as by this very example and inſtance of Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> doth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, which makes wholly againſt their doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and utterly overthrowes their tenent: for moſt certaine it is that the power of admitting of Members, and caſting out of offenders lies in thoſe mens hands only and ſolely that have the power of the Keyes, and are by God himſelfe made Stewards and Over-ſeers, and Guids of his Church his houſe, which when they peculiarly belong unto the Presbyters, and not to the people, they onely, and not the people ought to have the managing of the government of the church; and this hath beene ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the receiving in of Members, both in an ordinary way, and in an extraordinary manner, by all the examples I have produced, and by this very inſtance of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> alleaged by Maſter <hi>Knol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys</hi> himſelfe, who when hee was admitted into Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not onely without the conſent of the brethren, but againſt their good liking it is abundantly manifeſt, that the people have

nothing to doe with the government of the Church, but that it lyeth wholly in the Presbyters hands. And all this I ſay is clearly proved out of the good Word of God, within the wals of the which, it is ever ſafe to abide, and in the action of obedience to the which all men may promiſe to themſelves perpetuall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: and this ſhall ſuffice to have anſwered to all that Mr. <hi>Knol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys</hi> and my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> had to ſay to all my Arguments.</p>
               <p>And by all that I have now ſpoke, I hope it doth ſufficiently appeare that there is neither precept nor example through all the Holy Scripture to warrant the practiſe of theſe men in the gathering of their new Churches; and if a man will but looke a little more upon the practice of Chriſts ſeventy diſciples, &amp; of all the Apoſtles in the gathering of Churches, they ſhall not find one footſtep through the whole Booke of God of the gathering Churches after the manner of their congregating of their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: as for Chriſts Diſciples, they were all ſent to gather in the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they went not to gather in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted men from amongſt converted men, for they were to bring the loſt ſheepe into Chriſts fold (and wee are taught there is but one Shepheard and one ſheep-fold) wee never read that after they were once folded and brought into the Church, that any true Paſtors came into the fold and flocks of their fellow-ſhepheards; and picked out all the beſt and the fatteſt ſheep, and the moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and molded them into an Independent Fold by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſeparate and diſtinct from the others, and with the which they would have no fellowſhip and communion in the Ordinances, this was never heard of before theſe dayes: <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo farre from getting away of others ſheepe that hee tooke it for a diſhonour to him to build upon anothers foundation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and preached Chriſt in thoſe places where they had never heard of him before; and planted the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> himſelfe, and left <hi>Apollo</hi> to water it, and committed all the flocks that he had gathered, as that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to the charge and care of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors, and commands both the flocks and the Paſtors, and in them all Shepheards and Folds, to keepe unity and love one with another, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. &amp;c. and forbids them to make ſeparations and diviſions, and ſchiſmes betweene flock and flock, and this method hee uſed whereſoever hee came; yea, as ſoone as hee was converted and entred upon his miniſtry, as wee

               <p>I have been ever taught in Gods holy Word, that thoſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters that preached Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, and
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:48122:338"/>
opened the eyes of the blind, and turned them from darkeneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and taught the people that they ſhould repent and turne to God, and doe workes meet for repentance; and that inſtructed all men that they being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the hands of their enemies, they ſhould ſerve God without feare, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of their life, and teaching them that the grace of God bringing ſalvation, hath appeared to all men, for this very end that they ſhould deny all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God of our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, who gave himſelfe for us, that hee might redeeme us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes.

and which will be a greater ſnare than the Common-Prayer to many of the precious conſciences of Gods people, whoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is in his judgement, to dye in a priſon before they act or ſtoope unto ſo diſhonourable a thing as this is, to their Lord and Maſter, as to maintaine the black-coats with tythes, whom they looke upon as the profeſſed enemies of their anointed Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of his formall expreſſions, I leave the comment of theſe ſeverall paſſages to others: neither doe I rehearſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſuch like ſentences as are daily vented, to the intolerable diſgrace, both of all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of all thoſe beleeving chriſtians that are under their ſeverall char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that in every Pamphlet in the which they proclaime all the Miniſters to be the ſworne and profeſſed enemies of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ſuch as deny, diſclaime and preach againſt Chriſts kingly government over mens conſciences and churches; and for the people and beleevers in <hi>England,</hi> they proclaime them to be men unconverted, or at leaſt converted but in part, wanting the maine thing, Chriſts Kingly office; men viſibly out of the covenant of grace, who have not ſo much as an outward profeſſion of the faith; who deny Chriſt to be their King, to whoſe perſons and Infants the very Sacraments and ſeales of grace, with all church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>communion, may and ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By the which words, they not onely unchurch all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> but indeed all the reformed churches, and unchriſtian all chriſtians but thoſe that are in their owne independent aſſemblies, and account them as aliens and ſtrangers from the common-wealth of the Saints, and make Chriſt to be no King over them, or to have any Kingdome in or amongſt them, but onely amongſt themſelves in their new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: whereas Chriſt ever had a church or Kingdome upon earth in all ages before they were, and hath without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie a true Kingdome in many churches in theſe our dayes, where they are not. Had I not ſeene their expreſsions in print, and the Booke in which they are uttered, ſet forth by authority with approbation, I ſhould not have beleeved that they had all of them bin ſo uncharitable; but finding that booke not onely printed by licenſe, but generally applauded by them all and much magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as the frequent editions of it doe manifeſt, I gather, it is
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:48122:340"/>
the univerſall opinion of them all. Than the which, what could bee more uncharitably and unchriſtianly ſpoken? what comfort can any of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have in the ſociety of theſe men, who (what ſoever outward ſeeming favour they ſhew to them) in their hearts conceive of them as the ſworne enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and as men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to live, and who count it a diſhonourable thing to their Lord and Maſter, to maintaine thoſe black-coats with tythes, whom they looke on as the profeſſed enemies of their anointed Chriſt? can I ſay, any Miniſters with joy and alacrity converſe with theſe men? no ſurely; what reall comfort can any poor chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian beleevers through the Kingdome either expect or looke for at theſe mens hands if they were in their power, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare (and that in print, and in their Pulpits) to be men uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or converted but in part, wanting the maine thing, Chriſts Kingly office, men viſibly out of the covenant of grace, who have not ſo much as an outward profeſſion of faith, who deny Chriſt to be their King; to whoſe perſons and Infants the very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſeales of grace, with all church-communion, may and ought to be denied? can any true chriſtians be reall friends to the enemies of Chriſt? <hi>He</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 22.) <hi>that loveth not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathama Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha;</hi> will any true Chriſtians bleſſe thoſe that God hath curſt? <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I hate them that hate thee, yea, I hate them with a perfect hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely thoſe that are true friends to Chriſt, hate all his enemies; now they looke upon our Miniſters as the profeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, and upon all the people under their miniſtery as enemies of his Kingdome, and as men to whoſe perſons &amp; infants the very Sacraments and ſeales of grace, with all church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, may and ought to be denied (they are their own words) can they therefore expect any reall friendſhip from them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever outward curteſie they ſeeme to ſhew them? no doubtleſſe; how can any poore chriſtian have any delight to come amongſt theſe men, or ſo much as to be in their ſociety, whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of as the enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome? For my owne particular, I would not willingly come in any mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or be familiar with any that I thought a profeſt enemy of Chriſt and his Kingdome, neither ſhould I ever beleeve I could
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:48122:340"/>
have any reall eſteeme from ſuch as thinke mee an enemy of Chriſt and his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>It was the greateſt calamity to the poore ſufferers under the Prelats tyrannie, and to all thoſe diſtreſſed chriſtians that were haled into the High-commiſſion court, or into the Star-chamber, or before the Counſell-table for matter of Religion and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (which was the lot of many thouſands through the whole Kingdome) that commonly their greateſt enemies were thoſe of their owne houſe; their parents, their brethren and ſiſters would be the chiefeſt calumniators and reproachers of them, and that in word and deed would moſt deſpightfully perſecute them, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the common humanity of hoſpitality, and would not ſo much as looke on them, except it were to revile them and inſult over them, and would ordinarily joyne with their enemies both privately and publickly, and deſert them in their greateſt ſtreights, as all of them can generally witneſſe, which not onely encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their enemies againſt them, but added credit to their falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and calumnies; for they would uſually ſay, ye may ſee what manner of men theſe are, whoſe nigheſt friends are not only aſhamed of, but thus ſpeake of them; which was a greater affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto them than all the other miſeries and ſufferings they under-went; for had they beene their profeſſed enemies, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid, they could eaſily have endured it, and there would leſſe credit and regard have beene given to their words; but they were their parents, brethren, ſiſters and familiars, and therefore it added more ſharpely to their affliction: So had they beene our profeſſed enemies as Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians, or thoſe of the Prelaticall faction that ſhould have proclaimed us enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and had they denyed unto us and our children the ſeales of grace, with all church-communion, it would not have troubled us; but <hi>tu Brute!</hi> that Brethren, that fellow-ſufferers in affliction, that had gone up to the houſe of God together, and had taken ſweet counſell together; that they ſhould now proclaime us the enemies of Ieſus Chriſt, and deny communion with us; oh let not this bee ſpoken in <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelon!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that that grieves and ſads the hearts of their brethren more then all their former afflictions, and gives a great advantage to the common enemy, and ſcandalizes the Goſpel, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:48122:341"/>
both themſelves and us to the ſcorne of the Malignants, who ordinarily jeere and ſay, ſee thoſe holy Brethren that loſt their ears together, are now together by the cares, and count one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a company of Infidels, and diſclaime all holy communion one with another, and will not ſo much as admit of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to baptiſme, or ſuffer them to receive the Sacraments with them.</p>
               <p>But this is that that makes all men wonder, to heare them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be ſuch as <hi>deny, diſclaime, and preach againſt Chriſts Kingly government,</hi> when it is apparently evident, both by all their preachings and writings, and all their practices, that they ever advance Chriſts Kingly government as really as any of thoſe that oppoſe them, who in preaching up the Kingly office of Chriſt, and ſetting Chriſt upon his Throne, are inferiour to none of them in this work: For we are taught out of Gods Word, that thoſe Miniſters ſet up Chriſt in his Throne, that open the eyes of the blind, and turne them from darkeneſſe to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God, that they might receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and that teach men to repent and turne to God, and doe workes meet for repentance; and when the people that heare them give themſelves firſt to the Lord and upto his Miniſters by the will of God, and after denying all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</p>
               <p>And this, the Word of God teacheth us, is to ſet up Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne; and thoſe Miniſters that teach all theſe things, ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne, and thoſe people that embrace this doctrine, make Chriſt their King, as we may ſee 2 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 12. For Chriſt ſits as King upon his Throne when hee is beleeved in to bee that horne of ſalvation, that was raiſed up for us in the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> that has ſaved and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all that beleeve in him, out of the hands of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both ſpirituall and bodily, that they may ſerve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, and when Chriſt rules in all their hearts by the Scepter of his Word and Spirit, and when they owne him as their onely Law-giver, and acknowledge him to be the onely King in his Church, and the Saviour of all thoſe that truly beleeve in him;
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:48122:341"/>
and this is to ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne, and the brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accord unto this.</p>
               <p>Now when the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> teach this doctrine, in their preachings and writings, how can they be truly ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, diſclaim and preach againſt Chriſts Kingly government, over mens conſciences and Churches? and how can that people be ſaid truly to deny Chriſts Kingly government who do both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and to the uttermoſt of their power practice this doctrine and follow onely the guidance of his holy Spirit and Word, both for doctrine and government, who is King of the Church? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore this be not an unjuſt and unchriſtian calumny, laid both upon the Miniſters and people of the church of <hi>England,</hi> I leave it to the conſideration of any moderate minded chriſtian! doubtles all charitable minded chriſtians if they conſider all things aright, will not think ſo diſhonourably neither of the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> not of the people under their Miniſtery; for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not to be accounted the profeſt enemies of Chriſt, who are freed from that heavy accuſation by Chriſts own teſtimony; who when it was related unto him by Saint <hi>John, Mark</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 38. <hi>That they had ſeen one caſting out devills in his name, which followed them not, and that the Diſciples had forbad him becauſe he did not follow them:</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt replying, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for whoſoever is not againſt us is on our part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe Miniſters that open the eyes of the blind, and turne them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God, they cannot be eſteemed enemies of Chriſt, and to be againſt Chriſt but for him, and ought highly to be honoured for their works ſake 1 <hi>Theſſ. chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and ſingularly, <hi>to be beloved,</hi> and deſerve not to be maligned and reproached, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by brethren who owe all their converſions next unto God, to their Miniſtery; yea, both the Paſtors and people of all the new congregated churches are beholding unto them for their converſion; for they admit none into their Aſſemblies but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and they were made beleevers and converted by their Miniſtery; and therefore they are friends of Chriſt and not his enemies, and they ought all of them to look upon them as their Fathers, and on the church of <hi>England</hi> as their Mother, and on the beleevers of <hi>England</hi> as their brethren, and ought not thus
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:48122:342"/>
unchriſtianly and ungratefully to caſt dirt in all their faces.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians, chap.</hi> 1. hath theſe words, <hi>Some</hi> ſaith he, <hi>preach Chriſt even of envy and ſtrife, and ſome alſo of good will; the one preach Chriſt of contention and not ſincerely, thinking to adde affliction to my bonds, but the other of love: What then? notwithſtanding every way, whether in pretence or in truth Chriſt be preached, I therein do rejoyce, yea, and I will rejoyce.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here of ſuch as preach pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, though not with a pure mind, and was glad that Chriſt was preached, and counts them not the enemies of Chriſt, as he did the falſe teachers among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who joyned the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law and their own inventions with the Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wiſht that they were cut off; but in this place he rejoyces that Chriſt and the Goſpell were purely preached, though it were of envy.</p>
               <p>Now when the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do not only preach the Goſpell purely, but of ſincerity and of love, and mingle not their own traditions and inventions with the Goſpell, but follow their commiſſion; how can any men without intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable injuſtice proclame them the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, and make them odious to the people under the name of Presbyterians, whom they perſwade all men, that they will prove more cruell Taskmaſters then the Prelates? yea and they have generally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt the people with ſo prejudicate an opinion of them all, as if they would more lord it over them than ever the Biſhops did, and cauſleſly have moved the people to hate the name of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: And notwithſtanding they themſelves pretend they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the ancient Presbytery, and by this make themſelves Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians as well as the other: What juſtice or equity then is there in their dealing, to make their brethren odious to the world for endeavouring to ſet up a Presbytery after Gods Word, when they themſelves are Presbyterians, and labor to ſet up a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of their own? and therefore if the name of Presbyters be odious in the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no reaſon can gainſay it, but that they alſo ſhould be as odious to the people as their brethren, for they alſo are Presbyterians. But that the truth may the better appear, whether the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Independent Miniſters, be moſt guilty of all the accuſations laid to their charge, it will not be a miſſe to compare

the practice of the Miniſters of the church of <hi>England</hi> and the proceedings of the Independent Miniſters together, and that both for their doctrine and diſcipline, and in their ſeverall ſtudies and endeavours, for the advancing of Chriſts Kingdome; and by ſo doing it will be eaſie for any to judge, which of their governments and which of the Miniſters are more intolerable, and which of them are moſt guilty of thoſe foule reproaches the Miniſters of the church of <hi>England</hi> are aſperſed with by their Brethren; for he hath a ſhallow underſtanding and a very dim ſight that cannot diſcern, whether thoſe that advance Chriſts their Kings Word and Laws onely, and follow his commiſſion and the example of the holy Apoſtles in their Miniſteries, and that of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt and the primitive Preachers, or thoſe that ſet up their own inventions and prefer them before the Laws of Chriſt, and have neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nor preſident for their doings in all the holy Word of God: He I ſay, that cannot judge which of theſe moſt advance Chriſt for their King, either thoſe that obey Chriſts Laws, or thoſe that obſerve their own, neglecting Chriſts, is of a very ſhallow ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
               <p>But now let us compare them together; the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> preach faith and repentance, the Law and the Goſpell, according to Chriſts commiſſion given to his Apoſtles, and they receive all into the Church that beleeve and are baptized, and ſuch as but deſire to be admitted, they demanding of them what they ſhould do to be ſaved; and in their ſo doing they have both precept and preſidents: For Chriſt in his commiſſion unto them hath given them authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Neither did he ever ſay unto his Apoſtles and Miniſters, admit none into the church, although they beleeve and are baptized, without they walk with you ſome dayes weeks, moneths or years, that you may behold their converſation and manner of life, and after you have had ſome tryall and experience of them, ſee then that they make a publike confeſſion of their faith before the church and give in the evidences of the truth of their converſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the congregation, and enter into a private and ſolemne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and be admitted by the conſent and approbation of the Church; or otherwiſe, if they will not ſubmit themſelves to this Law, and come into the Church upon theſe conditions,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:48122:343"/>
receive them not into your Aſſemblies, nor admit of them for members.</p>
               <p>Here is nothing of all this in Chriſts Commiſſion, nor in his holy Word, nor any preſident of the ſame in ſacred Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and the holy Apoſtles and primitive Miniſters admitted all that came unto them, and ſuch as but demanded of them what they ſhould do to be ſaved; and baptized them and received them into the Church without any gainſaying or queſtion; as we may ſee in the third of <hi>Luke,</hi> and in the ſeventh chapter of the ſame book, and in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts;</hi> and no ſooner did the Eunuch deſire baptiſme, but <hi>Philip</hi> granted it; the Goaler did but aske <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> What they ſhould do to be ſaved, and they ſaid, <hi>Beleeve on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe;</hi> and it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Goaler and all his were ſtreight way baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 31, 32, 33. that is, they were forthwith admitted into the Church, without either walking any time with the Church for their approbation, or without either making a publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith before the Church, or giving in evidences of the truth of their converſion to the congregation, or entring into a private covenant, and without the conſent and allowance of the Church.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt notwithſtanding was imbraced by them as their Lord and King, and was preached by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> as the Lord and King of his Church, and was ſet up upon his Throne as King by them, as well as he is in any Independent Churches, and yet they had none of all their new borne truths, and they could then ſee how to ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne without their new lights; and as Chriſt was then by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> and the other Apoſtles ſet upon his Throne as King in all thoſe primitive Churches, ſo he is at this day in all the true Proteſtant Churches through the world, as well as in any of the Independent Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and yet they were and are all ignorant of their new way; ſo that any underſtanding chriſtian may gather, that all their new borne truths are no way requiſite for the ſetting up of Chriſt as King in his Church, nor for the advancement of Chriſts Kingly government; for if they had, Chriſt would have put them into the Apoſtles Commiſſion, and the Apoſtles who were led into all truth by the holy Ghoſt, who brought whatſoever Chriſt had
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:48122:343"/>
taught them concerning the Kingdome of God <hi>(Act.</hi> 1.) into their memories, would have ſuggeſted all theſe things, <hi>The new way, the new borne truth, the new lights</hi> to them, that they might have been recorded, if they had been neceſſary for the ſetting up of Chriſt upon his Throne; but when neither Chriſt nor the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, nor the bleſſed Apoſtles have preſcribed any of all theſe to the church, nor called for them, nor required them of any that deſire to be ſaved or made Members of the church; whether this be not a great temerity in any men, to preach all theſe things as the lawes of Chriſt, I leave it to the judgement of any ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minded chriſtian? and whether this be not to preferre their own inventions and traditions before the commandements of God and the lawes of Chriſt the King of his church, and whether this be not rather to ſet up themſelves than Chriſt, I referre it alſo to any judicious and impartiall chriſtians to weigh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now demand of any moderate chriſtian therefore, and let him anſwer me candidly, whether of thoſe Miniſters and people moſt advance the Kingdome of Chriſt, and acknowledge him to be their onely Lord and Law-giver, that both in their teaching and beleeving follow his commiſſion and Word, and teach nothing nor beleeve nothing (as they are injoyned) but what Chriſt their King commands them? or thoſe, that to the commiſſion and commands of Chriſt adde their own inventions and traditions, and preferre them before the lawes of Chriſt the King and Law giver of his Church? I am confident, if he will deale impartially, he will anſwer me, that thoſe Miniſters and that people moſt advance Chriſt for their King, and moſt ſet him upon his Throne, that own his Law, and that onely, for the rule of their faith and obedience; for Chriſt himſelfe hath ſaid it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>My Sheep hear my voiyce,</hi> they will not liſten unto the voyce of a ſtranger; Chriſts voyce onely the King of his Church is to be heard, and they onely that obey it advance him for their King and ſet him up on his Throne, which when the Miniſters and Beleevers in the Church of <hi>England</hi> doe, and the Independents do not, they more advance Chriſt for their King than they; for the Independents to Chriſts Law and Commiſſion adde their owne traditions and inventions, and enjoyne all that will be admitted as Members into their congregations, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides</hi>

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Galatians, blames thoſe falſe Teachers amongſt them, that would have joyned but the ceremoniall Law with the Goſpel, and cals it a perverting of the Gospel of Chriſt, and wiſhes that ſuch Teachers were cut off, Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 12. and blames likewiſe thoſe <hi>Galatians</hi> that <hi>received their doctrine,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Oh fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you ſhould not obey the truth?</hi> and yet they onely urged the ceremoniall Law which God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had appointed to remaine <hi>till the fulneſſe of time,</hi> but was now abrogated; they were not their owne traditions, they were no new borne lights, no new wayes, no new truths.</p>
               <p>Now if <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo diſpleaſed, or God rather, with the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi>
                  <pb n="555" facs="tcp:48122:344"/>
both teachers and hearers, the one <hi>for bringing in or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ceremoniall Law to the Goſpel,</hi> and the other <hi>for admitting of them,</hi> how highly would God have beene diſpleaſed with them if they had ſet up their owne inventions for the Lawes of God, and had brought in new borne truths, and intruded them upon the people as neceſſary to ſalvation, and for the ſetting up of Chriſt upon his Throne? Without doubt the Apoſtle would moſt ſharpely have reproved them, and have given ſpeciall cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats againſt them, as hee did in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>chapter</hi> of the which is chiefly ſpent in condemning all humane traditions; yea, in his firſt <hi>chapter</hi> of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians, verſe</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Hee chargeth them, that though the Apoſtles themſelves, or an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach unto them otherwiſe than that they had received, they ſhould count him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; and as J ſaid before,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſo ſay I now againe, if any man preach unto you otherwiſe than that you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let him be accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But none of the Apoſtles ever taught the Church, that chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and beleevers, though baptized, ſhould not bee admitted as members into the Church, unleſſe they had walked ſome time in church-fellowſhip with them, and had firſt made a publicke confeſſion of their faith, and had brought in the evidences of the truth of their converſion, and entred into a ſolemne private co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and were admitted by the conſent of the church; none of all this did ever the Apoſtles teach, or the chriſtians of thoſe times embrace or beleeve, and therefore ſuch doctrines as theſe ought not to be received.</p>
               <p>In the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in many places he reproves thoſe that made ſchiſmes and brought in hereſies and ſects into the Church; and in the fourth <hi>chapter</hi> and ſixth <hi>verſe,</hi> under his owne and <hi>Apollo's</hi> name, hee ſets an example before them, that they ſhould containe themſelves within the limits and bounds of that doctrine and manner of preaching, preſcribed and ſet downe in the Word of God, and uſed by the Spirit of God; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them that they ſhould learne in the Apoſtles, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or to be wiſe above that which is written, and enjoynes all chriſtians to reject all wayes of teaching that have not Gods Word for their warrant: Now in all Gods Word there is nothing of all this written, that after men beleeve and are baptized, they
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:48122:345"/>
ſhould not yet be admitted into the Church, without they had walked ſome time with them for their approbation, and without they had made a publike confeſſion of their faith before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and brought in the evidences of their true converſion, and had entred into a private covenant, and were admitted by the conſent of the church; none of all this is written in Gods Word, and therefore wee ought not to imbrace it.</p>
               <p>And in the 2 of the <hi>Corinths, c.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>v.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle ſignifieth unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that no man can teach the Goſpel &amp; the things of of heaven more exactly than he and the other Apoſtles have taught them, nor ſet before them a more perfect Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt than that that they have taught them, for the converting of any unto Chriſt, and for the ſetting up of Chriſt as King upon his Throne, and for the making of them Members of the Church, and for the building of them up in their moſt holy faith, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to take heed of all falſe Teachers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever piety and godlineſſe they make ſhew of, calling them <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull workers, and ſuch as transforme themſelves into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of Chriſt: And no marvaile,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for Sat an himſelfe can transforme himſelfe into an Angel of light; and therefore it is no wonder his Miniſters transforme themſelves, as though they were the Miniſters of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if men will conſider what thoſe falſe teachers were, wee ſhall find them to be no other, but ſuch as under ſhew of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and piety taught their owne inventions and grolleries, and abuſed the ſimplicity of the people for their owne advantage, and brought them into bondage and devoured them, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. as the Phatiſees did the Widowes houſes, under pretence of their long prayers, which our Saviour Chriſt ſharpely reproves them for, and denounces a woe againſt them for their ſo doing; after the ſame manner did theſe falſe Teachers amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who made their owne traditions joyned Members with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as if they had had a more fine, neat &amp; eleganter way of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of churches, and admitting of Members than <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles: But the Apoſtle bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> take heed of all ſuch, how glorious ſoever they ſeeme to appeare, and tels them they cannot teach the way to Heaven and happineſſe better than hee and the other Apoſtles have done; and yet neither Saint <hi>Paul</hi> or any of the Apoſtles in preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:48122:345"/>
taught them that they ſhould admit of none to bee joyned Members of the Church, although they beleeved and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, except they walked ſometime in fellowſhip amongſt them, that they might have approbation and tryall of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firſt, and after make a publick confeſſion of their faith before the church, and did give in evidences of the truth of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the congregation, and entred into a ſolemne private covenant, and were admitted Members by conſent of the church.</p>
               <p>Not a word of all this in the Goſpel that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles taught; and therefore all that teach their new wayes, their new-borne truths, and ſet up their new lights, are wiſe above that which is written, and teach otherwiſe than Chriſt and his Apoſtles have taught, or the chriſtians of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times had received, and therefore ought by the Apoſtles command, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 8. 9. to be accurſed. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo in his ſecond Epiſtle to the Elect Lady, <hi>verſe</hi> 9, 10. ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God; hee that continueth in the doctrine of Chriſt hee hath both the Father and the Sonne: If there come any unto you that bringeth not the doctrine of Chriſt, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed; for hee that biddeth him God ſpeed, is a partaker of his evill deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the doctrine that the Independent Miniſters teach for the gathering of churches and admitting of members, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and jumbling of them together, was never taught by Chriſt nor any of his Apoſtles; for they themſelves confeſſe it is a new way, and a new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>borne truth, and a new light, and therefore not the doctrine of Chriſt; and therefore ſuch novelties are not to be entertained nor imbraced, nor the teachers of them, if we will be obedient to Apoſtolicall precepts: I deſire therefore thoſe of the Independent brethren to produce any one teſtimony, or any one preſident out of the Word of God, where theſe things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are taught or have beene practiſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that although men and women beleeve and are baptized, they are not yet to be admitted as joyned Members till they have walked ſometime in fellowſhip with the church for approbation of their converſation; this is the firſt thing; I deſire of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren either a precept or an example for this in Gods Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:48122:346"/>
The ſecond, where it is commanded that thoſe that beleeve and are baptized ſhould not be admitted as Members of the church, whithout a publike confeſſion of their faith before the church.</p>
               <p>The third, where it is enjoyned, that to their Faith and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, they ſhould bring in the evidences of the truth of their converſion before they can be capable of their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>The fourth, where it is commanded that they ſhould enter into a ſolemn and private covenant before they can be admitted to church-fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>The fifth, where it is impoſed upon thoſe that beleeve and are baptized, that they ſhould not be received into the church without the conſent of the congregation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, where it is commanded that the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhall run about from their own places and charges into the ſheepfolds of their fellow-ſhepherds, and ſeparate and pick out all their beſt ſheep and bring them into their own folds, and debar them from all church-fellowſhip and communicating with the other beleevers in Gods holy Ordinances and Sacraments; or where ever it is commanded that the Preachers of the Goſpel ſhall gather beleeving Chriſtians from among beleeving Chriſtians, and ſeparate them from the other ſheep, into Independent congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſhall proclame all that are not thus moulded up after this new modell, to be people out of covenant, and to have no right to the ſeals of the new covenant, neither they nor their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though beleevers.</p>
               <p>All theſe things I deſire the brethren by evident places of the holy Scripture to make good and to confirme, or by any preſident or example to declare to have been practiſed either by Chriſt or his bleſſed Apoſtles; for I look for a law from Chriſt the King of his church, who was as faithfull in the houſe of God as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and hath not left the ordering and diſpoſing of his church to the will of men, but hath commanded the church to hear his voice, who is the great Paſtor and Biſhop of our ſouls, and the teacher of his church; his Word therefore I look for, for a warrant for the ratifying of all theſe doctrines; and I have good ground and reaſon to demand of them a warrant and authority out of Gods Word for what they both teach and practice; for we are taught
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:48122:346"/>
by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the onely Prophet of his church, that they that ſerve God after the precepts of men, offer him a vain worſhip: and it ſtands with all good reaſon, that if all humane traditions, though of never ſo ancient ſtanding, and of never ſo long antiquity were all caſt out of the church, becauſe they had no footing or ground in Gods Word, that all novelties or new inventions of men (which notwithſtanding are impoſed upon the people as the ways of God) ſhould be abrogated and nullified and caſt out of the church.</p>
               <p>It is recorded in holy writ, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 9. that the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under pretence that they came from a farre country, and for proofe of that they produced their mouldy bread, and their tattered botles and their old ſhooes, and they taking what they ſaid, <hi>pro confeſſe,</hi> and not conſulting with the mouth of the Lord (as it is fully related in that <hi>chapter)</hi> were deceived by them, and entred into a League with their enemies: And thus the Papiſts and Prelates, for theſe many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, have deluded the world, under pretence of their mouldy antiquities and tattered raggs of traditions, and in all this time they prevailed to miſlead the poore people, becauſe they conſulted not with the mouth of God, nor examined things by the Word of God and the holy Scripture, as the noble <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Now whatſoever was written, was written for our inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come; and therefore as it was the errour of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that they received things barely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on report, without conſulting with the mouth of God; and as it was the honour and praiſe of thoſe noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> that they ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Scriptures to ſee whether the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> were according to the holy Scripture: ſo if we ſhall receive theſe new borne truths, theſe new lights, theſe new ways without conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the living Oracles, we ſhall offend as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did in beleeving the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> upon their words, and ſhall degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and be unlike to thoſe the renowned <hi>Bereans,</hi> who would not receive <hi>Paul's</hi> doctrine, though an Apoſtle, without ſearching the Scriptures, whether things were ſo or no, as he taught them: and ſurely now much more ought we to try all things by the Word in theſe erroneous times, whoſoever they be that preach them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and if they be not evidently proved unto us out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

               </p>
               <p>When therefore the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſts and his Apoſtles way and method in their teaching and for the converting of men and hear only the voyce of Chriſt their King, and the Chriſtian Beleevers through the Kingdome under their Miniſteries, do all faithfully cleave unto the written Word and ſquare both their faith and obedience according to that rule; there is no juſt cauſe why the Independents ſhould proclame them all enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and ſuch as oppoſe his royalty; and preach up themſelves and their congregations as the onely people of God and his Saints, and account all thoſe that diſſent from them as oppoſers of Chriſts government, telling the people in their Sermons, that they come over from beyond the ſeas, <hi>thinking that they would have ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne, and that they would have embraced him for their King, and would have eſtabliſhed his government, and have gone on in a church-way, and have ſet up the ways of God;</hi> but they find it

               <p>Nay, they affirme it in their Pulpits, and in every Pamphlet, that both Miniſters and people are enemies of Ieſus Chriſt and his Kingdome, and all ſuch as will not joyne with them in their new wayes: And one of them not long ſince affirmed unto me, that the church of <hi>England</hi> was a Strumpet and an arrant Whore, and that ſhee being once a Whore, could never be preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt as a chaſte Spouſe: which was an expreſſion not onely uncivill and unbeſeeming a chriſtian, but untrue alſo; for grant ſhee had beene ſo, ſhee is now come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and has entred into a publicke covenant againſt her; and we reade of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> howſoever they had defiled themſelves and played the Harlots, yet upon their unfained repentance and true faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and renewing their covenant publickly of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, were preſented unto Chriſt as a chaſte Spouſe, ſo that what is impoſſible with man is poſſible with God.</p>
               <p>But this is the generall opinion of the brethren, and howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they will not all of them ſpeake it out in plaine words, as ſome of them doe, yet they preach and practiſe a ſeparation from all our aſſemblies and congregations, as from a people not to bee communicated with, and declare that by their deeds, which they will not as yet publiſh in their writings, nor in expreſſe words as hee did.</p>
               <p>And one of the Independent Miniſters not long ſince, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Gods judgements againſt all thoſe that would not aſſent unto their new wayes, nor light their candles at their new lights, nor embrace their new-borne truths, told them, that by their ſtanding out againſt the wayes of God (for ſo they ſuppoſe theſe are) and by their unkind uſage of the Saints, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, they would at laſt drive from amongſt them the praying people (meaning themſelves, as if no other prayed
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:48122:348"/>
but they onely) and then they might looke that the judgements of God would ſpeedily come downe upon them, as it hapned to the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Maydenburge</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who thruſt out all the Calviniſts out of their Towne, a praying people, and immediatly after, the enemy came upon them with fire and ſword and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all.</p>
               <p>With theſe and ſuch like expreſsions are their preachments ſtuffed, and to ſay the truth of many of their Sermons, they are like Taylors cuſhions, conſiſting of a hundred ſeverall ſhreds of various colours, all independent, making a fine ſhew, but comely no where but in a Taylors ſhop: and ſurely ſuch kind of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe are may beſeeme their Pulpits, but no grave and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned honeſt miniſters: for they have no juſt cauſe to complaine of perſecution amongſt us, it is a calumny; neither deale they chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly with us, to accuſe us that wee oppoſe the wayes of God, for we doe not ſo; we onely contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints, and againſt the wayes of Men, and ſuch as were brought into the Church by the cunning craftineſſe of ſome, and thruſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people as the Lawes and Ordinances and wayes of God, when they are but their owne inventions, and tend to no edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to the trouble and diſturbance of Church and State, and ſuch as already have brought a confuſion upon us all, and if the Lord do not ſpeedily from Heaven ſend his helping hand, we can expect nothing but deſolation, and all from theſe diviſions, that their new wayes have brought in, and therefore it is high time for all good chriſtians and ſuch as love the peace of <hi>Sion,</hi> more exactly to examine all theſe new wayes; and to put them upon the proofe of them.</p>
               <p>But that the Brethren ſhould complaine of perſecution amongſt us, and of evill uſage, it is againſt all reaſon and humanity, and ſheweth little gratitude in them to all the chriſtians both thorow citie and countrey; for if they remember when they came over, though they had deſerted the cauſe when they had moſt need of them, they were more honoured then any of thoſe famous and learned Miniſters that had undergone the labour and heat of the day, and they were preferred before them all, and ſetled in the prime Lectures of the Kingdome, and had more honourable maintenance then was uſually given to any Lecturers before them; and therefore they deale not brotherly in any of all their
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:48122:348"/>
proceedings, nor humanely ſo to aſperſe them as they ordinarily doe both publickly and privately.</p>
               <p>I am confident there is not ſuch a preſident in the world of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity as that ſhewed here to them; it is well knowne, and their books &amp; practices declare it, that they preach new ways, new-born truths, as they call them, and ſet up new lights: Now where was it ever heard of either in the Chriſtian or Pagan world, that it was ever permitted unto any Miniſters or Preachers to have all the Pulpits in any nation to preach a diverſe doctrine, to that which is ſet up by authority, and ſuch as tends to make a faction and diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people? I doe moſt aſſuredly beleeve that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the like preſident be produced.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Heathen, the Iewiſh Religion in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries was tolerated; but they were confined to their owne Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, they might not come in the Heathens Pulpits to preach up the Iewiſh worſhip amongſt them or to ſet up another ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice contrary to the cuſtome of the Nation: It was an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Egyptians that the Iewes ſhould ſacrifice in their land, they would not have ſuffered them then to have preached up their Religion in all their Pulpits.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Turkey</hi> at this day Chriſtians in many places have the liberty of their conſciences amongſt themſelves, and have their places for worſhip to aſſemble in; but they are not ſo much as permitted to come into their Temples, much leſſe to preach up their Religion in their Pulpits.</p>

               <p>And this that I now ſpeak, there is not any of the brethren that is well verſt in the grounds of that kind of government, that either will or can deny it: And this rigor to my knowledge both in the low Countries in the ſeverall congregations of the Engliſh there, and in ſome here in <hi>England</hi> among us was the cauſe of
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:48122:350"/>
making ſo many ſeverall ſects; for when they were caſt out of one congregation, for ſome particular opinion, in the which they differed from them, the other Churches and Congregations of the ſame mould and profeſſion could not abſolve them, nor durſt not receive them into Church-fellowſhip with them, without an atteſtation from the Church out of which they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, of their Chriſtian walking amongſt them, or untill they had g ven ſatisfaction to that Church of which they had been Members, and that they would never be brought unto concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the wrong was theirs who complained as unjuſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, neither would they relinquiſh their opinion, as being perſwaded it was grounded upon the Word of God; whereupon they finding others of their own opinion <hi>joyned themſelves into a new ſociety and congregation, and had a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Church by themſelves;</hi> and this hath been one of the chiefeſt cauſes of all theſe rents and diviſions we now ſee every where; for when they are upon every ſlight occaſion, or for any difference in opinion caſt out, <hi>then they congregate a new Church by themſelves, and turn Paſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which, bleſſed be God, in the reformed churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> hath not yet been ſeen ſince the firſt reformation; for the governing of Churches by the Common-councell of their Presbyters, where they find ſuch brotherly dealing, and where they have their appeals upon any conceived wrong or injury, and have right and juſtice done them, makes them willingly ſubmit themſelves to that manner of government, without making rents and ſchiſmes: And truly if things were but maturely weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all men would readily perceive that there is no juſt ground of reproach to belaid upon the Presbyters, neither would they ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſon, why, in way of diſdaine, the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be more called Presbyterians than the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Miniſters; for they alſo are Presbyterians, and labour to ſet up a Presbyterian Government as well as the other, and profeſſe in their writings that they contend for the ancient Presbytery, ſo that they alſo are Presbyterians as well as the other; and if the one be made hatefull and formidable to the people, in the judgement of all ſolid men, the other alſo may be made as odious and hatefull; for if that odium and hatred they bring upon the Presbytery, be for the onely feare they have conceived the Presbyters will lord it

It is well known and can ſufficiently be proved, that godly Chriſtians and people of approved integrity and of holy converſation, againſt whom they had no exception either for doctrine or manners, and who offered themſelves to be admitted members upon their own conditions, yet were not ſuffered to be joyned members, onely becauſe they were poor; and this very reaſon was given unto them for their not admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they would not have their Church over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>burdened with poore.</p>
               <p>And others deſiring that their Children might be baptized in their Congregations, and going to the Miniſters of thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to entreat this favour, that their children might be baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer, it was told them, that they could baptize none but ſuch as were infants of their joyned Members (which is their practice) and wiſhed them firſt to be made joyned Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert in one of their Churches: Whereupon they thought that there was no Congregation fitter for them to joyne to, than to that Paſtors Aſſembly that had given them this counſell, and therefore they applyed themſelves unto him, and deſired that they
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:48122:351"/>
might bee admitted joyned Members: for anſwer, it was replyed, that the congregation of which he was Paſtor, conſiſted of great perſonages, Knights, Ladies and rich Merchants; and ſuch people as they being but poore, could not walke ſo ſuitably with them; withall hee ſaid, he could doe nothing without the conſent of the congregation; wherefore hee perſwaded them to joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome other congregation among poore people, where they might better walke, and more comfortably in fellowſhip with them, ſo that the laſt newes I heard of this buſines, was that the children were neither baptized nor the poore men admitted to be joynt Members of that congregation.</p>
               <p>What their Miniſters have done ſince I know not, but I well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it is as great a difficuly for a poore man to get into ſome of their congregations, as to get into <hi>Suttons-Hoſpitall;</hi> and that I conceive to be the onely occaſion that makes ſome walke ſo long in many congregations before they come to be admitted members; for if they be rich they are ſpeedily received, nay invited to be Members.</p>
               <p>It is too well knowne, that many godly and holy people have left their native countrey, and tranſported themſelves over into <hi>New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>England,</hi> where this government is ſet up, onely that they might enjoy the Ordinances there in their purity; they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers before they went, and were baptized, and ſuch as were knowne before they went thither to be the deare ſervants of God; but when they come there (eſpecially if they be poore) they make them walke ſome a yeare, ſome more, yea, ſome ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before they can be admitted Members of their Congregations, and they baptize none of thoſe children that are borne there before their Parents be joyned Members; and except they will in all things conforme themſelves to their owne conditions, they ſhall never be admitted.</p>
               <p>And ſome time the man onely is admitted, and his wife left out ſtill to walke; and ſome time the wife is admitted and the man left out ſtill to walke, and both theſe notwithſtanding are beleevers and baptized; and after with a great deale of difficulty, they are admitted to be Members; a very ſmall offence will be ſufficient to caſt them out againe, if they be poore. But for ſtories of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I doe not love to multiply them; but I have heard many of this kind from thoſe places, and from ſuch as have beene in <hi>New-England,</hi>
                  <pb n="569" facs="tcp:48122:351"/>
and men both then and now no way evilly affected ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the place or people, ſerving God there.</p>
               <p>But it is too notorious, they lord it there over Gods poor Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in the ſuperlative degree, and every man that hath but eyes in his head may ſee it here in <hi>England</hi> in their congregations, what difference they make between the rich and poor, and that they have the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, a ſinne in Saint <hi>James</hi> his time highly blamed in Chriſtians, <hi>James</hi> 2. And as in their carriage towards the poor, they are very lofty, and look for great obſervance and attendance from them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they come, ſo likewiſe a little thing will diſpleaſe them; if they ſpeak a word amiſſe, it is enough to be caſt out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; preſidents of this nature might be brought many: And if all this be not to lord it over Gods Clergies, I know not what it is; to admit of none, though beleevers, and already bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but ſuch as will come in upon their own termes, and keep out the poor either altogether, or as long as pleaſeth them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other reaſon but becauſe they are poor, and caſt them out again upon every ſlender occaſion; I ſay, if all this be not a moſt diabolicall tyranny and lording it over Gods Clergies, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to any moderate man to judge of; and if to unchurch all Churches but their own, and at one blaſt to proclame them all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and to deny all Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, be not more than a Diotrephian, Prel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now when theſe Presbyters already make ſo great difference between the poor and the rich, and between beleevers and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as they will admit none but at their own times, and upon their own conditions, I do conceive that this is a moſt tyrannical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lording it over Gods Clergies and Inheritance; which when they dayly do it, and the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do it not, it is moſt apparent that their rule and domination is more prelaticall and more to be feared than that of the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for from the Independent Presbyters they can never expect any appeal for releife and redreſſe, whatſoever wrong or injury they have ſuſtained by them; and therefore there is no juſt cauſe why any ſhould ſo traduce the Presbytery of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to think they will lord it over the people, from whom they may ever expect farre better meaſure than ever they can from the Independent Presbytery, which if it ſhould once be eſtabliſhed, would tend to nothing elſe but to enſlave the whole Kingdome, and to bring in a confuſion upon both Church and State.</p>

               <p>To all which their pretences, I ſhall at this time briefly anwer, after I have ſet down ſome grounds out of holy Scripture, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome examples of Gods dear children, friends and ſervants out of the ſame, which muſt be the warrant of all Chriſtians to follow to the end of the world; for whatſoever was written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was written for our learning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and by the Word of God, and from the example of Gods ſervants, we are ever taught, that diverſity of Religions amongſt Chriſtians ought not to be tolerated.</p>
               <p>And firſt to begin with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithfull, and his ſeed, whoſe examples, all that are his and their children, ought to ſet before their eyes for imitation: The Lord called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> as it is in <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24. out of his Father <hi>Terah's</hi> houſe, and from his kindred, when they ſerved other gods and made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, as it is at large ſet down in the 12. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and in divers other places of the ſame book; and in ſpeciall in the 17. of <hi>Geneſis, verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. where the Lord reneweth his Covenant with him and his ſeed, and ſets down the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was, that <hi>Abraham ſhould walk before him and be perfect,</hi> and that then he would be his God all ſufficient to provide for him and protect him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:48122:353"/>
he came; which covenant the Lord ever kept with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeed, delivering them out of the hands of all their enemies, when they ſerved him according to the conditions of the covenant, walking uprightly before him (as he will do to all his children to the end of the world, walking in father <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſteps) and of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Lord ſays this, in the 18. of <hi>Geneſis ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>that which I doe. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhall become a great and a mighty Nation, and all the Nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him? for I know him, that he will command his children and houſhold after him, that they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do Iuſtice and Iudgement, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In theſe words, we have Gods teſtimony of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the which he gives this witneſſe of him, that he would command his children and houſhold after him, that they ſhould keep the way of the Lord to do juſtice and judgement: Then it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that <hi>Abraham</hi> tolerated neither in his children, nor in his houſhold any Religion contrary unto that that God had taught him, nor ſuffered no idolatry nor Sects in his family; for this had not been to walke uprightly before God, for it had been unjuſt dealing with God ſo to have done; for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were to walk perfectly and ſincerely before God, and therefore he would never tolerate all Religions or the worſhipping of a falſe God, or the worſhip of the true God after a falſe manner, which alſo is Idolatry, for this had not been to do juſtice and judgement; but <hi>Abraham</hi> ſet up the true worſhip of God whereſoever he came, as the whole ſtory of his life doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declare: And ſo did <hi>Iſaac</hi> after him, and <hi>Jacob</hi> after him, as in the 33. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> doth appear, where <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid unto his houſhold and to all that were with him, <hi>put away the ſtrange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments, and let us ariſe and go up to</hi> Bethel, <hi>and I will make there an Altar unto God, who anſwered me in the day of my diſtreſſe and was with me in the way which I went; and they gave unto</hi> Iacob <hi>all the ſtrange gods that were in their hands, and</hi> Iacob <hi>hid them under the Oak that was at</hi> Sechem, <hi>and the terror of God was upon the cities which were round about them, and they did not purſue after the ſons of</hi> Iacob.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:48122:353"/>
In theſe words we have a preſident for imitation, with the fruit and benefit that doth redound to all thoſe people and Nations that ſet up the true worſhip of God, and root out all Idolatry and falſe worſhip out of their families and Countries; for <hi>Jacob</hi> gives no toleration in his houſe nor amongſt his people for all Religions, or for any other but that which God himſelfe had appointed; he ſets up the true worſhip of God, and that onely within his Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and buries all the Idols, of what price and how rich ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were, and he found the comfort and benefit of this his ſo doing; for the Lord for this his faithfull ſervice, bleſſed him and protected him from the fury of all his provoked enemies; for the terror of God was upon them all, ſo that they durſt not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him.</p>
               <p>And if we take notice in our reading of the holy Scriptures, we ſhall find and that through the whole Word of God that the Lord ever followed that people, and thoſe Kings and governours and their whole Kingdomes and Countries with ſpeciall bleſſings and ſingular favours that purged their Country from idolatry and all falſe worſhips, and ſtruck a terror into all their enemies round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; neither did they ever purge their Countries from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and root out Idolaters, but the anger of the Lord was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appeaſed by it; and it is alwayes recorded to the eternall praiſe and honour of thoſe Kings, Rulers and Judges that were moſt forward in reformation, and that ſet more throughly upon that good work of reformation; and thoſe that did things but to the halves in reformation, have not ſo honourable a teſtimony in holy Scripture as the other: and that God hath ever been pleaſed when Idolatry hath been rooted out, and Idolaters put to death, there be many preſidents of it in the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Amongſt others, that in the 32. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> how highly was God diſpleaſed there with the making of that Calf? and how well was he pleaſed when execution was done upon the contrivers and authors of that Idolatry, that place ſufficiently declareth; yea, in the 13. of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> the Lord declaring how much he dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth Idolatry and all falſe worſhip, giveth a diſpenſation to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for diſobedience to their parents (who by his law they are bound to obey) in Gods matters; ſo that if thoſe of their nigheſt relations ſhould go about to intice any to Idolatry, or to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of falſe gods, or the true God in a falſe manner, or ſhould
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:48122:354"/>
endeavour but to bring in another Religion than that the Lord had appointed, that then they ſhould bring them forth and have juſtice done againſt them; ſo that God abhorreth that any Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his own people ſhould be tolerated or ſet up beſides that he himſelfe hath commanded; and he had forbid in his law, that any man ſhould make to themſelves any graven Image, or ſet up any way of worſhipping him but that which he himſelf had ordained and injoyned, and commanded that they that ſhould attempt any ſuch thing ſhould be put to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We ſee likewiſe what</hi> Ioſhua <hi>did according to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, who ought to be a pattern to all Chriſtians, and all Chriſtian Magiſtrates, chap. 24. verſe 14, 15, 16.</hi> Now therefore <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> fear the Lord and ſerve him in ſincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers ſerved on the other ſide of the flood and in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſerve ye the Lord; and if it ſeem evill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you to ſerve the Lord, chooſe you this day whom ye will ſerve, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gods which your fathers ſerved that were on the other ſide of the flood, or the gods of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> in whoſe land ye dwell; but for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord: <hi>And the people anſwered and ſaid,</hi> God forbid that we ſhould forſake the Lord and ſerve other gods; for the Lord our God is he that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> out of the houſe of bondage, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here we may obſerve firſt, that <hi>Ioſhua</hi> injoynes them to ſerve the Lord in ſincerity and in truth, and that they might do that, to put away all their idols; he gives no toleration of all Religions: and the like may be ſaid of <hi>Ioſhua, Ioſhua</hi> 24. 15. and that they might with the more alacrity yeeld obedience to God's command, he ſets his own example before their eyes, with his reſolution, which was, that both he and his houſhold would ſerve the Lord onely and ſet up his worſhip, and all the people likewiſe aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do the ſame, and gave their reaſon why they would ſerve the Lord, and tolerate no other Religion, becauſe ſay they, the Lord hath brought us up out of the land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and out of the houſe of bondage and made us his peculiar people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reſolved to ſerve him onely, and tolerate no other ſervice amongſt them but that which God himſelf had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and appointed: And this example of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is left to all the people of God, to all ages for
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:48122:354"/>
imitation, whoſe duty it is to ſet up the true worſhip of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt them, and none but that which Chriſt their Redeemer, King and Law-giver hath injoyned them; and therefore all ſuch as would have all Religions tolerated, do exceedingly forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are highly unthankfull to Chriſt their King and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>And if we look into the ſtory of the <hi>Judges,</hi> the book following that of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> when this generation was dead, and that they had forgot their covenant, and began to tolerate all Religions amongſt them, they brought down all thoſe plagues upon themſelves by it, that were written in the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and for no other cauſe, ſaith the holy Scripture, but for that they ſet up thoſe Religions the heathens had ſerved their gods by, as is manifeſt from the ſixth chapter; for <hi>when the people cryed unto the Lord becauſe of the</hi> Midianites; the Lord ſent a Prophet unto them firſt, who told them that the cauſe of all the judgements was, <hi>becauſe they had not obeyed the voyce of the Lord, but had ſerved the gods of the nations which he had forbidden them:</hi> and afterwards he ſent an Angel unto <hi>Gideon,</hi> and commanded him to break down the <hi>Altar of Baal which his father had made, and to cut down the Grove that was by it, and to ſet up an Altar to the Lord:</hi> In the firſt place <hi>Gideon</hi> was enjoyned to root out idolatry, and then to ſet up Gods true worſhip onely; here we finde no toleration of any Religion but the true Religion; when they ſet upon the work of reformation, and when the men of the City made inquiry after him that had broken down the Altar and cut down the Grove, and would have put him to death, it is related, <hi>that Ioaſh</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid to all thoſe that ſtood againſt him, <hi>Will ye plead for Baal? will ye ſave him? he that will plead for him let him be put to death whiles it is yet morning, if he be a god let him plead for himſelfe, becauſe one hath caſt down his Altar:</hi> Here we finde no toleration of Baal's Religion, but that they that would plead for him ſhould be put to death; and ſurely, thoſe that will plead for a toleration of all Religions, do no leſſe than fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>God.</hi>

                  <hi>be God follow him, but if Baal be God then follow him.</hi> The holy Prophet would not admit of a toleration of all Religions, but when God had miraculouſly manifeſted from Heaven that <hi>Elias</hi> his Religion was the true Religion, and which God in his holy Word had eſtabliſhed, all <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts were put to death, and that by <hi>Elias</hi> his command, who ſaid, <hi>Take the Prophets of Baal, let none of them eſcape; and they took them, and</hi> Elias <hi>took them and brought them down to the Brook</hi> Kiſhon <hi>and ſlew them there.</hi> And ſo upon all reformations, all other Religions were caſt out but the true Religion, as we may ſee through the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in the ſtories of the Kings and Chronicles, and thoſe of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> and through all the Prophets; and the Lord in the ſecond of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> complaineth againſt his people, That they had forſaken the fountain of living water, that is, they had forſaken the true God and ſerved other gods, and forſaken their maker, and had been more unconſtant than the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who had not forſaken their idoll gods; and therefore for this their Rebellion and ingratitude, the Prophet denounces all thoſe plagues that were written in the Law againſt them, as all the other Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And we have ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience already, what the tolerating of the idolatry of the Maſſe, that <hi>Dagon</hi> of Ginger-bread, hath brought upon us; for God will not be mocked; if God be God, and the Chriſtian Religion of the reformed Churches, and which we finde in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and which was confirmed by ſo many ſignes and wonders, and miracles, be the true religion, then let that and that onely be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God no more in our times, than it was amongſt his ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Jewes, and in the Primitive Churches; and therefore all thoſe that plead for a toleration of all Religions are no friends of Chriſt nor Lovers of Religion, pretend what they will; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham, Jſaac, nor Iacob,</hi> nor any of the Prophets nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God would ſuffer it, neither would the Apoſtles ever endureit, but in all their writings they give eſpeciall charg to all the people to take heed of all the falſe Teachers of their time, and forewarne them to take heed of them in all ſucceeding ages, ever deſcribing them by their crafty dealings, that they ſhould come in ſheeps cloathing, and in all ſeeming holineſſe and fained ſimplicity, and therefore that they are the more to be avoyded: And <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> in the fifth Chapter, wiſht and deſired that the falſe Teachers were cut off; ſo farre were the holy Apoſtles from tolerating all Religions, as in all their Epiſtles they inveigh againſt them, and that continually as falſe Apoſtles and Deceivers, and command all Chriſtians to receive no other Religion but that which they had taught them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and bids the people come out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and tels them there is no fellowſhip with light and darkeneſſe; and ſurely if all the Prophets and Apoſtles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For anſwer, let them take notice, that no thanke is due to the Heathens for it (as we may ſee in <hi>Geneſis</hi> the 12. chap. and the 20. chap. and chap. 26.) but onely the glory of that is to bee aſcribed to God, who reſtrained them when they intended evill againſt them; for hee appeared to ſome of them in viſions, and commanded them not to touch his anoynted people, and forbad them to doe his Prophets any harme, and by the ſpeciall bleſſings that hee rained downe upon his people, and by his miraculous preſerving of them in fiery furnaces and in Lyons dens, from the fury of Savage-beaſts, &amp; delivering them ſo often out of the hands of all their enemies, he ſtruck ſuch a terror into the heathen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they durſt not oppreſſe his people, ſo that the ſingular providence of God, who watcheth over them alwayes for good, was their ſhield and Buckler; ſo that what they did in tolerating them and their Religion, was not of their good nature, but it was <hi>Gods</hi> ſpeciall favour towards his own peculiar people, and for the maintenance of his owne cauſe, and that Religion which they had learned from him; and therefore thoſe heatheniſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are not for Chriſtians imitation to tolerate all Religions, who are bound to obey Gods commandements, and to follow the example of <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, who all of them have condemned the toleration of all Religions amongſt his people, and have denounced Gods judgements againſt them for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee muſt conſider the principles of the heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and the practice of all wicked godleſſe Politicians in all ages; for the Philoſophers, though they were ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by their naturall reaſon, that there was a God, and that
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:48122:357"/>
this God was the Author of all good, and the puniſher of all evill, and therefore that he ought to be feared and ſerved of all nations and people, yet becauſe they by that naturall light of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which was but darkeneſſe in them) could not comprehend what that infinite Majeſty and divine being and God-head was, and were not in themſelves able to ſet downe a deſcription of him, nor how to conceive of that inviſible Deity, nor what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would be moſt pleaſing unto him (which they could never doe without God himſelfe had revealed himſelfe unto them as hee did to his owne people) they ſerved him after ſome traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had received from their Fathers, and left all nations, cities and families to ſerve God as they thought beſt, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their owne vaine imaginations; and for the Atheiſticall Politicians of all ages, all Religions are one to them, who never regard any one more than another, and therefore tolerate all for their owne baſe ends, and thinke it beſt for the enriching of all their countries (as the experience of all ages and hiſtor es can ſufficiently witneſſe) and many of them doe not refraine to ſay, that Religion was onely brought into the world out of policy, and to keepe people in awe; ſo that God of his infinite goodneſſe having the ordering of all mens hearts in his hands, did ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all things, that by their owne principles they ſhould give toleration of all Religions in their ſeverall countries and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo that his people being ſcattered here and there through other nations by their ſinnes, yet found this favour, that they alſo for the moſt part enjoyed the liberty of their Religion (though they met ſometimes with moſt hot perſecutions) but all this is ever to be aſcribed to God alone (as I ſaid before) and to his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaying providence and guidance, who ever preſerved thoſe that truſt in him, and ſerved him according to his revealed will, though it be in <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelfe, and therefore it is not to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the good nature of the Heathen, neither would that tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration now be tolerable in Chriſtians, who have learned Chriſt otherwiſe than to ſet up any Religion but that which he the King and Prophet of his Church hath taught them.</p>
               <p>But now I will brieſly anſwer to what they pretend out of Scripture, and runne through the ſeverall Objections drawne from thence.</p>

In theſe words, by their favour, there is no toleration of many Religions, for he was to follow the Law of God, and not to decline from it, either to the right hand or to the left, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 1. and by that Law hee was forbid to ſuffer or tolerate any Religion but that which <hi>Moſes</hi> had taught them; and therefore thoſe words were a meere ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, and to find out thoſe that were idolaters to puniſh them, as any wiſe governour may at any time make uſe of the like <hi>Querie,</hi> to find out men not well affected to Religion, or to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that by this meanes they may be brought to condigne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: As if now any Officer or Commander under the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ſay to a company of men that hee was jealous of, being deſirous to diſcover them and find them out, chooſe you this day who you will ſerve, whether the King or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for my ſelfe and my houſe wee will ſerve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: would not any by and by gather that hee ſpake this onely to find out Malignants to puniſh them? Even ſo <hi>Joſhua</hi> a wiſe and religious governour did the ſame, not that hee ever intended to give them a toleration of all religions, for that had beene againſt the Law of <hi>God,</hi> and againſt their owne example; for in the 22. of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> we reade that becauſe the people had built but an Altar on the other ſide of <hi>Iordan,</hi> they intended forthwith to make warre upon them (a preſident to teach Chriſtians that they may fight for their religion) and they had gone out to battell againſt them and had deſtroyed them, had they not given a ſatisfactory anſwer that they had no intent to bring in any innovation in Religion; and therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I have heard many magnifie our Independent brethren for their great learning, ſome affirming that they were ſcholers from their mothers wombe, and for my part I beleeve it; for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of <hi>God</hi> and of his holy Word came with all men from their mothers wombe, and if ſuch interpretations of Scripture and ſuch illations from them, as theſe be, proceed not from the ignorance of <hi>God</hi> and of the Scripture, never any did; for what learned man that knows what Chriſts office was in taking hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature upon him, when he became a Mediator and the high Prieſt of our redemption, would argue as theſe men do? eſpecially when Chriſt hath ſo often in holy Scripture profeſſed of himſelfe that he came then to ſave thoſe th t were loſt, and not to judge the world; for he hath left that imployment till his next comming, when I am moſt aſſured theſe men will have a great deale to anſwer for, for ſo abuſing the holy Scriptures to maintaine their own baggatellies: Beſides, Chriſt came to keep the law for us which he himſelfe had given unto his people and took no way the office of a Judge upon him, but in ſcourging out the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, that I remember, and ſaith, that he came not to break the bruiſed reed, or quench the ſmoking ſlax, onely he had declared his laws unto his people, <hi>Malachy</hi> the fourth, by his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the execution of theſe laws was put into the hands of the Elders of Iſrael, whoſe place it was to puniſh all ſeducers, and who ſhould have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that work of juſtice which our Saviour declaring doth not give liberty for the tolerating of all Religions, which was againſt the revealed will of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore they that will out of this place argue a toleration of all Religions, may as well
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:48122:359"/>
conclude, that Chriſt tolerated adultery and injuſtice, and all manner of wickedneſſe, becauſe our Saviour Chriſt ſaid unto thoſe that brought the Woman to him, that was found in the act of uncleanneſſe, he that is without ſinne amongſt you, let him caſt the firſt ſtone, and when her accuſers were gone, ſaid unto the Woman, Woman where are thy accuſers, goe thy way and ſinne no more. Ergo, Chriſt gave a toleration for all Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers: and when the young man in the 16. of <hi>Luke</hi> came to our Saviour and complayning of unjuſtice done unto him by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and deſiring him to ſpeake unto his brother that he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the inheritance with him, to whom our Saviour anſwered, <hi>man, who made me a Judge or a Divider among you? ergo,</hi> Chriſt gave toleration of all injuſtice. And becauſe our Saviour Chriſt ſaid in that Parable of the good ſeed that was ſowne and of the tares that ſprung up, that they ſhould let them alone till the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, an argument which they much depend on: Ergo, all wicked men are to be tolerated, and no juſtice to be done upon them till Dooms-day, and they are to live without moleſtation, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ought not to meddle with them, becauſe Chriſt ſaid, let the good corne and the tares grow together till the harveſt; who would not admire to heare any man thus to argue, that there ſhould be ſuch either folly or wickedneſſe in the heart of man, to abuſe the holy Scriptures for their owne ends? And who knowes not, that it is concluded amongſt all learned men, that <hi>Symbolica Theologia non eſt argumentutiva;</hi> and that the Parable inferres no more, but that it is not for any private man to take upon him the Magiſtrates office, or raſhly to intrude himſelfe into the place of Rulers and Governours: But truly all ſuch conſequences may as well be gathered from every one of the above ſpecified Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they gather from our Saviours words to the Sadduces, and from the Parable of Chriſt for the tolerating of all Religions; and therefore all ſuch argumentations as theſe are but poore props to uphold their Tenent: for God hath given us that are chriſtians both the Law and the Goſpel, by which we ought to be guided in the ſerving of him, and by the which all Chriſtians are directed what courſe to take in the puniſhing of vice, and for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of errors and offenders, whether they be delinquents in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or manners: And although Chriſtians by the Goſpel are freed from the ceremoniall Law, yet wee are not freed from the

ſubſtance of it; for he that ſaid to the <hi>Iſraelites, be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> ſaith alſo to all Chriſtians, <hi>be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. ſo that although the ceremony be aboliſhed, yet the ſubſtance remaineth ſtill in force; and although the rigor of the judiciall law be taken away, and Chriſtians are not tyed to that manner of adminiſtration of juſtice, yet the equity of that law doth ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and righteous judgements is every where amongſt all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be executed, and ſatisfaction to be made to all ſuch as have been unjuſtly damnified; and although we are freed from the curſe, malediction and coaction of the morall law, yet we are not freed from the obedience of it; ſo that whatſoever was commanded in it to the Iſraelites, or forbidden them, the ſame is both commanded and forbidden to all Chriſtians to the ends of the world, and whatſoever was death by the law of <hi>God</hi> and nature then, for ought I know ought to be puniſhed with death now amongſt Chriſtians, as blaſphemors, wizards, witches, idolaters, and all ſuch as deſpiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> law; under the mouth of two or three witneſſes, if they be people within the pale of the Church, and make profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, for Chriſtians have nothing to do with thoſe that are without to judge them except they offend againſt the civill and municipall laws of the Country and againſt the laws of nations and nature when they live amongſt them: for Chriſt came not to change the morall law, but to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it in all things. And although the Sabbath be changed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the day, yet for the holineſſe of the firſt day of the week (which is the Chriſtians Sabbath) and which is in place of it, I am confident it ought moſt carefully to be obſerved, and that the whole day ought in all ſanctity and holineſſe to be kept; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fourth Commandment for the ſanctification of a ſeventh day, we have the example of the Primitive Chriſtians and bleſſed Apoſtles, who alwayes had their meetings on the firſt day of the week, and ſpent the whole day in the duties of piety and charity; for in the 20, of the <hi>Acts</hi> we read, that on the firſt day of the week the Diſciples came together to break bread; that was for the hearing of the Word, and for the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and for the exerciſing of all holy duties; and that <hi>Paul</hi> preached there untill midnight, and that when <hi>Eutichus</hi> was fallen downe with ſleepe, <hi>Paul</hi> reſtored him to life againe to all their comforts; ſo that here we have one preſident, that the whole
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:48122:360"/>
Lords day wasſpent by all thoſe Chriſtians in the workes of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and charity. Againe, in the firſt of the <hi>Revelations</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>hee was in the Spirit on the Lords day,</hi> that is, the firſt day of the weeke, called by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Lords day, and there the Angel preached unto him that day, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> to take ſo much of his Sermon by writing, as God in his wiſedome thought fit to reveale unto his Church; and hee that ſhall diligently reade what is there written, will gather that the whole day was taken up by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſpent in hearing, and writing and meditating of what hee had heard; for without doubt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> made it his whole dayes worke to be ſpiritually imployed; and as the holy Communion is called the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and all the time of that action is holily to be imployed, as being ordained by Chriſt himſelfe to that end; even ſo the Lords day being a day dedicated unro Chriſt, and ordained by him for holy duties, and for the hearing of the Word, and for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments and prayer, the whole day ought both privately and publikely to bee taken up in the imployments and workes of piety and charity, as hearing, reading, meditating, prayer, repetition of Sermons in their Families, and catechizing and inſtructing their children and ſervants, ſinging of Pſalmes, in viſiting the ſicke and them that are in priſon; relieving the poore and neceſſitated, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe examples of the Primitive Chriſtians are for our imitation, for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the third of the <hi>Philippians</hi> in the 17. verſe ſaith; <hi>Brethren, bee followers together of mee, and marke them which walke ſo, as ye have us for an example; for our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in Heaven.</hi> And in the 4. chapter, verſe 8. hee ſaith, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any vertue, if there be any prayſe, thinke on theſe things: Thoſe things which ye have both learned and received, and heard, and ſeene in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe, and the God of peace ſhall bee with you.</hi> By the which teſtimonies to omit many more, we are tyed to follow the examples of the Apoſtles, and to imitate them in all that is holy and good, and of good report; now it is prayſe worthy and of good report to ſpend the whole Lords day in holy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and wee have the Apoſtles examples, and the Primitive
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:48122:360"/>
Chriſtians for ſo doing, and therefore wee ought to ſpend the whole Lords day in the workes of piety and charity; and by this the ſanctifying of the Chriſtian Sabbath, (which is every ſeventh day) is ratified; the prophanation of the which in the reformed Churches, and in many places through theſe three Kingdomes has beene one of the cauſes of all thoſe heavie judgements the whole Chriſtian world now groanes under, and ſo much more would the Lord bee provoked by the toleration of all Religions amongſt us, which would give juſt occaſion of violating of all the Commandements of God, and of diſobedience both to God and man; for it is moſt ſure, that the Morall Law is not altered in any thing for ſubſtance, and that God that by it injoyned but one Religion to the Iſraelites, and commanded them to keepe that pure and undefiled, and to puniſh all Idolaters, Blaſphemers and Seducers, hath injoyned the ſame to all Chriſtians, and hath not ſuffered or permitted them to tolerate all Religions or any ſects or hereſies, which by the Apoſtle in the fifth of the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are called the workes of the devill, who declareth there alſo that they that do them ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of God. So that thoſe that would bring in a toleration of all Religions have a deſire to ſend men to the devill; which is one of the greateſt impieties and wickedneſſes that can bee perpetrated by the ſonnes of men. Truly if God had ſuch a care for the preſerving of the very natural life of man, that <hi>chariſſimum animal,</hi> as hee made a Law that it ſhould be death in any to tolerate or ſuffer any beaſt to goe at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and range abroad, if he killed a man, after he had beene told and forewarned of it that it was a dangerous creature, as wee may ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 28, 29. where the Lord thus ſpeaketh; <hi>If an Oxe gore a man, or a woman, that they dye, then the Oxe ſhall be ſurely ſtoned, and his fleſh ſhall not be eaten: but the Owner of the Oxe ſhall bee quit. But if the Oxe were wont to puſh with his horne in time paſt, and it hath beene testified unto his owner, and hee hath not kept him in but that hee hath killed a man or a woman; the Oxe ſhall bee ſtoned, and his Owner alſo ſhall bee put to death.</hi> I ſay if the wilfull tolerating of but a miſchievous creature to goe looſe after his owner was informed of the dangerouſneſſe of it, and that the owner himſelfe was to be put to death if hee killed either a man or a woman after it; how much more may wee thinke the Lord will ſeverely puniſh thoſe men that will ſuffer hereſies, and

               <p>Now the cauſe of all theſe miſeries and calamities that did come upon all theſe people was for their corrupting of their Religion. And this we ſhall find through the whole Scripture to be the cauſe of the wrath of God upon the Nations for the corrupting of their wayes and for the tolerating of Idolatry, and the adulterating of the true Religion amongſt them, as is ſufficiently manifeſt both from the places above ſpecified, and from the ſecond and third of the <hi>Revelations</hi> where the Lord denounceth Judgements againſt the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> &amp;c. for but conniving at and tolerating of the falſe doctrines amongſt them; in the which places as the Lord ſheweth, he is the ſame in the time of the New Teſtament, not changeable, ſo it ſhould leſſon both people and Miniſters, but eſpecially the Magiſtrates now to add their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand for the ſuppreſſing of theſe damnable and wicked do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that are now every where too much divulged and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

And for this place out of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> it is acknowledged by the very Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:48122:364"/>
themſelves that it is a Prophecy pertaining to thoſe that are under the Goſpell and belongeth unto all Chriſtians, as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them in their duty what they ſhould do for the ſuppreſſing of falſe Prophets; and they alſo do acknowledg that the eſtabliſhing of pure Religion, and the Reformation of corruptions in Religion, do much concerne the civill peace, confeſſing if Religion be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted there will be war in the gates, and where Religion rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, the civill ſtate flouriſheth; all this I ſay the Independents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accord unto. But they referre it and that truly unto the civill Magiſtrate partly by commanding and by ſtirring up the Churches and Miniſters thereof to go about it, in their ſpirituall way: partly alſo, by civill puniſhments upon the wilfull op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers and diſturbers of the ſame. Yea they apply that place out of <hi>Zachariah</hi> quoted by me to the times of the New Teſtament (as I ſaid before) and confeſſe that it is propheſied there that in ſome caſes capitall puniſhment ſhall proceed againſt falſe Prophets, and that by procurement of their neereſt kindred. And moreover they ſay that the execution thereof is deſcribed <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. v. 4, to the 7. Where the Rivers and Fountains of waters (that is the Preiſts and Jeſuites that convey the Religion of the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> throughout the Countries) are turned to blood, that is have blood given them to drink by the Civill Magiſtrate. Theſe are the very expreſſions of the Independents themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now if this in their opinion doe hold true againſt the Prieſts and Ieſuits? whether it doth not alſo hold true againſt all the erroneous and blaſphemous Sectaries and hereticall Teachers, that by murthering the ſoules of many thouſand innocent people, ſend them to the Devill, that I leave to the grave conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all thoſe that are zealous for the glory of God, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant for the truth, and to all ſuch as deſire to contend for the truth: who ought ever to ſet before their eyes the example of all thoſe godly Princes and Magiſtrates, the names of which are recorded in holy Writ; and in ſpeciall it will be good to conſider what <hi>Aſa</hi> and the people of his time did, whoſe prayſes are ſet downe, and what good followed upon it to the whole Land, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. verſe 12, 13. it is ſaid there, <hi>That they entered into a Covenant to ſeeke the Lord God of their Fathers, with all their heart, and with all their ſoule, that whoſoever would not ſeeke the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſhould be put to death, whether ſmall or great, whether man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi>

               <p>The firſt, that this their covenanting againſt all ſuch as ſhould goe about to corrupt Religion, for the puniſhing of them with death, is left not onely for their eternall honour and praiſe, and for our imitation, but that it did ſo pleaſe the Lord that he was found of them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſervable, is, that hee did in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bleſſe them, and gave them reſt round about: ſo that from thence wee learne, that if Magiſtrates who are Gods Miniſters, and whoſe place it is, will execute judgement againſt all Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and blaſphemous Teachers, by this they ſhall bring glory to God, and procure peace and welfare to their Countries, and ſafety to their dwellings. And truly Magiſtrates ſhould conſider their places who are called gods, and therefore as God hath ſet them an example both in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. and <hi>Numb.</hi> the 25. the places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited, in puniſhing Idolators, ſo they alſo ſhould follow him and the example of good King <hi>Aſa</hi> in ſo doing. They may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo they are called nurſing Fathers, and nurſing Mothers: and therefore as nurſing and tender Fathers and Mothers will not ſuffer corrupt and poyſonous food be given to their children, but kill Serpents and Scorpions, and ſuch venemous creatures, and deſtroy them that may hurt them; ſo they likewiſe ſhould labour in their particular places to root out all that Generation of Vipers that poyſon the people with their hereticall and blaſphemous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. The Magiſtrates ſhould remember alſo, that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Paſtors; now no godly and carefull Paſtors will ſuffer Wolves to come into their folds to worry and deſtroy their ſheep; how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ought they likewiſe to be to keep out thoſe ravenous wolves, though they come in ſheeps clothing, out of their ſeverall Paſtures, that would deſtroy the ſoules of all their ſheepe? all theſe things I ſay all Magiſtrates ſhould lay to heart and duly conſider; for their place it is to whom God hath committed the ſword, and who ought to watch over the people for good, and whoſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of their duty will be laid to their charge, and who are to

that hee and his houſhold, and all that were under his command ſhould ſerve the Lord, and him onely, and that after his way; and hee ſufficiently there declareth his deteſtation againſt a toleration of all Religions, or of giving the people an indulgence to ſerve God which way they thought beſt, and to uſe the liberty of their conſciences, for hee made them all to imbrace the true Religion, and to worſhip God according as hee had commanded in his holy word, which is meant by that hee <hi>made them ſweare by God,</hi> which as all the learned know, is ever in the holy Scripture to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the true worſhip of God. Now we ſee godly <hi>Nehemiah</hi> not onely urges them to imbrace the true Religion, and to ſerve God according as hee himſelfe hath appointed, by Arguments and Reaſons, ſetting before them the miſeries and calamities that came upon the whole land by <hi>Solomons</hi> tolerating of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt them: but gallant <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reviled them, as if hee ſaid, you rogues, doe you ſpeake in the language of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and then cudgels them into the true Religion, and forces them by ſtripes, and corporall puniſhments to imbrace it, which is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his immortall praiſe, and for all Chriſtian Magiſtrates imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that he abhorred the toleration of all Rel gions: and as <hi>David</hi> would not ſuffer a Lyar in his houſe, ſo good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would not ſuffer any of a contrary Religion to be under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; hee had learned this Leſſon from <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. &amp;c. This renowned Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Magiſtrate was not affraid to conſtraine them to doe that which was for the glory of God, and according to his will, and for the good of their owne ſoules, and for the good of the whole Land, and the ſafety and peace of them all: and yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>Nehemiah</hi> knew as well what belonged unto tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as any Independents now living, and hee underſtanding that <hi>the heart of man was deceitfull above all things, and desperately wicked,</hi> Jer. 17. v. 9. &amp; that conſcience being but a branch ſpringing from that deceitfull and deſperately wicked root, knew alſo that there could be nothing in it but evill, &amp; that continually, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tooke that liberty upon him to conſtraine their wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to conforme to the commandements of God, and to ſubmit themſelves to his moſt holy Lawes and Statutes, and to that way of worſhip God had injoyned his people, which is the duty of all Parents and Magiſtrates, who by Gods command and
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:48122:366"/>
this example of good <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> may at any time uſe the rod of correction, and by it make rebellious and ſtubborne children and people conforme themſelves to the commandements of the Lord, and to his true worſhip, and this duty they are bound unto by the Law of God if they urge them to nothing but what God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be his will in his bleſſed Word. And truly it is not to be paſſed over without ſerious taking notice of it, how zealous this good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was againſt all ſinne and falſe worſhip, and how adverſe hee was to a toleration of all religions under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for hearing them ſpeake but the language of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> hee by and by reviled them, and fell about their eares, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with conſtrained them, and that by ſtripes to embrace the true worſhip of God. But if this good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> were now living here amongſt us, and ſhould heare not onely the language of <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dod,</hi> but the language of hell out of every mouth, and ſee the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable practiſes of the Sectaries of our times, and ſhould heare their helliſh and blaſphemous and hereticall doctrines of denying the Trinity, and the Deity of Chriſt, and ſlighting the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and many ſuch deſperate doctrines, how may wee thinke would his righteous ſoule be troubled with it? and how would hee beſtirre him in cudgelling theſe fellowes into the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and making of them ſerve God according to his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not after their own fantaſies as they all now doe? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all controverſie good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would baſte them to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and all ſuch as ſhould ſide with them, and eſpecially hee would belabour all ſuch well as ſhould write bookes in defence of ſuch, and ſhould call them Saints, and their damnable blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the infirmities of the Saints. I ſay I am moſt confident that were good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in our times, and had hee that authority hee had then in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> hee would baſte them all to ſome purpoſe, and make, and force them by cudgelling of them to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wholeſome words; and I am moſt aſſured, he would pull off <hi>Cretenſis</hi> his blew beard, <hi>qui ne pilum boni viri habet,</hi> and knock him ſoundly about his hairy ſcalp; And St. <hi>Quarter-man</hi> alſo he would have ſome good ſlaps as he deſervs over his great pate, &amp; all the reſt of theſe hereticall &amp; dangerous Sectaries would by him be conſtrained with beatings to yeeld obedience to the authority of <hi>Gods</hi> word, and hee would make them know themſelves; and this indeed is the duty and place of all Magiſtrates and Parents, and
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:48122:367"/>
Maſters of Families, neither to ſuffer or tolerate ſuch fellows in their houſes nor Countries; for this would but bring judgements upon the land, much more ought every man to deteſt all ſuch as ſhould labour to bring in a toleration of all Religions, when we ſee what miſery came upon all <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Solomons</hi> toleration of them there.</p>
               <p>But the Independents ſay there is no preſidents of any corporall puniſhment layd upon any under the New Teſtament for matter of Religion that Magiſtrates ſhould follow: but I conceive the example of our Saviour may ſuffice for their imitation, <hi>Who</hi> Joh. 2. <hi>whipped the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple for merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing there;</hi> and therefore laid corporall puniſhments upon them. And truly if the Magiſtrates now ſhould whip all the buyers and ſellers of their new and blaſphemous doctrines out of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall new Temples and Churches, I am confident it would be very pleaſing unto God, and Chriſts example would juſtifie and hold them out in this their ſo doing: for who can they better imitate then the King of his Church? Yea we ſee corporall puniſhment threatned againſt the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Thyatira, &amp;c.</hi> and afterwards inflicted upon them by God himſelf for ſuffering thoſe falſe Prophets and Teachers amongſt them. Yea we ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 13. that <hi>Barieſus</hi> for but labouring to hinder the Proconſull from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpell, was by <hi>Paul</hi> ſtrucken with blindneſſe for it by God himſelfe, to teach all Magiſtrates that thoſe deſerve puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hinder the preaching of the faith; but much more thoſe that corrupt it ought to be puniſhed. And we have another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of corporall puniſhment; for when there was no Magiſtrate to puniſh thoſe exorciſts, thoſe ſonns of <hi>Sceva,</hi> the Lord ſuffered the devill which could not enter into a ſwine without his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be his executioner and to lay corporall puniſhment upon them for abuſing his name and his authority: All which may teach all men how much God is diſpleaſed with all ſuch as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his worſhip and ſervice, and would bring in <hi>a toleratiou of all Religions,</hi> and may ſerve to inſtruct all Magiſtrates in their duty for the puniſhing of all falſe and herericall Teachers and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers.</p>
               <p>And truly, if ever there were a time that called for an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one Religion and a ſetled Government with Uniformity in a Church and State, and a Suppreſſion of all Hereſies, Sects and
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:48122:367"/>
Factions from the Magiſtrates hand and a puniſhing of all falſe Teachers, now it is, when by the ſad effects already of diviſions and variety of opinions, we may well perceive what ruine will come upon the three Kingdomes, if there be a toleration of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted: for diviſions and factions, eſpecially in Religion, have been fatall to Kingdomes and Commonwealth in all ages, as the holy Scriptures and all Hiſtories relate. The conſideration of which makes me take the liberty to recite a ſtory I heard of a great Nobleman in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes at her firſt comming to the Crown, when there was a mighty Popiſh faction in the Court and through the whole Realm as all men know, and when there was as great an indeavour for the bringing in of a tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Religion, as now there is for the ſetting up a Pantheon of all manner of Sects. And ſuch reaſons there were then given for the eſtabliſhing of the Catholique Religion (as they called it,) as I beleeve (if they ſhould all be rehearſed) there is few of thoſe that now plead for a toleration of all, can give the like; but better I am moſt confident they cannon give. For if multitudes of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion armed with ſtrength &amp; power alſo, and they all furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with malice and reſolution to put them upon the imployment of their ſtrength, had been able to create danger to the Kingdome if the liberty of their conſciences ſhould have been denyed unto them, then there was nothing wanting to terrifie a State to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to grant a toleration: but all this could not then prevail, nor all the art of perſwaſion they then uſed as that men of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry judgement were rather to be won with ſweetneſſe and lenity and loving perſwaſions and arguments and reaſons, then by any coercive way which often brought danger unto Kingdoms, &amp; many arguments more with great worldly wiſdom were then produced, which with many that were reall Proteſtants and then in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet he demanding of the Councell that was then in debate about this buſineſſe (the greateſt part of which ſeemed to make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Proteſtant Religion and ſomething incline to yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a toleration) whether or no, they thought the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was the true Religion, and that way of ſerving God that he
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:48122:368"/>
had appointed; and the moſt of them replyed, that they from their hearts and ſouls beleeved, that it was Gods Religion, and that which was taught in the holy Scriptures: Then ſaid this Nobleman, my Lords, ſet up and eſtabliſh that Religion only and no other, do you your duty and labour to authorize it; and your life for mine, God will help you to maintain his own honour and cauſe, againſt what power and policy ſoever ſhall come againſt you; for he can infatuate their counſell and enervate their ſtrength and blaſt all their attempts in a moment, who is all-ſufficient, and againſt whom no counſell nor underſtanding can prevail; for he ſitteth in Heaven and doth whatſoever he pleaſeth; for as there is no Lord or Maſter that can indure any ſervant, that ſhall comply with his enemies &amp; give equall honour and ſervice to his adverſary that he doth to himſelf, or connive at any ſo doing; ſo God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like of your ſervice when you worſhip him, if ye ſerve the devill alſo; which you muſt do if you ſet up any other Religion or any other Religion or any other way of Church Government in the Kingdome, then that you beleeve in your hearts God himſelfe hath appointed: for as two Religions ſo contrary one to another are incompitible with the glory and honour of God, who hath ſaid, <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters;</hi> ſo they will be deſtructive to the ſafety of the Kingdome. And therefore my Lords, ſaith he, as we have but one <hi>God,</hi> ſo I beſeech your honours, let us have but one <hi>Religion</hi> in the Kingdome and one kinde of <hi>Church Government</hi> amongſt us, and that ratified and eſtabliſhed by authority: for if their be a liberty left for every man or every faction to do what they pleaſe, we ſhall ſpeedily bring down the judgements of <hi>God</hi> upon the Kingdome and a confuſion upon us all. And many reaſons more he gave to this purpoſe, by which he ſo prevailed with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell that they agreed to give no toleration for Popery or allow of any faction in Religion, but reſolved with all ſpeed to eſtabliſh the Proteſtant Religion. And truly the ſame argument may now be uſed for the eſtabliſhing of one <hi>Religion and one kinde of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrnment.</hi> And as <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts and to the people, <hi>If God be God then follow him, &amp;c.</hi> So if this way of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>God</hi> that is held forth in the Proteſtant Churches and hath for ſome generations been taught in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be that way, then it will be for the honour and glory of <hi>God</hi> and the ſafety of the Kingdome that that onely be eſtabliſhed, which will

But men that make more haſte then good ſpeed, have
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:48122:373"/>
cauſe at leiſure often to repent, as you one day muſt doe for this untimely birth of your deformed and monſtrous brat. To the matters of Argument concerning your opinion in anſwer to my Booke; I have in the foregoing Treatiſe made my Reply, in this Appendix I am to make my juſt defence againſt ſome falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and ſoule aſperſions with which you have beſpatterd mee through your whole diſcourſe; but ſhould I ſumme up all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings, ſcornings, vilifying, unſufferable and unchriſtian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which thoſe of your Fraternity (after I had declared my ſelfe to be none of your party, before any of my Books came forth) did and ſtill doe provoke and ſalute mee with, even in the open ſtreets, to the ſhame of their profeſſion (yet in the 27. page of your Booke approved of) they would riſe to a volume. But I have learned with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, to paſſe through honour and diſhonour, through evill report and good report, as a Deceiver and yet true</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8.) being therefore nothing moved with their raylings, I ſpread them before the Lord, and for brevitie ſake will not here repeate them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely take a note of ſome (paſſing by many) of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly reproaches, falſe accuſations, and bitter invectives, poured out from your ſelfe (whoſe Schollers it may be thought the others are) and I will unfaynedly anſwer you, in the words of truth and ſoberneſſe, and in the ſpirit of meekneſſe and love. But firſt give mee leave to ſay, that from you of all men I leaſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, much leſſe deſerved ſuch hard ſpeeches, I having beene not only a ſufferer with you (which ingageth a perſonall reſpect) but alwayes ready and forward in the worſt and moſt dangerous times to appeare in your defence to my owne great detriment and dammage, and as a faithfull friend, have ſtucke cloſe, and been ſerviceable unto you ſince, as can ſufficiently be proved when your <hi>proteſtation proteſted</hi> was queſtioned; all which challenged a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian circumſpection, even in reproving of humane frailties.</p>
            <p>Now things being thus betweene you and mee, how exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly doth it aggravate your offence, in ſcandalizing my name as you have done? For mine owne part, when out of zeale to Gods Glory, and my ſervent deſire of <hi>Syons</hi> peace, I write againſt that new way you walke in, and juſtly blamed in generall (naming no man) the unwarrantable writings, and cenſures publiſhed, and laid upon all who in their judgements diſſent from Independents,

though truly Godly, affirming, <hi>that they are but converts in part, that they are enemies to Christs Kingly office: and ſet up Chriſt as a pageant King; that they neither profeſſe nor confeſſe Chriſt, but with the Iewes ſay, wee will not have this man to raigne over us:</hi> obſerving alſo in the Frontiſpices of their Bookes writ in defence of Independent errors, theſe words; <hi>Thinke not that I am come to ſend peace upon earth: I came not to ſend peace but a ſword, &amp;c.

For I beſeech you lay aſide your paſſion, and conſider a little, are there not ſome others of your judgement, that have as great white beards as your ſelfe? which are basket-hilted beards in my Dialect, a harmeleſſe word in it ſelfe, and a word that you know in Love and Mirth I doe frequently uſe to my deareſt and familiar friends, and it was not counted ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or offenſive by any other, nor by your ſelfe (to whom I have

               <hi>I ſhal here conclude my anſwer to this Charge with the Apoſtle</hi> Paul's <hi>words, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>4. 3, 4, 5.</hi> But with me it is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans judgement: yea, I judge not mine own ſelfe.

Therefore judge nothing before the time, untill the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and will make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Councels of the heart: and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</p>
            <p>Brother, I have been the larger in my reply to this particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the foundation and main pillar that may ſeem to hold up all your other Calumnies; for if you could prove me to be a <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous walker, to the ſhame of the very name of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> then men might eaſily be perſwaded to beleeve your whole Charg; But the foundation being ſo rotten and unfound, the ſuperſtructure cannot poſſibly ſtand.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the fourth particular, and my Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is, that no man of truth, worth, and piety, can juſtly taxe me either with baſeneſſe or barbariſm.</p>
            <p>For the fifth particular, it is elevated very high, and becauſe you have in this exceedingly beſtirr'd your ſelfe, I am neceſſitated (for the clearing my ſelf, &amp; to vindicate the truth of what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) to be ſomewhat large in my reply, that I may fully anſwer the Charge you bring againſt me therein, which is very great: <hi>viz. You accuſe me to be one of the greateſt Incendiaries in the Land,</hi> and to prove this you quote two paſſages in one of my bookes, and you bring them as two witneſſes; for the confirmation thereof, the firſt is in my <hi>Preface</hi> pag. 28. the ſecond in my <hi>Poſtcript</hi> pag. 45. <hi>Now theſe two witneſſes of your own</hi> (ſay you) <hi>want but a Judge judicially to pronounce ſentence whether theſe words be not of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary nature and that in a high degree: For who's ſo blind as doth not clearly ſee theſe fiery flaſhes and flames to fly in the face of that Army which God hath honoured with many Crowns of admirable Victories both at</hi> York, <hi>at</hi> Naſeby, <hi>and at</hi> Lamport, <hi>with the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of</hi> Leiceſter, Bridgewater, Bath, &amp;c. <hi>ſo as God hath made this despiſed Army, the Preſervative of City and Country, the</hi>
               <pb n="621" facs="tcp:48122:377"/>
               <hi>Repairer of the breach, the Reſtorer of the pathes to dwell in.</hi> Thus you.</p>
            <p>Brother, this accuſation hath a Tower raiſed on the ſame Baſis the whole Fabrick of your Charge is founded upon, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation being deep, you dare build ſo high as (if it were poſſible) to over-top truth, not fearing the fall of your <hi>Babel;</hi> but God, <hi>who is Truth it ſelfe,</hi> ſeeing the evill of your intentions, <hi>hath confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your Language, as he did thoſe builders who ſought to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a name,</hi> Gen. 11. 4, 5, 6, 7. And therefore it will fall not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the height of its Tower. O what a confuſed relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have you made to prove me an <hi>Incendiary!</hi> I aſſure you in all you have ſaid, men of the cleareſt eye-ſight, nay were they Eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey'd, they can never diſcerne any truth where with you make good that Charge which you ſay is ſo conſpicuous to the view of all men: For thoſe two witneſſes that you produce, thus they ſpeak <hi>(Preface</hi> pag. 28. ſaith) <hi>They have the ſword now in their hand, and they think their party ſtrong enough to encounter any adverſe and oppoſing party, and they profeſſe they care not how ſoon they come to cutting of throats, and ſpeak of nothing but the ſlaughtering and bunchering of the Preſbyterians, and therefore there is juſt cauſe given us to think we may expect better quarter from the very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then from the Independents.</hi> (Poſtſcript <hi>teſtifieth) that the Independents boast they have ſuch a party in the Kingdome, (if their own words may be credited) as they now think by the ſword to be able to make their own laws; and have been frequently heard ſay, that they had many abbettors in the Aſſembly, and in both Houſes of</hi> Parliament <hi>and in many parts through the Kingdome, beſides in all the Armies; and they were all reſolved to have the liberty of their conſciences, or elſe they would make uſe of their ſwords, which they have already in their hands. So that moſt certain it is the Religion of too too many of them is a meer faction,</hi> &amp;c. Now what theſe two have affirmed, can be corroborated by other witneſſes, and if in your account he be an <hi>Incendiary</hi> that in deteſtation thereof hath ſet down their words by way of repetition to diſcover the danger of permitting ſuch lawleſſe ſpirits to go on in their unwarrantable wayes, what great <hi>Incendiartes</hi> are they that have imagined ſuch things in their hearts and boldly ſpoken thoſe words with their mouths? <hi>For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> Matth. 12. 34. Luke 6. 45. as it can be proved Independents have
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:48122:378"/>
done; and ſo much the two witneſſes you ſpake of ſaid; and no more; for they accuſed not that Army, <hi>which God hath honoured with many Crowns of admirable Victories, &amp;c. But you ſay, they caſt fiery flaſhes and flames which do fly in the face of that Army,</hi> &amp;c. Truly this is no other but a falſe Comment made by your ſelfe, from which you draw an evill inference, and then you cry out (as a man overcome with paſſion) ſaying, <hi>theſe words are not to be born:</hi> but <hi>I leave</hi> (ſay you) <hi>the judgement thereof to the wiſdome and juſtice of the</hi> Parliament, <hi>whoſe former freeing of you extends not to cleare your words from being Incendiary.</hi> Thus farre you.</p>
            <p>Brother, I profeſſe I am heartily ſorry to ſee that you my <hi>Quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Fellow Sufferer</hi> ſhould ſo much forget your ſelfe, as not only bitterly, unworthily, and moſt falſly thus to inveigh againſt mee, but alſo to inſinuate into the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as if they could not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt their <hi>wiſdome and juſtice,</hi> except they paſſe their judgement, and cenſure me according to your bill of Information. This vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent proſecution, and your <hi>Canterburian</hi> expreſſions, make not me alone, but all other ſolid Chriſtians wonder at your ſpirit: for you may pleaſe to call to mind, <hi>how one once profeſſed he would not paſſe any ſentence againſt You, my Brother</hi> Prynne, <hi>and My ſelfe, but left us as he ſaid to the wiſdome and juſtice of the Court,</hi> which was in the judgement of all that heard his whole ſpeech, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce us ſo highly guilty, that if the Lords there preſent, did not ſeverely cenſure us, they would ſhew themſelves neither wiſe, nor juſt. This preſident you have exactly followed againſt me but it will never Crown your head with honour; and for the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> it is their glory to ſlight troubleſome informers: for ſhould they hearken to every information invented and drawn up by the unſatisfied and turbulent ſpirits of ſome Independents, <hi>it would cloud their wiſdome, and totally eclipſe the ſhining of their Juſtice in our Horizon:</hi> But <hi>you cannot there obtain an Order to have your Bill taken</hi> pro confeſſo, <hi>and gain ſo much of the</hi> Parliament <hi>that I ſhould not anſwer for my ſelfe;</hi> therefore I may and will ſpeak for my ſelfe in my juſt defence and ſhew how unjuſtly you have accuſed me; <hi>And here I deny your Charg in every particular circumſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I returne my anſwer thereunto, you having given me ſuch a Theam to ſpeak upon, as the due acknowledgement of
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:48122:378"/>
Gods goodneſſe in raiſing us up deliverers when City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were ſorely afflicted and heavily oppreſſed on every ſide, in ſpeaking of Gods providentiall care and ſeverall actings in way of mercy to his people, I cannot omit (by way of thankfulneſſe to God and men) to declare how that in the firſt place City and Country are deeply ingaged for ever next unto divine goodneſſe to honour and highly eſteem thoſe Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and Citizens who in the beginning of the Kingdomes troubles, like <hi>the Governours of Iſrael and the Princes of Iſſachar did offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves willingly among the people.</hi> Judges 5. 9. 15. whoſe very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the cauſe was then of ſuch concernment, that as it made the hearts of all who were truly godly to praiſe God for them, ſo thereby God made them the preſervative of City and Country; Inſomuch that upon ſerious conſideration we ſhall find, <hi>that thoſe Noble Lords, and all thoſe brave Commanders that adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, who as Zebulon and Napthali jeoparded their lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, in the high places of the field, and expoſed themſelves to reproach,</hi> Judges 5. 18. are not to be over lookt, and their gallant undertakings obſcured under a Sable cloud of unthankfulneſſe, nor to be buried in the grave of Oblivion.</p>
            <p>For, when the Kingdome was in greateſt danger, then God made uſe of them to preſerve Citie and Countrey, rayſing an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by Land, and ſetting forth a Navie at ſea, under the commands of the <hi>Right Honourable, thrice Illuſtrious, Faithfull, Valiant, and for ever to be highly honoured Lords,</hi> Robert <hi>Earle of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>and</hi> Robert <hi>Earle of</hi> Warwicke, <hi>whom hee made by ſea, and land, inſtrumentall for the good and welfare of the Kingdome;</hi> and the truth is, at this day, neither preſervation nor ſafety could have beene expected in Citie and Countrey, as things then ſtood, had not theſe two Renowned Lords and Heroes, ſo nobly and undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly appeared in the cauſe, &amp; undertaken the charge, and care upon them, one to be Admirall of the Navie at ſea, the other to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Parliaments forces by Land: For this their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking was in ſuch a juncture of time, that had they out of ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects declined it, unleſſe the Lord by a miracle had withſtood and over-throwne our enemies, Citie and Countrey (in all probability) long before this time, would have beene over-run, and poſſeſſed by them, and no man ſhould now have had peace in his going out or comming in: But by <hi>the valour, vigilancie, and faithfulneſſe of</hi>
               <pb n="624" facs="tcp:48122:379"/>
               <hi>our then Noble Admirall,</hi> our Seas were ſafe-guarded, by which meanes, forraine enemies were awed, home-bred enemies weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by ſurprizing many Ships, Armes, Ammunition, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Preparations for warre, which were ſent over into <hi>England,</hi> for the deſtruction of Citie and Countrey; beſieged Townes were by him relieved, as <hi>Lyme, Plymouth,</hi> &amp;c. So that God made that Noble Lord by Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>the preſervative of Citie, and Countrey,</hi> which lay open ready to be deſtroyed by cruell and bloody enemies. And as the Earle of <hi>War wicke</hi> by Sea, ſo had not the <hi>Earle of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>being Generall of the Parliaments Armies by Land, beene an experienced Commander, faithfull to their cauſe,</hi> and with a moſt Heroick and undaunted courage ſtood to the Battle at <hi>Edge-hill</hi> (when by report whole Regiments ran away, and through feare deſerted him) there now would have beene no ſafety in <hi>Citie and Countrey.</hi> What had become of Citie and Countrey when <hi>Briſtow</hi> was loſt, aud <hi>Glouceſter</hi> cloſely beſieged, which though it was a long time, even beyond expectation vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly maintained by Colonell <hi>Maſſie</hi> the then Governour thereof, that ever to be honoured Gentleman, had it not by the care and valour of that Noble Lord beene ſeaſonably relieved, it could not poſſibly have held longer out, but muſt have beene delivered up unto the Enemie, and have beene made a prey for the Spoylers, and then what peace or ſafetie would Citie or Countrie have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed? In a word, what had become of Citie and Countrie, if that Army under his command, and ſo gallantly incouraged by him had not incountered the enemies of our peace, and through <hi>Gods</hi> mercie victoriouſly diſcomfited their Forces ſeverall times, as at <hi>Newbury,</hi> and at other places?</p>
            <p>Truly it is by all, that will not manifeſt to the whole world that they are ungratefull to <hi>God,</hi> and unthankefull to men, ever to bee acknowledged, that the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Earle of <hi>War wicke,</hi> with thoſe gallant Commanders, and Citizens in that Armie, and Navie commanded by them, deſerve the firſt place of honour to be our preſervers, ſome of whoſe names I ſhall by and by ſet downe, though I can never ſufficiently ſet forth their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and their merits, and to theſe many other worthy Generals muſt bee added with all thoſe gallant Officers and Commanders under them, who commanded ſeverall Armies, Regiments and Companies by Commiſsions from the Earle of <hi>Eſſex: as the</hi>

            <p>All theſe and many hundreds more, whoſe names are unknown to mee, none of the which were then Independents, yet whoſe fame, for their noble chivalry and gallantry in all their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will live when Mortality is dead; and truly for every one of theſe I have by name ſet downe, they are all of them men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed for all heroicall vertue, and ſuch as of whom ſeverally
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:48122:380"/>
for their moſt excellent ſervice, and ſeverall engagements, even in difficulteſt times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could make a large Diſcourſe, and yet that would not ſufficiently ſet forth their due prayſes; for theſe firſt Actors under-went the heate of the day, and by their valour quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Enemy, as I have heard the Cavaliers themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; and therefore all thoſe noble <hi>Heroes</hi> and gallant Commanders, as I ſaid before, have all of them primary right to that title <hi>Iſay</hi> 58. 12. to be called the <hi>Repairers of the breach, the reſtorers of our pathes to dwell in;</hi> for as much as when we were in great fears and unavoydable ruin did ſeem to threaten both Church and State, then God moved all their hearts to appear in his cauſe, and made them the preſervative of City and Country, <hi>Whoſe undertakings, performances, faithfulneſſe, valour, and Noble proweſſe, ought to be predicated, and recorded, that future generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may know their deliverers,</hi> and admire Gods goodneſſe who gave them magnanimous ſpirits to appear and expoſe themſelves to danger for the Kingdomes ſafety in ſuch a time, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were generally ſecure, ignorant of the miſeries that were like to befall them, and their poſterity, and ſo deluded with promiſes and proteſtations that the greater part in moſt Counties, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their own good, the peace and welfare of Church and State. And when the men in <hi>England</hi> lived delicately, and had been ſo long dandled in the lap of peace, that very few, none in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, had ever ſeen the formidable face of a reall fighting Army, nor had ever beheld the furious countenance of bloody war, whilſt ſhe encountreth with her enemies, but were unacquainted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unexperienced with warlike affaires, and marſhall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: yea, when City and Country were in great diſtractions and eminent danger, and when all things both by ſea and land, were to be accompliſhed for the preſervation thereof, with all manner of diſadvantages, and the greateſt hazzard and difficulty, that men could poſſibly meet withall; and therefore I ſay again all theſe brave men have the primary right <hi>to be called the repairers of the breaches, the reſtorers of our pathes to dwell in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And next unto theſe illuſtrious ones, I pray good <hi>Brother</hi> looke upon the famous Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and on all the true hearted ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens in it, who ſtood cloſe to the Parliament in the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times, and firſt reſcued their Members queſtioned, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them all from the jawes of imminent danger, and after
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:48122:380"/>
that expoſed themſelves their lives, fortunes, and liberties in their quarrell, and ſtucke cloſe to their cauſe, ſupplying them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with Men, Monies, and Ammunition, and all manner of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke accoutrements, without whish the whole Kingdome had beene miſerable; Yea, in their owne perſons in the Citie and in the Field they hazarded all their lives in the Parliaments and their countries ſervice, ſo as they alſo may juſtly challenge a ſhare in the next place to thoſe noble Worthies above mentioned, to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Repairers of our breaches, and Reſtorers of our paths to dwell in;</hi> and therefore I ſhall deſire you Brother, and all thoſe of your Fraternity to give the next place of honour to this Renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Citie. And whiles I am now ſpeaking of ſuch as have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well, and merited the name (under God) of being <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of our pathes to dwell in:</hi> I pray let us not forget out bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Scots whoſe faithfull ſervice deſerves eternall gratitude and an everlaſting memory, who alſo ſtood in the breaches when we were but in a low condition, who for our aſſiſtance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their own lives, fortunes and countries to the fury and rage of many a potent enemy, and indured incredible hardſhip at home and abroad, undergoing many miſeries, and that at ſuch a ſeaſon of the year as was enough to have killed them, to lie in the field, and made their Country a prey for the ſpoilers, who uſed barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and mercileſſe cruelties upon them, many of their brave and gallant commanders and gentlemen alſo dayly looſing their lives and wallowing in their own blood, and all for our preſervations; and therefore they may, under God, duly challenge the third place of honour to be reputed <hi>the Repairers of our breaches and Restorers of our pathes to dwell in:</hi> whoſe kindneſſe, brother, I could wiſh that thoſe of your party may never forget.</p>
            <p>And I may not whiles I enumerate thoſe that have deſerved the name of deliverers, omit here to ſpeak of all the faithfull Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſters in this City as well as through Country, thoſe Chariots and Horſemen of our <hi>Iſrael</hi> though now forgotten, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the which not onely ventered their lives in battell, but by holding up their hands as <hi>Moſes</hi> did when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fought againſt the enemy, and by the lifting up their hearts and voices to God with ſtrong cryes made all our Armies abroad and our Counſells at home to proſper, and all our undertakings hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to ſucceed. Neither is that all, but by their wiſdome vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:48122:381"/>
and powerfull and perſwaſive preaching they were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall means under God of keeping the people here and every where in obedience to the <hi>Parliament</hi> by reſolving their doubts, ſatisfying their ſcruples, and going before the people to their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, yea (many of them to my knowledge out of zeal to the cauſe) beyond their abilities in all contributions, animating and incouraging others to bring in their Plate and Moneys and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was of price and eſteem with them exhorting them now if ever to ſtand for their Religion, Lives, Liberties and the Liberty of the Subject: And as by their indeavours they did exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promote the cauſe through City and Country; ſo many of them did the <hi>Parliament</hi> very good ſervice in diſcovering ſecret and powerfull enemies by which they were diſabled to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. In a word I peremptorily aſſert it, that next under God the whole Kingdome are bound to be thankfull to the Miniſters who ſtrengthned the hands and hearts of the ſouldiers everywhere to battell and made them ſtick cloſe to their ſeverall Commanders and Captaines, who without their ſouldiers could never have done any thing of moment for our deliverance; and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple through the aſſociated Counties eſpecially may thank their painfull and faithfull Miniſters that they now live in peace and tranquillity under their ſeverall Vines and Figtrees; and therefore the condemnation of thoſe men ſleeps not that for all their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters care for them and their pains taken both to preſerve them in a bodily being and for converting their ſouls, in lieu of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe do not onely reproach them with odious and infamous names, but would deprive them alſo of their livelyhoods and take away their tythes from them. Such ingratitude was never heard of in any nation before, but there was eminent danger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued upon it; for in the ſecond of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> the laſt <hi>chapter,</hi> when the Lord ſent his Prophets and Servants amongſt them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and late calling them to repentance, and the people deſpiſed them, it is related that they provoked <hi>God</hi> ſo much by it, as there was now no remedy and medicine left to cure the nation: I pray God the ſame may not happen to this ungratefull nation, who you brother and your complices have inraged againſt our faithfull and zealous Miniſters, who notwithſtanding whatſoever the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent party can ſay, may challenge alſo a ſhare and that a great one in that honour to be counted <hi>the Repairers of our breaches and</hi>
               <pb n="629" facs="tcp:48122:381"/>
               <hi>the Reſtorers of our paths to dwell in;</hi> and all this before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Nazeby,</hi> in both which the Independents did not do all the ſervice as is pretended, and who all of them have deſerved as well from the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the whole Country as before.</p>
            <p>This, brother <hi>Burton,</hi> being premiſed, I come now to anſwer your Charge (which as I formerly ſaid) I do abſolutely deny.</p>
            <p>And here I affirme that after theſe two noble Earls, and other of our honourable and ever to be highly renowned worthies, ceaſed from their warlike imployments and commands by ſea and land; The Army which God hath ſince made the <hi>preſervative of City and Country,</hi> It is that Army under the Command of <hi>his Excellency Sir</hi> THOMAS FAIRFAX (which is imployed in all parts and quarters of this Kingdom) whom with the whole body, I honour, and every particular member thereof, as they have done worthily. And whereas you accuſe me to be an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> and ſay thoſe <hi>forecited words are flaſhes and flames to fly into the face of that Army, I</hi> am ready upon oath to depoſe, that it is a falſe miſchievous Calumny conceived in the fiery brain of ſome Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and brought forth into the world by your ſtrong paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Further I averre there is none ſo blind but they can diſcerne a myſtery of iniquity in your expreſſions: for it is generally known That there are many more Presbyterians then Independents in that Army, yea ten to one, which God hath now made victorious every where, and of them as valiant men as ever drew ſword, or wore iron, being experienced Souldiers, gallant Stormers, and as a man may ſay, even the Cream of the Kindome, and the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eareth its denomination from the greater part, or the better, which the Independents are not.</p>
            <p>Now looking on the Army as it is united to one head under the command of one chiefe Generall, and whether diſperſed <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North, South,</hi> yet hath acted together to be the Preſervative of City and Country, is that the victorious deſpiſed Army you ſpeak of? No, no, you will not hear of that, but you divide that Army which God hath made ſo inſtrumentall for the Kingdomes ſafety, and you overlook the greateſt part thereof as if they were uſeleſſe men and had done nothing for the preſervation of City and Country; this may prove the work of an Incendiary indeed, what? will you attribute all the honour of thoſe many glorious
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:48122:382"/>
victories which God hath crowned the whole Army with, but onely to a part of that Army? This is a derogating and dividing language, yet as in your writings, ſo in the publike Aſſemblies, and where ever any Independents preach or pray, you, and they, agree in this language, ſaying, <hi>It is the godly party, the praying people, that deſpiſed Army, that ſome ſpeak evill of, that God hath done ſuch great things by.</hi> Now none are called nor accounted the godly party with you and thoſe of your judgement, but Independents and Sectaries; ſo that it is plain you give all that Honour which is due to the whole Army, onely to the leaſt part thereof; by which courſe you endeavour to divide in the eſteem and opinion of men that Army, which God and the State have joyned and made one. But for my part, God is my witneſſe ſo far have I been from caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiery flaſhes and flames to flie in the face of that Army or any part of it, that I have, I do, and ever ſhall acknowledge, all the Worthies of that Army have done gallantly, and that <hi>for their wiſdome, faithfulneſſe, valour, and victories they are ever to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned,</hi> the whole body have purchaſed perpetuall honour, and the Kingdome is bound to aſcribe to God all praiſe and glory: But herein you are failing, when you divide that Army, as by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions you plainly do, and upon all occaſions ſacrifice to your own net, by which practice you ſeek what lies in you to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the hearts and weaken the hands of the body of that Army, and to caſt ſecret Fire-brands, which may break forth into flames of diſcontent, and ſo cauſe hot and burning Emulations amongſt our valiant and couragious Heroes, when they hear and ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſlighted, and quite ſtripped of the honour and due praiſes that God hath made them equall ſhares of. We read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. <hi>When the women came forth to meet King</hi> Saul, <hi>with joy and ſinging,</hi> anſwering one another (and as they chanted out their notes, running diviſion in their ſongs) <hi>ſaid,</hi> Saul <hi>hath ſlain his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and</hi> David <hi>his ten thouſands,</hi> that their aſcribing more to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> then to <hi>Saul</hi> made him very wrath, and the ſaying diſpleaſed him, (yea it wrought ſad effects) yet they did not aſcribe all the honour of the victory to <hi>David;</hi> for they allowed <hi>Saul</hi> his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: But you deal not ſo impartially and ingenuouſly with that Army, which God hath now made the <hi>Preſervative of City and Country,</hi> &amp;c. Certain it is ſuch writings, prayers and dividing practices are of a dangerous conſequence, if not of an Incendiary
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:48122:382"/>
nature. You proceed to double your Charge, and in the 26. Page of your book thus expreſſe your ſelfe, <hi>further</hi> (ſay you) <hi>to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ſpirit againſt thoſe Worthies in the Army, you go about to eclipſe the glory of that famous victory at</hi> Marſton-moore; <hi>for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king contemptuouſly of it, you ſay, ſome of the Independents ſtood to it in the Battell of</hi> York, <hi>when others of them ran away; for they ran as well as others: and if they be not Lyars all the other Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents had ran away too, and left the field, if they had known what had happened in the other parts of the Army:</hi> Then you make what conſtruction your own fantaſie frameth and dictates unto you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe words in my <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> Page 68. after which you go on in your diſcourſe, ſaying, <hi>I can produce thoſe that were actors in that Battell and are no Independents, that affirme, there was no run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away at all, of thoſe whoſe valour you ſo vilifie: yea, though they did perceive how the matter went with ſome, as when a whole body flies, a thing with no great difficulty to be diſcerned.</hi> So you.</p>
            <p>Brother, I entreat you take a view of what you have ſaid, and then conſider the incongruity of your relation; for can it be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid that it is a diſcovering of my ſpirit againſt thoſe Worthies in the Army, and a ſeeking to eclipſe the glory of that famous Victory at <hi>Marſton-moor</hi> and a ſpeaking contemptuouſly of it, becauſe I ſay ſome of the Independents ſtood to it in the Battell at <hi>York,</hi> when others ran away? Let all rationall men judge, for ſurely there cannot be a greater contradiction, nor more confuſion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. What? is it a diſcovering of my ſpirit againſt thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies in the Army, to ſay they ſtood to it in the Battell at <hi>Yorke?</hi> Doth it not rather crown their heads with Lawrell, and ſpeak ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their perſons who ever they were that did ſtand to it in the Battell of either party, whether Presbyterians or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents? for as ſome of both parties did run away, yet divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo ordered it (that God alone might have the glory) that ſome of both parties valiantly ſtood to it; and thus much is in part acknowledged by your ſelfe, when you ſay, <hi>you can produce thoſe that were actors in that <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Battell, and are no Independents,</hi> &amp;c. So that by your own confeſſion they were not all Independents, (no nor the greateſt part according to the relation of many, who were alſo actors in that Battell) by whom God gave us that famous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. Then this is out of queſtion. <hi>I but</hi> (ſay you) <hi>thoſe actors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that there was no running away at all, of thoſe whoſe valour</hi>
               <pb n="632" facs="tcp:48122:383"/>
               <hi>you ſo much vilifie,</hi> &amp;c. Brother, judge not raſhly, but aſſure your ſelfe, I have more man-hood in me then to vilifie true valour; for I profeſſe I do, and ever ſhall honour a Valiant man, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he be. But is ſpeaking the truth, and aſcribing to all our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies their due honour without reſpect of perſons, become a vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Valour with you? this is Independent Rhetorick, and ſo deep, that every one as yet doth not underſtand it, neither will I here undertake to unfold the meaning and Myſtery of it; onely give me leave without offence to tell you, <hi>That if any do affirm there were no Independents that ran away, when others ſtood to it in the Batell at York, their affirmation is moſt falſe, though happily unknown to them ſo to be:</hi> now their ignorance herein may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your errour, and bring you to the knowledge of this truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that one Wing of an Army, may be diſcomfited and flying, yet in the heat of the battle the other Wing being deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged at that preſent time, may not know how it fareth with them nor ſee their flight, and if a whole Body be worſted as the wind may ſet and drive the ſmoak, the ingaged party cannot poſſibly preſently diſcern it. Thus it was at that famous battle at <hi>Marſton-moore,</hi> as I have been informed by ſuch as were Actors in that Battle both Presbyterians and Independents. And that ſome Independents did then run away as well as others, and of them not a few, nor all of the meaneſt rank and quality, is a reall truth: But if you will not give credit to what I ſay, that you may not hereafter with ſuch great confidence put in Print falſe informations as you too too often do, I refer you to <hi>Leiutenant Coll: Iohn Lilburne,</hi> who was there at the beginning of that Battel; and for your better ſatisfaction enquire of him, whether ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents did not run away, and alſo whether I have ſpoken any thing concerning that Battell, but what he himſelfe knows, and hath reported for a truth, as can be proved. I could tell you the names of ſome Independents that did run away &amp; thoſe not a few and none of the leaſt eſteem amongſt you; but I forbear, unleſſe to cleer the truth I am inforced thereunto; for I know, that upon a diſcomfiture in the day of battell, gallant men, valiant, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſouldiers, have ſometimes been glad to run: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I there writ in my Poſt-ſcript, was not to vilifie any, but to give to every man his due honour which you and others of your Judgement did then, and ſtill do moſt injuriouſly rob and
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:48122:383"/>
wholly ſtrip them of, who diſſent from your opinions; and if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, or any of your party, ſhall ſo far prevail with the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to queſtion me for thoſe words, I doubt not, but as formerly <hi>I have found Justice, ſo then I ſhall finde the like, and be cleered both by Lords and Commons, from the reproach of being an Incendiary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly brother <hi>Burton,</hi> when I read your lines, and ſee how much you aſcribe unto men, and how little you ſpeak of God upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, I cannot but wonder: for the truth is, in all your language you never ſpeak of your party, who you call the confiding men, the wel-affected in the Army, the godly party, but you count them and them only the ſaviours of the Kingdome, the reſtorers of our paths to walk in, and this is your own dialect, God is not ſo much as named many times to my knowledge in your ordinary diſcourſes: although God hath given a caveat againſt ſuch expreſſions and ſpeakings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. where the Lord charged all his people by a threefold prohibition that they ſhould not aſcribe the glory or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their victories to their own righteouſneſſe, or to their own arme (which is the Independents dayly practice to ſay their party have done all) to teach all men that there is nothing that more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth God then to give his glory to men that can deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at his hands who is ever to have the ſole glory and honour of caſting the horſe and rider into the ſea; yea in expreſſe words it is often declared in holy Scripture, that God can ſave by few as well as by many, and that a King is not ſaved by the multitude of an hoſt, and that the horſe is prepared for the battell, but God gives the victory; and all this to teach us ever to give the glory of all victories to God onely and to aſcribe the honour to him. Now then when we have ſo many witneſſes that God is the Saviour of his people and the Reſtorer of our paths to dwell in, and a ſpeciall command to give him the praiſe of it; how is it Brother, that there is nothing in your mouth more frequent, yea in your Pamphlets and prayers, then that thoſe men you call the godly party in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my have done the whole work in this War, yea and are the only ſaviours of the people and the healers up of our breaches and the reſtorers of our paths to dwell in? robbing both God of his glory and all the other gallant men that indeed under God did the work of their due honour and praiſes, who had in all reſpects a far greater ſhare in all the victories obtained againſt the enemy, as being farre
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:48122:384"/>
better ſouldiers and better Chriſtians and valianter men, and the more in number by far ten to one then the Independent party. And that both at <hi>Marſton-moore</hi> and <hi>Naſeby,</hi> as in its due place will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all future ages.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Brother you have particularized the Battell at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton-moore,</hi> aſcribing the glory of that victory wholy to your party, and extreamly wrongfully accuſe me about that buſineſſe, I ſhall here therefore ſet down what I find writ by a ſtedier hand then yours concerning that Battell, and by ſuch an one as I know would not divulge an untruth to the world: neither would I have made uſe of his teſtimony, not withſtanding I know the truth of it, but that I am able my ſelfe to prove what he hath writ by a cloud of witneſſes that were there and received many wounds in that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and againſt whom there can be brought no juſt exception: the words of the Author are theſe.</p>
            <p>In this Battell, <hi>ſaith he, (ſpeaking of</hi> Marſton-moore) divers gallant men of both Nations had an honourable ſhare of the Victory: but none I hear of, without diſparagement to any, did appear ſo much in action that day with gallantry, as <hi>David Leſley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here thoſe of the party we ſpake of a little before: <hi>(viz.</hi> the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Independents) to indear themſelves to the people, attribute unto themſelves the honor of the day, and ſtick not to call one of theirs the Saviour of the three Kingdoms, when god knows he that they then did extoll ſo much, did not appear at all in the heat of the buſineſſe; having received at the firſt a little ſcar, he kept off till the worſt was paſt. This had not been ſpake of at all <hi>(ſaith the Author)</hi> if ſome idle men to gull the world had not given the honor of the day to thoſe who had but little or no ſhare in it.</p>
            <p>And all this that this Author relateth can be proved by an Iliad of witneſſes to be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as this teſtimony is true, ſo many more witneſſes, and thoſe men of reputation, can be brought to prove that the victory hath been wholly aſcribed unto the Independent party in other Battells and Skirmiſhes when they have been many miles of from the very place; and if there be but any commander of their party in any imployment though he ſtrike but one ſtroke, then he carries away all the honour from the reſt, and they have their pentionary pen-men both in the Army and at <hi>London</hi> to do this feat for them, to give them the praiſe and honour of it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare themſelves into the people, and all to delude them; and ſo it
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:48122:384"/>
was at that Battell; the Presbyterians underwent the heat of the day, and the Independents challenge the honour. Thus much Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have forced me to ſpeak, and now I go on.</p>
            <p>Brother, for the other particulars which to pleaſe your ſelfe, and ſet forth your paſſion, you charge me withall, I will anſwer them as they lie. And here I proteſt before the Lord, <hi>I have never dealt diſhoneſtly, nor Serpent-like with you nor any creature living, or that ever did live upon the earth: Alſo that my heart is ſound unto my God, firme, and filled full with Chriſtian Love to all that fear his Name, and walk before him in truth and ſincerity.</hi> And for my brain, <hi>it is not ſo ſhallow,</hi> but that through the wiſdome which is given me of God, <hi>who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. I can diſcern into the depth of Error, and am able by Gods aſſiſtance to make it appear to all whoſe eyes are open to ſee the clear ſun-ſhine of the truth, <hi>That the way of your Independency is not grounded on the Word of God, but its rice, continuance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe hath for the foundation thereof, onely the fantaſie, ambition, private intereſt, ſelf-ſeeking, and cunning practices (with a ſeeming hollowneſſe) of ſome ſubtill and unſtable spirits.</hi> And likewiſe, <hi>for the whole univerſe, I aſſure you it never did nor never can bring in a juſt verdict,</hi> and ſay, <hi>I am a man not onely whoſe heart is divided but whoſe head is,</hi> &amp;c. For the whole univerſe hath been and is ſo far from bringing in any ſuch verdict, that grave, learned, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, zealous, and holy men (in the Reformed Churches) have given in another verdict of me, whoſe Teſtimonies I can ſhew for my godly Life, Learning, and blameleſſe Converſation, whileſt I lived amongſt them beyond the Seas; and I have the like from the moſt eminent, godly, learned men where ever I have inhabited in this Kingdome; yea, many Letters of late time I have received from godly learned men both at home and abroad that have read my Books, whoſe faces I never ſaw, and by them it plainly appeareth that the chiefe, pious, orthodox, learned men of the whole univerſe, eſteem of me <hi>as a man of piety and learning, and not</hi> (according to the Character you have given of me) <hi>as a man not onely whoſe heart is divided, but whoſe head is,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore I having ſuch a plaiſter made by ſuch conſcionable, skilfull, and learned Phiſitians and men of reputation, it is approved of by all that are rationall and godly, to be efficacious not onely to ſalve this ſore, but to keep from feſtering, and perfectly heal up the ſeverall wounds I have
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:48122:385"/>
recived from you and your fraternity, although you have all cut deep, and many wayes, <hi>wounding me in my Religion, in my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in my good Name,</hi> (all which are more precious unto me, then my life) and then with one blow indeavouring to divide <hi>my heart and head, to make the wounds irrecoverably mortall.</hi> But if ſuch actions proceed from Independent principles, and the new light they pretend to walk by, doth guide you or any of them into theſe wayes, <hi>ſeeing ſuch inſtruments of cruelty are in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations (to murther innocent men in their good names, which is greater cruelty and more wrong to an honeſt godly man, then to take away his naturall life) with good old Jacob</hi> Gen. 49. 6. I ſay, <hi>O my ſoul come not thou into their ſecret: unto their Aſſembly mine honour be not thou united,</hi> &amp;c. Now to conclude my Anſwer to your Charge, <hi>where you ſpeak of me as if I were mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Prelaticall faction in their time ſpake of me and of all who in ſincerity and uprightneſſe of heart <hi>oppoſed their erroneous opinions, unwarrantable wayes and ſinfull practiſes:</hi> and it is no new thing for ſuch who wander from the truth to walk in the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths of error, and to think and ſpeak of any that hold out and maintain the truth, <hi>that they are mad and beſides themſelves;</hi> thus <hi>Festus</hi> thought and ſpake of <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 26. 25. And thus it hath pleaſed you (cunningly, but more ſcornfully) to ſpeak of me; yet as the Apoſtle replyed to him, ſo I do to you, <hi>I am not mad</hi> (Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Fellow Sufferer) <hi>but ſpeak forth the words of truth and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe.</hi> And here in the words of truth and ſoberneſſe I averre, whereas you ſay, Pag. 25. <hi>there wants but a Judge judicially to pronounce ſentence on the former repeated words in my Poſtſcript,</hi> that it is obvious to all men you aſſumed the place of a Judge, (though not a judiciall one) and have proceeded ſo far, not onely to pronounce an unjuſt ſentence againſt me, but by your uſurped authority to judge my heart, which power is peculiar to God alone <hi>Who ſearcheth the hearts and tryeth the reines</hi> Pſal. 7. 9. Jer. 11. 20. <hi>and will give to every man according to his wayes, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fruit of his doing,</hi> Jer. 17, 10. Revel. 2. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, further I ſay,</hi> there is none ſo weak-ſighted, but they may plainly ſee, how you, and other Independents, do make it your maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece to uſe dividing and traducing language, ſlighting all men that differ from your opinions, as if they had neither piety, wit, nor lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in them. <hi>And were not you grown very skilfull in theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi>
               <pb n="637" facs="tcp:48122:385"/>
you would never have falſly accuſed, ſat Judge, condemned the whole man, and then have turned Executioner, to divide my heart and head as you have done. <hi>For all which the Lord humble you low before him,</hi> giving you repentance not to be repented off; <hi>and never lay theſe your cauſleſſe, paſſionate, unadviſed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly dealings with me, unto your Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I paſſe on, good brother give me leave here a little to parly with you.</p>
            <p>You ſay Pag. 25. <hi>There wants but a Judge judicially to pronounce ſentence on the former words in my Poſtſcript,</hi> &amp;c. But that needs not, you have already done it for your purpoſe, though not judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; but it ſeems you would have me judged twice for one and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me but conceived offence, which is very tyranny; yea I muſt tell you that you have proceeded in your cenſure already againſt me, contrary unto all the laws of God, Nature and Nations, and all humanity; yea by a more tyrannicall law then that of the <hi>High Commiſſion Court</hi> or <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> all which by Gods aſſiſtance I ſhall evidently make appear.</p>
            <p>For the manner of proceeding in all Courts of Juſtice appointed by God (to ſay nothing how they never condemn a man twice for one and the ſame but conceived crime) was, that none ſhould be condemned but by the mouth of two or three witneſſes. And by the law of Nations their Courts of Juſtice were ever open to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead any prevaricators againſt their laws, obſerving ever an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way and manner of proceeding in them, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Statutes and Ordinances of their ſeveral Countries.</p>
            <p>Now the conditions and requiſites for a Judiciall Proceeding, were.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the parties queſtioned ſhould firſt be cited and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned into the Court, and this was to be done either by Articles or Bill, or Allegation, Libell or Petition, Information or Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation exhibited into the Court againſt the pretended Delinquent, before any Sentence could paſſe againſt him.</p>
            <p>Secondly the party accuſed was to be heard ſpeak and plead for himſelf before Sentence might paſs againſt him, except he wilfully neglected the Summons and ſo declined his appearance: for ſo it was ordered by the law of God and practiſed by all his people in the worſt times, as we may ſee in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who to convince the Jews of injuſtice in their proceedings againſt the Lord of life,
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:48122:386"/>
ſaid unto Chriſts enemies, <hi>Doth our law condemn any man before we have heard him?</hi> Yea, this was Gods own method before the deſtroying of <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah, who came down to ſee and know whether al things were according to the cry that was come up into the Court of Heaven:</hi> And it was the practice of all Judges and in all Courts of Judicature to proceed <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> the parties ever being brought before them face to face, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they did not judicially pronounce ſentence againſt them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all things were to be proved by ſufficient witneſſes and by men without exception, ſuch as were people of worth and credit, of no infamous and beaſtly life, and by ſuch as bare no grudg or hatred againſt the party queſtioned, and againſt whom the party accuſed could pretend no juſt exception: for all men know that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice can neither think, ſpeak, or write wel of any they malign (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe your book againſt me) ſo that if the party complained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt could make it appear that the witneſſes were his mortall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and that they were men or people of a vitious life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation or guilty of any heinous crimes and offences, and with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all that they were enemies and implacable adverſaries unto him, there was then a caution in law that ſuch men might be excepted againſt, and their teſtimony was not to be admitted without there were other more apparent evidence of the truth. And although the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> and <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> were the moſt corrupt Courts in the Kingdome, yet even in thoſe Courts there was an appearance of juſtice in this kind, ſo that if any man had any juſt exception againſt any mans teſtimony, if it did not totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their witneſſe, which it many times did, yet it ſo enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their evidence that it was never ſo valid and prejudicall to him as otherwiſe it would have been; as you your ſelfe can witneſſe it was in my cauſe in the <hi>High Commiſſion Court,</hi> where I making it appear by ſufficient witneſſe that <hi>Thomas Newcomin</hi> and <hi>John Danet,</hi> and <hi>Richard Daniel</hi> had formerly been expunged in the <hi>Chancery</hi> for Knaves, and had for that out of malice put me up into it, were all my adverſaries and perjured varlots, their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by the whole Court was rejected, and they were by them all accounted a company of Knaves all over ſoul and body, for ſo ſome of the <hi>Court</hi> ſaid of them, and I was onely condemned for my book: And this part of Juſtice in many cauſes remained even
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:48122:386"/>
in thoſe Courts in the worſt of times; &amp; in all Courts of the world there was ever leave and liberty given unto the accuſed to make his juſt defence and bring in the evidences of his own innocency and non-guiltineſſe, &amp; his juſt exceptions againſt both his accuſers proſecutors and witneſſes, and this by the very law of nature, for ſo ſaid <hi>Feſtus,</hi> that it was not the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any before they had been brought face to face with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaryes, and that they had bin fully heard what they could ſpeak for themſelves: for otherwiſe if they had condemned any without either of the former conditions, they had not proceeded according to law nor condemned them judicially.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, thoſe that are judged judicially, and according to the Lawes of God and nations, they muſt ever be within the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of that Court, and of thoſe that judge them, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Lawes. Neither doe any wiſe Judges take any cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of things without their juriſdiction: and if any ſhould bee ſo unjuſt or unadviſed to attempt any ſuch thing, the party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hath the benefit of his Appeal, as wee ſee in the cauſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee appealed from the Tribunall of the Jewes to <hi>Caeſars</hi> Barre. And all men know, that the Courts of one Countrey doe not judge and condemne the ſubjects that dwell in an other, and that are under an other government; yea, the Courts ſecular, and the Courts Eccleſiaſticall, even in the ſame Kingdomes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths doe not intermeddle with one an others imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except it be by ſpeciall appeale which is granted unto them by ſome caution upon juſt occaſions, but they leave each Court to the managing of thoſe cauſes that are of ſpeciall cognizance there and within their juriſdiction; for otherwiſe it would breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ſpeedily in a Country, and therefore thoſe diſtinct Courts and Juriſdictions take the cognizance of thoſe things onely that are peculiar and proper to themſelves, and within their ſpheare, and never intermeddle and exerciſe any power over others that are out of their juriſdictions, be they never ſo facinorous, or accuſed of never ſo high a crime; yea, if any information or accuſation be put up againſt any man into any Court, be it true or falſe, if the Judges conceive that the parties impleaded againſt belong unto an others juriſdiction they will ſend them thither to be judged, and decline ſentencing of them; and this method of judgement the very Law of nature teacheth all men; yea <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi>
               <pb n="640" facs="tcp:48122:387"/>
though a moſt wicked and unjuſt Judge, yet underſtanding that Chriſt was of <hi>Galilee,</hi> of which <hi>Herod</hi> was the Tetrarcke or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and conceiving him to be under <hi>Herods</hi> juriſdiction he ſends him forthwith unto <hi>Herod,</hi> intimating that the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tryall of his cauſe peculiarly belonged unto him, if Chriſt were judicially to be proceeded againſt. Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe ſaith, <hi>What have I to doe to judge thoſe that are without?</hi> Thoſe that were without in <hi>Pauls</hi> opinion, and under an other juriſdiction, hee profeſſed that hee had nothing to doe with them.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing required for the judiciall proceeding and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any cauſe, is this, that they that are to be Iudges may not be both parties, witneſſes, proſecutors, Iury, and Iudges in the ſame cauſe; for it they be, they cannot be ſaid judicially to give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. All that I now write unto you Brother, I am confident your conſcience tels you is juſt and true. Now in all nations and well governed Kingdomes and countries, if there have beene any faylings in either of theſe conditions and requiſites, the ſubjects have the benefit of the Law againſt both their Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Iudges, and may appeale unto the King, or ſupreame Court of judicature in the Kingdom, &amp; crave juſtice there againſt ſuch Iudges, and ſuch proceedings, and if they cannot obtaine juſtice there, God will call them to an account one day for it: for, in the judgement of all men ſuch proceedings have ever beene counted illegall and unjuſt, and all thoſe Iudges that have at any time given ſentence, without obſerving thoſe rules and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did never cenſure any man judicially, neither can their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſaid to be judiciall in any juſt mans underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Now Brother, if your proceeding againſt mee be examined by theſe rules, and by ſuch men as are judicious and truly godly without faction, you will not be thought judicially to have cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; condemned me: for it is moſt certain you have not in all the carriage of this buſines beene a judiciall Iudge; for in this your ſentence you have gone againſt all the Lawes of God and nature; yea &amp; againſt the practice of the moſt corrupt Courts in the world, in that you have accuſed me, arraigned me and condemned mee, without either Articles, Bill, Libell, (ſaving your owne Booke) allegation or information, and without any lawfull citation into your Court, or any Court, you have alſo condemned mee before
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:48122:387"/>
I knew who were my Accuſers, and that without hearing mee ever ſpeake for my ſelfe; yea, you have condemned and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged me an innocent man withou any lawfull witneſſe; for as I am not conſcious to my ſelfe of ever having done any thing that deſerves convention before any Court of Iud icature in this world, much leſſe to have ſentence given againſt mee, ſo I am moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if ever theſe your dealings againſt mee ſhall be brought to a tryall, and a judiciall hearing indeed, as they may be, if the time once grows more quiet; I ſhall make it clearly and evidently appeare, that the ground of this your beaſtly accuſation brought againſt me, <hi>viz. that I am a ſcandalous Walker to the ſhame of the very name of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> did firſt ariſe from one of the moſt infamous &amp; notorious creatures, though an Independent, that now lives upon earth for all manner of villanies, a ſhame &amp; diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>to</hi> her name &amp; kindred, known to be one of the moſt prodigious impudent Whores that is this day in the world, except the Whore of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and yet originally and primarily from that creature, or from ſuch as are as bad as her ſelfe, have you groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your moſt unbrotherly and extra judicall judgement againſt mee, and ſo you have made your ſelfe party, witneſſe, Iury and Iudge in this your owne cauſe, and which is more have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one that is in your opinion without, and out of your juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; whereas <hi>Paul</hi> had taught all Chriſts Diſciples by a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law from Heaven, that they ſhould not judge thoſe that are without: now you account mee and all the Presbyterians to bee enemies of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſuch Saints as <hi>Iob</hi> would not ſet with the dogs of his flocke, and proclayme us all the ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> as your learned Works can ſufficiently witneſſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you account us all without, and yet you condemne me, and that in the face of the whole world, as guilty of all thoſe foule crimes you charge me with, whereas you had nothing to doe with mee, I being out of your juriſdiction: I pray tell me courteous Brother, whether this your proceeding be to ſet up Chriſt as King upon his Throne, and be judicially to condemne any Brother? when it is apparently manifeſt by theſe your actions you tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe all the Lawes of Chriſt our King, and trample them under your feet? for Chriſt hath taught all his people and ſubjects, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>If thy brother offend thee, tell him of it betweene him and thee,</hi> &amp;c. and againe, hee hath ſaid, <hi>judge not leſt yee be</hi>
               <pb n="642" facs="tcp:48122:388"/>
               <hi>judged,</hi> and againe, <hi>there ſhall be judgement without mercy to him that ſhewes no mercy;</hi> againe God hath ſaid, <hi>hee that condemnes the righteous, and hee that juſtifies the wicked, they are both an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord;</hi> whether therefore by all theſe your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt mee you have not violated all theſe moſt holy Lawes and Statutes, I ſhall leave to the judgement of others. Brother you may remember in the 17. page of your Booke, ſpeaking there what you will doe when you come to my Poſtſcript (which you have finely performed) you aske mee whether or no, when you make mention of it my mind doth not miſgive me? your words are theſe, <hi>which when I mention here</hi> (ſay you) <hi>doth not your mind miſgive you?</hi> for anſwer I tell you no: for I am able to prove every word of that Booke by ſufficient witneſſe, and out of the very Independents writings; yea, their daily practiſes have made good every period of it, and ſo farre
I am that my mind ſhould miſgive mee at the mention of it for doing my duty, that I will with all ſpeed print it againe with ſome little inlargement concerning your <hi>New-lights,</hi> and other of your grolleries. But this by the way. But becauſe Brother, you take that liberty to propound now and then queſtions to me, I will here alſo uſe the ſame freedome with you: Therefore tell me <hi>I</hi> pray the next time I heare from you, whether or no your mind doth not miſgive you when <hi>I</hi> mention your bookes, and when you thinke what you have done againſt mee in thus condemning mee, and adjudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an innocent man, and your quondam Fellow-ſufferer? Brother had you to deale with ſome man, hee would recriminate, which would not be for your honour; but for the preſent <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelfe to have declared my innocency; only by the way conſider what you did to my reverend Brother, Maſter <hi>George Walker,</hi> a man to whom you were ſo much ingaged to; and when I <hi>mention him, doth not your heart miſgive you?</hi> But enough of this.</p>
            <p>Now before I conclude this my parley with you; I will ſay thus much <hi>concerning your new Courts, in your new gathered Churches, if this be your way of proceedings there, to be witneſſe, party, Iury, and Iudge in your owne cauſe, and when you have given ſentence againſt the innocent if ther be no appeale: then your Courts are worſe, and more tyrannicall then that of the High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Star-chamber; and for ought I know all ſuch arbitrary</hi>
               <pb n="643" facs="tcp:48122:388"/>
               <hi>Courts as your are, and all ſuch arbitrary and unjuſt Iudges as you are, may as well be queſtioned, cenſured and put downe, for all theſe your illegall, unjuſt, and extrajudicall proceedings, as either they or any other tyrannicall Courts were; and truly it concernes the whole Kingdome now ſeriouſly to looke about them, and to have a ſpeciall eye to your Jndependent proceedings and Iudgements: for if they bee not timely looked unto, all the repairing of our breaches, and all the reſtoring of our pathes to dwell in which you make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, will be no ſuch thing to the poore Presbyterians, who cannot already paſſe quietly in the ſtreets for you: nor any man avoyd your uniuſt cenſures, nor the filth both of your tongues and pens, which you caſt in our faces every ſtep wee goe.</hi> The Lord rebuke you for theſe your revilings. Truly Brother, I ſee a divine hand of juſtice againſt you in many paſſages, though you looke loftily, and ſpeake great ſwelling words, in all which you breath out hell, and your own ſhame, the Lord I hope in time will diſcover unto you all your vanity, and ſinfulneſſe. I will ſay thus much of you, that whiles you uſed the ſharpeneſſe of your parts againſt the common enemy, you were very ſerviceable to the Church of God; but now turning the edge of them againſt your Chriſtian brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have through their ſides both wounded your ſelfe, and all thoſe of your party, as I am moſt aſſured they will all aſſert. Yea, I can aſcertaine you of this, that it is exceedingly admired by many, that you having beene ſome yeares in captivity under the Prelates tyrannie, ſhould continue ſuch a trewant in the ſchoole of affliction, as not yet to have learned the leſſon of patience, ſo that you cannot digeſt a merry word, or but a conceived Ieſt. But this they are moſt of all ſtranged at, that out of the height and greatneſſe of your ſpirit you will ſtrike your enemy, though it be through the ſides of Religion, and the Chriſtian cauſe; and truly this your dealing with all your Chriſtian brethren, eſpecially with my ſelfe, cals for deepe and ſerious repentance at your hands.</p>
            <p>For my part, I freely forgive you, and do profeſſe it is a griefe unto my ſoul that you have drawn me out with ſuch violence in forcing me to encounter with you by name; it's true, the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes, opinions and falſe lights (under the name of new) late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth, I did and cannot but write againſt, they being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſacred writ; yet you my Brother, and <hi>Quondam</hi> Fellow Sufferer, I reverenced and did ever love, honour and eſteem, and
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:48122:389"/>
had it not been to wipe off thoſe black reproaches wherewith you have laboured to beſmear me all over, making me appear to the world <hi>as a man ſpotted and defiled with ſcandalous walking, an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, a Perſecutor, a mad man,</hi> &amp;c. I profeſſe out of tender reſpect to your perſon, and ſufferings, as I have hitherto ſpared your name, ſo I would now have over lookt your falſe aſperſions; but ſeriouſly conſidering the great and deep Charge you have brought againſt me (wounding truth thorow my ſides) upon the due deliberation thereof, I plainly perceived without diſhonouring God, and being cruell to my ſelf, I could not be ſilent, for that my taciturnity might cauſe truth &amp; the ways of God to be evil ſpoken of, and give an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to cenſorious ſpirits to vote me guilty of thoſe Malverſations wherewith you ſo ſlily &amp; unjuſtly have accuſed me; all which my ſoul hates and ever did utterly abhor; therefore although I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder to pity your paſſion, and more deſirous to paſs by your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, then to take notice of them, or divulg the weakneſſes and too too groſſe failings of you my Brother; yet your Charge being of a high nature and publiſhed in Print, it neceſſitated me to reply leſt I ſhould ſeem to approve of the murthering of my good name; So that meerly to preſerve the life thereof, you have extracted from me theſe lines, that men may know it lies upon you to prove it, (for I ſtand upon my juſtification and proteſt againſt every one of your foul Calumnies, as notorious untruths:) And likewiſe that all who fear the Lord may be fully aſſured, however you have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me to the world <hi>as one who hath a name to live but am dead,</hi> (ſo that I may ſtink in the opinion of ſuch as are holy) <hi>yet I do live to my God,</hi> who I doubt not will diſcover the bottome and myſtery of this iniquity.

            <p>Brother, I would here gladly diſmiſſe the Reader, for willingly I over look many of your invectives without mentioning of them; But I find two or three paſſages more to which you engage me to ſpeak, for the clearing the truth of what I have written (in my <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> Page 68.) concerning Independents; as alſo to anſwer a complaint you have made againſt me: And laſtly to reſolve two quaeries which you have propounded unto me, and in theſe I ſhall endeavour fully to ſatisfie you and all men.</p>
            <p>But firſt, as a Phiſitian and a faithfull Friend, avoyding all flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; I cannot but truly relate unto you the dangerous condition I find you in; for I aſſure you, I feel your pulſe beates very high, and I ſee you have a vein puft up with windy matter, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you are ſwoln with pernicious and corrupt humors, and that Choler exceedingly abounds in you, inſomuch as you breath forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Now as I am grieved to ſee it, ſo <hi>I</hi> wonder at the ſuddain diſtemper and great heat you are fallen into, which makes you talk ſo much, and that againſt me by name, more then againſt others; wherereas before <hi>I</hi> writ, and ſince, many have (and one more eſpecially) in part diſcovered the ſinfull practices of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, the evill and unwarrantableneſſe of their new way; And how ever you are generally blamed for ruſhing out upon the Theatre to oppoſe him by name, it being a work in the judgement of all wiſe men fitter for any other man to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken

            <p>Now here is exceeding great wrong done unto you, if your words are not of ſuch a nature; and might you be the ſole Judge, <hi>I</hi> am perſwaded you would pronounce them not guilty; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, you do not revile, vilifie, and falſly accuſe the Author thereof; But on me you have let looſe your fury and have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me ſo paſſionately who was once a Fellow Sufferer with you, that it hath ſadded the ſpirits, grieved the hearts, and given great offence unto all that are truly godly, who walk in that old way and the known paths of holineſſe, which Gods word doth plainly direct and lead them into, and contrarywiſe you have opened the mouthes of the wicked and given cauſe of rejoycing to ſuch as are without, by your bitter expreſſions and falſe accuſations brought againſt me one of your <hi>Quondam</hi> Fellow Sufferers.</p>

            <p>To this Brother I anſwer, I vilifie none, <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken the truth; but becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſee you take ſuch great exceptions at theſe words, <hi>I</hi> ſhall prove the truth of them from your own Tenents, or make it appear you are not the only Saints; for <hi>I</hi> have ſaid nothing there, but what the profeſſed judgment of thoſe Independents <hi>I</hi> know (I ſtill keep within the bounds of my own knowledg) and their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe inciteth me to beleeve: And if there be any Independents that differ from their judgement and practice, <hi>I</hi> know them not, (two only excepted, as <hi>I</hi> ſaid before): But for thoſe Independents who being in the company of ſuch as are truly godly, yet becauſe they are Presbyterians, refuſed in private to pray or joyn in prayer with them; and for ſuch who hold and do pronounce all that walk not in their way <hi>to be enemies of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.

by their opinions and practices do ſufficiently prove the truth of what <hi>I</hi> ſaid in the forecited words; and therefore you, with all that hold ſuch an opinion, muſt diſclaime that Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent principle, if you denie the veritie of them; otherwiſe you will declare to the whole world that you are not ſo zealous for Gods glorie nor love not the Lord ſo ſincerely, as his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have formerly done; and withall you will manifeſt to all men that you are more ſtudious to preſerve your own honours and reputation then the glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For whereas you (with moſt of the Independents that <hi>I</hi> know) doe hold and maintaine (in your bookes intituled</hi> Vindication, <hi>and</hi> Vindiciae veritatis) That the Presbyterians are enemies to Chriſts Kingly office, that inſtead of finding Chriſt ſet upon his Throne in their Congregations, you find there no more but an Image, <hi>ſuch as</hi> Michael had made up inſtead of King <hi>David, 1</hi> Sam, <hi>19.</hi> or as thoſe that in mockery, made of Chriſt a Pageant-King, ſtriping him, and putting on him a ſcarlet Robe, and on his head a Crowne of Thornes, and in his hand a Reed, ſaluting him with, Haile King of the Jewes, with which title over his head they crucified him. That the Presbyterians neither profeſſe, nor confeſſe Chriſt, but ſay with the wicked Iewes, we will not have this man to raigne over us, <hi>Luke 19. 14.</hi> That they are at the beſt but Converts in part, &amp;c. which is to ſay, they are in <hi>King</hi> Agripas <hi>condition,</hi> but almost Chriſtians, Act. 26. 28. <hi>or like</hi> Simon Magus ſtill in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity. <hi>And if this great charge againſt the Presbyterians be true, which you ſo confidently affirme in your books, truly all the Presbyterians are in a more curſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the wicked Iewes were; for why? they know, and ſay</hi> they doe beleeve, that Ieſus Chriſt is God and man, the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the father, full of grace and truth, <hi>Iohn 1. 14.</hi> who was made of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, and declared to bee the Sonne of God, with power, according to the ſpirit of holineſſe by the reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Rom. 1. 3. 4.</hi> The Redeemer of his Elect, and choſen ones, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</hi> The Saviour of all that beleeve in him, <hi>Ioh. 3. 15, 16.</hi> The bleſſed, and onely Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>1 Tim. 6. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Presbyterians knowing and profeſſing that they doe beleeve theſe Goſpel truths (which the Iewes did not know, nor would not beleeve) if they notwithſtanding are enemies to Ieſus

               <pb n="652" facs="tcp:48122:393"/>
               <hi>from them (before they had ſeen my books) they railed againſt me, raiſed up falſe reports and calumniated me,</hi> as the greateſt Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary in the Kingdome; <hi>in all which they moſt ſhamefully (as day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtill they do) abuſed me; thereunto I replyed in theſe words,</hi> I have been freed from that reproach by both Houſes of Parliament who adjudged all my ſufferings unjuſt, as againſt the Law and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject. And if it were a thing that could be any way uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto me. I could prove by many of the brave Gentlemen in the Kings Army, who in great Aſſemblies did acknowledge, when I was a Priſoner amongſt them, that I had great injury done me. Yea, the Papiſts themſelves have often averred it, that never any Subject ſuffered more unjuſtly then I did, in that I was caſt into Priſon and fined, for maintaining the Prerogative Royall of the King againſt the Pope; and for defending that Religion which was eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Land: And further added, that had any Catholique writ as well in defence of their Religion, as I did for the maintenance of the Proteſtant Profeſſion, he ſhould have been ſo far from ſuffering for it, as they would not only greatly have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, but alſo highly have rewarded him for his endeavour; and this that I now write I am able to prove by a cloud of witneſſes: and my unjuſt ſuffering in their opinion, made me find more favour amongst all the Governours that were Papiſts (which I do ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for a ſingular courteſie from them) then ever I found from Proteſtant Goalers. And therefore whereas the Independents do accuſe me for the greateſt Incendiary of the Kingdome, all men may ſee they speak as untruly, ſo moſt maliciouſly, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now theſe are my words: And herein is obſervable:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that as I ſay I have been cleared by both Houſes of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> from being an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> ſo I mention not, commend, or ſpeak of the Cavaliers, for their undertakings; I onely ſay, many of the brave Gentlemen in the Kings Army have alſo cleared me from that aſperſion being convinced that my ſufferings were moſt unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly that I ſay many of the brave Gentlemen; I ſpeak not of all the Cavaliers in the Kings Army; but you ſilencing my words and omitting to ſhew the cauſe which induced me there to ſpeak of them, make your complaint in Generall ſaying, <hi>He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Kings Cavaliers for brave Gentlemen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in my forecited words I plainly ſet down the reaſon
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:48122:393"/>
which moved the Popiſh Cavaiiers to ſhew me favour, namely, becauſe they were fully perſwaded that I (having writ ſo much in defence of the Proteſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whether I diſcovered unto the Cavaliers ſome of that bitterneſſe of spirit againſt the Independents.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, this is a cunning deceiveable queſtion, whereby you delude poore ignorant, harmeleſſe people, baring them in hand, as if there were a vaſt difference and great diſagreement between the Cavaliers and Independents, which is quite contrary; for there is a direct harmonie betweene the Independents and Cavaliers of all ſorts, whether malignant, or popiſh Cavaliers, and the truth is, to ſpeake againſt Independents to Cavaliers, may purchaſe diſpleaſure to any man ſooner then gaine him favour; for I know, and many can teſtifie the ſame, that the Cavaliers doe generally applaud the Independents; and indeed they have reaſon ſo to doe; for they drive on the Cavaliers great deſigne, with as much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe as themſelves, yet they have done it with farre more Ieſuiticall policie, doing it under the pretence of holineſſe, and ſo have beene leſſe diſcerned by many in their deſtructive practiſes. But their cunning undermining both Church and State, doth now daily more and more, very manifeſtly appeare, and is diſcerned, and bewayled of all, who have not the eye of reaſon blinded with ſelfe-ends, and by-reſpects, and for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſake will connive at, and ſide with any party: But who ever prudentially, conſcienciouſly, and judiciouſly examine, and take a view of their proceedings, they plainely ſee and confeſſe, <hi>that the Independents have exceedingly laboured to ſet forward, and daily doe indeavour, leaving no wayes unattempted to effect that thing, which was and is the Cavaliers grand deſigne,</hi> for it is well knowne, <hi>that the Cavaliers did make it their great, and one of their chiefeſt deſignes to have Biſhops, and all the Prelaticall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction continued, that ſo Popery, though it were not by a Law ſet up, and eſtabliſhed in this Kingdome, yet it might be countenanced, and privately authorized by them, which is all one with the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in effect, that the Independents doe ſo plead, ſeeke after and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, calling it Liberty of Conſcience:</hi> Thus while they ſtrive to get an unlimited, which is an irreligious and unlawfull Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="657" facs="tcp:48122:395"/>
them with all their power, and ſhould the Independents obtaine their deſire herein, the greateſt part of the Cavaliers worke would be done to their hand; for then Cavaliers, Papiſts, Prelates, Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Turkes, Iewes and Heathens, would all pretend, <hi>that they beleeve, ſerve, and worſhip God, according to the Light they have received, and as they are perſwaded in their Conſciences is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods Word, and Will (and Conſcience is a tender thing, and ought not to be forced); ſo that by the ſame rule in equity, a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Liberty of Conſcience cannot be denyed to any of them, if once granted to the Independents, and Sectaries of our times, who for the greateſt part of them are as erroneous, if not worſe, in their Doctrine as the Papists and Prelates; many of them as blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as the Turkes and Iewes, and live as without God in the world;</hi> and the malignant party knowing this very well, doe therefore all of them, Cavaliers, Papiſts, and the profaneſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants in the Kingdome, looke upon the <hi>Independents,</hi> and ſpeak of them uſefull as their friends, and unanimouſly agree upon all occaſions to withſtand the Presbyterian government, that way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſtrict and holy for any of them, yea the Independents and they doe all joyne together as one man, with one voyce pleading and crying out <hi>for a toleration, liberty of conſcience, or an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence without any limitation,</hi> that ſo every man may beleeve and ſerve God as it ſeemes good in his owne eyes, under the name of tenderneſſe of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Now the Independents practices, and the way they plead for, being thus knowne to be very pleaſing, and acceptable to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, whether Popiſh or otherwiſe, then ſurely had <hi>I</hi> diſcovered any bitterneſſe of ſpirit againſt Jndependents, it might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated their ſpirits againſt mee, it could never have extracted pitie or favour, nor have drawne any applauſe from them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is cleare, that was not the cauſe: But know the onely cauſe which moved ſome of the Cavaliers (after <hi>J</hi> had for the further tryall of my patience, and the manifeſtation of my faithfulneſſe, for a long time indured ſtrict and cloſe impriſonment in the Goale of <hi>Yorke)</hi> to ſhew me favour, was the gracious working, and over-ruling power of God, vvho inclined their hearts to deale kindly vvith me his faithfull ſervant.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a true anſvver to your firſt Querie, <hi>I</hi> come now to the ſecond, which you propound in theſe words.</p>

               <pb n="658" facs="tcp:48122:396"/>
Or was it ſome Courtly Compliance with Papiſts, preferring them before Independents or Proteſtants, that made thoſe Popiſh Cavaliers ſo much to applaud you?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that part of this laſt Querie, is the ſame with the former; for here you ſpeake as if to ſlight the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, were a ſure way to obtaine favour and applauſe from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Cavaliers; truly you flatter your ſelfe if you thinke your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till dealing herein is not ſeene, when as it is ſo notoriouſly known, that any man who ſpeaks againſt Independents may be ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but never applauded by Popiſh, or any that are Cavaliers; for they applaud the Independents, whom they hold to be more ſubtill, and powerfull to effect the thing they chiefly ayms at, and deſire then themſelves; and it is well knowne, and can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they will run and goe to doe any Malignant a favour, yea, they will joyne with the wickedeſt Cavaliers againſt a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to doe him a miſchiefe. But having cleared this truth in my Reply to your firſt Querie, I haſten to the other part of this, where you ſtart the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the favour I received were not by my courtly compliance with Papiſts, preferring them before Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> &amp;c. To which I anſwer, that my conſtant perſeverance in holding forth the true Proteſtant Religion where ever I lived, at home and beyond the ſeas, is ſufficiently knowne to all the godly, faithfull, orthodox Chriſtians, that inhabited in any of thoſe parts where I have dwelt, and ſo farre have I ever beene from any courtly complying with Papiſts, or preferring them before Proteſtants, as ſome in <hi>England</hi> at this day can teſtifie, that when I lived in forraine nations, my zeale was ſo great for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, that with no little hazard I have maintained it; for all the while I travailed abroad, and continued in Popiſh Countries, which was many yeares, it fared with mee as with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> while hee waited at <hi>Athens, Act.</hi> 17. 16, 17. my ſpirit was ſtirred in me when I ſaw the Cities and all the Countries wholly given to Idolatry; therefore carrying my life in my hand I daily diſputed with Papiſts, and thoſe they accounted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout perſons, Prieſts and Ieſuits againſt Popery, maintaining the Proteſtant Religion; inſomuch, as it was only the goodneſſe of my God that kept me ſafe, giving them no power to hurt mee; further <hi>J</hi> anſwer you, the Bookes that <hi>I</hi> have written againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, in Latine, and in Engliſh, are yet extant, and they doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:48122:396"/>
and will to future generations, that the Author of them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted againſt, and diſclaimed Popery, and earneſtly contented for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints, <hi>Iud. verſ.</hi> 3. yea, the many diſputations <hi>I</hi> have held with Prieſts, Jeſuits, and people popiſhly affected in <hi>England,</hi> not onely while <hi>I</hi> injoyed my liberty, but alſo when by the Prelaticall popiſh party <hi>J</hi> was for maintaining the true Proteſtant Religion, and ſtanding for the peace and welfare of my countrey caſt into ſeverall priſons, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Gate-houſe</hi> at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Launceſton</hi> in <hi>Cornewall,</hi> in the Caſtle, in the Iſle of <hi>Sylly,</hi> in the Goale of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> in the Goale in the Citie of <hi>Yorke,</hi> in <hi>Hemſley</hi>-Caſtle, in <hi>Yorke</hi>-ſhire; Laſtly in <hi>Knaſebrough</hi>-Caſtle in <hi>Yorke</hi>-ſhire. Yet through Gods ſupporting grace, in none of all theſe priſons, could the cruelty, pride and fury of men, which in <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Sylly</hi> was my daily portion, either make me forget my integrity, or daunt mee in the leaſt; for their rage and power <hi>I</hi> feared not, neither did <hi>I</hi> ever forbeare to juſtifie godly Proteſtants, nor decline any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to diſpute with Papiſts, but improved it to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ſhew the great idolatry, and vanity of their Religion, as many who were priſoners with mee, in ſome of the fore-named places can teſtifie: And <hi>I</hi> am confident, that the Popiſh Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, with whom <hi>I</hi> have beene a priſoner, and others of them, that have diſcourſed and reaſoned with me in matters of Religion, will give this teſtimony, that they ever found me conſtant to my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, unmoveable in the Proteſtant Religion, and as farre from complying with Papiſts, or preferring them before Proteſtants, what ever <hi>I</hi> ſuffered or under-went, as light is from darkeneſſe in its greateſt brightneſſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover Brother, <hi>I</hi> would not that you ſhould be ignorant how that I have beene as frequent in diſputations, writ as much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, and at all times, and in all companies have appeared as forward and earneſt againſt Papiſts, <hi>and have ventured my life to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion, as freely as any Independent,</hi> I <hi>know in</hi> England, <hi>and that in the worst of times; yea, when thoſe who are now the chiefe independent Rabbies, to avoyd ſuffering for truth, would not ſtand to appeare in her behalfe, but went out of the Kingdome,</hi> and like the parents of the man that was borne blind, Joh. 9. 21. <hi>Left her to ſpeake for her ſelfe,</hi> then J helped to maintaine truths cauſe, and was not afraid nor aſhamed to ſuffer

in ſo good a quarrell, but reſiſted her oppoſers, <hi>Papists, Prelates, Arminians</hi> and <hi>Formalists</hi> in their erroneous Doctrines, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh practiſes even unto blood. I am become a foole in glorying, you have compelled me, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. for ſo many reproaches which you have caſt upon me, and ſuch groundleſſe Queries could never have proceeded from any that had not beene guided ſhould I ſay by a traducing ſpirit, truly that word would come ſhort fully to explaine and ſet forth the ſinfull ſubtilty of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> will not undertake to ſet down what ſpirit it was, and what name it will beare; I ſhall onely ſhew what it was not, and leave it to ſuch as are godly, wife, and experienced Chriſtians, to ſpell out the name thereof: Now it is very evident that it was not the ſpirit of brotherly love; that would have ſilenced yea annihilated ſuch thoughts in the firſt conception; for as brotherly love thinks no evill, much leſſe dares it deviſe, and publiſh falſhood; yet more evill, and greater falſhood; then you have not only thought (as it plainely appeares) but publiſhed againſt me, and that delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, none could ever have imagined; for you render me a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Walker (as vile as vile can be) and here you queſtion whether I have not complyed with Papiſts, and Popiſh Cavaliers, and preferred them before Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Thus with your windie Independent policie you blaſt my good name, raiſe doubts, cloud my ſincerity, darken and overſhadow my faithfull conſtant perſeverance in the truth and wayes of God to make me be thought a man infamous and of no Religion: but ſuch dealings are abſolutely contrary to brotherly love; therefore it is very clear to the underſtanding of all, that you were not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by that ſpirit. And as your quaeries were made without bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, ſo they ſeem to be altogether voyd of Chriſtian expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, being wholly filled with evill ſurmiſes, ſcrued up to their height by the hand of carnall, reaſon, and uttered by the tongue of ſinfull ſuſpicion. For <hi>I</hi> beſeech you conſider how it comes to paſſe, that you who have been a Priſoner, one of my <hi>Quondam</hi> Fellow Sufferers, when you heare, that <hi>I</hi> being a Priſoner (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command and power of Popiſh Cavaliers) was courteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by a profeſt Papiſt, ſhould have ſuch thoughts ariſe in your heart, and ſet them forth in Print, to inquire whether the favor <hi>I</hi> received from them were not obtained by my courtly complying with Papiſts, preferring them before Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>

Brother, have you had ſuch experience of Gods power and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goodneſſe in giving you favor two years together in the eyes of ſome to whom you were committed Priſoner, and do you now think it ſo ſtrange as you cannot ſearch out the reaſon of it when God hath wrought the ſame thing for me, (one Moneth) but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the favor I received was purchaſed by wronging my conſcience? Surely when you writ theſe quaeries you had forgot the loving kindneſſes of our God ſhewed to you in your impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and how notwithſtanding for the firſt halfe year, the Governour of <hi>Garnſey</hi> kept you cloſe Priſoner in very ſtrict du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (in ſome things exceeding the rigor of his Warrant); Yet at laſt <hi>God</hi> moving his heart to more humanitie, he afterwards gave you what liberty the Caſtle did afford, ſuffered you not to want any accommodation that he could poſſiblie helpe you unto, and uſed you courteouſly all the remaining time of your baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Had you called theſe things to mind (me thinks) the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Gods mercies unto your ſelfe would have fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied you in this particular, and ſilenced your carnall reaſonings, knowing <hi>Gods</hi> arme is not ſhortned nor his power leſſened, He is the ſame <hi>God</hi> yeſterday, to day, and for ever; therefore (I ſay) ſurely you had forgot his loving kindneſſes to you, or elſe you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtopped the mouth of your experiences and would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to ſpeak for me, whom you ſo ſeek to blot with falſe reports, ignominie, and diſgracefull language, that even the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>God</hi> manifeſteſt towards me, you to obſcure with a vail of evill ſurmiſes; But that the name of <hi>God</hi> may be ever magnified, the world undeceived, and you receive a ſatisfactory anſwer unto your quaeries, know, it was not any courtly compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Papiſts which procured me favor; I did no ſuch thing; let <hi>God</hi> be true, and every man a lyar; for to him all praiſe is due, who in his Word hath ſaid, <hi>When a mans ways pleaſe the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him,</hi> Prov. 16. 7. This did my <hi>God,</hi> when I was committed cloſe Priſoner to a Papiſt, make good to me his ſervant (who though in much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, do make it the ultimate end of all my endeavors to pleaſe the Lord): Now this was <hi>the Lords doing, and let it not ſeem marvellous in your eyes, That that God, who called Cyrus by name, made him a friend to the people of God, though he knew not God,</hi> Iſaiah 45. 4. <hi>Who ſent his Angel and ſhut the lyons mouthes</hi>

No ſurely! For this and greater things then this, my <hi>God</hi> hath done for me; Therefore the experiences I have had of his goodneſſe, free grace, rich mercies, and never failing loving kindneſſes, I for ever will extoll, predicate, declare, and ſpeak of, that men may know it is not in vain to ſerve and patiently wait upon the Lord our <hi>God,</hi> nor to relie on him, in the time of their diſtreſſe, when they ſeem to be deprived of all outward comforts and expoſed to the greateſt miſeries.</p>
