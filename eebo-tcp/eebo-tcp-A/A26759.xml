            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I Å¿hould relate the indignation of all that party, and their Å¿everall expreÅ¿Å¿ions of the Å¿ame againÅ¿t me, Å¿o that at that time there were no leÅ¿Å¿e nor fewer ignominious calumnies caÅ¿t upon mee, nor more variety of viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent cenÅ¿ures given out againÅ¿t me, then were uttered by them all to my diÅ¿paragement, upon the late comming forth, but of the Title and FrontiÅ¿pice of the enÅ¿uing DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, many of them affirming, <hi>that I was a vaine glorious wicked fellow, that I was mad, that I was a baÅ¿e rogue, and that I deÅ¿erved hanging, and that I would never be quiet till I were hanged,</hi> with innumerable other unchriÅ¿tian expreÅ¿Å¿ion of like nature. So that it Å¿eems, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>piaculum</hi> by farre now to write againÅ¿t the Independents and Sectaries then <hi>Å¿candalum magnatum</hi> was a few yeares Å¿ince.</p>
            <p>Truly at that time, I could Å¿carce paÅ¿Å¿e by any of them (as I cannot at this day) without Å¿ome contumely or other, all which I beare with patience. And amongÅ¿t others, I could never meet my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> but he would alwayes after his Å¿alutation, in a deriding and Å¿cornefull manner, aske me, <hi>when my Book came forth,</hi> telling me <hi>that he expected Å¿ome MonÅ¿ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It Å¿eemes, he thought I was bringing forth Å¿uch a prodigious brat as he not long after laid at my doore, which though it were a MonÅ¿ter indeed borne with teeth and nayles, and did nothing but Å¿cratch and bite me, yet comming from his loynes my Brother

and quondam Fellow-Å¿ufferer, I gave it entertainment, and for the love I beare to him, I have ever Å¿ince danled it upon the knee of my election: Now as Å¿oone as I had Å¿atisfied his expectation, and Å¿ent him my Booke Å¿o long looked for, he very liberally expreÅ¿Å¿ed his thankes for it, and his opinion concerning both it and my Å¿elfe, and that with many opprobrious words; amidÅ¿t others he aÅ¿Å¿erted, <hi>I was craÅ¿ed in my braine, and that I had need of Å¿ome hellebore,</hi> and Å¿pake of me <hi>as an ApoÅ¿tate and a PerÅ¿ecutor,</hi> who before he new my differing opinion from him, both prayed for me, and immoderately prayÅ¿ed me, Å¿uch is the uncertainty of all that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne, there being no Å¿tability in any creature; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>hee triumphed that he would give me a Å¿peedy anÅ¿wer,</hi> making nothing of what I had written (as it is uÅ¿uall with all the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents to vilipend and Å¿light whatÅ¿oever the Presbyterians ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿peake or write) and meeting with an other Independent not many dayes after, he told me <hi>that there were twenty pens at worke againÅ¿t me, and that I Å¿hould have my hands full.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever it was Å¿ome moneths before I heard from any of them in print, yet all that <hi>interim</hi> they <hi>whetted their tongues againÅ¿t me like Å¿o many Razors, Swords and Arrows to wound me in my reputation;</hi> yea, there was Å¿carce a weapon in all the <hi>arÅ¿enall</hi> of calumny that they uÅ¿ed not againÅ¿t me.</p>
            <p>Now after Å¿ome moneths one <hi>HanÅ¿erdo Knollys</hi> comming to me, told me <hi>he had writ a moderate AnÅ¿wer unto my Booke,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning <hi>that the PreÅ¿Å¿es were all Å¿hut againÅ¿t them</hi> (though the whole Kingdome know, and their daily Å¿criblings in print can witneÅ¿Å¿e the contrary; whereupon, to take away (if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible) all occaÅ¿ion of their calumnious tongues, I writ unto Reverend and Learned MaÅ¿ter <hi>Cranford,</hi> intreating him <hi>that hee would for the Å¿topping of all their mouths licenÅ¿e his Booke,</hi> which he willingly, to pleaÅ¿ure me condeÅ¿cended unto, <hi>giving his reaÅ¿on withall in writing under his owne hand why he made Å¿uch a tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ion,</hi> the which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> concealed, <hi>wherein he dealt not candidly,</hi> for it gave great occaÅ¿ion to the Sectaries to traduce MaÅ¿ter <hi>Cranford</hi> not a little. And after this was printed, came forth an other Pamphlet by one <hi>I.

               <hi>unto them,</hi> I anÅ¿wered not in a triumphing manner (as my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> relateth) but merrily, yet in reÅ¿pectful terms, <hi>that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood my Brother</hi> Burtons <hi>Booke was comming forth againÅ¿t me, and when once that appeared I would anÅ¿wer them altogether.</hi> This is all as I remember was Å¿pake by me.</p>
            <p>Now they having their EmiÅ¿Å¿aries and LiÅ¿ners in all corners, it Å¿eemes Å¿ome of them over-heard that which was Å¿poken by me, which they related to my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> in other language then I uttered it, the which provoked him a freÅ¿h (as he Å¿aith, page 1.) <hi>in ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>But before I paÅ¿Å¿e on to my Å¿econd Querie,</hi> I <hi>Å¿hall take liberty to make uÅ¿e of Å¿ome of Reverend and Learned MaÅ¿ter</hi> Calamies <hi>words for the more corroborating the judgement of the Reader concerning this firÅ¿t queÅ¿tion: He in</hi> his just and neceÅ¿Å¿ary Apology against my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> unjuct invective concerning Truth Å¿hut out of doores, page <hi>2. hath this expreÅ¿sion concerning my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Burton. His words <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> are Å¿words and Å¿peares, rather then words. Hee fights with his heeles, rather then with his head,
<pb facs="tcp:48122:10"/>
and kicks rather then argues, and whips rather then anÅ¿wers. Scarce any man Å¿ince <hi>Montagues</hi> Appeal hath written with more bitterneÅ¿s. I may Å¿ay of him as Dr <hi>Rivet</hi> doth of BiÅ¿hop <hi>Montague, Non poteÅ¿t vir ille Å¿ine convitiis quenquam a quo diÅ¿Å¿entit vel in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿simis nominare,</hi> Rivet. Apol. this man cannot Å¿o much as mention any one from whom he differs in opinion, though it be but in the Å¿ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t matters, without reproach. And as <hi>Plato</hi> Å¿aid to <hi>Diogenes,</hi> when hee trode upon the pride of <hi>Plato,</hi> thou treadeÅ¿t upon my pride with a greater pride: So <hi>(Å¿aith MaÅ¿ter</hi> Calamy) doth Mr <hi>Burton</hi> tread upon me, and whatÅ¿oever is blame-worthy in me, with a pride more then epiÅ¿copall; and Å¿urely if to be railed upon and reviled be Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring a man into diÅ¿credit, then I muÅ¿t be eÅ¿teemed as the dung, off<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>Å¿couring, and filth of the world, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus that learned man truly Å¿pake of my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> whoÅ¿e faculty chiefly lies in abuÅ¿ing moÅ¿t men that differ from him, though but in the leaÅ¿t things.</p>
            <p>But what Mr <hi>Calamy</hi> Å¿ays of him, may alÅ¿o truly be Å¿aid of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenÅ¿is</hi> and all thoÅ¿e of that fraternity, <hi>whoÅ¿e words are Å¿words and spears, who all fight rather with their heels, then with their heads, and kick rather then argue, and whip rather then anÅ¿wer.</hi> Whether therfore Å¿uch men as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices, though they come to us in gray heads, <hi>be found in the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> when their dealings are Å¿o palpably unjuÅ¿t, and their opinions Å¿o Å¿chiÅ¿maticall, hereticall and erroneous, I leave it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Å¿uch as know what the way of <hi>righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e</hi> is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now I come to my Å¿econd quaerie:</hi> viz. Whether the way of Independency be the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e?</p>
            <p>My brother <hi>Burton</hi> writing in the name of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, pretends unto the people, and would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, <hi>that they are all Dependent upon Gods Word for all their proceedings,</hi> and affirmes moreover in the fifth page, <hi>that all their new gathered Churches and Å¿everall Congregations are all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent one upon another,</hi> both which aÅ¿Å¿ertions of his are moÅ¿t falÅ¿e, as will evidently appear to all thoÅ¿e that know their practices and will vouchÅ¿afe but to read the inÅ¿uing diÅ¿courÅ¿e, where they Å¿hall find, <hi>that they have neither precept nor preÅ¿ident for their way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency in all Gods holy Word, and that there is not Å¿o much as one example in all the Å¿acred Scriptures for any of their new practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> wherein they differ from us;</hi> and which is more <hi>that they all of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:11"/>
               <hi>them withhold the truth from the people in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e:</hi> How then can the way of Independency bee the way of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, when it is a deviation from that way, as by their practices will be evidenced; therefore for the confirmation of what I have now Å¿aid, <hi>I</hi> will briefly examine Å¿ome of their proceedings, and firÅ¿t whereas my brother <hi>Burton</hi> affirmeth <hi>that all their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are Dependent one upon another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I Å¿ay is moÅ¿t falÅ¿e. For all their proceedings in their Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall congregations are carryed on in an arbitrary way; whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they publiÅ¿h in their writings and pretend to the people (as all the learned and thoÅ¿e that are acquainted with their method well know); So that it lies in any one of their Churches breaÅ¿ts, and is at their pleaÅ¿ure, whether they will Å¿o much as confer or conÅ¿ult with each other; and if they do at any time vouchÅ¿afe one another that courteÅ¿ie, yet it is Å¿til voluntary whether they will give each other an account of either their cenÅ¿ures or proceedings (for they all pretend as abÅ¿olute a Å¿overaignty and juriÅ¿diction within themÅ¿elvs Å¿everally as any free-Å¿tates or common-wealths) &amp; have no authority one over another, neither can they appeal for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe if wronged, one to or from another: And if any Member in any one of thoÅ¿e Churches, or any one of thoÅ¿e Churches divided amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elvs, or upon Å¿ome eminent received wrong Å¿hould fondly complain to another neighbour Church, that Church hath no power to relieve them no more then one private man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve another if he Å¿hould be appealed to by another; And if that Church Å¿hould deÅ¿ire an account of the other Churches procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that Church may refuÅ¿e it, if it pleaÅ¿e them. But if to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their deÅ¿ire, that Church Å¿hould vouchÅ¿afe to condeÅ¿cend Å¿o far unto the other Church, as to give them a reaÅ¿on of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; all this is but <hi>gratis,</hi> and out of their good nature; they have Å¿till no power to call that Church in queÅ¿tion that hath done the wrong, if that Church Å¿tands upon its points and priviledges, and Å¿aith <hi>that they have nothing to do with them.</hi> And what then is to be done in this caÅ¿e? Then forÅ¿ooth, <hi>they will withdraw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from that Church, which,</hi> Å¿ay they, <hi>is the higheÅ¿t cenÅ¿ure any one Church can proceed to againÅ¿t another Church.</hi> Is not this, I pray, fine Dependency? What more unrighteous dealing can be found in the world then this of the Independents, <hi>to profeÅ¿Å¿e themÅ¿elves Independents, and yet to pretend a Dependency?</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:48122:11"/>
when that comes to the tryall, <hi>they have no more reall Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy one upon another, then we have with them?</hi> Yea, what a great unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is this to pretend a Dependency one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a communion amongÅ¿t their new gathered Churches, when it is well known <hi>there is no more union and communion, nor true friendÅ¿hip amongst them then was between Herod and Pilate,</hi> they refuÅ¿ing the right hand of fellowÅ¿hip each to other in many of them? Yea they are deadly enemies one to another, as can Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently be proved (although they all agree together to perÅ¿ecute the Presbyterians, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did well accord to perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ChriÅ¿t); For I my Å¿elfe have heard the Independents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t againÅ¿t the BrowniÅ¿ts, AnabaptiÅ¿ts, Antinomians, and See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and many other of the new fraternities, proclaming them all Sectaries: And on the other Å¿ide, I have heard thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Å¿oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties rail againÅ¿t all the Independents, eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e <hi>Homothu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madon</hi> diÅ¿Å¿enting brethren in the reverend AÅ¿Å¿embly, Å¿aying, <hi>that they had a better and a more charitable eÅ¿teem of any of the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian MiniÅ¿ters then of them, and they do unanimouÅ¿ly accuÅ¿e all the MiniÅ¿ters of New</hi>-England <hi>of as great tyranny as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:</hi> And it is well known, that many of the Independent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations here amongÅ¿t us have their different laws and cuÅ¿toms, every one of them diÅ¿Å¿enting more or leÅ¿Å¿e from each other in their Å¿everall new gathered Churches; yea they are ignorant of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers practices: For my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> know not <hi>that the women in Å¿ome of their congregations have their voices there;</hi> and yet it can be proved, <hi>that they alÅ¿o have Peters keyes at their girdles as well as any of their PreÅ¿byters:</hi> And therefore their new Churches <hi>are not Dependent one upon another,</hi> as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> aÅ¿Å¿erteth Page the fifth, when as they all of them exerciÅ¿e an abÅ¿olute Å¿overaignty amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves Independent: What unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e then is this in my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and in all the Independents to affirme <hi>that in all their Churches there is a Dependent Independency, or an Independent Dependency,</hi> which is but a contradictory bull at beÅ¿t, at the baiting whereof a man, if he regarded not miÅ¿pending his time, might make far better Å¿port, then he did Å¿ome years Å¿ince, in baiting the Popes Bull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The truth is, as their Religion is but a meer Babell, Å¿o all their language is confounded, and they are divided in their opinions,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:12"/>
               <hi>principles and practices, they being all really Independent: And therefore</hi> whether the way of Independency be the way of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, where they are Å¿o unrighteous in all their proceedings, and when they Å¿ay one thing and do and practice another, and when they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the truth from the people in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, as all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Predicants do, <hi>I refer it to the wiÅ¿dome and judgement of the godly and conÅ¿ciencious Reader. But the unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of their way will yet more perÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly appear if we but look into Å¿ome other of their practices, which I Å¿hall by and by inÅ¿tance, the very conÅ¿ideration of the which (the better to Å¿tirr up thy attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) makes me boldly to conclude of them all,</hi> That whatÅ¿oever they pretend and whatÅ¿oever Å¿hews of Å¿eeming holineÅ¿Å¿e they hold out to the world, they are unÅ¿ound, root and branch; and neither the godly party, nor the praying people, nor the only Saints, but the moÅ¿t phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aicall brood that ever yet appeared in the world, and more injurious to ChriÅ¿t the King of his Church and to his royalty, and to all his holy, faithfull MiniÅ¿ters and Servants, then ever the Pope or any of the Prelaticall party were, and more malicious and treacherous to the Saints, and truly godly and precious ones, and more oppoÅ¿ers of all Reformation, then ever the Cavaliers were; and many of them greater enemies to Church and State, and the welfare of both, then either Strafford or the Prelate of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the Independent government, as it is moÅ¿t certain it hath neither precept nor preÅ¿ident for it in all Gods holy Word, Å¿o it is far more tyrannicall and lordly then that of the Pope or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <hi>tending to nothing but an Anarchy and confuÅ¿ion in Church and State:</hi> And therefore that they with all their trumperies and deÅ¿perate practices, with all their unrighteous dealing, ought to be abhorred and abominated, whatÅ¿oever Å¿eeming Å¿anctimony they make Å¿hew of, by all Å¿uch as truly fear God and wiÅ¿h the peace of Zion and the good of the State and Kingdomes in which they live.</p>
            <p>Now they that have a deÅ¿ire to Å¿ee this charg made good againÅ¿t them, Å¿hall find it with the whole impeachment fully proved and made evident in the following diÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>But in the interim it will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e to produce Å¿ome few inÅ¿tances more of their practices <hi>for the proving of their Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency not to be the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a man but look upon their Å¿uperlative pride, eÅ¿pecially the
<pb facs="tcp:48122:12"/>
conceit they all of them have of their own holineÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity we Å¿hall find that it exceeds that of the very Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees, for all the Independents and Sectaries Å¿tile themÅ¿elves <hi>the holy people, the godly party, the praying people, the generation of the just, the Saints;</hi> yea eÅ¿teeming the very retrimentitious part of them (to Å¿peak in their own dialect) Saints, calling their moÅ¿t blaÅ¿phemous opinions and practices, <hi>the infirmities of the Saints,</hi> in the mean time excluding the moÅ¿t godly Presbyterians from thoÅ¿e titles, <hi>calling them the AntichriÅ¿tian brood, the enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdome, the Å¿ons of Beliall, and what not?</hi> all which dealing with their brethren is not the way of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e: yea in their very prayers to God, they like the PhariÅ¿ees boaÅ¿t of their own knowledge, Å¿lighting and vilifying all their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian brethren, diÅ¿daining Å¿o much as to pray for them; yea in their publike AÅ¿Å¿emblies, and in their publike prayers they have been heard contemptuouÅ¿ly to Å¿peak of thoÅ¿e in authority aÅ¿Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that they were not worthy of the prayers of the Saints, and it is well known that many of them will neither publickly nor privately joyn with their Presbyterian brethren in any duty of piety accounting them all as an AntichriÅ¿tian and unÅ¿anctified ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men, and all this out of a Å¿trong and confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waÅ¿ion of their own holineÅ¿s &amp; out of an uncharitable opinion of their brethrens impurity, then the which Å¿train of pride, the very PhariÅ¿ees never exerciÅ¿ed a greater; all which practices of theirs Å¿ufficiently declare, <hi>that the way of Independency is not the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e:</hi> for greater unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e there cannot be then this, as will by and by appear.</p>
            <p>But I will now come to Å¿ome inÅ¿tances.</p>
            <p>Not long Å¿ince at a great entertainment and feÅ¿tivity on the Lords day, when they were all met together, one of the <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumadon</hi> brethren, a great man amongÅ¿t them, beginning the duty of the day, in his Prayer before his Sermon, Å¿peaking unto God by way of complaint againÅ¿t the Presbyterians, Å¿aid unto Him with many tears, <hi>Lord, they</hi> (meaning the Presbyterians) <hi>hate us becauÅ¿e we know more of thee then they do; but we beÅ¿eech thee Lord give us Å¿till to know more of thee, and let them hate us more, if they will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before <hi>I</hi> come to Å¿peak of this their prayer, and of Å¿ome other paÅ¿Å¿ages of their other good prayers, I Å¿hall take the liberty
<pb facs="tcp:48122:13"/>
here to Å¿ay Å¿omething of the difference between theÅ¿e mens practices, and the old Puritans of ENGLAND; and Å¿o much the rather <hi>I</hi> do it, becauÅ¿e they would perÅ¿wade the world that there is little difference between them and the old Puritans; yea one of their Itinerary Predicants not long Å¿ince preaching in a publike AÅ¿Å¿embly, affirmed that there was no other difference between the Independents at this day and the old Puritans of ENGLAND but that the Independents were over-grown Puritans; which <hi>I</hi> conceive, he meant in this Å¿enÅ¿e, that the Independents outÅ¿trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them in all duties of piety and charity, and in all comely, Å¿eemly, orderly, and temperate walking in an unblameable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ation before God and men: This, <hi>I</hi> Å¿ay, <hi>I</hi> conceive to be his meaning by the word <hi>overgrown:</hi> for <hi>I</hi> would not willingly put a worÅ¿e interpretation upon his expreÅ¿Å¿ion, and underÅ¿tand by <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown,</hi> that he meant they were become monÅ¿trous (Which notwithÅ¿tanding too too many of them are); therefore if his words be taken in the better Å¿enÅ¿e, by <hi>overgrown</hi> he underÅ¿tands <hi>that the Independents have attained unto a higher degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then ever the old Puritans had attained unto, and that they now walke more cloÅ¿ely in the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e then ever they did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will firÅ¿t therefore Å¿et down Å¿ome of the practices of the old Puritans, with the paths and wayes of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e they walked in, omitting many things for brevity Å¿ake though worthy of eternall memory and our everlaÅ¿ting imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For the old Puritants of ENGLAND, as thoÅ¿e that have read their writings and knew their practices and were familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, they can teÅ¿tifie of them, <hi>that they were an humble, Å¿elf-denying people, ever groaning under that burden of the remnant of Å¿in,</hi> crying out with the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who Å¿hall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> they never dreamed of a perfect holineÅ¿s, nor never thought themÅ¿elves more holy then others; or preÅ¿umed to call themÅ¿elves Saints; and if that title had at any time been given unto any of them by Å¿uch as truly honoured them for their Å¿ingular graces, you Å¿hould ever hear them complain of their imperfections, and with the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>counting all things loÅ¿Å¿e for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, eÅ¿teeming all their righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:13"/>
               <hi>but dung, that they might win Christ and be found in him not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their own righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now they that are acquainted with the Independents doctrine, words, and practices, hear them talk of nothing but of their own Å¿anctity, and of their perfection, Å¿aying <hi>God can Å¿ee no Å¿in in them;</hi> and although Å¿ome of them do not profeÅ¿Å¿e Å¿o much in words, yet in deeds they allow of that doctrine, proclaming themÅ¿elves <hi>to be the only Saints, the holy people, and the godly party, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the juÅ¿t, and Å¿eparate from their brethren as impure crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> Therefore the Independents do not walk in that old way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e the old Puritans of ENGLAND walked in, who made no Å¿eparation in the worÅ¿t times from the publike AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblies, or ever refuÅ¿ed to pray with their ChriÅ¿tian brethren; and therefore in this point they have not outÅ¿tripped them nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown them; from which <hi>I</hi> boldly conclude, <hi>that herein that Predicant did abuÅ¿e the world,</hi> in Å¿aying <hi>that there is no difference between the Independents and the old Puritants of</hi> ENGLAND; For the old Puritans were <hi>humble, Å¿elf denying men,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents are <hi>phariÅ¿aicall boaÅ¿ters of their own holineÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity;</hi> and therefore in this, <hi>their way is not the way of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, but a great aberration from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> though never Å¿o learned, and never Å¿o Å¿ufficiently furniÅ¿hed with all accompliÅ¿hed abilities of divine knowledge, which many of them by their indefatigable pains, Å¿tudy, and induÅ¿try, and by their prayers unto God night and day, and by their continuall waiting upon the Ordinances, and Gods bleÅ¿Å¿ing upon all their endeavours, had attained unto, Å¿o that they were taken notice of by all men, both in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ities and amongÅ¿t all the learned, to be incomparable men, many of the which I could name, yet not any one of them ever preached either in publike or private without great Å¿tudy and prayer, yea and without a Å¿peciall call; and they alwayes with Saint <hi>Paul, exerciÅ¿ed their MiniÅ¿tery in fear and much trembling,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. ver. 3. Å¿aying with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Who is Å¿ufficient for theÅ¿e things?</hi> ThoÅ¿e holy and godly Puritans, though tranÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently learned, yet were always converÅ¿ant in all holy duties, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pecially in preaching and prayer with fear and trembling, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themÅ¿elves never Å¿ufficiently enough provided for, for thoÅ¿e duties. And truly Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> example is worthy alwaies to be
<pb facs="tcp:48122:14"/>
looked upon, who though he were immediately inÅ¿pired by God himÅ¿elfe and had alwayes the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of his Å¿pirit, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and times more learning then all the Independents put together, yet he preached alwayes <hi>with fear and trembling, and cryed out who is Å¿ufficient for theÅ¿e things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we compare the Independents and their Predicants with the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> we Å¿hall find the old Puritans al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and in all things imitating the example of holy <hi>Paul</hi> and the other ApoÅ¿tles in their MiniÅ¿tery, which they had a command to follow, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. ver. 17. who intruded not themÅ¿elves raÅ¿hly upon the MiniÅ¿tery, as the falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles and Seducers uÅ¿ually did, and as all the Independents and Sectaries daily do; they cryed out <hi>who is Å¿ufficient for theÅ¿e things? and how can any preach except he be Å¿ent?</hi> Rom. 10. Å¿aying <hi>No man taketh this honour unto himÅ¿elf, but he that is called of God, as</hi> Aaron, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 4. ThoÅ¿e old Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were all men of Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> Å¿pirit, <hi>they durÅ¿t do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a call, nothing without great Å¿tudy, nothing without their parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and books,</hi> imitating Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this, who would alwaies have his parchments with him (that is his books) <hi>bring me my parchments, Å¿aith he;</hi> they preached not <hi>without fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;</hi> this was the continuall practice of the old Puritans, they could never be Å¿een in a Pulpit before they had Å¿ome dayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themÅ¿elves by prayer and Å¿tudy; and yet after all this, they would then cry out, <hi>Who is Å¿ufficient for theÅ¿e things?</hi> Whereas all the Independents and Sectaries aÅ¿Å¿ert, <hi>that every man may preach, and every man of them is Å¿ufficient, and many alÅ¿o hold that women may preach;</hi> yea and to manifeÅ¿t that <hi>they are all Å¿ufficient for theÅ¿e things, and for the diÅ¿penÅ¿ing of the great myÅ¿teries of Heaven, which the very Angels deÅ¿ired to pry into,</hi> they run through Town and Country, and whereÅ¿oever they come get up into the Pulpits and preach with Å¿uch impudencie, impiety and blaÅ¿phemy, as it is not lawfull to name, their very doctrines being Å¿o deÅ¿tructive to all piety, goodneÅ¿Å¿e, and good manners, and Ruffian<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>like they go in their hair and apparrel, and Å¿o inÅ¿olent and proud they are, that one would rather take them for Luciferians then Saints; and Å¿uch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beÅ¿eeming expreÅ¿Å¿ions they have in their prayers to God, as would terrifie a truly conÅ¿ciencious and godly man to hear them, as not long Å¿ince one of them in <hi>London</hi> publickly Å¿peaking unto God in his prayer, Å¿aid, <hi>Right Honorable Lord God,</hi> which kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ions

<pb facs="tcp:48122:17"/>
and Å¿upplications private and publick, ever with tears prayed for all in authority; I affirme that this practice of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents is not onely one of the higheÅ¿t Å¿trains of all unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and contrary to the practice of all the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> but contrary to all the practice of all the Saints that ever yet lived in the world, and contrary to all the commands of God both in the Old and New TeÅ¿tament. For we have read how earneÅ¿tly <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> prayed for the rebellious <hi>IÅ¿raelites,</hi> wiÅ¿hing himÅ¿elfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be blotted out of the book of life then that the Lord Å¿hould deÅ¿troy them; and Å¿o did <hi>Paul</hi> wiÅ¿h for his Countrymen the Jews: <hi>Samuel</hi> alÅ¿o when the people deÅ¿ired him to pray for them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. v. 23. <hi>God forbid</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that I Å¿hould Å¿in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Lord in ceaÅ¿ing to pray for you</hi> &amp;c. So that the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet makes it a Å¿in in either MiniÅ¿ters or people not to pray for their brethren, and eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e in authority: for this was the practice of all the Prophets; <hi>the Lord told a heathen King that Abraham his Å¿ervant Å¿hould pray for him; yea father Abraham prayed for the very Sodomites, and the Kingdoms in which they dwelt,</hi> Gen. 18. And the people of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> when they were in captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> had a command from God himÅ¿elfe <hi>to pray for the welfare of very Babylon and the Princes of the Å¿ame;</hi> and we have read what Å¿upplications <hi>Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah</hi> put up in behalfe of thoÅ¿e heathen Princes under which they lived, as well as for their own Countrymen. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives it in charge to all MiniÅ¿ters and people, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>to pray for all men,</hi> ver. 1, 2. <hi>I exhort</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that firÅ¿t of all Å¿upplications, prayers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceÅ¿Å¿ions, and giving of thanks be made for all men: For Kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a peaceable and quiet life in all godlineÅ¿Å¿e and honeÅ¿ty: For this is good and acceptable in the Å¿ight of God our Saviour.</hi> So that here there is not onely an exhortation to all ChriÅ¿tians in generall, but in Å¿peciall to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters <hi>to pray for all men:</hi> but primarily for thoÅ¿e in authority; and reaÅ¿ons &amp; grounds are alÅ¿o given by the ApoÅ¿tle of incouragement to this duty: <hi>viz. becauÅ¿e that it is a good and acceptable thing in the Å¿ight of God, tending alÅ¿o for the peace, quiet, and tranquillity of them all;</hi> and which is more, <hi>to all godlineÅ¿Å¿e, which is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all peace; and therefore that they ought to pray for thoÅ¿e in authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this exhortation of the ApoÅ¿tle, all the old Puritans of
<pb facs="tcp:48122:17"/>
               <hi>England</hi> did ever moÅ¿t diligently obÅ¿erve and follow, praying for them that were in authority night and day; whereas the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were never in private heard pray for either <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or the <hi>Scots,</hi> or <hi>AÅ¿Å¿embly.</hi> How wicked a thing therefore is it in the Independents and Sectaries, and what a part of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is it in them, dayly to omit this duty, who will neither pray with their brethren nor for them, but Å¿eparate from all their Å¿ocieties as from a people unholy? yea how impious and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a thing is it in them, againÅ¿t both God and all authority, to Å¿ay, and that in a diÅ¿dainfull manner, even in their publike meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places and congregations, <hi>that neither the Parliament nor AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿embly are worthy their prayers?</hi> yea it is well known and can be proved, <hi>that they pray againÅ¿t them and the King himÅ¿elfe,</hi> and that not onely privately, but in their congregations publikely.</p>
            <p>Surely if either the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>AÅ¿Å¿embly,</hi> or the <hi>PreÅ¿byte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were as bad as the <hi>Kings of Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>perÅ¿ecuting Jews,</hi> yet they ought to be prayed for; For we have a command to pray for all men, yea for our enemies, and thoÅ¿e that perÅ¿ecute us and revile us; and we have ChriÅ¿ts example for it, who Å¿aid, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do,</hi> Å¿peaking of thoÅ¿e that perÅ¿ecuted him, which Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> imitating, Å¿aid, <hi>Lord lay not this Å¿in to their charge;</hi> Å¿upplicating likewiÅ¿e for his enemies.

pleaÅ¿e, and therefore (for all their flatterie in their <hi>Petition)</hi> it highly concerns the Great Councel and the whole kingdom, time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look into their proceedings, &amp; their clandeÅ¿tine machinations, leÅ¿t that in recruting of the Parliament they doe Å¿o Å¿trengthen their faction, that in <hi>fine</hi> they deÅ¿troy not only the Parliament it Å¿elfe, but the whole Kindome, and make themÅ¿elves Å¿overaigne Lords indeed (as they pretend they are) over both the King and Parliament, and all the people, and Å¿o become really our Lords and MaÅ¿ters, Å¿o that whereas formerly this nation was called the Popes and Prelates AÅ¿Å¿es, we may now juÅ¿tly be called and termed the Independents Mules, a monÅ¿trous brood indeed; for it is Å¿ufficiently knowne, and can be proved, and that by good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e that it is their maxime, that the Saints only ought to rule the world, and to have the Å¿word in their hand, aud they prove this their Doctrine out of the 149. <hi>PÅ¿ame,</hi> where the Prophet Å¿aith, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. &amp;c. <hi>Let the Saints be jeyfull in glory, let them Å¿ing abroad upon their beds; let the high prayÅ¿es of God be in their mouth: and a two edged Å¿word in their hand to execute vengeanee upon the Heathen, and puniÅ¿hments upon the people, to bind their Kings with chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of Iron, to execute upon them the judgement written; this honour have all his Saints; prayÅ¿e yee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this place of Holy Scripture they ground their opinion, that the Saints only ought to rule the Earth; now they account none Saints but themÅ¿elves, and all the Presbyterians enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t; yea, they have beene heard Å¿ay when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, where they may Å¿peake freely, that they Å¿ee no reaÅ¿on why the Saints may not compell any nation by the Å¿word to come under obedience to ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome. So that howÅ¿oever they challenge liberty of conÅ¿cience now, Å¿aying that conÅ¿cience is a tender thing, and that it ought not be forced; yet if they but once get the day, they will give no toleration I beleeve to any Presbyterians; yea, I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, had but the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment voted for Independency as they did for the Presbyterie, they would have found Scripture enough then by which they would have proved that the ChriÅ¿tian MagiÅ¿trate might have forced any to come under obedience to ChriÅ¿ts yoake, and then the example of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would have beene exceedingly urged by them all, who Å¿eeking a through Reformation, would not Å¿uffer Å¿o

<pb facs="tcp:48122:19"/>
altered Religion, and have Å¿et up many new Religions, and that without any authority; yea, they have altered both Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pel, rejecting all the Holy Scriptures, and making nothing of the glorious Word of God, as can be proved, and they have not only eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by their Å¿ole authority divers Religions amongÅ¿t us that were never knowne before, but they proclame all the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians enemies of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and the Å¿ons of <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and eÅ¿teeme of them as Å¿o many Infidels in no wiÅ¿e to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with in holy things. And for the fundamentall Lawes of the Land, they not only Å¿peake againÅ¿t them as a yoake of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and bondage unÅ¿upportable to be borne, but they write whole bookes againÅ¿t them, deÅ¿iring they may be altered, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding all men injoy their lives and eÅ¿tates by them; yea, they write not only in general againÅ¿t all the laws of the land, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the very Ordinances of Parliament, daily publiÅ¿hing Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets againÅ¿t all their proceedings, and eÅ¿pecially they have taken great paines to diÅ¿mount the Ordinance of Tythes eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed both by Law and a particular Ordinance of Parliament, they would faine Å¿tarve the Presbyterians, preaching and practiÅ¿ing hourely againÅ¿t the Covenant, and many knowne Ordinances: for whereas it was by Ordinances injoyned that none Å¿hould preach publickly, but Å¿uch as were authoriÅ¿ed, and thought fit for the Å¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e of their Doctrine, and for the Å¿ufficiency of their parts and abilities; and that nothing Å¿hould be printed but by authority; notwithÅ¿tanding theÅ¿e Ordinances, the Sectaries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents both preach &amp; print whatÅ¿oever they pleaÅ¿e to the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the people, and for the perverting and corrupting of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and diÅ¿turbance both of Church and State; and whereas by an Ordinance of Parliament, the manner of government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿ting of the three States, King, Peers and Commons, hath been againe and againe confirmed, &amp; eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed with the Å¿itting of the Reverend AÅ¿Å¿embly of Divines, and the ratifying of the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and for the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing of the Presbyterian government, nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e they write againÅ¿t them all, eÅ¿pecially the King, Peers, and AÅ¿Å¿embly, making nothing of them; no nor of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Parliament to their faces; firÅ¿t the King, then the HouÅ¿e of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and then the HouÅ¿e of Lords, Å¿lighting their authority and power, affirming that they could not Å¿o much as commit any freeborne Å¿ubject to priÅ¿on which every JuÅ¿tice of peace or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿table may doe; yea, it is well knowne that in inÅ¿olency they have exceeded all Delinquents that ever appeared before the great Councell of the Kingdome; Å¿o that it may be Å¿pake to the honour both of <hi>Strafford</hi> and the <hi>Prelate</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that they both of them behaved themÅ¿elves with far greater modeÅ¿ty and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards both HouÅ¿es then many of the Sectaries have done, for they ever yeelded due honour and reverenciall reÅ¿pect unto them all, both with bowed knees, and gracefull and Å¿eeming lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; which thoÅ¿e paultry Fellowes out of an inÅ¿ulting impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency denied them, deÅ¿piÅ¿ing Dignities and Dominions; and theÅ¿e creatures have had their complices to applaud them in theÅ¿e their RebelliouspractiÅ¿es, yea Å¿ome of them have beene Å¿o bold as to petition the Parliament in their behalfe, though they could not be ignorant how unchriÅ¿tianly, unreverently, and undutifully they behaved themÅ¿elves before them, which was the greateÅ¿t affront that was ever offered to any Parliament, and the greateÅ¿t breach of the priviledge of Parliament that hath beene knowne in any nation; and yet all theÅ¿e things have beene perpetrated by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents and Sectaries, all which graceleÅ¿Å¿e proceedings the old <hi>Puritans</hi> of <hi>England</hi> abhorred, as the way of unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e. This alÅ¿o can be proved that many of their Independent itinerary preachers run from place to place, preaching againÅ¿t the Nobility and Gentry, againÅ¿t the Citie, and againÅ¿t the Reverend AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, againÅ¿t the Directory, againÅ¿t Tythes, againÅ¿t the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; yea againÅ¿t all that is called authority, and againÅ¿t all our gallant, renowned, and valiant presbyterian Å¿ouldiers, Å¿aying in their Sermons, <hi>come out yee old baÅ¿e drunken whoremaÅ¿terly rogues,</hi> Å¿hew what you have done for the Å¿afety of the Kingdome, aÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all the glory of thoÅ¿e noble victories to their owne party.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I will yet in a few things more</hi> compare the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> and the Sectaries and Independents together, before I come to Å¿peake of the prayer of that <hi>Homothumadon</hi> brother, I firÅ¿t made mention of. <hi>It is well knowne, that the old Puritans of</hi> England <hi>were all of them very zealous for the Å¿anctifying of the Lords day, and their whole imployments on that day Å¿ufficiently declared to all thoÅ¿e that were familiarly acquainted with them,</hi> that they were heavenly minded men, and Å¿uch as were truly morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and dead unto the world, who denyed unto themÅ¿elves uÅ¿ually thoÅ¿e ordinary neceÅ¿Å¿aries on that day, that at other times they would more freely partake in; <hi>they dreÅ¿Å¿ed but little meat on that day, no more then very neceÅ¿Å¿itie called for, not out of any penuriouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, but for this end,</hi> that their Å¿ervants might be eaÅ¿ed from all toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing workes, that they might the better attend upon the duties of the day; and they were eÅ¿pecially carefull, that both they and their children, with the Å¿trangers that were within their gates, Å¿hould Å¿anctifie that day; <hi>they left none of them to ramble whether they pleaÅ¿ed, they had well learned that LeÅ¿Å¿on,</hi> that they and their men-Å¿ervants and maid-Å¿ervants, with the Å¿tranger within their wals Å¿hould keepe holy the Sabbath day, <hi>and did both by themÅ¿elves and with their families take order,</hi> that no duty of the day Å¿hould be omitted, <hi>the whole day being taken up either</hi> in prayer or medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or reading of the holy Scriptures, or hearing the Word, or repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sermons, or Å¿inging of PÅ¿almes, or inÅ¿tructing and catechiÅ¿ing their Families, or in the works of charity, or viÅ¿iting the Å¿ick, or in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conference, or in reading godly books, or in performing of Å¿ome duty or other that might bring glory to God, and honour to their holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion, <hi>and their houÅ¿es were generally Å¿o well ordered, and all</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:21"/>
               <hi>things carried in Å¿uch comelineÅ¿Å¿e and decencie, as he that had beene brought up in profane company, and had accidentally lighted into owne of their houÅ¿es, would as much have wondred</hi> to Å¿ee the excellent carriage of all things there, as the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> did to behold the ordering of <hi>Solomons</hi> houÅ¿e. <hi>I may truly Å¿peake this to their immortall praiÅ¿e,</hi> that I never Å¿aw in their Families the leaÅ¿t diÅ¿order on thoÅ¿e dayes; <hi>nor never Å¿aw a FeaÅ¿t on that day, though at other times they were very free in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, and much given to HoÅ¿pitalitie, and nigardly in nothing, and commonly they cauÅ¿ed their Table-cloath to be Å¿pread on the Saturday before they went to bed, and they were carefull that all that were well in the Family Å¿hould go to Church with them, and they had a Å¿ingular care that all their Å¿ervants might have no hindrances or impediments by any worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments</hi> that might in the leaÅ¿t diÅ¿turbe them or dictract them from the duties of the day; <hi>all theÅ¿e things I can witneÅ¿Å¿e with thouÅ¿ands more beÅ¿ides my Å¿elfe,</hi> were the practices of the old Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans of <hi>England,</hi> and this was the way of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e that they walked in, for the Å¿anctifying of the Lords day.</p>
            <p>Now if the practice of the Independents and Sectaries about this buÅ¿ines and point of obedience be looked into, there will be found a vaÅ¿t difference betweene them and the old <hi>Puritans</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> for it is well knowne <hi>that they ordinarily make all their greateÅ¿t entertainments on that day, as that I Å¿pake of before</hi> for inÅ¿tance, (and many more that I could mention) <hi>where the whole Church was feaÅ¿ted to no Å¿mall diÅ¿traction to their poore and godly Å¿ervants, that were taken up with more attendance that day, then</hi> Martha <hi>was on an ordinary day in entertaining of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe,</hi> which not withÅ¿tanding hee then blamed in very godly and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Martha,</hi> who had learned to give ChriÅ¿t an honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of her faith concerning her beliefe in him; and doubtleÅ¿Å¿e if <hi>Martha</hi> were then blamed by ChriÅ¿t, and had from him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe for her too much care about many things in entertaining himÅ¿elfe; I beleevee the Independents and Sectaries will receive but little thankes at his hand for profaning his owne day, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing others to doe the Å¿ame, and for their thus breaking and viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his holy Lawes, and hindring of his Å¿ervants by their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e entertainments, from the duties of pietie and holineÅ¿Å¿e that he requires at their hands on thoÅ¿e dayes, and he will Å¿ay to them
<pb facs="tcp:48122:21"/>
at the laÅ¿t judgement, as for theÅ¿e their diÅ¿orderly walkings, Å¿o for their new and needleÅ¿Å¿e traditions, <hi>who required theÅ¿e things at your hands?</hi> nay, did I not forbid theÅ¿e things will the Lord Å¿ay? Truly it is moÅ¿t notorious that the Sectaries and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are very looÅ¿e in the Å¿anctifying of the Lords day; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of them before they fel into the way of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie were very conÅ¿cionable obÅ¿ervers of that day, and were greatly diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed with the King for granting but a toleration for Å¿ports on that day, and could then Å¿ay, <hi>that very Å¿inne alone had beene enough to bring downe the judgements of God upon the whole Land, yet Å¿ince they turned Sectaries, they can now not only feaÅ¿t and ryot on that day, but if need be work on the Å¿ame in their ordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as can be proved, and many of them that were then great zealots for the performances of all duties of holineÅ¿Å¿e that day with all their Families, now regard not that day no more then an other,</hi> nay, <hi>they let their Å¿ervants and children goe whether they pleaÅ¿e, leaving them all to the liberty</hi> (as they Å¿peake) <hi>of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences,</hi> and it is ordinarily obÅ¿erved, that all the Independents and Sectaries in the Armie, and through the whole Kingdome will frequently journey on that day, and for the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Predicants, they are trundled about on the Lords day in their Coaches with foure HorÅ¿es, needleÅ¿Å¿ely diÅ¿quieting both men and beaÅ¿ts that they have a command to give reÅ¿t unto. A Tumbrell or a Dung-cart were fitter for theÅ¿e proud and profane Fellowes to be carried about in; and if they will not leave theÅ¿e their licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious courÅ¿es, and Å¿urceaÅ¿e thus to profane the Lords day, <hi>I Å¿ee no reaÅ¿on but that the MagiÅ¿trate Å¿hould take Å¿ome order with them, and puniÅ¿h them for profaning it, it being not only againÅ¿t the Lawes of God, but contrary unto the Lawes of the Land.</hi> It may be that is one of the Lawes that the Sectaries would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated and made null; for moÅ¿t certaine it is <hi>their practiÅ¿es are both contrary to that Law, and the knowne Law of God, and the practiÅ¿e of all the old Puritans of</hi> England, <hi>and therefore the way of Independency in this point alÅ¿o is not the way of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, but of profaneÅ¿Å¿e and licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, neither are they overgrowne Puritans in this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Å¿eeing I have upon this occaÅ¿ion, began to compare the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> with the Independents and Sectaries, who their Predicants aÅ¿Å¿ert are but the <hi>old Puritans over-growne,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:22"/>
               <hi>that is, ChriÅ¿tians in all respects, tranÅ¿cending them in all duties of piety and godlineÅ¿Å¿e, and in all offices of Love and Charity towards others, and in the whole frame of their lives and converÅ¿ations, and for their uprightneÅ¿Å¿e and honeÅ¿ty in their dealings, and for their Å¿incerity in all their actions, and for their moderation in the temperate uÅ¿e of all the creatures, and for their humble walking towards others.</hi> I Å¿hall briefly here Å¿et downe the practices of the old Puritans concerning Å¿ome of theÅ¿e particulars, and paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel them with the proceedings of the Independents and Sectaries of our times.</p>
            <p>It is Å¿ufficiently knowne, that the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> ever loved and honoured all the Orthodox, faithfull, painefull, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Preachers of the Word of God through the Land, whether ConformiÅ¿ts or non-ConformiÅ¿ts, and they never thought they could yeeld them reverence enough, and were willing at any time to the uttermoÅ¿t of their abilities to relieve and Å¿upply them with all neceÅ¿Å¿ary accomodations, for the Å¿upport of themÅ¿elves, and their Families, and they were Å¿o farre from taking from them any thing, or hindring them of their dues, either in reÅ¿pect of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or maintenance; that they would run and ride in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe for the maintaining of their reputations and livelyhoods, <hi>and if at any time they had beene oppreÅ¿Å¿ed by the power and tyrannie of the Prelates in any Court, or by any wicked enemies of the Church, they had the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, and ever the good word of the old Puritans, and their prayers, and their purÅ¿es to Å¿upport them, and Å¿ustaine both them and their Families; they were never knowne to deÅ¿ert them, or to give them an ill word;</hi> and this was the carriage of the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> towards their godly and painfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters of all Å¿orts, and they never favoured any hereticall, and Å¿chiÅ¿maticall Teachers, and this was that way of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e they walked in.</p>
            <p>Now if we looke upon the practices of the Independents and Sectaries they are chiefeÅ¿t enemies of all the painefull and godly MiniÅ¿ters through the Kingdome, and the only friends of all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, Å¿chiÅ¿maticall and hereticall Preachers, Å¿o that it is well knowne, they doe not only reproach, and abuÅ¿e them in words, calling them <hi>Baals</hi> PrieÅ¿ts, the limbs of AntichriÅ¿t, and the Devils MiniÅ¿ters, and a thouÅ¿and Å¿uch ignominious names, but Å¿o perÅ¿ecute them in word and deeds that they cannot Å¿afely dwell

by them where there is any number of the Sectaries; yea, there is Å¿carce a Committee through the Kingdome where they have not perÅ¿ecuted their moÅ¿t faithfull MiniÅ¿ters, yea <hi>it is their chiefe deÅ¿igne to take away their Tythes from them, and to deprive them of their Livings, by which they Å¿hould Å¿upport themÅ¿elvs, and their poor Families, and they have made the lives of many of them Å¿o irkeÅ¿ome unto them, and Å¿o wearied them with their calumnies and carriage towards them, that though they highly honoured them before they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sectaries, yet after that, they became their mortall enemies,</hi> and for no other reaÅ¿on but that they continued Å¿till to preach thoÅ¿e or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox doctrines they had formerly taught, &amp; inveighed againÅ¿t the dangerous and blaÅ¿phemous opinions that were now preached up every where by the Seducers of theÅ¿e times, &amp; for this cauÅ¿e alone, and for no other ground they have wearied many of them out of their very lives, and forced others to leave their places of their habitations; many preÅ¿idents of this kind I could produce, but one I cannot but inÅ¿tance, and that is of one MaÅ¿ter <hi>Beton</hi> of <hi>Rye,</hi> in <hi>SuÅ¿Å¿ex,</hi> a moÅ¿t painefull, orthodox, and laborious Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and a man of no Å¿mall fame, as well for his godly life, and diligence in his MiniÅ¿try, as for his Å¿ingular knowledge in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and all the orientall tongues, and yet this man every way Å¿o unblameable and accompliÅ¿hed, did the Sectaries joyning with all the Malignants of that place, drive from his habitation there. The ful Å¿tory of that particular buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e would make a pretty larg book, which would Å¿ad the hearts of all Å¿uch as are truly godly, to hear <hi>that any that pretend unto ChriÅ¿tian Religion Å¿hould practiÅ¿e Å¿o contrary unto all ChriÅ¿tian principles and the practice of the old Puritans of ENGLAND;</hi> and yet what thoÅ¿e Sectaries of <hi>Rye</hi> with their complices have done againÅ¿t that godly and learned MiniÅ¿ter, is generally practiced by all the other Sectaries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents through the Kingdome, as can Å¿ufficiently be proved, <hi>who generally implacably hate thoÅ¿e that they have formerly loved, and have Å¿till a cauÅ¿e to honour; as who next under God have been a means of their converÅ¿ion, if ever they were really converted:</hi> So that in theÅ¿e their proceedings, <hi>they are not the old Puritans of ENGLAND overgrown, which walked in the way of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e in honouring their faithfull MiniÅ¿ters according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> 1 TheÅ¿Å¿. 5. <hi>and</hi> Heb. 13.

               <hi>And as for their charity and practice of love, and their integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Å¿incere dealing towards their brethren, the old Puritans of</hi> ENGLAND <hi>were famous for their re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I could Å¿ay much upon my own experience, how many of the Sectaries Å¿eemed not a little to honour me, and Å¿pake as well of me as of any man living, before they Å¿aw they could not prevaile with me to be of their mind, nor to favour them in their erroneous opinions; but as Å¿oon as they perceived <hi>that I was immoveable in my reÅ¿olution, their love turned into implacable hatred,</hi> as it is well known. And I am confident there might be thouÅ¿ands of preÅ¿idents produced of the like nature, many of which I know; yea <hi>I</hi> may truly Å¿ay this, that I have not known any Presbyterian now living that was formerly familiarly acquainted with any that afterward turn'd Sectary or Independent (notwithÅ¿tanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever courteÅ¿ies they had formerly received from them) that have not either betrayed him or done him Å¿ome ill office after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or at leaÅ¿t would never do him the leaÅ¿t kindneÅ¿Å¿e, though he were in need, or Å¿hew him any favour; So that in this point of love and charity, <hi>they walk not in the way of the old Puritans, who were kind to all men and Å¿incere towards thoÅ¿e they had famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:23"/>
               <hi>converÅ¿ed with, it never being known that they betrayed any of them or did them any ill offices;</hi> and therefore in this point alÅ¿o, <hi>the way of Independency is not the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e nor the way of the old Puritans of ENGLAND, but the way of treachery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e and unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to inÅ¿tance the practices and wayes of the old Puritans in a few things more, and then to compare them with the wayes of the Independents and Sectaries.</p>
            <p>The old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> as all can witneÅ¿Å¿e that knew them, <hi>were all of them generally men no way addicted to the pleaÅ¿ures of the world, and in their apparell and outward garbe commonly they were ever out of faÅ¿hion: It</hi> was, to my knowledg, counted a great Å¿in amongÅ¿t them, <hi>to exceed in apparrell, or to be faÅ¿hionably clad, or to go with long hair, or RufÅ¿ian<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>like, or to be Å¿een in gorgeous attire;</hi> You Å¿hould rarely or Å¿eldome behold any gold or Å¿ilver lace on any of their apparrell, except they had been of noble Parentage, or of Å¿ome very great and rich Families, or in Å¿ome eminent place of authority, <hi>and that was alwayes very sparing;</hi> and for cuffs at their hands, not one of a thouÅ¿and of the old Puritans were ever Å¿een in any; and if they at any time upon any feÅ¿tivity, or at any Å¿olemn entertainment, or upon Å¿uch like occaÅ¿ion appeared in any, <hi>they were commonly Å¿uch little Å¿uck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones as a man could Å¿carÅ¿e diÅ¿cern them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if you look upon all the Independents generally through Town and Country, though they were never born to any eÅ¿tates, nor were of any repute, <hi>till that out of the ruines of the Kingdome by their SectariÅ¿me and indirect dealings they have attained to Å¿ome wealth; You Å¿hall find them the only gallants of the world, Å¿o that one that Å¿hould meet them would take them for Roarers and Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans rather then Saints;</hi> Yea you Å¿hall find them with cuffs, and thoÅ¿e great ones, at their very heels, and with more Å¿ilver and gold upon their clothes, and at their heels (for thoÅ¿e upÅ¿tarts muÅ¿t now be in their Å¿ilver Å¿purs) then many great and honourable perÅ¿ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have in their purÅ¿es; Å¿o that thoÅ¿e that behold them, if they knew them not, <hi>would take them to be the Gentry and Peers of the Kingdome rather then a company of obÅ¿cure fellows,</hi> in Å¿o much that Å¿ome taking notice of the great change in this Kingdome Å¿aid not long Å¿ince, <hi>that Gentlemen and Noblemen were become beggers, and beggers were become Lords and Gentlemen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:24"/>
Truly the like pride in apparell was never Å¿een amongÅ¿t Å¿uch as made profeÅ¿Å¿ion of Religion before theÅ¿e our times; <hi>Whereas the old Puritans of ENGLAND, both men and women, were all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿tly cladd and attired, and went very plain, and thought it rather a Å¿candall to Religion to be attired or cladd in the leaÅ¿t manner after the faÅ¿hion of the Court, then for an honour to their profeÅ¿Å¿ion;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> have known them blame thoÅ¿e that abhorred all pride as much as any men did, and onely for that they went handÅ¿omely cladd and apparrelled, although it were onely for the gracing of their profeÅ¿Å¿ion, as they then told them, for the which they were at that time Å¿ufferers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that if thoÅ¿e people were now alive, thoÅ¿e old Puritans, and Å¿hould Å¿ee our Sectaries and Independents who predicate themÅ¿elves to be</hi> the onely Saints, <hi>thoÅ¿e good old Puritans would lift up their hands with admiration, and Å¿ay, as one of</hi> New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>Å¿aid not long Å¿ince Å¿eeing a brother of his coming over thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very gallant whom he had known live in a meaner condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that in beholding him he thought he Å¿aw one of the Å¿even won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the world, and profest that he believed they would ere long grow mad with pride in Old ENGLAND, Å¿aying moreover that in his time (he having then been but ten years in New England) he that Å¿hould have been Å¿een go in thoÅ¿e faÅ¿hions the Sectaries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents uÅ¿ually and daily now go in, would have been thought to have had little Religion in him, and he exceedingly marvelled at the liberty all thoÅ¿e of the Congregationall way now take, <hi>Å¿aying,</hi> that he much Å¿uspected their Å¿incerity that now made that a vertue and counted that an honour to Religion which the old Puritans of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> deemed a diÅ¿honour to God, and a diÅ¿grace and diÅ¿honour to their holy profeÅ¿Å¿ion. <hi>So that in this point alÅ¿o,</hi> the practices and way of the Sectaries is not the way of the old Puritans of England and the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>it being the way of vanity and the world, and contrary unto the command of the ApoÅ¿tle Saint</hi> Paul <hi>Rom. 12. ver. 2, 3, 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again whereas the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> had their fare, diet, and houÅ¿hold<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>Å¿tuffe, how rich in eÅ¿tate Å¿oever they were, according to their Å¿everall degrees, were it a Yeoman or but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gentleman, or a Knight, they ever obÅ¿erved their rank; whatÅ¿oever, I Å¿ay, or how great Å¿oever the eÅ¿tates of each of them were; the Yeoman had his houÅ¿e furniÅ¿hed and fared like a Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:48122:24"/>
and not like a Gentleman; the Gentleman he alÅ¿o fared like a Gentleman, and had his houÅ¿e furniÅ¿hed accordingly, and not like a Knight; the Knight in like manner fared like a Knight, and had his houÅ¿e furniÅ¿hed according to his rank, and not like a Lord; All the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> every one of them out of conÅ¿cience obÅ¿erved and kept their rank, <hi>and lived and fared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that degree and order God had placed them in this world, and uÅ¿ed their Å¿uperfluity for the clothing of the naked, and feeding of the neceÅ¿Å¿itated, and relieving of the poor,</hi> many of the which rich Yeomen, Gentlemen, and Knights <hi>I</hi> could name, Å¿ome of the which to my knowledge layed by yearly out of their eÅ¿tates and revenues Å¿ome two hundred pounds, Å¿ome three hundred, yea Å¿ome five hundred pounds all their life time, <hi>which they Å¿ent to the godly Ministers here and there diÅ¿perÅ¿ed through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be diÅ¿tributed amongst the poor and neceÅ¿Å¿itated ChriÅ¿tians in thoÅ¿e parts, and this was the practice of the old rich Puritans of ENGLAND;</hi> yea, <hi>many of them maintained a preaching ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Minister in Å¿ome blind corner of the Kingdome at their own charges;</hi> others of them <hi>alwaies entertained one Å¿ilenced MiniÅ¿ter or other, or took poor neceÅ¿Å¿itated Christians children into their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and bred them as their own:</hi> I can Å¿peak much to the praiÅ¿e of God and to many of their immortall honours upon my own experience concerning <hi>the charity of the old Puritans of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,</hi> who ever kept their ranks, whatÅ¿oever their wealth and riches were, and would never exceed in houÅ¿hold-Å¿tuffe, in fare, or diet, whatÅ¿oever their hoÅ¿pitality was; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding was many times very great; and this order and decency they obÅ¿erved out of conÅ¿cience, and that they might the better relieve the neceÅ¿Å¿ities of others; <hi>and this was the way the old Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans of ENGLAND, to my knowledge, walked in, and this was the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e as approved on and commanded by God himÅ¿elfe, and yet the old Puritans of ENGLAND knew their ChriÅ¿tian liberty and what right they had to the creature, as well as any Sectary or Independent in our times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we compare the Independents and Sectaries, in reÅ¿pect of this cuÅ¿tome, with the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> we Å¿hall not find them <hi>the old Puritans of ENGLAND overgrown,</hi> that is, <hi>to exceed them in all theÅ¿e graces of charity, wiÅ¿dome, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, frugality, and orderly walking every one according to</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:25"/>
               <hi>that rank and Å¿tation God hath placed them in:</hi> for the Sectaries have all of them changed this ancient cuÅ¿tome and way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and are all run, as in their opinions, into the way of error, Å¿o in this, into the by<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>path of luxury and Å¿enÅ¿uality: So that the Sectaries generally, although the greateÅ¿t part of them through the Kingdome as it is well known, are Å¿uch <hi>as are but newly Å¿prung up out of the ruines of the State, and that were never borne to any thing,</hi> yea many of them, before the troubles of the Kingdome, <hi>having Å¿carce bread to put in their mouths;</hi> yet now are grown to Å¿uch a height of pride and luxury and Å¿umptuoÅ¿ity, that you Å¿hall find their houÅ¿es furniÅ¿hed rather like Noblemen and Peers, then ordinary men; and ye Å¿hall Å¿ee more plate in their dwellings, and all things with more bravery and elegancy, <hi>then in the pallaces of the Grandees of the Earth;</hi> and their fare and dietis Å¿o delicious, and Å¿et out with Å¿uch curioÅ¿ity of cookery and all things corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pondent to it, in reÅ¿pect of all Å¿orts of wines and dilicacies and whatÅ¿oever rarities the Å¿eaÅ¿ons and time of the year will afford, as they exceed the very Princes of the world, by report of thoÅ¿e that have been at their entertainments; Å¿o that <hi>Dives</hi> in all his glory exceeded them not. Yea, it is well known and can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>that many of them that were never born to three halfpence a year of inheritance, nor never were worth any thing but what they have got in theÅ¿e troubleÅ¿ome times by the ruines and miÅ¿eries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that theÅ¿e very fellows <hi>are taÅ¿ters to all the Noblemen and Peers of the Kingdome:</hi> And their very Predicants are grown Å¿o dainty that they muÅ¿t be Å¿erved before the Lords and mighty rich men in all markets; for they will outbid the greateÅ¿t of them for the Å¿atisfying of their pallates: So that whatÅ¿oever rarities, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Å¿everall Å¿eaÅ¿ons of the year, whether from Å¿ea or land, are Å¿tirring, they are ordinarily the men that have the firÅ¿t <hi>guÅ¿to</hi> of them; So that they exceed the daintyeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t delicate Dames and Ladies, by the relation of thoÅ¿e that are acquainted with their diets; Å¿o that all fine things are taÅ¿ted and eat in their houÅ¿es before they are Å¿o much as heard of in Noblemens Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whereas the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> denyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves all theÅ¿e things, who were uÅ¿ually, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>the firÅ¿t that were laÅ¿t Å¿erved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I have heard affirmed by great Gentlemen and travellers, very gallant men, that were Å¿ometime very intimate with the
<pb facs="tcp:48122:25"/>
Sectaries and Independents, whoÅ¿e familiarity they made uÅ¿e of onely to pry into their Å¿everall humours, and whom the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had Å¿ome hope to have gained to their party; and therefore <hi>Å¿pared not in their entertainments;</hi> theÅ¿e very Gentlemen, <hi>I</hi> Å¿ay, have aÅ¿Å¿erted unto me, <hi>that whatÅ¿oever things were thought Å¿ome ten years Å¿ince to be rarities in all Princes, Dukes, MarqueÅ¿Å¿es, and Noblemens houÅ¿es, and were rarely to be found in any other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they met dayly with them in every ordinary Independent and Sectaries houÅ¿e upon all occaÅ¿ions;</hi> So that they vowed unto me, they thought them the onely <hi>HelieogabaliÅ¿ts</hi> in the world, and the greateÅ¿t <hi>SenÅ¿ualiÅ¿ts;</hi> and they obÅ¿erved that generally there was more luxurious entertainments now amongÅ¿t them in theÅ¿e times that called for mourning and faÅ¿ting, then ever were in the richeÅ¿t Subjects houÅ¿es in the times of the Kingdomes proÅ¿perity; So that if ever there were a generation of men in the world that in their fulneÅ¿Å¿e of bread and in their felicity forgot the afflictions of <hi>JoÅ¿eph,</hi> they were the Independents and Sectaries who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes feaÅ¿ting, which was one of the principall cauÅ¿es, as they profeÅ¿t unto me, that made them beleeve <hi>they were not the onely Saints, their actions being Å¿o unÅ¿aint-like;</hi> which made them alÅ¿o pry farther into their dealings and proceedings, which they found <hi>to be altogether contrary unto the royall law of Love:</hi> for as they Å¿aid, all their charity was ever limited within the confines of their own fraternity, and to Å¿uch onely as were either of their party or they had hopes to gain; in all which things they are different from the old Puritans of <hi>ENGLAND, who walked in that way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e which teacheth every man a moderation and right uÅ¿e of the creature, and to keep within their bounds, and to extend their charity towards all, especially towards the poor and indigent;</hi> and not to Å¿pend all upon themÅ¿elves in luxury and vanity, and that at Å¿uch times as call for mourning and faÅ¿ting, and when there are Å¿uch multitudes of diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed godly families as are drove from houÅ¿e and home and have been made a prey to the Å¿poilers, whom the Sectaries will Å¿ee lie famiÅ¿hing in the Å¿treets, rather then they Å¿hall receive the leaÅ¿t reliefe from them, unleÅ¿Å¿e they will become of their fraternity, which many of them to my knowledge out of meer neceÅ¿Å¿ity were forced to be, or elÅ¿e they could not have had the leaÅ¿t reliefe from them, <hi>which is not the way of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and that way God hath chalked out through his holy Word
<pb facs="tcp:48122:26"/>
for all his Saints and Servants to walk in, Å¿aying, that they Å¿hould always have the poor amongÅ¿t them, and that their charity Å¿hould be extended to all; and therefore commands all his Å¿ervants <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. ver. 48. <hi>to be perfect as their heavenly father is perfect,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 44, 45, 46, 47. injoyning them, <hi>That they Å¿hould love their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and bleÅ¿Å¿e them that curÅ¿e them, and do good to them that hate them, and pray for them that despightfully uÅ¿e them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ecute them.</hi> And telling all his Å¿ervants, <hi>That by their Å¿o doing, they Å¿hall Å¿hew themÅ¿elves to be children indeed of their heavenly father, who makes his Sun to riÅ¿e on the evill and on the good, and Å¿endeth rain on the just and on the unjuÅ¿t;</hi> Å¿aying, <hi>If you love them only that love you, what reward have you?

<pb facs="tcp:48122:26"/>
replyed and anÅ¿wered, <hi>that they had enough to relieve of their own,</hi> telling them, that they Å¿hould go to thoÅ¿e that were of their own party, and to the Collectors in every pariÅ¿h; Å¿aying, that they muÅ¿t have a care of Å¿uch as were in Church fellowÅ¿hip with them; and thus they have Å¿hut up all bowels of compaÅ¿Å¿ion to all thoÅ¿e that are of a different opinion from themÅ¿elves, eÅ¿pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all thoÅ¿e that are of the Presbyterian way, as can be proved by innumerable witneÅ¿Å¿es. Yea, they are come to Å¿uch a height of indignation againÅ¿t the Presbyterians, and Å¿o far they are from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving any of them, as they will wiÅ¿h their ruine, <hi>and this is the way the Sectaries now walk in, which is not the way of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e nor of the old Puritans of ENGLAND;</hi> for the way of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e</hi> is, <hi>that they Å¿hould love their enemies, and do good to them that hate them.</hi>

            <p>Now all the Independents Å¿ay that the Presbyterians hate them, for Å¿o in their very prayers they intimate to God himÅ¿elfe, that I may now returne to that prayer I formerly mentioned made by the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Brother at the great VeniÅ¿on FeaÅ¿t on the Lords day in one of the grand Sectaries houÅ¿es, where all their Church was entertained: He in his prayer Å¿pake unto God in this manner, <hi>Lord</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>they (meaning the Presbyterians) hate us, becauÅ¿e we know more of thee then they doe; we beÅ¿eech thee Lord give us to know yet more of thee, and then let them hate us more if they will,</hi> &amp;c. Here we Å¿ee they complaine unto God himÅ¿elfe (though falÅ¿ely) that we hate them; now if they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the way of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e that God hath appointed them to walke in, they Å¿hould doe us good and pray for us, and not be Å¿o uncharitable as to pray againÅ¿t us, and to requite evill for evill, which is the way they walke in, and which was not the way of the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> who had better learned their LeÅ¿Å¿on of love and charity. But now to conÅ¿ider this prayer a little, and Å¿ome other of their expreÅ¿Å¿ions, and the high prayÅ¿es that upon all occaÅ¿ions they give of themÅ¿elves, by all which it will yet the better appeare that they are not the old <hi>Puritans of</hi> England <hi>over-grown in goodneÅ¿Å¿e, and exceeding them in Å¿elfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and in all points of piety, godlineÅ¿Å¿e, and charity, and in truth and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e;</hi> for this very prayer of theirs, with their other Å¿peeches and practices, proclame to the world the quite contrary; for I affirme, firÅ¿t that the old Puritans never
<pb facs="tcp:48122:27"/>
magnified their owne graces: And Å¿econdly, that both this prayer and many of their other prayers to God, &amp; prayÅ¿es of themÅ¿elves, are both untrue, PhariÅ¿aicall and uncharitable; for the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians doe not hate them, as they falÅ¿ely accuÅ¿e them, but it is they that hate the Presbyterians, as all their words and actions, and Pamphlets can teÅ¿tifie. The Presbyterians as they are bound, hate all falÅ¿e wayes, but they hate not the perÅ¿ons of any, that is the practice of all the Sectaries, as it is well knowne. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Brother Å¿aid, that they knew more of God then the Presbyterians, it is moÅ¿t falÅ¿e; for all the workes and writings of the Presbyterians in all the Reformed Churches can prove and witneÅ¿Å¿e the contrary, Å¿o that the Sectaries are all of them beholding to the learned Workes and Writings of the Presbyterians for all that is in any of them worthy the name of knowledge, out of whoÅ¿e learned Bookes they have Å¿tole it; and I undertake it, and Å¿hall ever by the grace of God be able to make it good, that in all their preachments they deliver nothing that can deÅ¿ervedly be called truth, but it hath beene taught by the Presbyterians before they were borne, and that far better then any of them can teach it; and it is moÅ¿t certaine that there is more knowledge in Å¿ome one of <hi>Calvins</hi> Workes, as that of his <hi>InÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi> then is in all the Independents and Sectaries put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which very Booke alone, with the Holy Scripture had it beene diligently read and Å¿tudied by the people, the Independents and Sectaries, with all their plots and devices could never have gained an hundred ProÅ¿elytes.

But Å¿hould I grant unto theÅ¿e men (which were wickedneÅ¿Å¿e in me to doe) that they did truly and indeed preach JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and free grace, yet to Å¿ay that they preached them more clearly, more fully, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ever they were formerly taught, is not farre from blaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and exceedingly injurious and derogatory to the holy Scripture; for all knowledge that wee are to take notice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and ChriÅ¿t, is Å¿hut up and contained in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, out of whoÅ¿e confines we are not to Å¿eeke for any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning either God or ChriÅ¿t; for wee have a Å¿peciall command given us by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>to Å¿earch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and we are Å¿ent to <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and the Prophets by Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Luke</hi> 16. 29. and in the 8. of <hi>IÅ¿aiah, wee are Å¿ent to the Law and the teÅ¿timony,</hi> Å¿o that they that Å¿peake <hi>not according to that word, it is becauÅ¿e there is no light in them;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Galat.</hi> 8, 9.

               <pb facs="tcp:48122:29"/>
If this be the knowledge the Sectaries vaunt Å¿o much of, and if theÅ¿e be the things they pretend they have received <hi>from the mind and boÅ¿ome of the Father,</hi> I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e in theÅ¿e their notions they out-Å¿trip the knowledge of the Saints of old, and of all the holy Prophets and ApoÅ¿tles, and of the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> who were ignorant of them all, which was a learned ignorance in them, knowing that God the Father taught a far different do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to his people, as I Å¿hewed a little before, and Å¿hall more fully declare in the inÅ¿uing DiÅ¿courÅ¿e. But this I will againe and againe aÅ¿Å¿ert, that neither the old Puritans of <hi>England,</hi> nor our godly Presbyterians now, are inferiour to any of the Sectaries for an holy and conÅ¿cionable outward walking in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ation, or in the knowledge of God or of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, or in any kind of knowledge that may truly be called learning or Å¿cience, whatÅ¿oever the Independents and Sectaries may glory and boaÅ¿t of themÅ¿elvs; &amp; I do farther aÅ¿Å¿ert that al the godly Presbyters in the church of <hi>England</hi> do preach JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, faith &amp; repentance, and free grace, and that in every Congregation upon all occaÅ¿ions more orthodoxly, Å¿olidly, Å¿incerely and learnedly, with all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall divinity, then ever any of the Sectaries did or can doe; and therefore they do not know more of God then the Presbyterians doe, as that <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Brother phariÅ¿aically and falÅ¿ely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and all the Sectaries with him vaunt. So that I Å¿ee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on why wee may not here make uÅ¿e of the ApoÅ¿tle Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words concerning this buÅ¿ines, who in the Å¿econd of the <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. v. 7. 12. 18. <hi>Doe you looke on things after the outward appearance</hi> (Å¿aith he)? <hi>if any man truÅ¿ts to himÅ¿elfe that hee is ChriÅ¿t's, let him of himÅ¿elfe thinke this againe, that as he is ChriÅ¿t's, even Å¿o are wee ChriÅ¿t's. For we doe not make our Å¿elves of the number, or compare our Å¿elves with Å¿ome that commend themÅ¿elvs, but they meaÅ¿uring themÅ¿elves by themÅ¿elves, and comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves are not wiÅ¿e (or underÅ¿tand not) for not he that commendeth himÅ¿elfe is approved, but whom the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth.</hi> So that it Å¿eemes by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, not only in this EpiÅ¿tle but in others, that the falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles and Seducers of his time had Å¿ome high eÅ¿teeme of themÅ¿elves, and of their own holineÅ¿Å¿e, knowledge and abilities above others, yea above the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves, as the Independents and Sectaries of our times have of their great piety and Å¿ufficiencie above their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

as all their words, Pamphlets and Vindications daily wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, in which they Å¿light all that oppoÅ¿e their novelties, and Å¿tile them vaine men, and Å¿uch as neither know what to Å¿ay, norhow to hold their peace, vilifying them all as the off-Å¿couring, and things of nought, which practice of theirs when it was blamed in the falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles as Å¿infull, it cannot be prayÅ¿e-worthy in the Sectaries now in our times, who walke in that way of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e falÅ¿e Teachers then did, and contrary to that rule preÅ¿cribed by God, <hi>which is to preferre others before themÅ¿elves in honour,</hi> which way the old Puritans of <hi>England</hi> walked in, and not in the way of the falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles, and the Sectaries of our times; for they kept the road way, and the royall way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>eÅ¿teeming of their brethren better then of themÅ¿elves.</hi> But the world was never without Å¿uch a Å¿ort of men: for <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Å¿peaks of the like, <hi>There is a generation of men</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>and how lofty are their eyes, and their eye-lids lifted up?</hi> and of Å¿uch creatures Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, <hi>ver.</hi> 22 which made him compare himÅ¿elfe with them after this maner; <hi>are they Hebrewes?</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>Å¿o am I; are they IÅ¿raelites? Å¿o am I; are they the Å¿eed of</hi> Abraham? <hi>Å¿o am I; are they the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t?</hi> I Å¿peake (Å¿aith he) <hi>as a foole, I am more,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the holy ApoÅ¿tle laughs at theÅ¿e Å¿educers and vaine boaÅ¿ters, and to make them more aÅ¿hamed, he compares himÅ¿elfe with them, not fearing to be counted a Jeerer and Å¿corner of piety and religion, though hee made himÅ¿elfe merry with them, whom he knew very well for all the Å¿hewes they made of being the MiniÅ¿ters of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, that they were a company of ImpoÅ¿tors, and therefore aÅ¿Å¿imilates and likens them to the Devill; for the which if he had lived in our times hee would have been termed a boyÅ¿terous and froward Å¿pirited man, Å¿hameleÅ¿Å¿e, deÅ¿erving the name of <hi>Creten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿is,</hi> againÅ¿t whom there would have come out many vindications, telling him that it became not the gravity and wiÅ¿dom of old age, and an old profeÅ¿Å¿or of Religion to charge, and that publickly, his brethren of unworthy double dealing, and unfaithfulneÅ¿Å¿e, though they were all guilty of thoÅ¿e crimes. And therefore I Å¿ee no reaÅ¿on why any godly conÅ¿cientious man Å¿hould now fear to uÅ¿e the Å¿ame method with the deceivers and Å¿educers of theÅ¿e our times, that <hi>Paul</hi> did with thoÅ¿e in his dayes, and to laugh at them; for it would be an abuÅ¿e of gravity to Å¿pend it upon them who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

Å¿o are the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; are they IÅ¿raelites? the people that wrestle with God day and night by prayers and Å¿upplications, and by groanes of the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and teares prevaile with God? Å¿o doe the Presbyterians; are they the Å¿eed of</hi> Abraham? <hi>the children of the faithfull, and doe they walke in</hi> Abrahams <hi>Å¿teps? Å¿o are the Presbyterians as well the children of the faithfull as they, and walke as carefully, conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouÅ¿ly, and unblamably in all manner of converÅ¿ation before God and towards all men; and therefore in nothing inferiour to them, if the Sectaries and Independents be really and indeed Å¿uch as they pretend to be; are the Independent Predicants and Pastors, Ministers of Christ? I may truly Å¿ay the Presbyterian Ministers are more, as having had the honour of the converÅ¿ion of them all, the Å¿eale of true Ministers, if they were ever truly converted, and of many hundred thouÅ¿ands beÅ¿ides, and they are more orthodox Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; yea, Å¿uch as Å¿tood to their MiniÅ¿try faithfully, and indured the heate and brunt of the day, when all the MiniÅ¿ters of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here my brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿eems to deÅ¿ire that he and <hi>I</hi> may try out the truth of what <hi>I</hi> have written by the dint of the Å¿word of the Scripture: and I Å¿ay as <hi>David</hi> did in another Å¿enÅ¿e, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 9.) <hi>There is none like that;</hi> but he immediately forÅ¿akes that weapon and betakes himÅ¿elfe to <hi>Phocions hatchet,</hi> and that is his Pole-ax. Truly I exceedingly pity him, <hi>who Å¿trives to maintain a way that brings him into Å¿uch a Å¿traight that he cannot cut in two the arguments brought againÅ¿t him without a hatchet:</hi> whereas the Sword of the holy Scripture is Å¿harp enough <hi>to cut in two with one Å¿troke any erroneous arguments:</hi> For <hi>the Word of God is quick and powerfull, and Å¿harper then any two-edged Å¿word, piercing even to the dividing aÅ¿under of Å¿oul and spirit, and of the joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is a diÅ¿coverer of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. But he knowing very well, <hi>that with the Å¿word of the Å¿pirit</hi> (which is the Word of God <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 17.) <hi>though it be a two-edged Å¿word,</hi> &amp;c. that he could never cut in two with that weapon my arguments, the truth and Å¿trength of them being drawn out of the Word of God upon which I have grounded all my aÅ¿Å¿ertions, which is a Å¿ure unmoveable and impregnable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; therefore laying aÅ¿ide the Å¿word of the Scripture, <hi>he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours with an unknown hatchet</hi> (a deÅ¿perate carnall weapon) and to pleaÅ¿e himÅ¿elf he aÅ¿Å¿ays <hi>to chop, hack and mangle my arguments,</hi> which he is never able to cut in two with all his Å¿trength and Å¿trokes. Surely none but a bad cauÅ¿e, and an unwarrantable way had need to make uÅ¿e of Å¿uch a weapon.</p>
            <p>Now for the Presbyterians, as their way is warrantable being grounded on the holy Scripture, the good Word of God, the practice of the ApoÅ¿tles, and all the Churches conÅ¿tituted by them; Å¿o <hi>the weapons of their warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of Å¿trong holds,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4. And for my part, I am reÅ¿olved never to uÅ¿e any other but that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly weapon (the Å¿harp Å¿word of the Å¿pirit) for the hewing and pulling down of all the Å¿trong holds of the Independents and
<pb facs="tcp:48122:33"/>
               <hi>Sectaries, and for the dividing and cutting in two all their errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions,</hi> and by the help of my God and through the power of his might and by his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting grace I Å¿hall never doubt, but by the dint of that Å¿word ever be able to try it out with my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all thoÅ¿e of his fraternity, and to oppoÅ¿e any adverÅ¿aries of the truth, and to make no long work of it, and alwayes to be Å¿ufficiently armed to maintain it and all the wayes of God which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Å¿uffered for, and still continue to hold forth and perÅ¿evere to walk in.</p>
            <p>Now before <hi>I</hi> conclude, <hi>I</hi> cannot but Å¿peak Å¿omething upon this occaÅ¿ion concerning <hi>Phocion</hi> whom my brother <hi>Burton</hi> makes mention of, that <hi>I</hi> may informe the Reader a little of the truth of that Å¿tory, and to Å¿hew that he is miÅ¿taken concerning that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbiall Å¿peech; but how fitly it belongs unto my brother <hi>Burton</hi> the Å¿equell of the diÅ¿courÅ¿e will declare. Now he repreÅ¿ents this <hi>Phocion</hi> to the world as if he had bin Å¿uch another creatures as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> was, and that as he had his club by which he did many pretty feals, Å¿o he Å¿peaks of <hi>Phocion</hi> as if he had had his hatchet likewiÅ¿e. But <hi>EraÅ¿mus</hi> a man better skill'd in all HiÅ¿tories and in the Annals of the times, then my brother <hi>Burton</hi> or any of his way, who are for the moÅ¿t part Å¿trangers and enemies to all good litterature, out of <hi>DemoÅ¿thenes</hi> Å¿etting down the truth of that Å¿tory, <hi>deÅ¿cribes</hi> Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion <hi>to have been Å¿ome Sectary in PhiloÅ¿ophie, but yet Å¿uch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall and worthleÅ¿Å¿e one, that</hi> DemoÅ¿thenes <hi>speaking of him, Å¿aith, That</hi> Phocions <hi>Arguments were Å¿o far from having any Å¿trength or validity in them to perÅ¿wade any man to imbrace his doctrine and opinion, that by the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of them and the contradicting of himÅ¿elfe and the fond handling of the controverÅ¿ie, he affirmeth, that</hi> Phocion <hi>was his own executioner, and the only hatchet of his own Arguments, and who oppoÅ¿ed, yea overthrew his own principles: Phocion (Å¿aith</hi> DemoÅ¿thenes) <hi>is his own hatchet to deÅ¿troy and cut in Å¿under his own Arguments.</hi> The words of <hi>EraÅ¿mus</hi> relating that Å¿tory are theÅ¿e, <hi>In adagiis</hi> EraÅ¿mi <hi>printed</hi> Hanoviae M. D. C. XVII. <hi>fol.</hi> 485. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> (Å¿aith he) Phocionem <hi>appellare Å¿olet Å¿uorum Argumentorum Å¿ecurim.</hi> Thus <hi>EraÅ¿mus</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿eth him Å¿elf touching that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e. And this is the true Å¿tory concerning that matter in <hi>DemoÅ¿thenes,</hi> who makes <hi>Phocion the hatchet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of his own Arguments.</hi> Now my brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿peaks of <hi>Phocion,</hi> as if indeed he had been armed with Å¿uch a weapon to
<pb facs="tcp:48122:33"/>
incounter his enemies withall, which was nothing Å¿o. But the Å¿tory may truly be verified in my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> who is indeed like <hi>Phocion</hi> and is his own executioner and the very hatchet of his own arguments, that really divides the head and heart of all his own and of all the Independents doctrine; Å¿o that <hi>I</hi> may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ay of him, <hi>that he hath not onely Å¿orely and deÅ¿perately wounded his own cauÅ¿e, but abÅ¿olutely murthered and taken away the life of Independency;</hi> Yea, whiles with this hatchet he came out againÅ¿t me <hi>to cut in two the long thred</hi> (as he Å¿peaks) <hi>of my Alcibiadian fluent and luxuriant Rhetorications, and to wound me Å¿oul and body,</hi> he hath wounded himÅ¿elfe and all his brethren <hi>under the fifth ribb;</hi> and that when he Å¿eemed in love to take them all by their great white basket-hilted beards to kiÅ¿Å¿e them; &amp; that which I now Å¿ay of him, I am confident that all thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall vouchÅ¿afe to read the inÅ¿uing diÅ¿courÅ¿e without prejudice, and Å¿ee what <hi>I</hi> have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wered to him and all thoÅ¿e of his Å¿ociety, will Å¿ay.</p>
            <p>It is uÅ¿uall with all the Independents to Å¿ay of any Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians that write againÅ¿t their wicked practices and novelties, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do it with moÅ¿t Å¿ingular reaÅ¿on, wiÅ¿dome, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and with all evidence of demonÅ¿tration, that by their writing againÅ¿t their wayes they not only wronged themÅ¿elves and the Presbyterian cauÅ¿e, and that very much, but that they have been a great occaÅ¿ion of increaÅ¿ing Independents and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their party, when notwithÅ¿tanding it is well known to the judicious and learned that they have given the Sectaries a fatall blow by diÅ¿covering the vanities and errors of their wayes to all men. But what the Independents and Sectaries falÅ¿ly vaunt in this point, (as they do of their graces and vertues) may truly be Å¿aid of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys, I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any men have wronged their cauÅ¿e, and advanced their adverÅ¿e party, they have done it; as <hi>I</hi> am confident all they will Å¿ay that Å¿hall deliberately read the following diÅ¿courÅ¿e; for there they Å¿hall Å¿ee how they not only upon all occaÅ¿ions contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and through their ignorance and temerity overthrow their own principles, and are enemies to their own cauÅ¿e; but how they like the <hi>Midianites</hi> deÅ¿troy one another with their own Å¿words, and at that time when they thinke mortally to wound their adverÅ¿aries and utterly to vanquiÅ¿h them and to obtaine the victory.</p>

               <hi>All that I have more in this place to add, is this,</hi> That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all men Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to look about them: and as they will not be deterred by any art of perÅ¿waÅ¿ion when either their lands or estates are queÅ¿tioned from Å¿earching into their evidences and the laÅ¿t wills and teÅ¿taments of their fathers, Parents, and friends that gave them their inheritances, Å¿o they ought not by any perÅ¿waÅ¿ions of men to be diÅ¿Å¿waded now to Å¿earch the good will and teÅ¿tament of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father and all the evidences of holy Writ, and to Å¿ee what all their adverÅ¿aries can pretend againÅ¿t their right &amp; juÅ¿t title to them. <hi>Let them ever make thoÅ¿e living Oracles</hi> Act. <hi>7. their CounÅ¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, they will adviÅ¿e them for their preÅ¿ent good and Å¿hew them the right way to their eternall &amp; everlaÅ¿ting Patrimony the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory.

there were Å¿ome Å¿trength in the Arguments of the enemies, or that they are more diligent to Å¿ow errors &amp; tares, then I Å¿hould be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to root them out &amp; oppoÅ¿e them, if I Å¿hould not as often reply as they cavil, and object; &amp; therfore for my particular it never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles me what any of youcan Å¿ay to me about my tautologies, which are not vaine repetitions to any that love often to heare the Å¿ame truth well confirmed; for allthis will but witneÅ¿Å¿e and declare to all men, <hi>that I am a carefull man to uphold the truth, and to reÅ¿iÅ¿t gain-Å¿ayers; beÅ¿ides, any man may Å¿ooner reade a reply many times, then turne to an other place, where it was formerly Å¿pake of, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wered to;</hi> withall, there will in a Å¿everall anÅ¿wer to the Å¿ame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in an other place be found Å¿ome variety, both for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and language, which many times begets other excellent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which more and more confirmes men in any truth.</p>
            <p>BeÅ¿ides, this hath ever beene Gods owne method, which they that are taught of him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. ought to imitate, often to repeate one and the Å¿ame Law; as what he taught his people in <hi>Exodus,</hi> he often reiterates in the Å¿ame Booke, and not in that only, but in <hi>Leviticus</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi> and repeats the whole Law againe in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and that often, to the end they might remember it, &amp; the Å¿ame may be Å¿aidof al the holy Prophets through the whole Bible, who often reiterate &amp; repeat the Å¿ame things <hi>that the people may not pretend ignorance;</hi> and this I Å¿ay is Gods own method, and therfore worthy of our imitation; yea and ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf uÅ¿ed this method in his preaching, and dictating unto his ApoÅ¿tles by his Holy Spirit, who writ foure Evangels of what he hath both done and Å¿uffered for us, often repeating the Å¿ame thing; yea, all the holy ApoÅ¿tles and pen men of holy Writ uÅ¿ed the Å¿ame method, as is to be Å¿een through the <hi>Acts,</hi> &amp; all their holy EpiÅ¿tles, repeating the Å¿ame things according to their Å¿everal occaÅ¿ions, as when either the Å¿ame errors Å¿prang up in other places, or began to increaÅ¿e where they were Å¿o wen, and Å¿tarted up; yea, <hi>Paul</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿eth of himÅ¿elfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 1. <hi>that to him it is not grievous, but for them Å¿afe, to write the Å¿ame things.</hi> The Å¿ame method did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> uÅ¿e, as yee may Å¿ee in his Å¿econd EpiÅ¿tle; and therefore it is no error in me often to repeate the Å¿ame things, and to inculcate and reinforce the Å¿ame Arguments, eÅ¿pecially if it be occaÅ¿ioned by your Å¿elves, that by this meanes the truth for which I contend may be the more confirmed, and errors may be the more confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and overthrown. But withall let mee Å¿ay thus much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:48122:37"/>
you by the way, <hi>that although I am conÅ¿trained through your vaine tautologies often to handle the Å¿ame truths; yet it is with Å¿uch variety, and in Å¿o diverÅ¿e a way, manner and Å¿tile, as it will not bee grievous or tedious to all thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall reade it with honeÅ¿t hearts,</hi> where they will well perceive that what I have anÅ¿wered more briefly in one place I have more fully handled in an other; that (if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible) I might give full Å¿atisfaction to all docible and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men that will be Å¿atisfyed, either with Scripture or reaÅ¿ons.</p>
            <p>Now if in this diÅ¿pute there be any expreÅ¿Å¿ions that may diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿e any of you, you of all men may well excuÅ¿e them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how great your provocations of me have beene; eÅ¿pecially, if you conÅ¿ider that all this contention is for the defence of the truth of God, which yee all have Å¿ought to corrupt, and adulterate with your traditions; in whoÅ¿e quarrell, and for the maintenance of whoÅ¿e honour it becomes every man to be more zealous, and fuller of animoÅ¿ity then for his owne; and therefore if I take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Å¿peake more freely in Å¿hewing the vanity, impiety and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e of the Deceivers and ImpoÅ¿tors of theÅ¿e times in which we live, it is but to uÅ¿e the Å¿ame method the holy Prophets and bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles have uÅ¿ed againÅ¿t the falÅ¿e teachers of their times, who have expreÅ¿Å¿ed themÅ¿elves in language equivalent to whatÅ¿oever they Å¿hall find in any part of my Booke.

<pb facs="tcp:48122:37"/>
as all their practices, and noyÅ¿ome, fruitleÅ¿Å¿e, and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Å¿criblings can witneÅ¿Å¿e, who daily write againÅ¿t their ChriÅ¿tian Brethren for their zeale to the truth, with a greater Å¿pirit of pride, inÅ¿olency and elation, and with more contempt and diÅ¿daine, and that out of Å¿elfe conceitedneÅ¿Å¿e then ever the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates did, continually Å¿lighting, under-valuing and contemning thoÅ¿e men they are not worthy for any merit or true learning to be compared with, or named the Å¿ame day they are mentioned; and therefore if I in Gods quarrell and cauÅ¿e be a little more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t, and uÅ¿e a little more tartneÅ¿Å¿e (which I Å¿hall ever wave in my owne) it may with any good nature eaÅ¿ily plead excuÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude my EpiÅ¿tle, I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire you all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider three paÅ¿Å¿ages, omitting many; I Å¿hall here Å¿et before your eyes the one out of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys his AnÅ¿wer,</hi> the other out of <hi>I.

MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> thus Å¿peaks, upon the FrontiÅ¿pice of his Booke: <hi>A moderate AnÅ¿wer unto Doctor</hi> BaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks <hi>Booke, wherein the manner how Å¿ome Churches in this Citie were gathered, and upon what termes their Members were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Å¿o both the</hi> Doctor <hi>and the</hi> Reader <hi>may judge, how neere Å¿ome `Beleevers who walke together in the Fellow-Å¿hip of the GoÅ¿pel, doe come in their practiÅ¿e to theÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tolicall rules, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the</hi> Doctor, <hi>as Gods method in gathering Churches, and admitting Members.</hi> TheÅ¿e are MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his own words, and in the nineteenth and twentieth page he more fully there te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tifies his good liking of that method for gathering of Churches that I out of the Word of God propounded, and would perÅ¿wade the world that their Congregations were gathered after that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or manner, or came very nigh unto it; by all which his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ions, and by that their practice he declares, <hi>that in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have writ nothing but what is agreeable to Gods Word.</hi> I appeale now therefore unto you all, whether this man deÅ¿erves not condigne puniÅ¿hment, <hi>that will goe about, undertake and endeavour to confute that Booke which he in his judgement allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, and according to which he pretendeth he practiÅ¿eth,</hi> andall this for the deluding and miÅ¿leading of unÅ¿table Å¿oules, to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both of Church and State. I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, that thoÅ¿e that are rationall amongÅ¿t you, and not blinded with paÅ¿Å¿ion, will Å¿ay
<pb facs="tcp:48122:38"/>
that MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> is not only an unworthy trifler, but that hee goeth contrary unto his owne Principles, and ought deÅ¿ervedly to be Å¿everely puniÅ¿hed for his thus wickedly miÅ¿pending his pretious time and abuÅ¿ing the Å¿imple people: For if I have writ nothing concerning the gathering of Churches, <hi>but what he in his conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beleeveth and practiÅ¿eth;</hi> then how unexcuÅ¿able is that in this man that will Å¿peake againÅ¿t what his owne Å¿oule dictates unto him to be according to GODS holy Word? By all which it is manifeÅ¿t, that he is not onely a vain jangler, but hath loÅ¿t the day, and wronged that your cauÅ¿e, the defence of which, notwithÅ¿tanding, he entred into the field to vindicate and maintain againÅ¿t all the Presbyterians. And that which I have Å¿aid of him, may deÅ¿ervedly be Å¿pake of <hi>I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> For <hi>I. S.</hi> in the 13. Page of his <hi>Flagelli,</hi> hath theÅ¿e words, <hi>If it were granted</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that many Churches did aggregate and unite in the beginning, yet would not this example be bindingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idential,</hi> &amp;c. and Å¿eems there to prove it by arguments; and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> in the 9. and 10. pages of his Pamphlet aÅ¿Å¿enteth unto <hi>I. S.</hi> his doctrine, as you may Å¿ee at large if you look into it, in which you Å¿hall find alÅ¿o, that he acknowledgeth <hi>there were many congregations of beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, and at that time, when according to his own reckoning, there were but three thouÅ¿and beleevers in that Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His words are theÅ¿e, Å¿aying,</hi> that though they wanted a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place Å¿o spacious as wherein to break bread, or to receive the Lords Supper altogether, Å¿o as they were conÅ¿trained to Å¿ever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves into divers companies in Å¿everall private houÅ¿es to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, &amp;c. <hi>So that by the learning of all theÅ¿e your great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions you will in the Å¿equell of this diÅ¿courÅ¿e evidently perceive,</hi> that they have utterly overthrown your doctrine of Independency and of the Congregational way, and that whiles they all came out to maintain it: <hi>For Mr</hi> Knollys, <hi>as I Å¿aid even now,</hi> he fights againÅ¿t the light of his own underÅ¿tanding, and oppoÅ¿eth that truth which he in his judgement alloweth of. <hi>And for</hi> I. S. <hi>and my brother</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>they have ignorantly murthered your cauÅ¿e: For all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention hitherto, both in the Synod, between the reverend PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters there and the</hi> Homothumadon <hi>diÅ¿Å¿enting brethren, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the Independents and Presbyterians through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hath been</hi> concerning the Church of JeruÅ¿alem and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of beleevers in that Church, which the diÅ¿Å¿enting brethren with
<pb facs="tcp:48122:38"/>
all the Independents in <hi>England</hi> hold were never at firÅ¿t and laÅ¿t more then could all meet in one place or Congregation to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip; <hi>and they aÅ¿Å¿ert moreover</hi> that that Church ought to be a patern for all Churches to the end of the world in reÅ¿pect of its government; <hi>and do peremptorily affirme,</hi> that the example of that Church is bindingly preÅ¿identiall to all Å¿ucceeding ages for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>which is the opinion not only of</hi> the Homothumadon <hi>diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿enting brethren but of all the Sectaries that I know, yea the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Presbyterians do all beleeve,</hi> that the Church of IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem the Mother-Church is to be a pattern of Government to all Churches in all Å¿ucceeding ages to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>I. S.</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>that the example of the Church of IeruÅ¿alem is not bindingly preÅ¿idential,</hi> wickedly comparing it to the confuÅ¿ed chaos that indigeÅ¿ted <hi>moles</hi> in the firÅ¿t creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, Å¿o that he makes the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> an imperfect patern. So that by his doctrine, it is left arbitrary for any Church or State to Å¿et up what kind of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they pleaÅ¿e. Now whether or no this opinion of his be not contrary to all divinity and the judgement of all orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, yea to the very tenent of all the Independents, I leave it to the conÅ¿ideration of all thoÅ¿e amongÅ¿t you that can judge of things that differ: So that you may Å¿ee that this Champion alÅ¿o of yours hath abÅ¿olutely overthrown your own principles when he came out to maintain and defend your cauÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>My brother <hi>Burton</hi> alÅ¿o hath given a fatall blow to that cauÅ¿e he came out Å¿o deÅ¿perately to maintain: For all the Independents through the world, that ever I heard of, with all the <hi>Homothu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madon</hi> brethren in the <hi>AÅ¿Å¿embly,</hi> by all their arguments have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto laboured to evince, <hi>that there were no more beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem then could all meet in one place or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to communicate in all ordinances,</hi> acknowledging, <hi>that if it could be proved there were more AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in that Church, that then they would yeeld the cauÅ¿e; and they spake according to reaÅ¿on.</hi> For if there were many Congregations of beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and all thoÅ¿e made up but one Church, and were all under one Presbytery, as they muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be if they made all but one entire Church, then the doctrine of the Congregationall way falleth to the ground or vaniÅ¿heth: for if there were many and Å¿everall Congregations there that had not an abÅ¿olute authority and juriÅ¿diction Independent within themÅ¿elvs reÅ¿pectively, but were Å¿ubordinate and Å¿ubject to another authority
<pb facs="tcp:48122:39"/>
above them, then of neceÅ¿Å¿ity that tenent of the Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall way is but a meer chimera or whimÅ¿y of your own heads, as all the learnedÅ¿t of your tribe do acknowledge.</p>
            <p>Now when my brother <hi>Burton</hi> hath not onely granted there were many Congregations of beleevers in that Church, but by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments proved it; he hath utterly, I Å¿ay, loÅ¿t the field before he entered into the combat, as will yet more perÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly appear in the following diÅ¿courÅ¿e: but by that I have now Å¿aid, you may Å¿ee how unhappy you are in all theÅ¿e your Champions and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals that give as great wounds unto your cauÅ¿e as any adverÅ¿aries you have in the world now living ever gave.</p>
            <p>That which I have now to Å¿ay in the firÅ¿t place to all your leaders and guides, is, earneÅ¿tly to intreat them as they look for true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in life and death, and as they deÅ¿ire the peace of the Church, and quiet of this diÅ¿tracted State and Kingdome, they would now no longer <hi>withhold the truth from the people in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> which hitherto they have done; but that they would unfainedly bewaile the errors of their wayes; and repent of their Å¿educing and miÅ¿leading of the poor people; let it be enough that they have Å¿o highly provoked God and cauÅ¿ed the enemies to blaÅ¿pheme our ChriÅ¿tian Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the Å¿econd place I deÅ¿ire all you that have hitherto been miÅ¿led and carryed about with every wind of their new doctrine,</hi> that now you would more Å¿eriouÅ¿ly prove and examine all things <hi>(according to the ApoÅ¿tles rule, 1</hi> TheÅ¿Å¿. <hi>5. 12.)</hi> and hold faÅ¿t that which is good. Lay not out your time and moneys for that which will profit you nothing, but whiles it is called to day, Å¿et your Å¿elves Å¿eriouÅ¿ly upon the work of examining all thoÅ¿e new doctrines that have been taught you: <hi>Å¿et before your eyes the example of the noble</hi> Bereans, <hi>Å¿earch the Scriptures whether things be as they have taught you, and if you pleaÅ¿e diligently to read what I have writ out of a zeal of the glory of God, and out of love to your Å¿elves, and a true deÅ¿ire of your eternall felicity,</hi> If any of you that have erred from the truth Å¿hall be converted by it, let him know, that he that converteth the Å¿inner from the error of his way, Å¿hall Å¿ave a Å¿oul from death, and Å¿hall hide a multitude of Å¿ins, <hi>James 5. 19. 20.</hi>

               <hi>Å¿aith there:</hi> This commandement which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far of; it is not in heaven that thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t Å¿ay who Å¿hall go up for us to heaven, and bring it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that we may hear it and do it. Neither is it beyond the Å¿ea, that thou Å¿houldÅ¿t Å¿ay, who Å¿hall goe over the Å¿ea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it: But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayÅ¿t do it.

            <p>Now if in the dayes of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> the truth was Å¿o near unto them that the Lord Å¿ays there unto his people, that he had Å¿et it before their eyes, yea that it was in their hearts; Å¿o that they had then no need to run from land to Å¿ea, and from Å¿ea to land to finde it: how much more obvious is it now, may every rationall man conclude when it is Å¿o gloriouÅ¿ly Å¿et forth, and that through the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the New TeÅ¿tament?

            </p>
            <p>I will firÅ¿t therefore diÅ¿Å¿ipate and Å¿catter thoÅ¿e miÅ¿ts that have been caÅ¿t before their eyes, by which the truth hath been clouded,

            <p>ThoÅ¿e that call themÅ¿elves by the name of Independents and have Å¿eparated themÅ¿elves from our Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, counting us <hi>Å¿uch Saints as Job would not Å¿et with the doggs of his flocke, calling us the Å¿ons of Belial, proclaming us to be the enemies the Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdome</hi> (for this is their language concerning us all) thoÅ¿e I Å¿ay pretend that they have both the Word of God and the example of the Primitive Churches, eÅ¿pecially that of JeruÅ¿alem for the maintenance of their Independency and for theÅ¿e their unbrotherly proceedings, whoÅ¿e opinion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this:</p>
            <p>That the Church of IeruÅ¿alem that Mother Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of of no more beleevers at any time then did ordinarily meet altogether in one place and Congregation to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip; and they teach withall, that this Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of no more, had an abÅ¿olute Å¿overaignty within it Å¿elfe Independent without reference to any other Church, and from the which there might be no appeal for the redreÅ¿Å¿e of any conceived wrong; and they moreover affirm that
<pb facs="tcp:48122:41"/>
the conÅ¿titution of this conceited forme of government, is the true Gospel forme of Church government, and is for ever to be a patern to all Churches in all Å¿ucceeding ages to doe the Å¿ame and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e the Å¿ame authority within themÅ¿elves Å¿everally that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this Church did, though they conÅ¿iÅ¿t but of twenty or thirty Members apeece, yea fewer.</p>
            <p>This is the opinion of all the Independents, Å¿aving my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> who in this differeth from all his brethren, beleeving, yea acknowledging that there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> by which he hath overthrowne their opinion, whiles notwithÅ¿tanding hee labours with all his might to maintaine it, as will appeare in its due place; whereas all the other Independents, (as I Å¿aid before) confidently aÅ¿Å¿ert, that there were no more Beleevers in that Church, at firÅ¿t and laÅ¿t, then could all meet in one Congregation to communicate in all the Ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Presbyterians on the other Å¿ide, and that upon very good grounds, as will in the Å¿equell of this diÅ¿courÅ¿e appeare,</hi> hold and beleeve that there were many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, and that all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Congregations made but one Church within its pracincts, and were all under one Presbyterie; and that the government of this Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many Congregations combined together under the government of a Colledge of Presbyters is a paterne of government to all Churches in Å¿ucceeding ages to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Å¿econd is concerning the gathering of Churches and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Members into Church fellow-Å¿hip &amp; communion, which the Independents hold and teach muÅ¿t be upon theÅ¿e conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FirÅ¿t that</hi> they that are to be admitted, and before they can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church, they muÅ¿t walke Å¿ometime with them. <hi>In</hi> New-England <hi>they make Å¿ome walke Å¿even yeeres before they can be received, and this is their firÅ¿t condition.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they must bring in the evidences of their converÅ¿ion, declaring the time when, the place where, and the occaÅ¿ion how they were converted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:42"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they must all and every one of them enter into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular explicite Covenant.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>they must come in and be admitted by the conÅ¿ent of the whole Church, Nemine contradicente;</hi> Å¿o that the refuÅ¿ing of any of theÅ¿e hinders their admiÅ¿Å¿ion, and the gathering of Churches after Å¿o faÅ¿hion (as the French men uÅ¿e to Å¿peake when they learn EngliÅ¿h) is the onely way as they all affirme of Å¿etting up ChriÅ¿t as King upon his Throne, and this is the opinion and doctrine of all the Independents concerning the gathering of Churches, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending withall that they have the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> for this their paterne and plat-forme, which is nothing elÅ¿e but to abuÅ¿e the Scripture, as will afterwards appeare.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterians on the contrary Å¿ide <hi>hold and beleeve, that for the gathering of Churches, and for the making of any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any Church, and for the admitting of them into Church FollowÅ¿hip and Communion, no other conditions are to be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them by the MiniÅ¿ters for their reception into the Å¿ociety of the Church, or to be required at any peoples hands, but thoÅ¿e that ChriÅ¿t the King of his Church (whoÅ¿e voyce is only in Church matters to be liÅ¿tned unto and heard) hath propounded,</hi> viz. <hi>Repentance, Faith and BaptiÅ¿me.</hi> And this is the beliefe and opinion of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans concerning the admiÅ¿Å¿ion of Members, and gathering of Churches, affirming that the Independents have neither Precept nor PreÅ¿ident for all their new conditions in the whole Booke of God, and therefore that they ought to be rejected as their owne inventions, and as the vaine and wicked traditions of their owne braine, as will clearely in the following diÅ¿courÅ¿e be evidenced to all men. And this is briefly the Å¿tate of the queÅ¿tion and difference betweene us.</p>
            <p>Now before I Å¿et downe the ground, and Å¿eeming warrant they pretend for this their fond opinion of Independency, by which they have brought trouble and confuÅ¿ion upon this whole Church and Kingdome; I thinke it fit I Å¿ay before the handling of the whole buÅ¿ines to Å¿ay Å¿omething concerning the Å¿orts of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents I have to deale with, and againÅ¿t the which all my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments doe militate; and I find two Å¿orts of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; the firÅ¿t are thoÅ¿e which for diÅ¿tinction Å¿ake I call <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothumadons;</hi> the other <hi>Burtonians.</hi> Now the <hi>Homothumadon</hi> Independents, that at this day Å¿warme through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

The <hi>Burtonian</hi> Independents, of which my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> is the <hi>Corypheus,</hi> and <hi>AnteÅ¿ignanus,</hi> and from whom they have received their doctrine, they hold and beleeve that there were many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies of beleevers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> but deny that thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Congregations were Churches properly Å¿o called.</p>
            <p>This I Å¿ay is the opinion of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and his diÅ¿ciples.</p>

All this by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance I undertake to make good, and to evince this alÅ¿o, that they lay that foundation of their new Fabrick onely in the ayre or chimera of their owne braine.

            <p>But firÅ¿t I Å¿hall give you in <hi>the anÅ¿wer of thoÅ¿e reverend Iudges Å¿itting in the Court,</hi> I meane the reverend AÅ¿Å¿embly, where this cauÅ¿e was fully heard and debated, where the <hi>Homothumadons</hi> had liberty fully to Å¿peak for themÅ¿elvs, &amp; to bring in whatÅ¿oever made for their cauÅ¿e, howÅ¿oever they have falÅ¿ely given out to the contrary</p>

            <p>Now if we do duly examine the words of the Text and conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in their native Å¿enÅ¿e and true meaning, it will moÅ¿t ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿tly appear that the AnÅ¿wer of the learned and reverend <hi>AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> was grounded upon moÅ¿t excellent and Å¿olid reaÅ¿on, <hi>which all the Å¿light of all the</hi> Homothumadons <hi>and their cunning craftineÅ¿Å¿e</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now by the holy Scripture we are truly informed there were millions of true beleevers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> at that very time, and that they were the MiniÅ¿ters only that were preÅ¿ent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the day of PentecoÅ¿t, and that the other Beleevers were in their other meeting places: yea, beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that I have now named, it is Å¿aid in the Å¿ame Chapter, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 5. <hi>that</hi> (at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant of time) <hi>there were dwelling</hi> at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem, Iewes, devout men out of every nation under heaven,</hi> that is true WorÅ¿hippers, and Beleevers: here therefore muÅ¿t needs bee an innumerable company of theÅ¿e, and all theÅ¿e were then Inhabitants in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem:</hi> Å¿o that the Holy Scripture doth by many witneÅ¿Å¿es prove there were more then a hundred and twenty Beleevers, or more then a hundred thouÅ¿and in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> at that time, how therefore with any honeÅ¿ty can the Independents conclude from <hi>Epi to auto,</hi> that there were no more Beleevers then in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> nor ever after, then could all meet in one Congregation? If this be not to fight againÅ¿t God, there was never any fighting againÅ¿t him. But Å¿hould I yeeld unto them, which I cannot doe for many reaÅ¿ons,
<pb facs="tcp:48122:50"/>
that there were no more Beleevers at that time in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> then did or could all meet in any one place; will it follow in any Å¿ound underÅ¿tanding that they could ever after all Å¿till meet in one Congregation, when they were infinitly daily increaÅ¿ed? I trow not; for Å¿o to Å¿peake, and Å¿o to argue and conclude, would be but to prove fighters againÅ¿t all reaÅ¿on; yea againÅ¿t God himÅ¿elf (as I Å¿aid before) and to deny the expreÅ¿Å¿e Scriptures, as will forthwith appeare; for in the Å¿ame Chapter when there were but three thouÅ¿and new Converts added to the Church, it is Å¿aid that then that company could not all meet in any one place to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in all acts of worÅ¿hip, but for want of a place Å¿pacious enough for to breake bread in, they were forced then to meet in divers places, and to divide themÅ¿elves into Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations, and that in Å¿everall houÅ¿es; for Å¿o Å¿aith the Scripture, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 46. <hi>and they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e;</hi> that is, <hi>in many Å¿everall houÅ¿es,</hi> they had their meetings to communicate in; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at that very time there were many Congregations of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Å¿o that they could not poÅ¿sibly meet altogether in one place. And here by the way it is good to take notice, not onely that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which the Independents confeÅ¿Å¿e to be the firÅ¿t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, and that when there were but three thouÅ¿and new Converts added to the DiÅ¿ciples, but that all theÅ¿e were Å¿peedily and readily received into Church-fellowÅ¿hip, and that by the Å¿ole and alone authority of the ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿o that it was not required at their hands, that they Å¿hould firÅ¿t walke Å¿ometime with the Church before their admiÅ¿sion, or that they Å¿hould make a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeÅ¿sion of their faith, or bring in the evidences of their converÅ¿ion, or that they Å¿hould enter into any particular explicite Covenant, or that they muÅ¿t have the conÅ¿ent of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could be received into Church-fellowÅ¿hip; nothing I Å¿ay of all this was either practiÅ¿ed in this Mother-church, or any Daughter-church in the Primitive and pureÅ¿t times; but theÅ¿e two truths are moÅ¿t certainely evident out of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t, that all ChriÅ¿tians in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> were admitted into Church-fellowÅ¿hip upon <hi>their repenting, beleeving and being baptiÅ¿ed, without any other conditions,</hi> and that upon offering themÅ¿elves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:51"/>
The Å¿econd truth is this, that there were many congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> at that inÅ¿tant time, which is abundantly proved out of the teÅ¿timonies and reaÅ¿ons above Å¿pecified, and thoÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿e words, where it is <hi>Å¿aid that they brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e; therefore there were many Congregations then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will farther more illuÅ¿triouÅ¿ly yet appeare, if we conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the divers other additions of Beleevers, and that daily unto the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> for in the laÅ¿t verÅ¿e of this chapter it is Å¿aid <hi>that the Lord added daily unto the Church Å¿uch as Å¿hould bee Å¿aved;</hi> here we find additions upon additions of Beleevers, and that daily, indefinitly Å¿et downe, as if they could not eaÅ¿ily have been told, which addeth no Å¿mall EmphaÅ¿is unto the expreÅ¿sion; and all theÅ¿e were admitted into Church-fellowÅ¿hip without any of thoÅ¿e conditions the Independents require of all their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in theÅ¿e our times; for it is Å¿aid <hi>the Lord added daily unto the Church Å¿uch as Å¿hould be Å¿aved;</hi> and therefore hee did it onely upon his owne termes of <hi>Repentance, Faith and BaptiÅ¿me.</hi> Now what underÅ¿tanding man can eaÅ¿ily beleeve <hi>that when there was Å¿uch daily increaÅ¿e of Beleevers made, that they could all Å¿till meet in any one place or Congregation to partake in all Ordinances?</hi> But if wee looke into the fourth chapter, we Å¿hall find an other new Addition, and that of <hi>five thouÅ¿and men more, beÅ¿ides women;</hi> for Å¿o Å¿aith the Scripture, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 4. <hi>Howbeit, many of them which heard the word beleeved, and the number of the men was about five thouÅ¿and.</hi> Now if when there were but three thouÅ¿and, they were then forced for want of a convenient place Å¿pacious enough to communicate in, <hi>to divide themÅ¿elves into divers Å¿everall hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es;</hi> how impoÅ¿sible a thing was it <hi>for them all daily then to meet together in any one place or congregation, may any one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,</hi> when there were not only daily additions of Beleevers, but five thouÅ¿and men more added unto the Church at one time? without all controverÅ¿ie <hi>it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible that they could all then meet together in any one place;</hi> and for farther confirmation of this truth, and for the putting of this controverÅ¿ie for ever out of doubt, the Holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿aith in the fifth chapter, verÅ¿e 14. <hi>And Beleevers were more added unto the Church, multitudes both of men and women.</hi> Marke I pray the expreÅ¿sion, <hi>multitudes:</hi> Now by <hi>multitude,</hi> all men know is to be underÅ¿tood, and that in all

So that if I Å¿hould Å¿ay no more, the truth concerning this point is Å¿o evidently apparent to all judicious and underÅ¿tanding men, that they cannot doubt of it, except they will deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it Å¿elfe; yet that the truth concerning this controverÅ¿ie may yet more fully be cleared, <hi>I</hi> Å¿hall for the farther coroborrating of it and for confirmation of the Å¿ame, produce a few teÅ¿timonies more.</p>
            <p>In the Å¿ixth chapter, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 7. <hi>The word of the Lord increaÅ¿ed,</hi> (Å¿aith the Holy GhoÅ¿t) <hi>and the number of DiÅ¿ciples multiplyed in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>greatly, and a great company of the PrieÅ¿ts were obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the faith.</hi> Here wee find multiplication upon multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beleevers, and more additions of them, and that in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> and amongÅ¿t theÅ¿e multitudes there was a great company of PrieÅ¿ts, that is a great company of their MiniÅ¿ters and learned Rabbies were converted, and all theÅ¿e Å¿everall admiÅ¿sions of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers into this Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> were without any of the conditions thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way require now of their new Members; for it is not Å¿aid, <hi>that they demanded of them that they Å¿hould walke Å¿ome time with them before their admiÅ¿sion, or that they Å¿hould make any publicke confeÅ¿sion of their faith, or bring in the evidences of their converÅ¿ion, or enter into any particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Covenant, or come in by the conÅ¿ent of the people before their admiÅ¿sion;</hi> nothing of all theÅ¿e things were required at their hands in this Mother-church; and therefore all the practiÅ¿e of this kind of admiÅ¿sion in our new Congregations is without any preÅ¿ident or example; and therefore thoÅ¿e of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall way doe moÅ¿t wickedly <hi>to pretend they have the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>for an example for their practiÅ¿e of admitting of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I Å¿ay the thing chiefly to be obÅ¿erved here is <hi>the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the increaÅ¿e of many more DiÅ¿ciples to the former,</hi> adding withall, <hi>that amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e DiÅ¿ciples and Converts that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Lord there was a great company of the PrieÅ¿ts:</hi> now what an increaÅ¿e of Beleevers may any man Å¿uppoÅ¿e there muÅ¿t then needs follow, when Å¿o many of their MiniÅ¿ters were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? without doubt when the people Å¿aw their PrieÅ¿ts turne ChriÅ¿tians, and heard them alÅ¿o in their preachings give in their reaÅ¿ons for their imbracing of the GoÅ¿pel, and Å¿aw withall the daily miracles of the ApoÅ¿tles for the confirmation of this their
<pb facs="tcp:48122:52"/>
doctrine they did infinitly multiply; Å¿o that if there had beene no converÅ¿ion of men before Å¿pak of, yet the converÅ¿ion of theÅ¿e very PrieÅ¿ts in a Å¿hort time would have procured the converÅ¿ion of many more <hi>then could have met in any one place or a few;</hi> and this all reaÅ¿on will perÅ¿wade; for wee find it by hourly experience, how many hundreds are daily miÅ¿lead, and Å¿educed by the error of a few temporiÅ¿ing unÅ¿table Presbyters, who are turned Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and what a deale of miÅ¿chiefe they have done here amongÅ¿t us, Å¿o that not a few places can containe their ProÅ¿elytes, and all this without the helpe of any miracles; and we Å¿ee daily, <hi>if but any rich and craÅ¿ed Gentlewoman, or any confounded Lady turne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, or if but any unÅ¿table man of any eminency revolt from the Presbyterian way,</hi> what a noyÅ¿e there is by and by made at it, and how many giddy headed men, and women eÅ¿pecially, are Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it, and that without any prodigies: Now <hi>I</hi> Å¿ay all reaÅ¿on will perÅ¿wade any intelligible man that truth Å¿hould much more prevaile then error, and that in the hands of Å¿o great a multitude, and of Å¿uch learned Rabbies, and thoÅ¿e alÅ¿o in Å¿o great honour and eÅ¿teeme amongÅ¿t the people, having withall the helpe of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles amongÅ¿t them, and that to the Å¿peedy converÅ¿ion of many thouÅ¿ands; yea, the Scripture Å¿aith, <hi>that the Word of God increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed,</hi> that is to Å¿ay <hi>converted many, and that the number of DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples multiplyed in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>greatly,</hi> not in a Å¿mall manner; <hi>and that a great company of the PrieÅ¿ts were alÅ¿o added unto the Lord;</hi> Å¿o that if there were a great Congregation and AÅ¿Å¿embly of the PrieÅ¿ts, as the Word of God relateth; there muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be many more Congregations of the ordinary people, and all theÅ¿e are to be yet reckoned upon a new account, and upon a new LiÅ¿t, <hi>Å¿o that there were numberleÅ¿Å¿e Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>if any credit may be given to the Holy Scripture, and that in the very infancy of the Church:</hi> Å¿o that I am moÅ¿t confident, that this truth is now evident and perÅ¿picuous to all thoÅ¿e that have but ordinary underÅ¿tanding.</p>
            <p>But becauÅ¿e this is the onely buÅ¿ines, as the Independents Å¿ay, and that will put an end to this controverÅ¿ie betweene us; for they have often Å¿aid, <hi>prove once but clearly unto us out of the Word of God that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>and then wee will grant you the day;</hi> I Å¿ay in this regard I Å¿hall briefly adde Å¿ome other Arguments to

            <p>By all which it now appeareth that it is Gods Ordinance and his Appointment <hi>that many congregations combined together in any city or vicinity within Å¿ome Precinct, Å¿hould all of them within that juriÅ¿diction make up but one Church and be under a Colledg of PreÅ¿byters to be governed by them in common,</hi> which is indeed a meer eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Corporation; and therefore this kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might without any offence or diviation from the holy Word of God be compared by me to any civill Corporation, as

that of <hi>London</hi> or the like: For though <hi>I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿pend much time and many words to no purpoÅ¿e about my <hi>Å¿imile,</hi> yet it will Å¿tand for ever immoveable and Å¿erve to all intelligible ChriÅ¿tians for that very end <hi>I</hi> propound it: <hi>viz. to declare the Å¿tate of the queÅ¿tion;</hi> yea by <hi>I.

S.</hi> Å¿peaks there.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>I</hi> having from the holy Word of God and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution of the Church at JeruÅ¿alem the firÅ¿t true formed Church and originall Church found out the true nature of that Å¿pirituall and eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall government, that heavenly compoÅ¿ure and that device of God (as he grolliÅ¿hly calleth it) it was then no Å¿in in me (in <hi>I. S.</hi> his opinion) to find a reÅ¿emblance of it in things below. And therefore both he himÅ¿elfe and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> might have Å¿aved all that labour they needleÅ¿ly Å¿pent about that Å¿imile, which will ever Å¿tand good againÅ¿t whatÅ¿oever they Å¿hall be able to Å¿ay againÅ¿t it, for the elucidating and cleering of the point of difference between the Presbyterians and the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which was the onely end <hi>I</hi> made uÅ¿e of it for; and there fore all the pudder they made about that Å¿imile, was but to beat the aire and to vent their own vanity.</p>
            <p>But from all this diÅ¿pute (that <hi>I</hi> may now Å¿peak Å¿omething concerning Nationall Churches, which the Independents deny) I farther gather, That if many hundred Congregations being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together under one Presbytery in any great City or Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity within any large JuriÅ¿diction, may all of them make up but one Church within that Precinct, and may take its name or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from the City or place in which it is: <hi>I</hi> Å¿ee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on why a thouÅ¿and PariÅ¿hes, yea ten thouÅ¿and, all of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the GoÅ¿pell and making profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the true ChriÅ¿tian Religion, in what Kingdome, Nation, Province, Country, or Commonwealth Å¿oever they be, may not all of them in thoÅ¿e Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Countries, being all of them combined together and under Å¿ome grand Presbyteries, take their Å¿everall names and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations

               <hi>Cambridge,</hi> &amp;c. have all their bounds and limits preÅ¿cribed unto them, and all the people within that precinct, and no farther, that Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves to that their government, are Å¿aid to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each Å¿everall Church, and of no other; and yet<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> all this is as much politick, as the diviÅ¿ion of our PariÅ¿hes and Cities; and thoÅ¿e Churches conÅ¿tituted by the ApoÅ¿tles in every citie, village and countrey, were as much politick as ours, and yet are called Gods Ordinances: and truly I know no good reaÅ¿on why our pariÅ¿h churches Å¿hould not farre rather, and with farre greater reaÅ¿on be of divine inÅ¿titution, then thoÅ¿e churches of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way: for it is well knowne that all the Members in our Å¿everall PariÅ¿hes dwell within Å¿uch and Å¿uch limits, and for the moÅ¿t part are all well and familiarly knowne one to an other; and every weeke, once at leaÅ¿t Å¿ee all one an others faces, and can daily meet together for to watch over one another; whereas thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way dwell many of them twenty miles one from another, and Å¿ome threeÅ¿core miles one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and all for the moÅ¿t part a great diÅ¿tance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Å¿cattered here and there, Å¿o that they cannot poÅ¿sibly one watch over an other, as is pretended, and behold one an others converÅ¿ation, for that is impoÅ¿sible; and therefore for my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar I know that the parochiall or pariÅ¿hionall aÅ¿Å¿embling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves together for the injoying of the Ordinances hath preÅ¿idents for it in holy Writ, and that many, both in cities and villages; but wee have not one preÅ¿ident of Å¿uch congregations as are now in our new Churches in all the whole Booke of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude that all our parochiall meetings are farre more of divine inÅ¿titution, and Churches properly Å¿o called then the AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblies of the congregationall way: And by the Å¿ame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I may gather that the ChriÅ¿tian Churches now through the world, at leaÅ¿t all the reformed Churches may as well be called nationall Churches, as the JewiÅ¿h Church was, eÅ¿pecially if we looke unto the requiÅ¿ites that make a nationall Church; for two things are required for the making of a nationall Church; firÅ¿t a nationall agreement in the Å¿ame faith and worÅ¿hip. Secondly, a nationall union in one EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall body in the Å¿ame commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall government; as now the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> have all by covenant bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to maintaine the Å¿ame faith and worÅ¿hip, and by a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="tcp:48122:58"/>
union and agreement they have accorded to be under a PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall government, and this they all acknowledge to be Gods Ordinance, and a way appointed by him of governing his church; and that the Presbyterian government is Gods Ordinance, the Independents themÅ¿elves doe acknowledge, but they hold only a congregationall Presbyterie, and we hold, and that from all reaÅ¿on, and from the good word of God, and from many preÅ¿idents, both Citie, claÅ¿Å¿icall, provinciall and nationall Presbyteries, and oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall alÅ¿o upon occaÅ¿ions; for of theÅ¿e kinds of Presbyteries, both the Word of God, and many EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall HiÅ¿tories doe furniÅ¿h us with Å¿ome preÅ¿idents: and therefore for the one wee have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inÅ¿titution for it, and many examples in the Booke of God; but wee have neither precept nor example of that of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall way, and therefore it is none of Gods inÅ¿titutions, nor none of his <hi>devices nor compoÅ¿ures,</hi> that I may uÅ¿e Å¿ome of <hi>I.

            <p>
               <hi>But now I am to anÅ¿wer to Å¿omething my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>hath to Å¿ay concerning the Presbyters of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>who</hi> pag. <hi>6. 7. of his Booke,</hi> If you <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> have not a good PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, where Å¿hall hee, <hi>viz.</hi> that is Å¿candalized or offended, goe to complaine? Hee may goe and appeale higher you will Å¿ay, and what if the higher the worÅ¿e? Good Brother <hi>(Å¿aith hee)</hi> either provide the people of the Land an honeÅ¿t godly Presbytery, that may be as Å¿o many Angels to gather out of Christs Kingdome every thing that offends; or elÅ¿e let there be a tender care of tender conÅ¿ciences, and Å¿ome proviÅ¿ion made for them, that they may not be Å¿candalized by being forced to be the companions of the Å¿candalous. <hi>Thus my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Burton.</p>
            <p>Here is a double <hi>If</hi> propounded meerly to amuÅ¿e the people: for it is not unknowne to all men that the Parliament, the great Councell of the Kingdome, endeavoureth to caÅ¿t out all Å¿candalous MiniÅ¿ters, Å¿o farre as their power extendeth through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if by information and Å¿ufficient witneÅ¿Å¿es they can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be Å¿uch; Å¿o that every conÅ¿cientious and intelligible man may Å¿ee there is very Å¿mall ground for the doubts and feares, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> or any of that Fraternity, that there will not be a good Presbytery Å¿et up, and as little (when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but the godly if offended may goe and appeale higher) for either he himÅ¿elfe or they to make Å¿uch a Å¿uppoÅ¿ition; <hi>what if</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48122:59"/>
               <hi>the higher the worÅ¿e?</hi> If I Å¿hould conclude, that theÅ¿e doubts were conceived, nouriÅ¿hed, and brought forth out of the wombe of faction, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> with his complices would call it rayling; therefore to avoid (ifit be poÅ¿Å¿ible) their unjuÅ¿t cenÅ¿ures I onely Å¿ay thus much, that both hee and all his brethren uÅ¿e an uncharitable way of arguing (which is the beÅ¿t conÅ¿truction can be made of it) for thus they may traduce any man, yea, any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or any way of God at pleaÅ¿ure, with a detracting <hi>if.</hi> But here lies the myÅ¿terie; the onely way my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his aÅ¿Å¿ociats have to advance Independency, is to cloud the truth of God under darke expreÅ¿sions, and to eclypÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Å¿hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lights, the faithfull godly MiniÅ¿ters throughout the kingdom, that the Lord hath Å¿et up in his Church, that Å¿o the people may not heare the voice of God Å¿peaking in them, by which meanes the underÅ¿tandings of many are wrapped up in error, obÅ¿curity and darkeneÅ¿Å¿e, as in a mantle, and the ungrounded and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable notions of Independency are received by them as new Lights, they being very pleaÅ¿ing to fleÅ¿h and blood: for man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hath an ambitious, boundleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿pirit, and from the beginning would not be limited by God himÅ¿elfe, and the Independent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being without bounds, teaching that it is free for men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, practiÅ¿e and preach abroad their Å¿everall opinions (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it liberty of conÅ¿cience) this is Å¿uch a Light that all the Å¿ons and daughters of darkeneÅ¿Å¿e will willingly walke in. But Å¿hould the Independents obtaine their deÅ¿ire, whereever this new Light were Å¿et up, it would prove no other liberty then that which our firÅ¿t Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> gained for their Rebellion againÅ¿t Gods command, which was to inÅ¿lave themÅ¿elves, and all their poÅ¿terity to Å¿inne and Satan; and moÅ¿t certaine it is, that Å¿uch a liberty as the Independents doe teach, Å¿eeke, and (joyning with all Å¿ort of Sectaries and Libertines) plead and Å¿tand for, would bring confuÅ¿ion, and an irrevocable curÅ¿e on thoÅ¿e Kingdomes and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries as Å¿hall tolerate Å¿o great abominations, and cauÅ¿e the Lord who hates <hi>Laodicean</hi> LukewarmeneÅ¿Å¿e in Religion, <hi>to Å¿pue them out of his mouth, Revel.</hi> 3. 15. 16. But before I paÅ¿Å¿e on, I will take this liberty to Å¿ay unto my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that whatÅ¿oever with his <hi>Ifs</hi> hee can plead againÅ¿t our Presbyters, may be Å¿aid with much more, and with farre better reaÅ¿on againÅ¿t the independent Presbyters, if they be wicked or hereticall; for from them there
<pb facs="tcp:48122:59"/>
is no appeal for reliefe by any amongÅ¿t them never Å¿o much wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and therefore all Å¿uch kinds of arguing againÅ¿t our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is as altogether uncharitable, Å¿o but trifling. But my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> cals upon me <hi>to provide the people of the Land an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t and godly Presbyterie;</hi> from whence it appeares that in his and his brethrens account all the Orthodox, faithfull and godly Presbyters in the Land at this day, who differ from the opinions they have lately received, are neither honeÅ¿t nor godly: for if there be (as moÅ¿t certaine it is there are many) honeÅ¿t &amp; godly Presbyters provided for the people of the Land, it is Å¿trange he Å¿hould Å¿peak in Å¿uch a manner, as if they were altogether wanting, for Å¿o his words doe intimate; for why otherwiÅ¿e Å¿hould he make Å¿uch a requeÅ¿t to me of providing an honeÅ¿t &amp; godly Presbyterie, if he or they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wee had a godly Presbytery already, who notwithÅ¿tanding he knows hath no power to performe it? Truly all his Argumentations are very uncharitable, &amp; no way beÅ¿eeming a Brother; for charity is kind, <hi>and thinks no evill,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. 5. But were it Å¿o, that it might be taken <hi>pro confeÅ¿Å¿o,</hi> that ther were not any Å¿uch Å¿et up in this land, which were to deny the Suns Å¿hining at noon-day, did hee and the Independents indeed and in truth unfainedly deÅ¿ire Å¿uch a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie Å¿hould be Å¿et up &amp; eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, why do they not, as they falÅ¿ly accuÅ¿e them, firÅ¿t prove them to be enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdom, and not a godly and an honeÅ¿t Presbyterie, and then as in duty they are all bound earneÅ¿tly in the firÅ¿t place Å¿eeke to God, that he would Å¿end <hi>faithfull Labourers into his Vineyard,</hi> and Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to authority, that they would Å¿et up an honeÅ¿t and a godly Presbyterie, and give unto them full power that they may be as Å¿o many Angels to gather out of ChriÅ¿ts Kingdom every thing that offends according to the Word of God, which all the knowing godly Presbyterians (MiniÅ¿ters and people) do heartilydeÅ¿ire, that Å¿o no truly tender conÅ¿ciences may be Å¿candalized? this I Å¿ay were the duty of them all, and not to make Å¿uppoÅ¿itions &amp; needleÅ¿Å¿e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿ts to thoÅ¿e that have neither power nor authority to doe it. But the Independents are Å¿o farre from this, that they have made it their deÅ¿igne hitherto, to hinder the worke of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by rayÅ¿ing up queÅ¿tions continually, as being alwayes unÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied (and by Å¿eeking to Å¿tirre up the people in their preachings and Pamphlets againÅ¿t the Presbyterians) and that meerly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, retard and keepe off a Å¿etled government in the Church of

God (Å¿aying) <hi>what haÅ¿te is there of that?</hi> and in the meane time they fiÅ¿h in our troubled waters, and yet their Å¿trongeÅ¿t and moÅ¿t effectuall baits wherewith they allure and catch the poore Å¿illy fiÅ¿hes, I meane the Å¿imple and unÅ¿table people, is this, to tell them that there is not any Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>government Å¿etled, and that as they <hi>have waited many years already, Å¿o they may waite as many more, and be as farre off from DiÅ¿cipline, and a through Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they now are,</hi> Å¿aying withall, if they doe waite to have a Presbyterie Å¿et up, <hi>what if it be not a good one? and what if they have not power to gather out of ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome every thing that offends?</hi> affirming, <hi>that as it is uncomfortable, Å¿o it is abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Å¿infull, to live without the Ordinances, which amongÅ¿t the Saints, and none but Beleevers in their Congregations they may injoy.</hi> Thus whiles the Independents doe labour and endeavour with all their might to oppoÅ¿e the Å¿etling of Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>government, they make the want thereof the moÅ¿t powerfull and prevalent Engine and Argument to draw the people into their way; and upon the occaÅ¿ion of theÅ¿e Interrogatories or queries, and of theÅ¿e <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands</hi> of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and his confedertes, I Å¿hall Å¿et downe Å¿ome of their Independent practiÅ¿es well known to many thouÅ¿ands in this Kingdome beÅ¿ides my Å¿elfe, by which their ingratitude, both to God and men, and the reÅ¿t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of theÅ¿e mens Å¿pirits will the better appeare to all Å¿uch as are not blinded with a previous or prejudicated opinion. So that all men of diÅ¿cerning Å¿pirits by beholding their juglings and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proceedings, may learne to Å¿hun them, and to take heed of them, and all their by-wayes. It is well knowne that in the time of the Prelats power, the removall of a very few things would have given great content unto the moÅ¿t Å¿crupulous conÅ¿ciences: for I my Å¿elfe can Å¿peake thus much, not only concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cientious ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors here in <hi>England,</hi> but the moÅ¿t rigid Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿ts beyond the Seas, with many of which I had familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at home and abroad, and amongÅ¿t all that ever I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ed with, I never heard them till within theÅ¿e twenty yeares deÅ¿ire any other thing in Reformation, but that the Ceremonies might be removed with their Innovations, and that EpiÅ¿copacy might be regulated, and their boundleÅ¿Å¿e power and authority taken from them, and that the extravagances of the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion Court might be annihilated, and made void, and that there
<pb facs="tcp:48122:60"/>
might through the Kingdom be a preaching MiniÅ¿tery every where Å¿et up. This was all that the moÅ¿t that I was then acquainted with deÅ¿ired in the Reformation of Church matters. Indeed within this Å¿ixteene yeares I met with Å¿ome that deÅ¿ired a more full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and yet if they might have injoyed but that I now mentioned, they would have beene very thankfull to God and authority, and have Å¿ate downe quietly. But yet I Å¿ay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameÅ¿t extent of their deÅ¿ires, reached but to the removall of all the Ceremonies and Innovations, the taking away of the Service Booke, and the putting downe of the High CommiÅ¿Å¿ion Court, (which was called the court ChriÅ¿tian, though it was rather Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan) and the removall of the Hierarchy, root and branch, and the Å¿etting up, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing of a godly Presbyterie through the Kingdome; this was I Å¿ay <hi>all and the uttermoÅ¿t Reformation that was required by the moÅ¿t Å¿crupulous men then living that I knew;</hi> yea, I can Å¿peake thus much in the preÅ¿ence of God, <hi>that MaÅ¿ter</hi> RobinÅ¿on <hi>of</hi> Leiden, <hi>the PaÅ¿tor of the BrowniÅ¿t Church, there told mee and others, who are yet living to witneÅ¿Å¿e the truth of what I now Å¿ay, that if hee might in</hi> England <hi>have injoyed but the liberty of his MiniÅ¿try there, with an immunity but from the very Ceremonies, and that they had not forced him to a Å¿ubÅ¿cription to them, and impoÅ¿ed upon him the obÅ¿ervation of them, that hee had never Å¿eparated from it, or left that Church.</hi> This I can depoÅ¿e; Å¿o that all men may Å¿ee, the very diÅ¿penÅ¿ing with the ceremonies would then have given great content to the moÅ¿t auÅ¿tere profeÅ¿Å¿ors; how much more may any man Å¿uppoÅ¿e would they have Å¿ate down Å¿atisfied, if but the very ceremonies then might have bin removed?</p>
            <p>Surely if the Prelats had not beene infatuated, and had they but in thoÅ¿e things a little connived, and would have abated Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their rigour, for ought I know, they might have never been queÅ¿tioned, but they might have injoyed all their honours and greatneÅ¿Å¿e, and whatÅ¿oever they could have deÅ¿ired, and that with the good liking of all the people; had they I Å¿ay but <hi>diÅ¿penÅ¿ed with thoÅ¿e needleÅ¿Å¿e vanities, and had they but favoured honeÅ¿t and godly MiniÅ¿ters, and Å¿et up Lights, I meane good Preachers in the darke places and corners of the Kingdome, they would have beene beloved and reverenced of all men, and no man would have envied their Magnificence:</hi> yea, I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured had they but favoured good and godly men, the whole Kingdome would have beene their

friends; and whereas they all at laÅ¿t petitioned againÅ¿t them, they would have Å¿upplicated in their behalfe, that they might Å¿till have continued in their authority. But through their owne pride, and from an ambition of Lording it over their brethren, and by their tyrannicall practices, and licentious living they have brought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion upon themÅ¿elves, and beene one of the principall cauÅ¿es of all the miÅ¿eries and diÅ¿tractions, and of all the blood-Å¿hed that the three Kingdomes are now involved with; and for ought <hi>I</hi> can diÅ¿cerne our Independent Predicants now treading in their Å¿teps, and Å¿eeking to be the Å¿ole and onely men, and to Å¿et up their new government, <hi>which is more groundleÅ¿Å¿e then that of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> if the Lord of his infinite power and goodneÅ¿Å¿e prevent not their deÅ¿igne, they are in a way to bring a greater confuÅ¿ion upon both Church and State, and the three Kingdomes then that which were are all now imbroyled with: For I have heard them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily conclude amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, making uÅ¿e of that Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophet, <hi>that they Å¿hall come to thee, and not thou to them,</hi> intimating by thoÅ¿e words that they would never Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves to the Presbyterian claÅ¿Å¿icall Government, but that all the Presbyters muÅ¿t come in, and yeeld to their Independency, Å¿o that if they perÅ¿iÅ¿t in this their groundleÅ¿Å¿e ReÅ¿olution, wee may never promiÅ¿e unto our Å¿elves any peace or quiet, <hi>unleÅ¿Å¿e they may have what they aÅ¿pire to, and what they deÅ¿ire;</hi> and for ought I know there will be no end of their <hi>demands, nor no limits or bounds to their requeÅ¿ts and prayers: for they looke every day for new DiÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and expect yet more new Lights,</hi> Å¿aying, <hi>that all truths are not yet fully revealed, and therefore according to thoÅ¿e they Å¿ay they muÅ¿t act and be moved;</hi> Å¿o that by this their doctrine, there will never be a period of their Grolleries.</p>
            <p>And all men may well perceive what an endleÅ¿Å¿e worke they that Å¿hall Å¿atisfie the Independents will have by their very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: for to my knowledge the chiefeÅ¿t of them, and thoÅ¿e that are now in higheÅ¿t eÅ¿teeme in that Fraternity, and the chiefeÅ¿t men and women amongÅ¿t them at the beginning of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deÅ¿ired only <hi>the removall of the Ceremonies, and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, the removall of the Service Booke, the putting downe of the High CommiÅ¿Å¿ion Court, and the taking away of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy root and branch, and the Å¿etting up of the Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as it was in other Reformed Churches, and eÅ¿pecially in</hi>

The <hi>European</hi> horÅ¿es being onely acquainted with the warlike

If ever there was need of this exhortation, there is now Å¿ingular uÅ¿e of it, eÅ¿pecially in this diÅ¿tracted Nation wherein we live. For the diviÅ¿ion of a Kingdom is the ruine of it: the diviÅ¿ion of a family deÅ¿troys it: the diviÅ¿ion between brethren brings a confuÅ¿ion amongÅ¿t them. It hath ever bin obÅ¿erved, That diverÅ¿ity of judgment &amp; opinion hath made a difference in affection. The difference between the <hi>Iews</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in points of Religion, made the DiÅ¿ciples deÅ¿ire, That fire might come down from heaven to end that controverÅ¿ie.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48122:68"/>
The difference between us and the PapiÅ¿ts, and the diverÅ¿ity of opinions between us, made them, becauÅ¿e they could not bring down fire from heaven, fetch it out of hell, to blow up the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and becauÅ¿e that had not the deÅ¿ired effect, and the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity of opinion Å¿til remaining, makes the difference of their affection from us Å¿o great, that nothing can expiate their indignation againÅ¿t us, but the utter internetion and deÅ¿truction of us all; and this and this only, next unto our own Å¿ins, is the cauÅ¿e of all thoÅ¿e fatall calamities this miÅ¿erable kingdome is now imbroyled with. And therefore, all care and diligence among brethren, Å¿hould be uÅ¿ed to get a right underÅ¿tanding one of another, and to move them to bear one with another, and ever to call to minde the Å¿aying of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>Let not us contend together for we are brethren.</hi> I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, if there were a right underÅ¿tanding of the differences that are now among brethren, there could not be Å¿uch bitter expreÅ¿Å¿ions one againÅ¿t another, and Å¿uch alienation of affection as is now too frequent and too well known to the common enemy.

The contemplation of the Å¿ad condition, that will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably come upon that Land, Kingdome, and Church, where thoÅ¿e variances and heart-burnings are, and where there is Å¿uch diverÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of opinions, and by reaÅ¿on of them, Å¿uch difference in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, put me chiefely upon this imployment, to Å¿ee and try, if by any poÅ¿Å¿ible meanes, I could, by Å¿hewing wherein the difference between the brethren lyeth, be an inÅ¿trument of a good accord amongÅ¿t them: reÅ¿olving with my Å¿elf by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others do, to obÅ¿erve to the uttermoÅ¿t of my abilities, the royall Law, <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. 8.

The truth is, the miÅ¿-underÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of each others opinions and the miÅ¿-priÅ¿ian of each others intentions, is the onely cauÅ¿e of this diverÅ¿ity of affection which to the diÅ¿honour of God and of our holy profeÅ¿Å¿ion, and indeed to the diÅ¿grace of ChriÅ¿tian Religion, every where too much ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it Å¿elfe.

That I have dedicated this TreatiÅ¿e to no man, nor Å¿ought the patronage of any Authority, no mortall creature I preÅ¿ume, will blame me, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ReaÅ¿ons.

And when I moÅ¿t humbly petitioned his highneÅ¿Å¿e, complaining againÅ¿t the injuÅ¿tice done me, and moÅ¿t Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ively Å¿upplicated his MajeÅ¿ty (who was the <hi>CaeÅ¿ar</hi> to whom only I could then appeal) that he would be pleaÅ¿ed to grant me one of theÅ¿e humble requeÅ¿ts, either That his MajeÅ¿ty would be pleaÅ¿ed, but for one houre to give me a hearing of my juÅ¿t defence; or if

that could not be granted, That at leÅ¿t he would then grant me that liberty in his Kingdome, that he denyed not to Crows and Kites and other Vermine, that I might provide for my young ones; and if his highneÅ¿Å¿e would not be pleaÅ¿ed to condeÅ¿cend unto either of the former juÅ¿t demands, That then he would give me leave to depart the Kingdom, and to go into any other Country where I might enjoy my Liberty and provide for my poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treÅ¿Å¿ed family. I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured there was never a more equall Petition put up to any Prince in the world, yet his MajeÅ¿tie vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿afed not to yeeld unto any of theÅ¿e my requeÅ¿ts, nor to any other Petition put up either by my poor diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed wife or calamitous children; Å¿o that without any wrong unto his MajeÅ¿ty, I may truely Å¿ay, That <hi>Paul</hi> found more favour from a Heathen Roman <hi>CaeÅ¿ar,</hi> then I had from a ChriÅ¿tian King, the defender of the faith. After I Å¿aw all poÅ¿Å¿ibility of releefe was now taken from me, I writ my Apology to the BiÅ¿hops themÅ¿elves, diÅ¿covering unto them their unjuÅ¿t proceedings in their Courts, and their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings towards my Å¿elfe, and gave them my reaÅ¿ons of all I Å¿pake, without any offenÅ¿ive language and without any perturbation of Spirit; and Dedicated this my Booke to the Lords of his MajeÅ¿ties Privy Councell, expecting ayde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe from them, and indeed I had no hope of Å¿uccour from any other, nor knew none to whom I could better apply my Å¿elfe, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tly imploring their patronage; but they, as it is well knowne, of Patrons became my unjuÅ¿t Judges, and after they had made me a Å¿pectacle to Men and Angells, and expoÅ¿ed me to the Å¿corne and ludibry of the world, Å¿ent me into baniÅ¿hment, where I lived a living death and a dying life, and Å¿uffered Å¿uch intolerable miÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all Å¿orts, as would exceed beliefe to relate; and I am moÅ¿t confident, if all the particulars were truly known, the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the like, and there I had ended my dolefull life, had not God of his infinite mercy called this Parliament, and put into their hearts to redeem me from my captivity; for the which incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable favour, I do, as of duty I am ever bound, profeÅ¿Å¿e my Å¿elfe to the laÅ¿t drop of my blood to be their Å¿ervant in the Lord, and in all their moÅ¿t juÅ¿t and honourable imployments; I hope, with all fidelity to anÅ¿wer to the expectation of the world, and Å¿hall in life and death Å¿hew my Å¿elfe to be one, that without all by-reÅ¿pects Å¿hall ever aime at the glory of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the honour of them and my

               <p>There is a two-fold queÅ¿tion between us, they call the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and our Brethren they tearme Independents. The firÅ¿t is concerning the government of the Church, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queÅ¿tion is, concerning the gathering of Churches: but of that in its due place. The firÅ¿t queÅ¿tion is whether many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations or ChriÅ¿tian AÅ¿Å¿emblies (commonly called Churches in our dialect) in the which there are all the acts of worÅ¿hip, or all Ordinances, as the pure preaching of the GoÅ¿pell, the due and right adminiÅ¿tration of the Sacraments, the true invocation of God, DiÅ¿cipline rightly executed, and all other performances, which make for the eÅ¿Å¿ence and form of a true Church, and in the which aÅ¿Å¿emblies likewiÅ¿e, they have all Å¿uch officers and helps of Government<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as in their Å¿everall places being rightly imployed, may Å¿erve for the edification of the Å¿ame, and mutuall comfort and benefit of each other, and the preÅ¿ervation ofall, as Presbyters, doth preaching and ruling and Deacons, and all other Officers; I Å¿ay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48122:71"/>
the queÅ¿tion between us and the brethren is, Whether all theÅ¿e Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, may be accounted but one Church, or make but one Church within their Precincts; and be to be under the government and rule of one Presbytery, or a Councell or Colledge of many Presbyters together, upon which, all the Congregations and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies under it are to depend; and to which in all weighty buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es they are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, for any injury or conceived wrong, or Å¿candall; or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreÅ¿Å¿e of any abuÅ¿es in Doctrine or manners, and for the exerciÅ¿ing of Church-DiÅ¿cipline upon incorrigable and Å¿candalous offenders; as admonition for giving offence, Å¿uÅ¿penÅ¿ion from the Ordinances till amendment and reformation; or if obÅ¿tinate, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or whether every one of thoÅ¿e particular Congregations, or AÅ¿Å¿emblies be they never Å¿o Å¿mall, Å¿everally or conÅ¿idered a part, and by themÅ¿elves be Independent; that is to Å¿ay, have full and plenary authority within themÅ¿elves, without reference to this, or any other great Councell or Presbytery, for tranÅ¿acting or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all differences about faith or manners amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, or for the redreÅ¿Å¿ing of any grievances or abuÅ¿es, or the exerciÅ¿ing of the power of DiÅ¿cipline or juriÅ¿diction, and from the which there is no appeal for relief, though the parties offended conceive they have never Å¿o much injury or wrong done them? In a word, whether two Presbyters with a Å¿lender Congregation, have an abÅ¿olute kinde of Spirituall Soveraignty among themÅ¿elves, in their own Congregation, and as ample authority as was given to the whole Colledge of the ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and to the whole Presbytery in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem?</hi> And this is the firÅ¿t QueÅ¿tion: Which that it may the better be underÅ¿tood, I will propound it in a Å¿imile, and that in a matter well known unto all men: The government of this famous City of <hi>London,</hi> and of many other great Cities through the Kingdome, are called Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, that is to Å¿ay, majeÅ¿tracies; and have in them a Secular or Civill Signory or Presbytry, who are inveÅ¿ted with Anthority to exerciÅ¿e all acts of Government amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, as if they were an abÅ¿olute Principality; and this Government, by which all Citizens and inhabitants within their Precincts and liberties, are to be ruled and ordered, as occaÅ¿ion and neceÅ¿Å¿ity Å¿hall require, is committed to the Lord Mayors, Aldermen, and Common-Councell, who onely by Å¿uch other Officers as they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48122:71"/>
Å¿hall elect and chooÅ¿e, are to manage and exerciÅ¿e this government Å¿o, that all particular Citizens, and all the Companies of Å¿everall TradeÅ¿men, are in their particular Wards, Precincts, and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hips, by their conÅ¿titutions and Charter, to depend upon the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of that CounÅ¿ell, and are to make their addreÅ¿Å¿es unto them upon any urgent occaÅ¿ion, or conceived wrong, or when it concerns the common good, and for the time to Å¿tand unto their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement. Now then, the queÅ¿tion between us and our Brethren is, as if there Å¿hould ariÅ¿e a controverÅ¿ie in theÅ¿e Å¿everall Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Whether the Companies in each City where they all have their Å¿everall Halls, and their Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies and meetings upon all occaÅ¿ions, and have all their Officers, and exerciÅ¿e alÅ¿o a power of ruling and juriÅ¿diction among themÅ¿elves be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that is to Å¿ay, have plenary authority within themÅ¿elves without reference to the Lord Mayor or Aldermen or Common-counÅ¿ell, to determine of all things among their Å¿everall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and from the which there is no appeale for reliefe; though one be never Å¿o much injured and damnified by any unjuÅ¿t act; and whether theÅ¿e Å¿everall Companies and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies be each of them a Å¿everall Corporation or MagiÅ¿tracy, or all of them put together make but one Corporation, under one civill Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-counÅ¿ell? This I thought fit to propound, that every one may the better underÅ¿tand the queÅ¿tion. Now, as this kingdome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath its Å¿everall Porporations through all Pounties, and the which Porporations, although they have their Å¿everall Pompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in them, yet are all dependent upon a civill Presbytery and Common-counÅ¿ell, and every Company in them makes not a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Porporation or MagiÅ¿tracy, or a Å¿everall City, but are all dependent upon the Common-counÅ¿ell or Presbytery, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordering and governing of them in all their common affaires, and for the redreÅ¿Å¿ing of abuÅ¿es, and taking away and removing of common grievances, and have their Å¿everall appeals to the Common-counÅ¿ell, the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen; and if they finde no juÅ¿tice there nor Å¿atisfaction, have their redreÅ¿Å¿e and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Å¿ome generall Court, or Å¿ome Å¿upreame judicature, as to the Parliament of the Kingdome, who redreÅ¿Å¿e and determine all things according to the lawes and conÅ¿titutions of the whole Kingdome. So in the Kingdome of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48122:72"/>
is his Church, all theÅ¿e Å¿everall Churches which we reade of in the holy Scrupture of the New TeÅ¿tament, are Å¿o many Å¿everall Corporations and AÅ¿Å¿ociations, all the Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies as Å¿o many Å¿everall Companies in them, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Presbytery or Common-counÅ¿ell and Colledge of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tors and Rulers, all making up but one Church in every one of their juriÅ¿dictions and Å¿everall Precincts, though they be conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tent of never Å¿o many Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of the Cities or Townes wherein they are, or according to the Å¿everall Hundreds or DiviÅ¿ions aÅ¿Å¿igned to each Presbytery, and all theÅ¿e Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿ociations to be groverned by their Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Presbyteries for the better ordering and preÅ¿erving of the Å¿ame, to the which every particular man, as well as any AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or Congregation, may have their appeal for the redreÅ¿Å¿e of any abuÅ¿es or enormities, and if they finde themÅ¿elves wronged there, then they have appeals to Å¿ome other higher Presbytery or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell of Divines for relief and juÅ¿tice; and both they and all other of the Å¿everall Corporations to be governed and regulated by the Laws and Statutes given by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, the onely Head and King of his Church, according onely to whoÅ¿e laws they are to be governed and ruled for the common good and preÅ¿ervation of the whole Church, divided into thoÅ¿e Å¿everall JuriÅ¿dictions, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations or Precincts, in imitation as neer now as may be of the Churches of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem, EpheÅ¿us, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> &amp;c. and whoÅ¿e lawes alone muÅ¿t be the rule for the ordering of all their government, doctrine, and manners.</p>
               <p>I have premiÅ¿ed this I have now Å¿aid, that all men may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underÅ¿tand the Å¿tate of the QueÅ¿tion and controverÅ¿ie in hand. Now then, if it Å¿hall be made appear out of the holy Scripture, That all the Å¿everall Churches we have mention of in the New TeÅ¿tament, were all particular corporations or aÅ¿Å¿ociations, and governed by a Common-Councell of Presbyters, or by a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall government in each of them; and that there were many aÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations in thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Churches, and all of them had their diÅ¿tinct Officers amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, in the which likewiÅ¿e they had all the Acts of WorÅ¿hip amongÅ¿t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and did partake in all ordinances of Church-fellowÅ¿hip, eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the preaching of the Word, Prayer, &amp; in the Sacraments of BaptiÅ¿m and the Lords Supper, and yet made but one Church,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48122:72"/>
and were all governed by a common-counÅ¿ell of Presbyters, or by a common Presbyterie within their Precincts, then it muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity follow, that as the Mother-churches were firÅ¿t govern'd, all the Daughter-churches to the end of the world muÅ¿t be Å¿o go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, and according to that rule that is Å¿et down in the Word of God. So then, the queÅ¿tion in hand between us and our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is, <hi>Whether, there were many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies in any of thoÅ¿e primitive Churches, as in that of IeruÅ¿alem the Mother Church, and many Elders or Presbyters in that Church, and all other Officers; and whether all thoÅ¿e Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies were one Church, and thoÅ¿e Presbyters and Officers all of them Elders and Officers of that one Church, and whether all thoÅ¿e Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies were under one Presbytery?</hi> Which is the opinion of the Presbyterians, and the contrary that of the Independents. This I Å¿ay is the queÅ¿tion between us and our Brethren. Now then if it can be proved, that there were more Beleevers in the Church of JeruÅ¿alem then could all meet in one place, or in one congregation for all acts of worÅ¿hip; and if it can be evidently elucidated, that there were Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall aÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations in the Church of JeruÅ¿alem, &amp; yet Å¿o, as they made but one church for government; then our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity acknowledge that the church of JeruÅ¿alem, was govern'd by a common-councell of Presbyters, or was presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially governed. Neither did our Brethren ever yet undertake to prove, that in caÅ¿e there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblies in JeruÅ¿alem, they had Å¿everall and independent presbyteries, neither it they Å¿hould go about to prove, could they do it. And therfore we may conclude, and that with very good reaÅ¿on and warrantable authority, that as the Mother-church, the church of JeruÅ¿alem, in her greateÅ¿t glory was govern'd, Å¿o all other Churches muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be regulated to the end of the world; <hi>For out of Zion Å¿hal go forth the Law, &amp; the Word of the Lord from IeruÅ¿alem, IÅ¿ay</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3. We muÅ¿t have both our Law from thence, and our paterne of government. And out Brethren do make the Church of JeruÅ¿alem the patern of their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Now that all things may be handled in good order and in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall way, I will reduce the whole DiÅ¿putation concerning the firÅ¿t QueÅ¿tion into theÅ¿e foure PropoÅ¿itions, and prove them in order. The firÅ¿t, <hi>That there were many Congregations and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, in the which they enjoyed all acts of worÅ¿hip, and all the Ordinances amongÅ¿t</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48122:73"/>
themÅ¿elves, and did partake of all acts of Church-fellowÅ¿hip, eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of preaching, and in the adminiÅ¿tration of the Sacraments and Prayer, <hi>and that before the PerÅ¿ecution we reade of,</hi> Acts <hi>8.</hi> v. <hi>1. The Å¿econd,</hi> That all theÅ¿e Congregations and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies made but one Church. <hi>The third,</hi> That the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, ordered, and ruled this Church, joyntly and by a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counÅ¿ell and Presbytery. <hi>The fourth,</hi> That this Church of IeruÅ¿alem and the government of the Å¿ame, is to be a pattern for all Å¿everall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies in any City or vicinity to unite into one Church; and for the Officers of thoÅ¿e congregations to governe that Church joyntly in a Colledge or Presbyterie.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the proof of theÅ¿e particulars, it will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e in generall to take notice that all the Churches we read of in the New TeÅ¿tament, were AriÅ¿tocratically and Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally governed, and were all dependent upon their Å¿everall PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries; and that the ordering and managing of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lay onely upon the Presbyterie; and was their peculiar who had the power of the Keyes. Now ChriÅ¿t gave the Keyes to the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters only, and whatÅ¿oever the ApoÅ¿tles did in ordering and Å¿etling the government of the Church, they did by ChriÅ¿ts command; and that order and conÅ¿titution they Å¿et down in the Church, was to be perpetuated and continued to the end of the world. And the violating of this order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conÅ¿titution, was the occaÅ¿ion of the riÅ¿e and growth of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriÅ¿t, and the very cauÅ¿e of all thoÅ¿e confuÅ¿ions that the ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world hath for theÅ¿e many generations been wearied and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with; and the occaÅ¿ion of all thoÅ¿e SchiÅ¿mes, Sects, and HereÅ¿ies the world hath ever Å¿warmed with: and the re-eÅ¿tabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing and reducing of it to its priÅ¿tine conÅ¿titution, will be a means not only of removing all Å¿candall, and taking away of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion amongÅ¿t Brethren, and be a Å¿ingular means alÅ¿o of eÅ¿tabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing a flouriÅ¿hing government in Church &amp; State, and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of God upon the three Kingdoms, but a way alÅ¿o of ruining that Man of Sinne, and of making an abÅ¿olute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation through the whole world.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore firÅ¿t take notice what government was eÅ¿tabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed by God in all the Primitive Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>And when they had ordained them Presbyters</hi> (for Å¿o it is in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) <hi>in every Church, and had prayed with faÅ¿ting, they commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48122:73"/>
                  <hi>them to the Lord, on whom they beleeved.</hi> Here are two things obÅ¿ervable. The firÅ¿t that the government of the Church was committed to the Presbyters. The Å¿econd, that the Presbyteriall government was that government that was eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in every Church; for Å¿o Å¿aith the Holy GhoÅ¿t, <hi>when they had ordained them Presbyters in every Church.</hi> This was Gods ordinance, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17. <hi>And from Miletus he Å¿ent to EpheÅ¿us, and called the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church.</hi> Here we Å¿ee there were many Presbyters in one Church. And <hi>VerÅ¿e</hi> 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your Å¿elves,</hi> Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>and to all the flock over which the Holy GhoÅ¿t hath made you BiÅ¿hops, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaÅ¿ed with his own blood.</hi> Here, as we may obÅ¿erve, that in Gods Dialect, Presbyters and BiÅ¿hops were all one, Å¿o likewiÅ¿e is evident that the Church was committed to their government: this Church therefore of <hi>EpheÅ¿us</hi> was under a Presbytery, and was to be regulated joyntly by them by a common-councell of Presbyters. And <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 1. verÅ¿. 5. <hi>For this cauÅ¿e,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>life I thee in Creet, that thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t put in order the things that are wanting, and ordaine Presbyters in every City, as I appointed thee. If any man be blameleÅ¿Å¿e, &amp;c. for a BiÅ¿hop muÅ¿t be blameleÅ¿Å¿e as the Steward of God,</hi> &amp;c. From this place likewiÅ¿e we may take notice of the parity between Presbyter and BiÅ¿hop, and that the Presbyterian government was that way of ruling that God appointed, not in one City onely, but in every City, and that theÅ¿e Presbyters were the Stewards in Gods houÅ¿e, which is his Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and had the government of thoÅ¿e Churches in every City laid upon them, which they were joyntly to governe and order by the common-counÅ¿ell of Presbyters. And <hi>Paul</hi> in his firÅ¿t EpiÅ¿tle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 5. v. 17. <hi>Let the Presbyters,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in word and doctrine.</hi> Still we ever obÅ¿erve, that the rule and government of the Church was in the Presbyters hands. And the Author to the EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ch. 13. 7. <hi>Remember,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>them that have the rule over you, who have Å¿pake unto you the Word of God, whoÅ¿e faith follow, conÅ¿idering the end of their converÅ¿ation.</hi> And verÅ¿. 17. <hi>Obey,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>them that have the rule over you, and Å¿ubmit your Å¿elves, for they watch for your Å¿oules, as they that muÅ¿t give an account,</hi> &amp;c. And in verÅ¿. 24. <hi>Salute all them,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>that have the rule over you, and all the</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48122:74"/>
                  <hi>Saints.</hi> Here againe he injoynes all the Churches to yeild obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves unto the government of the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, Å¿hewing them that it is their place to obey, and for their MiniÅ¿ters to rule; and that Å¿o long as they command in the Lord, they out of conÅ¿cience ought to obey them, and that for a double reaÅ¿on; <hi>For they watch,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>for your Å¿ouls,</hi> and <hi>they muÅ¿t alÅ¿o give an account</hi> of their Å¿tewardÅ¿hip. And in 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5, 1, 2, 3. <hi>The Presbyters that are among you,</hi> Å¿aith Saint <hi>Peter, I exhort, who am alÅ¿o a Presbyter, and a witneÅ¿Å¿e of the Å¿ufferings of ChriÅ¿t, and alÅ¿o a partaker of the glory that Å¿hall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the over Å¿ight thereof, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traint, but willingly, &amp;c. neither as being Lords over Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, but being examples to the flock.</hi> And Saint <hi>James</hi> chap. 5. ver. 14. <hi>Is any among you Å¿ick?</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>let him call for the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the Church.</hi> He doth not Å¿ay of the Churches, but of the Church. So that the Presbyterian government was in every Church, and every Church was to Å¿ubmit it Å¿elf unto the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. it is Å¿aid, that <hi>Paul and Barnabas went up to the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters, &amp;c. And when they came to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem they were received of the Church</hi> (it is not Å¿aid of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but of the Church) and of the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters, &amp;c. and <hi>VerÅ¿e</hi> 6. And the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters came together to conÅ¿ider of the matter, &amp;c. and <hi>VerÅ¿.</hi> 22. <hi>Then pleaÅ¿ed it the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles and Presbyters with the whole Church,</hi> &amp;c. and wrote Letters by them after this manner. <hi>The ApoÅ¿tles, and Presbyters, and Brethren.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 17. <hi>And when we were come to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem,</hi> Å¿aith Saint <hi>Luke, the Brethren received us gladly. And the day following Paul went in with us in to Iames, and all the Presbyters were preÅ¿ent.</hi> From all which places, and many more which might be produced, it is moÅ¿t clear and evident, that in all Cities there was a Presbytery, and that the Presbyters had the power of order, namely, of preaching, and the power of juriÅ¿di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that is of ruling, which was ever to be exerciÅ¿ed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not alone; and that conÅ¿iÅ¿ted in admitting of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and in conventing men before them upon occaÅ¿ion, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniÅ¿hing if any offended, in Å¿uÅ¿pending them from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion till reformation or amendment; and if they continued obÅ¿tinate and incorrigble, in excommunicating and caÅ¿ting of them out of the Church, and upon repentance, in receiving of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48122:74"/>
them in again, and in ordaining of Officers, and in appointing the times of meeting, and the places where.</p>
               <p>And within theÅ¿e limits, as I conceive, is all the power given to the Presbyters terminated, and this they are by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance joyntly and by the common-counÅ¿ell of Presbyters to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e, and it peculiarly belongeth unto them; and therefore the Presbyterian government was the order of ruling and governing all Churches, that God himÅ¿elf eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, and is to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the end of the world; neither do I ever read, that the people or the congregations were joyned with them in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion, or had any power given them of ruling. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿eth of himÅ¿elf in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. that whatÅ¿oever he writ in his EpiÅ¿tles <hi>Were the Commands of the Lord.</hi> And the Å¿ame may be Å¿aid of all the other ApoÅ¿tles. Now <hi>Paul</hi> writ to <hi>Titus,</hi> that the Churches in all Cities Å¿hould be governed by a Presbytery. And in the firÅ¿t EpiÅ¿tle to <hi>Timothy</hi> he commands <hi>Timothy</hi> again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in chap. 5. verÅ¿. 21. and in chap. 6. v. 12, 13. I give thee charge in the Å¿ight of God, Å¿aith he, <hi>That thou keep this Command without Å¿pot, unblameable till the appearing of our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> Here <hi>Timothy</hi> and all MiniÅ¿ters in him, are to the end of the world bound to maintain that government unblameable that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the ApoÅ¿tles; and that was the Presbyterian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ruling of all Churches by joynt conÅ¿ent, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon counÅ¿ell or Colledge of Presbyters; Å¿o that nothing ought to be done or tranÅ¿acted of publick concernment without their joynt and mutuall accord or agreement and common conÅ¿ent of the Presbytery. And therfore when <hi>Diotrephes</hi> aÅ¿Å¿umed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf and his particular congregation a power and authority to rule according to his will and pleaÅ¿ure, without the conÅ¿ent of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytory, &amp; oppoÅ¿ed <hi>Iohn</hi> the Presbyter, he Å¿harply reproves his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and Å¿ignifies to the Church <hi>EpiÅ¿t.</hi> 3. That when he came he would remember his words, and teach him how to prate againÅ¿t the Presbytery with malicious words; <hi>For he</hi> (Å¿aith S. <hi>Iohn) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth not himÅ¿elf only to prate maliciouÅ¿ly againÅ¿t us, but he will not receive his brethren, nor Å¿uffer others, but caÅ¿teth them out of the Church; which is an evill thing in him;</hi> Å¿aith Saint <hi>Iohn: But for you,</hi> Å¿aith he, Å¿peaking to the Church, <hi>follow not that which is evill but that which is good.</hi> It was evill in him to aÅ¿Å¿ume unto himÅ¿elf alone, and his particular Congregation, that power that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48122:75"/>
belonged unto the colledge or councell of Presbyters, and was to be moderated and exerciÅ¿ed onely by the conjoynt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conÅ¿ent of the Presbytery. For God had appointed, that his Church Å¿hould be governed by a Presbytery; and <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would have his Congregation Independent, and have an abÅ¿olute juriÅ¿diction within it Å¿elf, <hi>Which,</hi> Å¿aith Saint <hi>Iohn, is an evill thing.</hi> So that I cannot but wonder our brethren the Independents Å¿hould call <hi>Diotrephes</hi> the Patriarch of the Presbyterians, as one of them did to me not long Å¿ince; whereas if the place be du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed and conÅ¿idered; it will appear that he was the firÅ¿t that oppoÅ¿ed the Presbyterian Govenment, and for the which he was by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿harply reproved, and in him, all that follow his Å¿teps, and will not Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves to the Presbytery which is Gods Ordinance, and that will not receive the brethren into the Churches, but upon their own termes and conditions. But of this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e when I come to the Å¿econd QueÅ¿tion.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I muÅ¿t here make reply to what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> by way of AnÅ¿wer hath to Å¿ay to this Argument drawn from <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes</hi> his practiÅ¿e which was occaÅ¿ioned as I related before, by reaÅ¿on of a diÅ¿courÅ¿e between me and an Independent, who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, That <hi>Diotriphes</hi> was the patriarch of all the Presbyterians: which opinion of his Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> doth Å¿eem to favour, as by his words may appear, but I hope to make the contrary more evident then yet it hath been, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was the primate of the Independents, and of all thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way. But firÅ¿t I will Å¿et down Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his words at large, to take away all occaÅ¿ions of their calumniating tongues, who ordinarily uÅ¿e to Å¿ay, That we keep from the world their Arguments, that we may the better delude the people, and hold them in ignorance. His words therefore by way of anÅ¿wer to that Argument are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>Now let the reader judge <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> whether the Doctor be not much miÅ¿taken in his commentary expoÅ¿ition and application of this place of Scripture. And let me give you to underÅ¿tand, that Saint Iohn Å¿aith verÅ¿e the <hi>9.</hi> I wrote unto the Church. But Å¿eeing no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of any particular congregation, how can the Doctor Å¿o confidently affirme that it was his particular congregation? Now the reader may Å¿ee plainly, that the Doctor can expound thoÅ¿e bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and their Elders or Presbyters, which the Scripture calls a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48122:75"/>
Church, to be a particular congregation. And what it was which Saint Iohn had written to the Church is not in this Epistle, nor in any other Scripture delcared, except it was, to receive thoÅ¿e brethren which he Å¿aith ver. <hi>8</hi> ought to be received, and ver. <hi>10</hi> whom <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi> would not receive, how then doth the Doctor Å¿ay that <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi> aÅ¿Å¿umed that power to himÅ¿elfe, which belonged unto the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Councell of Presbyters, without whoÅ¿e joynt and mutuall agreement, and common conÅ¿ent nothing ought to be done or tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of publike concernment? is the receiving of brethren, or caÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of brethren a power which belongs to a colledge of Presbyters, and neither the one nor the other may be tranÅ¿acted by the Elders and Brethren of a particular congregation unleÅ¿Å¿e the Court or common-councell of PreÅ¿byters conjoyntly conÅ¿ent unto it? Let it be alÅ¿o conÅ¿idered, that <hi>D otrephes</hi> oppoÅ¿ed the brethren and forbad them that would have received thoÅ¿e who Saint John Å¿aith <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> we ought to receive, yea and caÅ¿t them out <hi>verÅ¿e 10.</hi> of the Church, to wit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate them. Doth it hereby appear that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would have his congregation Independent, and have an abÅ¿olute juriÅ¿diction within it Å¿elfe? No, but <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would lord it over the Church, and have the preeminency above his brethren, whether fellow-Elders or fellow Saints. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> loving the primacy amongst them, he would be the Primate and Metropolitan of the Church, and have the preeminency of all the PreÅ¿byters in it, and brethren of it. The Doctor could have urged this Scripture againÅ¿t the domineering Prelates, and why Å¿hould he marvell, that his brethren Å¿hould now urge it againÅ¿t the Court of PreÅ¿byters. It is confeÅ¿t that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did that which was evill in uÅ¿urping authority over the Church and thoÅ¿e brethren he caÅ¿t out of the Church; But that he was the firÅ¿t that oppoÅ¿ed the PreÅ¿byterian government, or that he did affront a Court or common<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>councell of Presbyters, it is more then I know, or the Doctor can prove. For had <hi>Diotrephes</hi> done Å¿o, why was he not convented before them? Surely the ApoÅ¿tle Saint Iohn would rather have written to the colledge of PreÅ¿byters (if there were any Å¿uch) then to the Church, or in writing to the Church, would tather have Å¿ent him a Å¿ummons to appear at Å¿ome conÅ¿iÅ¿tory before the Court and common-councell of PreÅ¿byters, then to warne them to take heed of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> evill, that they did not follow it. And doubtleÅ¿Å¿e St John would have writen thus: <hi>Diotrephes</hi> loves to be a Primate amongÅ¿t you, wherefore when the PreÅ¿bytry, that is to Å¿ay, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿tracy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48122:76"/>
or Signiory of grave, Å¿olid, learned, religious, and wiÅ¿e Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and MiniÅ¿ters come to keep order, and meet together in a Court and common-councell, I will remember his deeds, and informe, or complain to the Court and common-councell of PreÅ¿byters, that he prates againÅ¿t us (the PreÅ¿byters) with malicious words. But the ApoÅ¿tle Saint Iohn (did not know any Court or Common-councell of PreÅ¿byters, neither ClaÅ¿Å¿icall nor Synodicall, to appeal unto) Nor can the Doctor make good thoÅ¿e appeals he mentioneth <hi>page 10<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> to be according to the Scripture of truth, to wit, that every particular man, as well as any aÅ¿Å¿embly or congregation, may have their appeals to the PreÅ¿bytry of their Precinct, hundred, or diviÅ¿ion under whoÅ¿e juriÅ¿dictions they were, and if they found themÅ¿elves wronged there, that they have appeals to Å¿ome other higher PreÅ¿bytry or Councell of Divines for releefe and juÅ¿tice. I only aske the Doctor how he can prove thoÅ¿e appeals by Scripture; and if he could, whether that higher PreÅ¿bytry or councell of Divines (especially if they may Å¿ay the Holy GhoÅ¿t and wee) be not as Independent as theÅ¿e brethren and their churches, againÅ¿t whom the Doctor hath written. And if Å¿o, then Å¿uch a high Presbytry or councell of Divines, is not Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance by the Doctors own confeÅ¿Å¿ion and affirmation. Therefore the ApoÅ¿tle writes to the Church or particular congregation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a Member and an Elder, whom he knew had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to judge him as well as the Church or particular congregation of <hi>Corinth</hi> had power to judge them that were members therein, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>5. 12. 13.</hi> and therefore might as warantably admoniÅ¿h <hi>Diotrephes</hi> as the Church of ColoÅ¿Å¿e might Archipus: <hi>ColoÅ¿Å¿. 4. 17.</hi> And if nothing of publike concernment ought to be done or tranÅ¿acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the joynt and mutuall accord or agreement, and common conÅ¿ent of the Presbytry; Iohn the Presbyter would not have tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿o farr, as to take upon himÅ¿elfe this authority over <hi>Diotrephes</hi> to tell the Church of his faults, and to Å¿ay, he would remember him and Å¿harply reprove him, and teach him to prate againÅ¿t the Presbytry with malicious words, which belonged unto the Court and common-councell of Presbyters. But I Å¿hall have a juÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion to Å¿ay more touching this matter, in the anÅ¿wer unto the third question, and therefore paÅ¿Å¿ing by the objection with his anÅ¿wer mentioned page <hi>19.</hi> to the <hi>29.</hi> unto its due place. I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to conÅ¿ider the Doctors proof of his firÅ¿t propoÅ¿ition, which he laboureth firÅ¿t by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Å¿uch Scriptures, as he conceiveth make for the manifeÅ¿tation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48122:76"/>
of the truth, and from thence frames and formeth his arguments. <hi>Thus Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>in way of reply Å¿peaketh to my argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> Diotrephes <hi>and of his intention what he will do in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uing diÅ¿courÅ¿e to all the other arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have here Å¿et down his words at large, omitting only the greek and latin texts which he School-boy-like Å¿cribleth, to little other purpoÅ¿e than to Å¿hew his own vanity, and to perÅ¿wade the ignorant people, that he is Å¿ome-body in the Greeke and Latine tongue (which kind of learning notwithÅ¿tanding the moÅ¿t of his fraternity generally deÅ¿piÅ¿e and contemne) I have therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, eÅ¿pecially having learned this leÅ¿Å¿on from Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 13. verÅ¿. 19. <hi>rather to speak five words to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding of the people,</hi> that I might <hi>teach others, then ten thouÅ¿and words in an unknown tongue.</hi> And truly unleÅ¿Å¿e there be Å¿ome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverÅ¿ie concerning the Interpretation or about the text (as there is not here) I conceive it the greateÅ¿t folly in the world; writing in the vulgar tongue and for the common benefit of all men, to inÅ¿ert Å¿entences either of Greek or Latin, except very varly; for it but pudders the reader that is not skilled in the languages, neither do we finde that it was the cuÅ¿tome either of the holy Prophets, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ancient Greek or Roman fathers in all their Writings or Sermons, to uÅ¿e any, but their vulgar tongue without it were very Å¿eldom and that with interpretation. I Å¿ay therefore, thoÅ¿e flaÅ¿hes being excepted I have punctually Å¿et down all that he had to Å¿ay againÅ¿t any of my arguments both here and every where, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor any of his party may complain, that I had not Å¿et down their words in their full Å¿trength, and Å¿o might fall into the Å¿ame condemnation with him, who hacketh and minÅ¿eth my arguments at pleaÅ¿ure, picking and chooÅ¿ing what he thinks himÅ¿elf beÅ¿t able to deal with, either wholly omitting the other or Å¿lighting of them which is the ordinary method both of Mr <hi>Knollys, J. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all the Independents, wherein they deal not fairly with me, nor ingenuouÅ¿ly nor candidly with the people: for in Å¿o doing they delude them and meerly play the jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
               <p>This large diÅ¿courÅ¿e of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> if it be well weighed, hath but little Å¿ubÅ¿tance in it, it conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of abÅ¿urdities and contraditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and flat denyalls of that which he often granteth. In breife, if the reader will but duly conÅ¿ider every paÅ¿Å¿age of his anÅ¿wer,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48122:77"/>
with whathe grants in the third and the 11. pages of his pamplet, he will Å¿peedily perceive, that whiles he labours to confute others, he gives a fatall blow to his own cauÅ¿e, and overthrowes that opinion which both he and all thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way labour to maintaine, and withall by the examination of the particulars he will the better diÅ¿cerne into the futility of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> and the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoÅ¿e of his party, that beleeve &amp; take every word of his, for an Oracle though it be never Å¿o diÅ¿tructive totheir own cauÅ¿e. The Å¿um of this his anÅ¿wer is this, that I am<hi>miÅ¿taken in my comentary expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition and application of this place of Scripture.</hi> TheÅ¿e are his words.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e therefore, in the firÅ¿t place to take notice what he denyeth in his anÅ¿wer, and what he affirmeth, with the reaÅ¿ons of both, that the reader may the more eaÅ¿ily perceive the vanity of error and the force and efficacy of truth. FirÅ¿t he denyeth that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would have had an abÅ¿olvte juriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within himÅ¿elf and have had his Congregation indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that he was the firÅ¿t that oppoÅ¿ed the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or that he had any particular congregation: He deneyeth alÅ¿o that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew any Court or Common counÅ¿ell of PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters either ClaÅ¿Å¿icall or Synodicall to appeale to his time. The reaÅ¿ons of his denyals are theÅ¿e. FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e Å¿aith he, there is no mention made of any particular congregation <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had. Secondly, it is not declared what it was that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had writ unto the Church in his EpiÅ¿tle nor in any other Scripture, except it were to receive thoÅ¿e brethren which <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would not receive and therfore, how Å¿aith God can the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

BeÅ¿ides Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would then have wrot rather to the Colledge of Presbyters (if they had been any Å¿uch) than to the Church, or in writing to the Church would rather have Å¿ent him a Å¿ummons to appeare at Å¿ome ConÅ¿iÅ¿tory, than to warne them to take heede of his evill, that they did not follow it, and doubtleÅ¿Å¿e he would have written thus. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> loves to be a Primate amongÅ¿t you: therefore when the Presbytery comes to keepe order, and to meet together in a Court common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48122:77"/>
I will remember his deeds, and informe and complaine to the Court that he prats againÅ¿t us with malicious words. Now when neither of this was done by the Presbytry, nor by Saint<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is manifeÅ¿t that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did not oppoÅ¿e the Presbytry, and that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> then knew not of any Court or common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Presbyters either ClaÅ¿Å¿icall or Synodicall to appeale to in his time. And then in the third place he putteth me upon the proofe of thoÅ¿e appeales I made mention of page 10. affirming that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them good: And in the laÅ¿t place, he afferteth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having thus briefly Å¿et down what MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> both denies and affirmes with the reaÅ¿ons of each, I Å¿hall now anÅ¿wer to every Å¿everall branch in order; and if I be the more large in my reply, I crave pardon, in regard it is not only a buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of publicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and about the principle queÅ¿tion now in debate, but that it will give the more light to the wholo following diÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>

they were not to depart, as too too many of the Independent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters now amongÅ¿t us dayly do, leaving the poore Å¿heepe in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneÅ¿Å¿e: I Å¿ay when all theÅ¿e things are evident out of the holy Scripture it neceÅ¿Å¿arily followeth, when <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was an Elder and Presbyter in that Church Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writ unto, which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth, that he had there his particular congregation, and therfore there was no neede of making any mention of it: for very common reaÅ¿on will dictate thus much, to any man, that if any great graÅ¿ier have ten or twelve thouÅ¿and Å¿heepe and many Å¿everall walks and places of paÅ¿turage to feed them in, and hath Å¿everall paÅ¿tours to looke unto them all, as not a few Shephards can feede ten or twelue thouÅ¿ands Å¿heepe, and gives them all a charge in common of looking to his Å¿heepe and feeding them, although all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall paÅ¿tours are to have a generall care of all thoÅ¿e Å¿heep that have his marke upon them, and that are within the limits of his Å¿everall walks and graÅ¿ing places, yet it is to be underÅ¿tood, that every one of them hath his Å¿everall flocke committed to him in Å¿peciall for he muÅ¿t not be idle, over the which he is to have the particular inÅ¿pection and care for the well ordering of it, with this limitation, that he may not wrong the flocke, or do any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto his MaÅ¿ters pleaÅ¿ure, or to the dammage or prejudice of his other fellow PaÅ¿tours or their flocke: All this I Å¿ay, good reaÅ¿on will dictate to any rationall man, and dayly experience will confirme it.</p>
               <p>In the Å¿ame manner things were ordered, in the primitive and ApoÅ¿tolicall Churches, all whoÅ¿e Elders and PaÅ¿tours in them, had the charge of the Å¿everall flocks committed to them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, all the which they were to governe <hi>communi conÅ¿ilio presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terorum</hi> as it is by all the Independents themÅ¿elves confeÅ¿t: for all thoÅ¿e Churches were AriÅ¿tocratically and Presbyterianly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned: and therefore according to the wiÅ¿dome and common councell of their Elders, this Presbyter had the charge of the Å¿heepe of Å¿uch a ward or walke committed unto his care; and that Elder had Å¿uch a Circuit committed unto his charge, and a third Elder had Å¿uch a precinct committed to his cure, and Å¿o of the reÅ¿t, with this proviÅ¿o alwayes, that all things of publicke concernment, and that tended to the common good both of Å¿heep and PaÅ¿tours Å¿hould be ordered by the joynt and common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Å¿everall and reÅ¿pective Presbyters in an orderly and

First, that in every City or Church there was a Presbytery, For they Ordained them Elders in every Church, <hi>Act. 14.</hi> That thou Ordain Elders City by City, <hi>Tit. 1. v. 5.</hi> Secondly, that as there were ApoÅ¿tles and Elders in the church of JeruÅ¿alem, Å¿o there were Elders, <hi>in the church of</hi> EpheÅ¿us Acts the <hi>20.</hi> ver. <hi>25.</hi> and in the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and in the church of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Philippy,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, that thoÅ¿e Å¿everall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were dependent, upon their Å¿everal Presbyteries, and they were to obey them who had the rule over them, <hi>Hebr. 13. 7. 17. 24.</hi> Who were their guids, obey your guids. Fourthly, that this Presbyterian church Government God hath appointed as his Ordinance to be continu'd to the end of the World, the which whoÅ¿oever reÅ¿iÅ¿teth, reÅ¿iÅ¿teth the Ordinance of God. <hi>TheÅ¿e are the foure concluÅ¿ions MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knolleys <hi>gathereth out of my arguments, but with all adds, Å¿aying,</hi> that all this doth not prove, that this Presbyterian Church government is dependent upon a Å¿upreame judicature, to the Decrees of which they muÅ¿t Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves and their churches. <hi>This Å¿aith Mr.</hi> Knollys <hi>doth not follow; but of that in its due place.</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48122:79"/>
from which grant of his, I Å¿hall now likewiÅ¿e deduce theÅ¿e enÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluÅ¿ions, which will neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow out of his words, and all of them fatall to his own principles, and to the opinion of thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way.</p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t, that the people are wholly excluded from Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church; for Å¿aith he, <hi>It is not denyed by the brethren, that the Presbyters in all Churches, were the men in Government of the Churches, in which they were Elders:</hi> So that the people and Church though presbyterated (as they Å¿peak) have not the government in their hands, as indeed they have not, as never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the Keyes, nor never having been made Å¿tewards of the Church, nor joyned in CommiÅ¿Å¿ion with the Elders, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can never either receive in members, or caÅ¿t out offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for all theÅ¿e are acts of Government and belong onely to the Rulers of the Church, whom the people are ever to obey in the Lord, as he granteth, and by this he overthrows all that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he affirms, that the Church or Congregation of which <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was an Elder, had power over him; and this is the firÅ¿t concluÅ¿ion, that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity followeth out of Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his words; but more of this in the Å¿equell of this diÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd concluÅ¿ion that follows out of his words is this That the Government was not put into the hands of any one El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with his Congregation, but into the hands of many Elders, that is, into the hands of the whole Presbytery, to wit, the Court or Colledge of Presbyters; Å¿o that they, and they only, joyntly and together, had the power, both to queÅ¿tion, convent and cenÅ¿ure; for M. <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>It is not denyed by the brethren, but that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in al churches were the men in the government:</hi> according to that of S. John <hi>If I come, I will remember his deeds which he doth prating againÅ¿t us.</hi> So that whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall, <hi>Diotrephes</hi> like, indeavour to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this government, and aÅ¿Å¿ume it to themÅ¿elves from the other Elders and from the Presbyters, or to inveÅ¿t the people with it, or joyn them in commiÅ¿Å¿ion with the Elders, or to arrogate unto themÅ¿elves or to their particular congregations, an abÅ¿olute juriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within themÅ¿elves, and an Independency from them; and Å¿hall go about to diÅ¿grace and prate againÅ¿t the Presbyters, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring them into the hatred of the people, and Å¿hall take this liberty at pleaÅ¿ure, to caÅ¿t out whom they will out of their congregations, or to bring in whom they pleaÅ¿e upon their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48122:80"/>
owne tearmes and conditions, and exerciÅ¿e an abÅ¿olute Lordly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves over their congregations and the Å¿everall members in them, all Å¿uch are guilty of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> his Å¿inne, and offend in like manner, and are equally to be blamed as aÅ¿Å¿umers unto themÅ¿elvs of that power which only belongeth to the presbytery; now when all the Independents are guilty of this crime, they may juÅ¿tly with <hi>Diotrephes</hi> be cenÅ¿urd: and this is the Å¿econd concluÅ¿ion that neceÅ¿Å¿arily followeth from Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> his words.</p>
               <p>The third is this, that there were many congregations in all the primitive churches, and yet made all of them within their Å¿everall precincts and juriÅ¿dictions but one church; for Å¿o it was here in the church that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth unto, where there were many Elders as MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth, in the which every Elder had his particular congregation as well as <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> for they were no way inferiour to him; Å¿o that, if he had his particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation they each of them Å¿everally had their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions likewiÅ¿e, and yet they were all of them to be governed and ruled <hi>communi conÅ¿ilio presbyterorum,</hi> which kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Diotrephes</hi> oppoÅ¿ing, or refuÅ¿ing obedience unto, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting a Supremacy and juriÅ¿diction to himÅ¿elfe and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation independent from the presbytery, was juÅ¿tly blamed by the ApoÅ¿tle Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in that he prated againÅ¿t the presbyters with malicious words. So that by all that I have now Å¿aid, theÅ¿e three poÅ¿itions are clearely manifeÅ¿t which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> denyeth, viz: the firÅ¿t, <hi>That Diotrephes had a particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>Å¿econd that he affected an abÅ¿olute juriÅ¿dicton within himÅ¿elfe and to have his congregation independent, and that he was the firÅ¿t that oppoÅ¿ed the presbyterian government; for we never read of any that prated malicious words againÅ¿t the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie before.</hi> The third that <hi>the church that</hi> Saint Iohn <hi>writ unto, was governed by the common counÅ¿ell of the Presbytery at that time, and that</hi> Saint Iohn <hi>did then acknowledge a Court and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon councell of Presbyters</hi> both <hi>ClaÅ¿Å¿icall and Synodicall to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale unto,</hi> all which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> notwithÅ¿tanding doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily deny. But for the fuller elucidation of the truth, I will firÅ¿t make all theÅ¿e propoÅ¿itions good from MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his own words in this his anÅ¿wer, and then I will prove thoÅ¿e Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appeales I made mention of page 10. and after that, evidently evince that the people and congregation in any Church have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48122:80"/>
not power to judge their MiniÅ¿ters, and that it is a meare babble in M. <hi>Knollys</hi> to Å¿ay, <hi>that if nothing of publicke concernment were to be done without the joynt conÅ¿ent of the Presbytery, that then</hi> Saint Iohn <hi>the Presbyter would not have tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿o farre as to take upon him this authority over</hi> Diotrephes, <hi>to tell the Church of his faults &amp;c. all theÅ¿e things I will</hi> methodically handle, and then go on to anÅ¿wer whatÅ¿oever MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> hath to Å¿ay to all my other arguments in their due places.</p>
               <p>And for proofe, that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had a particular congregation, which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith there was no mention of, waving the reaÅ¿ons above Å¿pecified, from that nigh relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a PaÅ¿tor and a flocke, which is Å¿o much urged by all the Independents, I Å¿ay waving all thoÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons, I will make uÅ¿e of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his owne words, for it may be, he will beleeve himÅ¿elfe, and perhaps his DiÅ¿ciples and followers and thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way will give more credit to him, whom they accompt very learned, then to any thing I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of the holy Scripture: and if they will duly conÅ¿ider and ponder his expreÅ¿Å¿ion they will then perceive not only his errors, but how palpably he everywhere contradicteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe and woundeth their cauÅ¿e, and everteth their opinion, whiles he laboureth with all his power to maintaine and defend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diotrephes</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>oppoÅ¿ed the brethren and forbad them that would have received them, yea and caÅ¿t them out (ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>of the</hi> Church; to wit, excommunicated them; but doth it hereby appear (Å¿aith he) <hi>that Diotrephes would have his congregation indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? and have an abÅ¿olute juriÅ¿diction within it Å¿elfe? N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>but,</hi> Diotrephes <hi>would lord it over the Church, and have the Preeminency above his brethren, whether fellow Elders or fellow Saints.</hi> By the way, take notice, that in MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his opinion, <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a Saint, Saint <hi>Diotrephes</hi> therfore let him be even Å¿uch another Saint as himÅ¿elfe and his brethren are. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>loving the primacy amongÅ¿t them, would be the Primate and Metropolitan of the Church, and have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency of all the PreÅ¿byters in it, and brethren of it. And why therefore Å¿hould the Doctor marvell that his brethren Å¿hould now urge this place againÅ¿t the Court of Preshyters?</hi> Thus MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> while he Å¿eemes to anÅ¿wer, moÅ¿t maliciouÅ¿ly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calumniates his brethren and labours to perÅ¿wade the world
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48122:81"/>
that the presbyters of our times are like <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> in affecting Supremacy over their fellow Presbyters and over the churches; and all this to inrage the people againÅ¿t them, when it is they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, that would bring all men under their Å¿lavery, and have an abÅ¿olute authority and juriÅ¿diction Independent in their Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall congregations within themÅ¿elves, which was the Å¿inne of <hi>Diotrephes.</hi> But out of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his words, it appeareth that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had a particular congregation: For Church and congregation are Synonimaes in his Dialect, which is yet more clearely evident from his words page the 7. which are theÅ¿e: <hi>Therefore</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>the ApoÅ¿tle writs to the Church or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar congregation, whereof</hi> Diotrephes <hi>was a member and an Elder, who he knew had power to judge him.</hi> TheÅ¿e are MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> formall expreÅ¿Å¿ions; out of all which it doth now evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that there were many Presbyters and many congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that Church Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth unto, and that <hi>Diotrophes</hi> had his particular congregation amongÅ¿t them; for Å¿o MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth in expreÅ¿Å¿e termes acknowledge, and in Å¿o Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king contradicts himÅ¿elfe, and vindicates me from the error he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿ed me of, who affirmed, <hi>I was much miÅ¿taken in my commentary expoÅ¿ition and application of that place, Å¿aying there was no mention made of any particular congregation</hi> Diotrephes <hi>had,</hi> And yet here he aÅ¿Å¿erteth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writ to the church or particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, whereof <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a member and an Elder: Å¿o that he hath done my worke for me once and again, and made himÅ¿elfe guiltie of that fault he charged me with page 6 and page 7. By which all men may Å¿ee not only the contentiouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e and reÅ¿tleÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of the creatures Å¿pirit, and the folly of the man who contradicteth himÅ¿elfe at every hand, but may alÅ¿o gather that that Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many congregations, all the which made but one Church within its precinct, and was to be governed by the joynt conÅ¿ent and common counÅ¿ell of the Presbyterie; and that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> aÅ¿piring to the primacy amongÅ¿t them and Å¿eeking to Å¿tand Å¿ingular by himÅ¿elfe with his congregation, and to be Independent, and to have no relation or reference to the Presbyters of that Church, became an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender by it, and was therefore Å¿everely reproved by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> for his Å¿o doing, in oppoÅ¿ing his brethren in taking in and caÅ¿ting out of what members he pleaÅ¿ed, by his Å¿ole and abÅ¿olute authority;

all which Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> accordeth to: whether therefore this were not to make his congregation Independent, and whether <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi> was not the firÅ¿t that oppoÅ¿ed the Presbyterian government, and affronted a Court and common<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>councell of Presbyters (Å¿eeing we read of none that did theÅ¿e things before him) and whether thoÅ¿e that now Å¿eek to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h an abÅ¿olute juriÅ¿diction in every congregation within themÅ¿elves Independent, be not rather like <hi>Diotrephes</hi> than thoÅ¿e godly MiniÅ¿ters that deÅ¿ire the government in common according to Gods holy word, I leave it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learned to conÅ¿ider; and whether or no Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> doth not palpably contradict himÅ¿elfe in all this his diÅ¿courÅ¿e: for he acknowledgeth that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had his particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and oppoÅ¿ed the Presbyters in it, and that <hi>he did evill in uÅ¿urping authority over the church and thoÅ¿e brethren he caÅ¿t out:</hi> and yet notwithÅ¿tanding he Å¿aid it was more then he knew, or I could prove.

               <p>I conceive that all men that are but of ordinary capacity, when they Å¿hall well conÅ¿ider my argument and Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his reply unto it, will Å¿ay<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> aÅ¿Å¿umed that power to himÅ¿elfe, which belonged to the Colledge and councell of Presbyters; for if he had not bin a tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿our, and an offender againÅ¿t Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and the other Presbyters, the ApoÅ¿tle would never have Å¿aid, <hi>Wherefore if I come<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I will remember his deeds which he doth, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againÅ¿t us with malicious wordes,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>but the ApoÅ¿tle did not know of any Å¿uch Court or councell of PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to appeal unto.</hi> Thus Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> triflingly cavilleth: As if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Presbyters had been all ignorant of their duty, and as if in writing unto the Church, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did not in that write to the Presbyters in it alÅ¿o, as well as ChriÅ¿t writing unto the Å¿even Churches and in Å¿ending unto them did not alÅ¿o write unto the Angels and Presbyters in them, when we learne from all thoÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tles and from the holy Scripture that the government of all thoÅ¿e Å¿even churches, as of all the ApoÅ¿tolicall churches through the world, lay only on the Presbyters Å¿houlders, which Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> alÅ¿o aÅ¿Å¿enteth unto, Å¿aying <hi>page</hi> 11. <hi>That it is not denyed by the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the Presbyters in all Churches, were the men in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Churches in which they were Elders.</hi> So that it cannot be denied but in his writting to the Church, he writ unto the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters principally who were the Officers in it and the cheife mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, and knew very well that there was a Court of Presbyters in that Church, who would in convenient time have called <hi>Diotrephes</hi> to an accompt, though Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had never come thither; but he Å¿ignifying that when he came he would remember his deeds, made them retard their proceeding againÅ¿t him, for a time, that he being a fellow-Presbyter with them (as <hi>Peter</hi> was, with thoÅ¿e Presbyters he writs unto 1 EpiÅ¿tle <hi>Pet.</hi> chap. 5.) might have the hearing of the cauÅ¿e amongÅ¿t the other Presbyters; all which Å¿ufficiently confirmeth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did acknowledge a common councell of presbyters in that Church to appeale unto. And therefore all MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his whibling queÅ¿tions are vaine and meerely to delude the people: for what man is there Å¿o Å¿tupid or Å¿o unexperienced in matters of government, or but underÅ¿tands the practice of our times in every corporation, or Committee, through the Kingdome, that knowes not if any Alderman of any Corporation, or any CommiÅ¿Å¿ioner of any Committee Å¿hould affect a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar domination to himÅ¿elfe over his fellow-Aldermen or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ioners, or over the people that were under their charge, whenas they are by their charters and CommiÅ¿Å¿ions, to governe their Å¿everal corporations, Hundreds, Rapes, Ridings or Wapentaks by the common conÅ¿ent, and joynt counÅ¿ell and aggreement of them all, Å¿o that no order made without their combined authority or the joynt conÅ¿ent of them all, or the major part of them,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48122:83"/>
Å¿hould be binding and of force, I Å¿ay, who doth not know, that if any of thoÅ¿e Aldermen or CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners contrary unto their Charter or CommiÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿hould not onely aÅ¿Å¿ume unto himÅ¿elf a particular power of ruling and ordering things by himÅ¿elfe, and of giving Lawes unto others and in bringing in or putting out, either in the Corporation or Committee, whom they pleaÅ¿ed; and Å¿hould alÅ¿o uÅ¿e diÅ¿gracefull words againÅ¿t their fellow-Aldermen or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ioners, that any either Alderman or CommiÅ¿Å¿ioner doing any of theÅ¿e things, doth not oppoÅ¿e the Corporation &amp; Committee with the commiÅ¿Å¿ioners in them, and by that offend againÅ¿t their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and deÅ¿erveth thereby Å¿everely to be puniÅ¿hed? And who doth not likewiÅ¿e know, that if either any of the Aldermen or any of the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners Å¿hould underÅ¿tand of this their diÅ¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly carriage, and Å¿hould informe the Corporation or Committee of it by letters, and Å¿ay, that when he came he would remember his deeds, by theÅ¿e his expreÅ¿Å¿ions doth not acknowledge likewiÅ¿e that there is both in the corporation and committee a Å¿tanding court, in which there was power at all times for the puniÅ¿hing and cenÅ¿uring of any Å¿uch offender? I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured that he will Å¿o conclude that there is a court there, and withall will Å¿ay, that this or that commiÅ¿Å¿ioners information doth no way impeach or hinder the proceedings of that court, or minoriÅ¿e its power, but that it may go on to cenÅ¿ure Å¿uch as Å¿hall offend againÅ¿t their authority, if it can be proved by others, though that commiÅ¿Å¿io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that informed againÅ¿t him Å¿hould not be preÅ¿ent. And even Å¿o it was in the Church Saint John writ unto, it had a court, and power within it Å¿elfe of proceeding againÅ¿t <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and would have uÅ¿ed it againÅ¿t him, whether S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had come or no, although we may Å¿uppoÅ¿e that they did not proceed againÅ¿t him till Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> came: yea, I Å¿hall make it good out of Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> his words that there was a court in that church. But by this, I Å¿ay, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew very well that there was a court or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Presbyters to appeal unto in his time, in that church, though Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmeth the contrary, peremptorily aÅ¿Å¿erting that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew no Å¿uch Court to appeal to, and that I cannot prove any Å¿uch appeals. But it is ordinary with M. <hi>Knollys</hi> to confute the holy Scriptures, and to contradict himÅ¿elf as he doth both here and in all other of his anÅ¿wers, as in their due places we Å¿hall Å¿ee. For what ChriÅ¿tian ever with deliberation did read the Scripture, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48122:83"/>
can beleeve that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> could be ignorant that there was a court and Presbytry in every church, when M. <hi>Knollys</hi> himÅ¿elf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it? Without doubt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew the government that was then eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in all churches, as well as Mr <hi>Knollys.</hi> He could not be ignorant what government God had appointed &amp; eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in every church which was a Presbytery (as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from all the places above quoted) which was a Court, to wit, a company of officers in every church armed with power &amp; authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from God himÅ¿elf within their Å¿everall Presbytries to order, rule and govern the people under them, and to convent any offender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them and to proceed againÅ¿t him by cenÅ¿ure and puniÅ¿hment: If the crime layd againÅ¿t him were Å¿ufficiently proved, and that the people under them were to yeild obedience unto them in the Lord, Å¿uch a power was every Presbytery inveÅ¿ted with through all the ApoÅ¿tolicall churches; and this Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath acknowledged in divers places in this his Pamphlet, &amp; in this his very anÅ¿wer concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> as we Å¿hall Å¿ee by and by. And all this S. <hi>Iohn</hi> could not be ignorant of, and that in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> in which hee was both a PaÅ¿tor and a Member, that the Presbytery ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there, and that all the people made their addreÅ¿Å¿es (as well for the good of their Å¿oules, as for the better rectifying of abuÅ¿es) to the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters of that Church, and appealed alwayes unto them, and never applyed themÅ¿elves unto the people or the multitude, as we may Å¿ee in theÅ¿e particulars: as,</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, when they were pricked in their hearts, they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves unto the ApoÅ¿tles for direction, Å¿aying, <hi>men and brethren what Å¿hall we do? Acts</hi> 2. they went not to the church or people, but to the ApoÅ¿tles, knowing that the MiniÅ¿ters were their guides, and that they were to be directed by them, and that they were bound to obey them. And Å¿o in the fact of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, when they had purloyned the goods of the Church; for whereas it was ordered and agreed upon by common conÅ¿ent that the price of thoÅ¿e poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions that were Å¿old Å¿hould be layd down at the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles feet, and that diÅ¿tribution Å¿hould be made unto every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had need; contrary to this order <hi>Ananias</hi> kept back part of the price, <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife alÅ¿o being privy to it: Hereupon the people appeal unto the ApoÅ¿tles in whoÅ¿e hands the government then lay, and who had power to cenÅ¿ure and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h them, as they did for that their delinquency, as it is to be Å¿een

                  <hi>Acts</hi> the 5. they went not to the people and Church, but applyed themÅ¿elves to the Presbytery; and of this proceeding Saint <hi>John</hi> was not ignorant.</p>
               <p>Again when the widdowes were neglected in the daily mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tration, for the taking away of this abuÅ¿e, they appealed unto the ApoÅ¿tles, as we may Å¿ee in the Å¿ixt of the <hi>Acts</hi> (and not unto the Church or people) who ordered that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, and determined the controverÅ¿ie amongÅ¿t them, to which the people aÅ¿Å¿ented. This alÅ¿o Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was not ignorant of: And he knew very well that the Presbytery in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and all other Churches had power to Å¿end any of the ApoÅ¿tles or their other MiniÅ¿ters into any other place to preach, or upon any meÅ¿Å¿age, as we may Å¿ee it <hi>Acts</hi> the 8<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and <hi>Acts</hi> 14, &amp; 15. For the Presbytery of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> Å¿ent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> to preach amongÅ¿t the people there, which they could not have done except the Presbitry had had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority in their hands over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>; we Å¿ee alÅ¿o the Å¿ame in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they Å¿ent <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and their miniÅ¿ters to the Presbitry at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> &amp; the Presbitry of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> they likewiÅ¿e Å¿ent their decrees by their MiniÅ¿ters through all Cities and Churches, which they could not have done, had they not had authority over the MiniÅ¿ters. Again S. <hi>Iohn</hi> knew very well that the power of admitting of members lay not in the peoples hands; for we read <hi>Acts</hi> the 9. When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and aÅ¿Å¿ayed to joyn himÅ¿elf to the DiÅ¿ciples, and that they being affraid of him, &amp; believing not that he was a DiÅ¿ciple, St <hi>Paul</hi> appeals from them to the Presbytery of the ApoÅ¿tles in whoÅ¿e hands the government lay; and declaring unto them how matters were, they admitted him into fellowÅ¿hip with them, without the conÅ¿ent of the people &amp; their good liking, for the government did not belong unto them. All theÅ¿e proceedings Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew very well, and therefore could not be ignorant that there was a Court and Councell to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to in all Churches: Yea Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew alÅ¿o that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> had power and authority over any of the ApoÅ¿tles, and did upon any occaÅ¿ion convent them before them as we may Å¿ee in the 11. chap. and 21. where <hi>Peter</hi> was called before the Presbytery for going in to the Gentiles, and was therefore to give an accompt of his actions there, which he did; all with Å¿hews there was there a Å¿tanding Court: and Å¿o in the 21. chapter the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gave Saint <hi>Paul</hi> an order and direction how to behave himÅ¿elf
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48122:84"/>
toward the weak ones; which he followed; all which Å¿hewes that they only had the power in their hands, and that there was a court there, and that it belonged not to the people; all theÅ¿e things, I Å¿ay, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was not ignorant of, &amp; therfore knew very well that in that Church alÅ¿o where <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a Presbyter, there was a Court and Common-councell of Presbyters to appeal unto, or elÅ¿e he would never have Å¿aid, <hi>If I come I will remember his deeds.</hi> But why Å¿hould I Å¿pend time in proving that which to any underÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding man is as evident a nd clear as almoÅ¿t any other truth in the holy Scripture? eÅ¿pecially when Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath proved it himÅ¿elf in formall words in many places in this his anÅ¿wer; for he confeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth that there was a Presbytery eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in every Church, and that the government of thoÅ¿e Churches was put into the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hands, and that the people were to obey thoÅ¿e Presbyters as their guides; and in expreÅ¿Å¿e termes page the Å¿eventh Å¿aith, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ApoÅ¿tle writes to the Church or particular congregation whereof</hi> Diotrephes <hi>was a Member and an Elder, who he knew had power to judge him, as well as the Church or particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Corinth <hi>had power to judge them that were Members therein,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. 13. <hi>And therefore might as warrantably admoniÅ¿h</hi> Diotrephes, <hi>as the Church of</hi> ColoÅ¿Å¿e <hi>might</hi> Archippus <hi>ColoÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 4. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 17. in theÅ¿e words, He confeÅ¿Å¿eth that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew that the Church whereof <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a Member and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had power to judg him; which doth neceÅ¿Å¿arily infer that there was at that time a court there; for judgement and cenÅ¿ure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of puniÅ¿hment is the act of a court or MagiÅ¿tracy and of thoÅ¿e that are in authority and armed with power; beÅ¿ides for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuÅ¿tration of his meaning, he Å¿aith that the church Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writ unto, had the Å¿ame power over its Members that the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had over its Members: Now all men that have read the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iÅ¿tle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> know very well that there was a court in the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> with plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry authority from ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, both to convent and cenÅ¿ure, and that with the Å¿evereÅ¿t puniÅ¿hment thoÅ¿e that did publikely Å¿candalize the GoÅ¿pell, as is evident by the excommunication of the inceÅ¿tuous perÅ¿on; now if that church that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ unto were equall in power to that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that of <hi>ColoÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and to all the other ApoÅ¿tolicall churches, as Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth and laboureth to prove; then theÅ¿e concluÅ¿ions will neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48122:85"/>
from his argumentations. The firÅ¿t, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> could not be ignorant that there was a court and common-councell of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in that church to appeal unto; for Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith, that <hi>Saint</hi> John <hi>knew that that Church had power to judge Diotrephes,</hi> and therefore in this contradicteth himÅ¿elfe; for in the Å¿ixth page he affirmed that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew not any Å¿uch court.</p>
               <p>2ly, it follows that there was an Uniformity of government in all the ApoÅ¿tolicall and Primitive churches: W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wholy overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the tenent of many of the Independents who hold the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Å¿o that one church had not one manner of government, and another church another manner of government peculiar unto it Å¿elfe, and diÅ¿tinct from the other; but they were all governed alike by their Å¿everall Presbyteryes, and had equall authority and power within their Å¿everall precincts, as the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem, EpheÅ¿us, Corinth,</hi> in all which there were many congregations, and yet all of them made but each of them a particular church within their reÅ¿pective juriÅ¿dictions, and were all to be governed by the joynt conÅ¿ent of there Å¿everall Presbytries.</p>
               <p>And laÅ¿tly, that this order of government was to be perpetuated to the end of the world, which when Saint <hi>Diotrephes</hi> laboured to violate in aÅ¿Å¿uming it to himÅ¿elfe and his congregation, both hee and all theÅ¿e that follow his Å¿teps, deÅ¿erve Å¿everely to be puniÅ¿hed for it, as prevaricators againÅ¿t both precept and example of all well ordered churches and ChriÅ¿tians. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have replyed by way of anÅ¿wer to what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> had to Å¿ay for proofe that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knew not of any Court or Common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Presbyters, either claÅ¿Å¿icall or Å¿ynodicall, to appeal unto in his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now I come to make good thoÅ¿e appeals I made mention of</hi> page <hi>10. which</hi> Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> thinketh a thing impoÅ¿Å¿ible for me to do; to wit, That every particular man, as well as any aÅ¿Å¿embly or congregation, may have their appeal to the Presbytery of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, Hundred or DiviÅ¿ion under whoÅ¿e juriÅ¿diction they were; and if they finde themÅ¿elves wronged there, then they have appeales to Å¿ome other higher Presbytery or Councell of Divines for reliefe and juÅ¿tice.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e appeales MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith I cannot make good to be according to the Scripture of truth, although the having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e by appeales, from Inferiors to Superiors and from one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48122:85"/>
Court to another, is Å¿o evident by the very light of nature, and approved of by the practice of all Nations and Churches in all ages, and is alÅ¿o Å¿o apparent by the holy Scriptures both of the old and new teÅ¿tament, as there is Å¿carce any truth more obvious to all underÅ¿tanding men; yet MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> peremptorily aÅ¿Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that they cannot be made good out of the Scriptures of truth; Å¿o that it is manifeÅ¿t, to all men, that be there any truth never Å¿o perÅ¿picuous, he is reÅ¿olved to beleeve nothing but what he conceiveth to be according to the Scripture of truth.</p>
               <p>Therefore for the gratifying of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and all Å¿uch as with candour and ingenuity and without any prejudice Å¿hall reade the inÅ¿uing lines, I Å¿hall in this place adde Å¿omething more fully and diÅ¿tinctly to that which I Å¿pake in the foregoing page for the proofe of thoÅ¿e appeales I mentioned page 10. and Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evince, they are warranted by the Word of truth: and for that purpoÅ¿e, I Å¿hall firÅ¿t produce the authority of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and bring forth Å¿ome PreÅ¿idents out of the unerring word for the confirmation of the Å¿ame; and then I Å¿hall alÅ¿o ratifie the uÅ¿e of appeales by reaÅ¿ons and from the practice of all ages in all Nations. And all this I Å¿hall the more willingly do in this place, although it is done againe and againe in this treatiÅ¿e; and onely becauÅ¿e MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmeth that I cannot make good that appeales be according to the Scripture of truth. And for proofe ofthis, I will begin with that of our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 13 <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 15. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>if thy brother Å¿hall treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t thee, go and tell him of his fault betweene thee and him alone,</hi> &amp;c. But if he heare thee not, appeale higher <hi>to two or three more:</hi> And <hi>if he Å¿hall neglect to heare them,</hi> appeale yet higher, tell it then <hi>unto the Church,</hi> that is to the Court of Presbyters in that precinct. So that from this place it is evident, that appeales are warranted by the Word of truth; for truth it Å¿elf, hath taught us the Doctrine of appeals. And for PreÅ¿idents of appeales there are many in the New-TeÅ¿tament, to Å¿ay nothing of the Old. To begin with that in the 5. of the <hi>Acts</hi> which we finde recorded after ChriÅ¿t's aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion in the queÅ¿tioning of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> whereas by conjoynt argrement it was appointed and ordered amongÅ¿t them, that all things Å¿hould be common, and that Å¿elling their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, they Å¿hould bring
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48122:86"/>
the price of them and lay it alÅ¿o at the ApoÅ¿tles feet; which very expreÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿ignifieth and denoteth what great authority and power the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters in the Church of JeruÅ¿alem were then in, and Å¿ufficiently declares that there was a Court there, as all the carriage of that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e doth abundantly prove. I Å¿ay therefore, when they had made Å¿uch an order by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conÅ¿ent, and when it was found out that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife had not dealt faithfully in that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, nor according to publike agreement, but had conÅ¿ented together to deceive their brethren, and by that had Å¿candalized the GoÅ¿pel, the Church or people for the redreÅ¿Å¿ing of this abuÅ¿e, take not the matter into their owne hands, nor challenge not any power unto themÅ¿elves for the puniÅ¿hing of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> as well knowing their place then, and that the government did not belong unto them, but to the Elders and Rulers over them; they appeale therefore unto the ApoÅ¿tles and make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint unto them, and exhibit their Articles againÅ¿t <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> as both guilty of the Å¿ame crime, whereupon they were convented before the ApoÅ¿tles as Delinquents; <hi>Peter</hi> then being there preÅ¿ident and chiefe judge, and finding them guilty<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Å¿entenced them both, from God himÅ¿elfe, and puniÅ¿hed them for their Å¿inne with death; by which we may take notice not onely of an appeale, but that there was a Å¿tanding Court of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in JeruÅ¿alem and that they had in it plenary power from ChriÅ¿t for the tryall and puniÅ¿hing of all offenders and of caÅ¿ting them out of the Church, if Scandalous, as well as the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and it Å¿tands with all reaÅ¿on; for JeruÅ¿alem was the mother Church, and therefore was inferior to none of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Churches and to this Court of Presbyters were all appeales ever to be made by the people of that precinct; as this one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance doth Å¿ufficiently declare. And that other preÅ¿ident in the 6. of the <hi>Acts</hi> where we have a Å¿econd appeale upon an other publike Å¿candall, which was the neglect of their widdowes in the daily MiniÅ¿tration where they applyed themÅ¿elves unto the ApoÅ¿tles; for the particular congregations aÅ¿Å¿umed not the authority into their hands of redreÅ¿Å¿ing the abuÅ¿e, nor challenged not any right to the government, but appealed unto the ApoÅ¿tles for remedy, who ordered that whole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e by joynt conÅ¿ent, to which all the people willingly Å¿ubmitted themÅ¿elves as it is at

large to be Å¿eene in the Å¿ixt Chapter of the <hi>Acts.</hi> The third appeale we finde <hi>Acts</hi> the ninth, where <hi>Paul</hi> aÅ¿Å¿aying to joyne himÅ¿elf to the DiÅ¿ciples, and they being afraid of him, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he were a beleever, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> forth with appeals from them to the ApoÅ¿tles, who he knew had the authority in their hands, and making knowne his cauÅ¿e unto them, they forthwith admitted him into Church-fellow-Å¿hip with them without the conÅ¿ent of the people, who indeed had nothing to do, either in the admitting of members of caÅ¿ting of them out; and therefore they allowed of the appeale of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to teach all men whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fly, to wit the to Presbytery, if they be injured by the people or debard from any Church-priviledge by them, for they only are the Å¿tewards of the Church and have the Keys of the kingdom of heaven to open and Å¿hut the doores to whom they Å¿hall thinke fit, or unworthy; and this is the place of the Presbyters, and not of the people: for they are injoyned to obey their guids and to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themÅ¿elves in the Lord to what they order and appoint ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God. Here we have three preÅ¿idents of appeales in the mother-church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery upon any abuÅ¿e, Å¿o that by the mouth of their witneÅ¿Å¿es out of the word of truth this truth of appeales is Å¿ufficiently confirmed; And that the Presbytery at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> had plenary power over the very ApoÅ¿tles and could call them at any time to an accompt, is manifeÅ¿t from the eleventh of the <hi>Acts</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> was convented &amp; queÅ¿tionedbefore them and was forced to give an accompt of his going in to the Gentiles and Preaching unto them, which he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>elded unto, knowing it was their place to queÅ¿tion any; yea the Presbytery in every Church could Å¿end the very ApoÅ¿tles &amp; MiniÅ¿ters to Preach in any place or city or upon any MeÅ¿Å¿age, as we Å¿ee they Å¿ent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> Å¿ent <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with other MiniÅ¿ters to the Presbytery of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> as is evident <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. and <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and therefore all theÅ¿e examples Å¿ufficiently prove that all the people of every Church made their appeales to their Å¿everall Presbyteries, if there aroÅ¿e any controverÅ¿ies and abuÅ¿es among themÅ¿elves: and if there aroÅ¿e any difference between Church, and Church, or betweene Presbytery and Presbyterie about any points of Doctrine or Religion, then they made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales for the determining of thoÅ¿e controverÅ¿ies to Councells
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48122:87"/>
and Synods, as we may Å¿ee it <hi>Acts</hi> the 15. and this is one of Gods Ordinances as the Independents themÅ¿elves doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So that for the Doctrine of appeales it is Å¿o cleare that all the learned and judicious cannot doubt of it; and I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured that thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall but with due deliberation Å¿eriouÅ¿ly examine the Scriptures above quoted and thoÅ¿e that follow in this diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e, for the confirmation of the Å¿ame truth, will wonder that any man that pretends to learning as MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth, Å¿hould ever dare Å¿ay, that appeales cannot be made good to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture of truth, whereas there is almoÅ¿t no truth in the holy Scripture more cleare and evident than this of appeales.</p>
               <p>Yea this method of dealing and manner of handling of buÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es of publike offences and Å¿candals, and for the redreÅ¿Å¿ing of them, is ratified by the very light and Law of nature, as we may reade in all the governments under the very Heathens, and <hi>Paul</hi> made uÅ¿e of it, by appealing from inferiour Courts to <hi>CaeÅ¿ars</hi> tribunall. And I Å¿hall never be brought by all the arte and wit of man to beleeve, that ChriÅ¿t hath left his Church under the New TeÅ¿tament in a worÅ¿e condition then it was under the old, where we know they had appeales from one Court to another. Nay if ChriÅ¿tians now, had not the liberty of appeales in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience and Religion, they Å¿hould be inferior to the Pagan na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and Å¿urely ChriÅ¿t hath not left his Church which is his Kingdom, in a worÅ¿e condition then either the IewiÅ¿h or Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke Kingdomes were, and therefore by all reaÅ¿on beÅ¿ides the TeÅ¿timony of ChriÅ¿t <hi>Matth.</hi> the 13. and beÅ¿ides the PreÅ¿idents I produced out of the Word of God to confirme appeales, the lawfulneÅ¿Å¿e of appeales is Å¿ufficiently eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed and ratified. So that I hope that which I have now briefly Å¿et downe, may Å¿atisfie any rationall man. But before I go on to prove that the people or Church have not power to judge their MiniÅ¿ters, which is the laÅ¿t thing I undertake to make good. I muÅ¿t Å¿ay Å¿omething by way of anÅ¿wer to a vaine and frivolous cavill of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> which is this. <hi>If the Doctor can prove theÅ¿e appeales,</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>I aske him whether that higher Presbytery or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Divines, be not as Independent as the brethren and their Churches againÅ¿t whom the Doctor hath written: and if Å¿o, then Å¿uch a high Presbytery or Councell of Divines, is not Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by the Doctors own confeÅ¿Å¿ion and affirmation.</hi> The very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48122:87"/>
reading of this fond cavill had been enough for the confutation of it to any Å¿olid man: and truly had not I to deale with Å¿uch a trifling creature as he is in Å¿erious buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, who compts every word he Å¿cribleth an oracle, I would have paÅ¿Å¿ed by it with Å¿ilence, as being nothing to the queÅ¿tion between us, and as little to his purpoÅ¿e as all his other wrangling is, except it be to declare to all men, that he knoweth not his owne principles nor no good learning. But for anÅ¿wer, all Å¿uch as know any thing in the controverÅ¿ie betweene us and the Independents, know that it is my opinion and Å¿ettled beleefe, that all Churches and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels are to depend upon the Word of God, and to be ruled and ordered in all their proceedings and Governments according to the direction of the Å¿ame: an Angel from Heaven is not be heard that Å¿peaks not according to the written Word <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and this Word hath directed us to the law and to the teÅ¿timony, <hi>IÅ¿ay</hi> 8. and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all men that Å¿peak not according to that, to be in darkneÅ¿Å¿e; and therefore according to this my opinion, no Church or Councell in the world is Independent; and therfore all Å¿uch Churches and Councels as have not either precept or example for their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the ordering and governing of them, out of the Word of God, but follow their own vaine and idle phantaÅ¿ies and affect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, in my opinion they in Å¿o ordering their Churches do not according to Gods Ordinances. Now when the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Governments are Å¿uch, they are their own inventions; and that government only of the Presbyters, is Gods Ordinance, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both precept and PreÅ¿idents for it in Gods Word, upon which they depend; and this is my opinion, and not that which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> would grolliÅ¿hly put upon me; and this Å¿hall Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for anÅ¿wer to that peece of non-Å¿enÅ¿e of his. And now I come to the laÅ¿t branch of his anÅ¿wer, and that which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to make Good and prove, viz. <hi>that the people and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in any Church have not power to judge their MiniÅ¿ters,</hi> which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmeth they have, and for inÅ¿tance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and that of <hi>ColoÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> underÅ¿tanding by Church the people, who he Å¿aith had power over the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, miÅ¿erably miÅ¿taking himÅ¿elf and abuÅ¿ing the ignorant and Å¿imple Å¿oules by it, as will by and by appeare to thoÅ¿e that can diÅ¿cerne things that differ or are but a little acquainted in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of government, either EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall or civill. For if men
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48122:88"/>
do once but rightly underÅ¿tand what a Church is according to the diÅ¿cription of a Church as it is laid down in the New-TeÅ¿tament, and conÅ¿ider withall of the parts and members of that Church which by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is compared to the body of a man: they will eaÅ¿ily perceive, that the governors and rulers are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the head and all the noble parts of the body, as to the eyes, eares hands &amp;c. which are to guide and governe all the other members in the body, and that all the other members under them are to be ordered and ruled by the head and other more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, and are to follow their direction; Å¿o that it is in the Church of God, as it is in the body of man, Å¿ome are to rule, and others to be ruled in it and whoÅ¿e place it is ever to obey: For none of the members of the body leave their Å¿tations, unleÅ¿Å¿e they by violence be cut off, as all rationall creatures do very well know. For the head is ever the head, the eye is ever the eye, the eare is ever the eare, and the hand is ever the hand, &amp;c. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 27. <hi>Now yee are the body of ChriÅ¿t, and members in particular. And God hath Å¿et Å¿ome in the Church, firÅ¿t ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿econdly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps in Government, diverÅ¿ities of tongues; are all ApoÅ¿tles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> &amp;c intimating that the ApoÅ¿tles, and Prophets and Teachers, and helps in Government in the Church, every of them keepes their Å¿tations, to wit, they that are once ApoÅ¿tles, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or Governors, doe continue in the Church in their Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places, ever Å¿o to be, and never loÅ¿e their places, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the day of their death, remaine and continue Å¿till to be ApoÅ¿tles, Prophets, Teachers and Rulers, according to that in the fourth of the <hi>EpheÅ¿ians verÅ¿.</hi> 11. Where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>He gave Å¿ome ApoÅ¿tles, and Å¿ome Prophets, and Å¿ome EvangeliÅ¿ts and Å¿ome PaÅ¿tors and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the worke of the MiniÅ¿try and the edifying of the body of ChriÅ¿t, till we come all into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Å¿onne of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of the Å¿tature of the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of ChriÅ¿t.</hi> We finde not in all the holy Scripture that any of thoÅ¿e true MiniÅ¿ters were at any time degraded, or loÅ¿t any thing either of their Titles or of their authority, but as God had put the rule and Government of the Church into their hands, and had given them the power of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48122:88"/>
Keyes, and made them Stewards in the Church which is his body, Å¿o they were ever to be the head, eyes, eares and hands for the governing and well ordering of the Church. We finde likewiÅ¿e that in every Å¿everall Church of the New-TeÅ¿tament there was a Presbytery ordayned, as <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. &amp;c. and that the Presbyters had the Government of thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Churches put into their hands, that the people and members of thoÅ¿e Churches were commanded to obey their Presbyters as their guides whom God had Å¿et over them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. as MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> and all the learnedÅ¿t of the Independents do acknowledge. We finde likewiÅ¿e by the practiÅ¿e of the Church of JeruÅ¿alem the PreÅ¿ident of all other Churches, that the people there for the redreÅ¿Å¿ing of any abuÅ¿e amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, aÅ¿Å¿umed not the power into their own hands, but applied themÅ¿elves and made their addreÅ¿Å¿es and appeales to the Presbytery, and that they ordered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing according as they thought good, and that the people wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly Å¿ubmitted themÅ¿elves to the order. We finde further that for all acts of government, as queÅ¿tioning any offendo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s for the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uring and puniÅ¿hing of them, for ordination of Officers, and excommunication, it was done either by the Å¿ole power and authority of the ApoÅ¿tles, or by the Presbyteries of the Church and thoÅ¿e that were in office, and not by the multitude, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿t by that in the 2. of the <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 2. ver. 6. a place Å¿o much abuÅ¿ed by the Independents; <hi>Å¿ufficient</hi> (Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle) <hi>to Å¿uch a man is the cenÅ¿ure which was inflicted of many.</hi> So that it was not inflicted by all the people, but by Å¿uch only in whoÅ¿e hands the power lay, which was the Presbytery, and therfore the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith by many or of many. And truly if we would but duly reade the EpiÅ¿tles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> which were writ to them, and in them to all the MiniÅ¿ters of the New-teÅ¿tament in all ages to come, and obÅ¿erve the rules Å¿et downe in them, which are to continue to the ende of the World, we Å¿hall finde that for all Acts of government and for the well ordering of the Church, it is only committed into the hands of the MiniÅ¿ters and presbyters of the Å¿everall Churches through all Nations, and that to them only belonged the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Goverment, as the rulers and Stewards of the Å¿ame<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and that all power and authority of Government peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto them, and that the people had nothing to do with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48122:89"/>
it but to obey. Again if we look but into the Å¿even Churches of <hi>AÅ¿ia,</hi> Revel. 2. &amp; 2. We Å¿hall finde that all the EpiÅ¿tles ChriÅ¿t writes unto them are directed to the Angels and MiniÅ¿ters of thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Churches, as upon whom the Government of thoÅ¿e Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches lay, and who had both the praiÅ¿e of well doing and blame of any evill either committed or tolerated by them; for Å¿eeing they were appointed by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe to be the Stewards and Guides of thoÅ¿e Churches and to be the Governours of the Å¿ame, all the blame of the malverÅ¿ation of any of the members in them, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto them, as if they themÅ¿elves had been the cauÅ¿e of it, as not uÅ¿ing their Authority for the redreÅ¿Å¿ing of thoÅ¿e abuÅ¿es. So that it is apparently evident through the whole New TeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That the MiniÅ¿ters and Presbyters, and they onely, in every Church had the rule of the people committed unto them, as the head, eyes, ears, and hands, the more noble members; and that the people as the other members under them, were to yeeld obedience unto them in the Lord. And we find that in the holy Scripture, every man is to look unto that Office that is committed unto him, and that every one is to keep himÅ¿elfe in that Station God hath placed him in, as we may Å¿ee it at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Having gifts differing according to the grace given unto us, Å¿aith Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prophecy, let us prophecy according to the proportion of faith, or miniÅ¿try, let us waite on our miniÅ¿try &amp;c. He that ruleth, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> &amp;c. Here we finde that every man according to his place and office, he is injoyned to wait upon it and not to deÅ¿ert it; they that are appointed to rule, they are ever to rule; and the others that are under them, are ever to obey; every Member is to keep his Å¿tation in this myÅ¿ticall body; the MagiÅ¿trates and Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters whether eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall or civill, are to continue in their Å¿everall places and to keep their ranks as long as they are in thoÅ¿e places; and all thoÅ¿e that are under them, whether Subjects, children, or Å¿ervants, they are likewiÅ¿e to keepe their places, and to obey all thoÅ¿e that are over them in the Lord; and that is their place; for Å¿o the holy Scripture everywhere teacheth us, and eÅ¿pecially in the 7. of the 1 of the <hi>Corinth. ver.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>CircumciÅ¿ion</hi> (Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle) <hi>is nothing, and uncircumciÅ¿ion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandements of God;</hi> That is, the yeelding of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the commandments of God, and the obeying of thoÅ¿e God hath Å¿et over us, and the honouring of thoÅ¿e that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48122:89"/>
and doing the will of God in every thing to our power, is that that commends any men unto God, eÅ¿pecially the honouring of God himÅ¿elfe and the reverencing of our godly MiniÅ¿ters and painfull PaÅ¿tors, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Know them which are over you in the Lord, and eÅ¿teem them very highly in love for their works Å¿ake:</hi> For God hath made them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tors, and all the people their flock; them fathers, and the people children begotten by their MiniÅ¿try; them builders, and the people the Å¿tones layd by them in the building; them Stewards, and the people DomeÅ¿tiques under them and their conduct: So that every one in the Church of God is to continue in that Station God hath placed them in, untill they by their gifts and graces and eminent abilities be removed to a higher calling, or elÅ¿e for their miÅ¿de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours are caÅ¿t out; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. ver. 20. <hi>Let every man abide in the Å¿ame calling wherein he was called; and as if it had not bin Å¿ufficient to have once Å¿pecified his mind in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, in the</hi> 24 verÅ¿e, <hi>he reiterateth this precept Å¿aying, Brethren, let every man wherein he is called therein abide with</hi> God. So that for the MiniÅ¿ters and Presbyters of the Church, or for the MagiÅ¿trates of the Common-wealth, or for MaÅ¿ters or Parents of Families, for either of them, I Å¿ay, to leave their calling in their particular places of ruling: and for either the flocks under the PaÅ¿tors, or Å¿ubjects under the MagiÅ¿trates, or Å¿ervants and children in the Å¿everall Families under their Parents and MaÅ¿ters, to offer to take the Government into their own hands, or to joyne themÅ¿elves in CommiÅ¿Å¿ion with them, and to take the rule in either Church, State, or Families upon them, is to leave their callings, and Å¿o to tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t the commandements of God who, hath injoyned the MagiÅ¿trates, MiniÅ¿ters and PaÅ¿tors both in Church and State to command, and all the people under them to obey, and in their Å¿o doing they each of them abide in the Å¿ame cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Å¿tation wherein they are called: otherwiÅ¿e, <hi>they will be found tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ours of the Laws of God and Violaters of that Order God hath appoynted in Church and State,</hi> and bring confuÅ¿ion in both; Now, <hi>God is the God of Order, and hath injoyned all men to keep his commandements,</hi> and the commandement given to the MagiÅ¿trates, is <hi>to rule;</hi> and the commandement given to the people in every Church is <hi>to obey their guides and yeeld double honour unto them;</hi> the honour of <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>Å¿ubjection,</hi> and the honour of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48122:90"/>
                  <hi>maintenance;</hi> they are ever bound <hi>to obey them in the Lord:</hi> And this is the Order God appointed in all the Primitive Churches, <hi>That the Presbyters only Å¿hould rule in them, and that the people Å¿hould obey and not intermeddle in the government; for that is not to keep themÅ¿elves in their Å¿everall Stations, and to abide in the Å¿ame calling wherein they were called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to Å¿peake the truth, the ignorance of this doctrine and the pride of too too many hath bin the onely cauÅ¿e of all thoÅ¿e confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions that now the Church and State are imbroyled with; for if every man had learned but this leÅ¿Å¿on, <hi>To keep himÅ¿elfe in the Å¿ame calling wherein he was called,</hi> he would know that the MagiÅ¿trates place whether civill or ecclerÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall, is <hi>to command,</hi> and that the Å¿ubjects and peoples place under them in their Å¿everall aboads and habitations, is <hi>to obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They would underÅ¿tand likewiÅ¿e, that in every kingdome, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwelth, corporation, or in any Province and Country or church, that howÅ¿oever buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of publike concernment belongs unto the whole body in each of thoÅ¿e governments, yet the managing of them and ruling and ordering of them reÅ¿pectively, belongeth and pertaineth onely to thoÅ¿e in authority, as in a kingdome or Republique, howÅ¿oever the embaÅ¿ladours of other nations are Å¿ent into Å¿uch a Kingdome and Common-wealth about buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e that may concern the whole Countrie, yet none but the King and his Councell or the State have the ordering and managing of the buÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and the people and Å¿ubjects under them intermeddle not in thoÅ¿e high affairs, for they are <hi>Arcana Regni</hi> and appertain not unto them. And Å¿o it is in every Corporation, howÅ¿oever the Letters or Mandates from either King, Parliament or State, are directed unto the Å¿everall Counties, Hundreds or Corporations or Cities, yet the Lieutenants, Governors, Sherifes, Mayors, Aldermen and Common-councells in each of them are to mannage the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e and to put in execution what they are commanded and injoyned by either Letters or Mandates, and the people under them Å¿everal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are to yeeld obedience to what they order and command accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Å¿everall exigences of the times, as daily experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all men; Å¿o that the directing of their Letters to the Å¿everall Counties or Hundreds or Corporations in generall, doth not inveÅ¿t all the people with power or joyne them in commiÅ¿Å¿ion with the MagiÅ¿trates of thoÅ¿e reÅ¿pective places, but leaveth the tranÅ¿acting

of all things to thoÅ¿e onely in thoÅ¿e Å¿everall juriÅ¿dictions that are in authority and armed with power, which the people are not. Yea this truth is Å¿o well known and perceived by all Å¿uch as will not wilfully blinde themÅ¿elves, as it cannot be denyed; hourly experience furniÅ¿hing men with PreÅ¿idents of it.</p>
               <p>For if any Delinquents be found out, they are not hailed before the people, but before Å¿uch as are in authority; there is not an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Hew and Cry that is Å¿ent to any PariÅ¿h, but it is carryed to the ConÅ¿table or his Deputy and to Å¿uch in that Town or Village as are in place or authority, Å¿o that the people trouble not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves with it; yea they will ordinarily Å¿ay it concerneth them not, it is not their place to intermeddle in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of State, that they affirme belonges to thoÅ¿e that are in authority.

Neither with any good reaÅ¿on will it follow, if any private ChriÅ¿tian may admoniÅ¿h a MiniÅ¿ter failing in his duty, that he hath power and authority over him, for this one Member and Brother hath not over another, <hi>as having nothing to do with another mans Å¿ervant,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿ufficiently declareth in the fourteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>EpiÅ¿tle to the Romans;</hi> and although all ChriÅ¿tians are commanded, <hi>ColoÅ¿Å¿.</hi> the 3. and in divers other places, <hi>to admoniÅ¿h one another,</hi> yet this proves not that they have rule, power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, becauÅ¿e the Scripture witneÅ¿Å¿eth the contrary.

               <p>
                  <hi>The firÅ¿t;</hi> That all Å¿uch as affect an abÅ¿olute juriÅ¿diction in every particular congregation within it Å¿elfe Independent, without any

               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd is this:</hi> That all Å¿uch MiniÅ¿ters and Congregations as give the authority and power of ruling and ordering the affaires of the Church into the hands of the people, either wholly excluding the MiniÅ¿ters, or joyning the people with them in the Government of the Church, they thus leaving their Å¿tation and calling wherein they were called, are prevaricators and offenders againÅ¿t divine inÅ¿titution: For God hath given the keyes, the power of order and juriÅ¿diction to the MiniÅ¿ters and Presbyters only, and injoyned the people to obey them: But Å¿uch are all the MiniÅ¿ters and AÅ¿Å¿emblies of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall way, as leaving their Å¿tation and calling wherein they were called: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are all prevaricators and offenders againÅ¿t di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inÅ¿titution.</p>
               <p>And thus much I thought fit by way of anÅ¿wer, to reply unto all that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> had to Å¿ay, againÅ¿t my argument drawn from <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and in defence of their congregationall practices<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> There yet remaines one whibling cavill more in this his anÅ¿wer, that I may not paÅ¿Å¿e by leÅ¿t he Å¿hould glory I could not anÅ¿wer it; I will therefore Å¿ay Å¿omething to that and conclude this point and then go on to all his other fond anÅ¿wers to Å¿uch arguments as he thought himÅ¿elfe beÅ¿t able to incounter with. His words are theÅ¿e in the concluÅ¿ion of his Babble.</p>
               <p>If <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> nothing of publike concernment ought to be done and tranÅ¿acted without the joynt &amp; mutual agreement, and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent of the Presbytery, <hi>John</hi> the Presbyter would not have tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿o farr, as to take upon himÅ¿elfe this authority over <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi> to tell the Church of his faults, and to Å¿ay he would remember him and Å¿harply reprove him, and teach him to prate againÅ¿t the Presbytery with malicious words, which belonged to the Court and Common-councell of Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> rather chatters than diÅ¿putes, in making Å¿uch
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48122:93"/>
an inference from his own conceit. And therefore for AnÅ¿wer let Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> know, that there was no tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> againÅ¿t the Presbyters in taking Å¿uch authority upon himÅ¿elfe: for S. <hi>John</hi> was an ApoÅ¿tle, and an univerÅ¿all PaÅ¿tor, tyed to no one place or flock, but had the Å¿ame power and authority that <hi>Paul</hi> and all the other ApoÅ¿tles had over all the Churches, the care of which lay primarily and principally upon them, who were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inÅ¿pired by God, and in all their preachings and writings followed the dictates of his holy Spirit, who Å¿pake in and by them; Å¿o that whatÅ¿oever they taught or writ was to be the rule of all mens thoughts, words, actions, and governments, and it was their place to give Laws unto all Churches and MiniÅ¿ters in them, what they Å¿hould do in the ordering and governing of the Å¿ame; and therefore S. <hi>John</hi> had no leÅ¿Å¿e authority and power over this Church, wherein <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was an Elder, and in and over all other Churches, then S. <hi>Paul</hi> and all the other ApoÅ¿tles had in all Churches: Now if S. <hi>Paul,</hi> could give a Law unto the Church of <hi>Corinth, For the caÅ¿ting out of the InceÅ¿tuous perÅ¿on, and for the carrying of themÅ¿elves with Order and Decency, in their AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Å¿harply reproove offenders in that Church,</hi> and if all the other ApoÅ¿tles did the like, and took Å¿uch Authority upon them over all the members of thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Churches; and that without any tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion of any divine inÅ¿titution, but with the very good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and allowance of God himÅ¿elfe, who writ the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord to all the Churches, then I Å¿ay, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ed not at all in uÅ¿ing his authority and power given him of God over <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> in telling the Church of his faults, and Å¿aying <hi>He would remember him, and Å¿harply reprove him;</hi> for this he might well do by his Å¿ole Authority, without any offence, as he was an ApoÅ¿tle, for what he did, he did by immediate Revelation and had a warrant for it from ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, <hi>who Å¿ent his Å¿pirit to lead him into all truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is a ridiculous if not an impious thing in MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> to draw Å¿uch an inference from a phantaÅ¿ie of his own brain, in that he makes no difference between Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary Presbyter and MiniÅ¿ter, and would make that an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which was none, and infer that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> took more upon him than he ought. BeÅ¿ides it had been no tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion in any other Presbyter, if he had writ Å¿o to any Presbytery, under which he had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48122:94"/>
been a fellow Presbyter, to inform them of any miÅ¿carriage in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther PaÅ¿tor or member of that Church wherein he was an Elder, and if he had Å¿aid, <hi>If I come I will remember his deeds,</hi> &amp;c. For in his Å¿o Å¿peaking, he would aÅ¿Å¿ume no more authority to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe, then became a Presbyter to take upon him, as both to witneÅ¿Å¿e to a truth, and to give in evidence of what he knew of Å¿uch a man to his fellow judges, and then to leave it to the judgement of the Presbytery and Common Councell of Elders, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did, whoÅ¿e place it was to cenÅ¿ure Å¿uch an offender, and in his Å¿o doing he Å¿hould no way impeach the power and authority of the Court or Common<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>councell of Presbyters, but rather ratifie and confirme it as all learned men will gather; For by Å¿uch words, he declareth that there is a Å¿tanding Court or Councell there, where offenders are both to be queÅ¿tioned and cenÅ¿ured; for Å¿uch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion, <hi>If I come I will remember his deeds,</hi> Å¿ufficiently declareth, that there was power in their hands, and manifeÅ¿teth, <hi>that he was a judge there among the reÅ¿t, who with others had the hearing of all cauÅ¿es there, and that all buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es of publike concernment ought to be done and tranÅ¿acted by the mutuall and joynt accord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Presbytery, and not to be managed by any one Å¿ingly by himÅ¿elf, or by the people whom God had never given the Keyes unto, nor the power of rule and Government:</hi> This I affirme will neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arily enÅ¿ue and follow, and not that which Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> vainly intimateth. And I am confident that any judicious ChriÅ¿tian up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due deliberation will Å¿ay the Å¿ame, and will conclude, <hi>That</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>his Å¿o writing was no offender, though all things of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like concernment in the Church were ever to be tranÅ¿acted by the joynt agreement and common conÅ¿ent of the Presbytery.</hi> So that all men that are judicious may plainly behold the futility in both the anÅ¿wers and cavills of this man, and well perceive that he was never cut out for a diÅ¿putant, or ever fitted for Government in church or State; who if he might have his own minde would bring in a confuÅ¿ion in both, and violate all order divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and make the head the foot, and the foot the head.</p>
               <p>And truly if a man would but conÅ¿ider the manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their <hi>Å¿even new Churches or rather Å¿eventy</hi> (for every ten or twelve of them prove a Church) he Å¿hould find in them all, Å¿o much diÅ¿order and diÅ¿crepancy amongÅ¿t them, and yet every one of them pretending Divine authority for its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

And Å¿o for many yeeres after the ApoÅ¿tles times they were Governed <hi>Communi conÅ¿ilio presbyterorum,</hi> as our brethren the Independents do confeÅ¿Å¿e and prove by antiquity and humane authority; which weapon I wonder they will contend with, in deciding of Gods matters,

which are only out of his holy Word to be proved, which is to be the rule of our faith.</p>

                  <hi>But it Å¿eemes Saint</hi> AmbroÅ¿e <hi>his authority pleaÅ¿eth them well, though if we looke into it, it makes much againÅ¿t them.

               <p>As for the Presbyterian government, in the Å¿enÅ¿e that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand it, there is nothing more cleere to me in all the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Yea the very word and name of a Presbytery Å¿ignifieth <hi>a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿tracy, or AriÅ¿tocracy, or Signory, or Court;</hi> that is, <hi>a Company, or Senate, or Councell of grave wiÅ¿e, and underÅ¿tanding men,</hi> inveÅ¿ted <hi>with authority and power of ruling, ordering, and commanding, and in whoÅ¿e hands the government is put.</hi> And as the word is taken in the civill polity and Government, Å¿o in the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall; By a Presbytery we underÅ¿tand, <hi>a Religious, Grave, Solid, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and wiÅ¿e councell of Divines and MiniÅ¿ters, or men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate experience; and Å¿uch as know how to Rule and Govern thoÅ¿e that are under their command, with wiÅ¿dome and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and according to the Word of God; and the which men likewiÅ¿e are inveÅ¿ted with Authority and Power for to exerciÅ¿e a juriÅ¿diction over others, and are hereunto called by Å¿uch as are able to judge and diÅ¿cerne of the Å¿ufficiency of their gifts and abilities for this worke, which the ordinary and common people cannot do.</hi> And as in the civill State, the Presbyters and Elders of the people, were thoÅ¿e <hi>that had the rule over them for the common good of them all and for their bodily preÅ¿ervation;</hi> So the Presbyters and Elders in the Church are thoÅ¿e <hi>that have the rule and government over the Churches for the Å¿pirituall good of their Å¿ouls.</hi> And as Kings and Rulers are by a Metaphoricall and borrowed Å¿peech called PaÅ¿tors and Sheepherds of the people, and are Å¿aid to feed the flocks committed to their charge, by which word is underÅ¿toode the exerciÅ¿e of all lawfull and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate authority agreeable to the Law of God over them; Å¿o the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>MiniÅ¿ters</hi> are called the <hi>PaÅ¿tors</hi> and <hi>Sheepherds, yea,</hi> and <hi>Stewards</hi> over the flocks committed to their charges,

and they are commanded to feed them; by which metaphor they are inveÅ¿ted with the authority and power both of preaching and ruling, and have the Government over thoÅ¿e flocks put into their hands, which they muÅ¿t alwayes exerciÅ¿e according to Gods Word; they muÅ¿t feed them and rule them in the Lord, and not after their own wills and pleaÅ¿ures, they may not <hi>have dominion over our faith,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith in the 2. of the <hi>Corinthians; chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 24. <hi>But that they Å¿hould be helpers of our joy;</hi> that is, they may not uÅ¿urpe an abÅ¿olute Soveraignty or power over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences of the people, as if the Å¿pirituall Å¿tate and welfare of their flocks depended on them, which is onely grounded upon their faith in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t; but as they are the Stewards of God, and MiniÅ¿ters and Å¿ervants of the Church, Å¿o they Å¿hould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them and rejoyce their hearts in the Lord, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h them in the faith; and uÅ¿e all the care and diligence that is poÅ¿Å¿ible, like <hi>good Shepheards,</hi> to preÅ¿erve the flockes committed to their charge, that they Å¿traggle and Å¿tray not from ChriÅ¿ts fold, and run not into the by-wayes and thickets of Å¿inne and errour, and be corrupted with noyÅ¿ome food, and falÅ¿e Doctrine: And if they have any among them that are unruly, that they bring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into order: or if they have any Å¿icke, feeble, poor or weak, that they cure, releeve, comfort, and reÅ¿tore Å¿uch: and if they have any that are infected or Å¿cabby, that they remove Å¿uch from the Å¿ound, till they be recovered: or if they have any broken or wounded, that they heal and recover them with all lenity and humanity; and that they Å¿hould by common<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>councell govern and order their flocks, and take Å¿peciall care that the particular PaÅ¿tors and MiniÅ¿ters of the Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Presbytery and charge, aÅ¿Å¿ume not any Å¿ole and Å¿overaign Authority to themÅ¿elves over the flock, to do any thing of publike concernment, <hi>without the joynt conÅ¿ent of that PreÅ¿bytery or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Corporation, under whoÅ¿e commands they are.</hi> And it Å¿tands with all reaÅ¿on, that a Common councell, of godly, grave, learned, and experienced miniÅ¿ters, Å¿hould ever be more able to manage and order a government, then two or three unexperienced men, or two or three hundred young people, of which moÅ¿t Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations conÅ¿iÅ¿t, in whom the Å¿ap of youth is not yet dryed up; or if many of them Å¿hould be of riper years, yet they know little what belongs to government, and therefore they can never be Å¿o

               <p>But by the way, an objection is here to be anÅ¿wered unto, made by Å¿ome of the Independents after this manner.</p>
               <p>The Elders and Presbyters of the ApoÅ¿tles times, <hi>Å¿ay they,</hi> by the impoÅ¿ition of their hands, gave the gift of tongues and propheÅ¿ie, <hi>Acts 19. 1, 2, 3, 4 5.</hi> and the <hi>8. 18</hi> and <hi>1 Tim. 4. 14.</hi> and healed the Å¿ick <hi>Iames 5. 14, 15.</hi> according to our Saviours promiÅ¿e <hi>Mark. 16. 18.</hi> Let, <hi>Å¿ay they,</hi> the Presbyters of our time, let them impoÅ¿e their hands upon the Å¿ick and heale them, let them by impoÅ¿ing hands upon their diÅ¿ciples inable them on a Å¿udden to Å¿peake with Å¿trange tongues, and foretell things to come; and then we will acknowledge them for a true Presbytery, then will they be a right aÅ¿Å¿embly of Elders, and the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors; but, if they cannot give to others, nor yet have for themÅ¿elves in Å¿tore, any of the true ApoÅ¿tles, any of the right PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters gifts and characters, we may not, we dare not acknowledge them as Å¿uch.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e are their formall words in print. Before I come to my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer, I deÅ¿ire there may be Å¿peciall notice taken of this Objection, and Å¿uch like; for, for ought that I know, if any man will argue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this manner, all ChriÅ¿tian religion may be called in queÅ¿tion, and no man will have any Creed or Belief, except he may make his own Articles, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, who Å¿aid, <hi>VnleÅ¿Å¿e I put my hands into his Å¿ide and my fingers into the print of the nailes, I will not believe.</hi> And as the Iews Å¿aid unto our bleÅ¿Å¿ed Saviour, <hi>Thou that Å¿avedÅ¿t others, now Å¿ave thy Å¿elf, come down from the CroÅ¿Å¿e and then we will believe in thee,</hi> do this miracle and then thou wilt perÅ¿wade us. Here we Å¿ee, they would make their own Articles, or elÅ¿e they would have no Creed. The Jewes had learned this method of diÅ¿puting from the Devill, who at his meeting of our Saviour ChriÅ¿t, and at his firÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ault, thus diÅ¿puted, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>and wouldeÅ¿t have the world Å¿o believe, and me too, on thee, then</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48122:97"/>
                  <hi>command theÅ¿e Å¿tones to be made bread, do this miracle firÅ¿t;</hi> but thou canÅ¿t not do it, <hi>Ergo.</hi> So in like manner theÅ¿e men argue, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> Å¿ay they, <hi>the Presbyters by the impoÅ¿ition of their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their DiÅ¿ciples, can inable them on a Å¿udden to speake with Å¿trange tongues, to foretell things to come, and heal the Å¿icke, &amp;c. we will not acknowledge them to be true Elders: but let them do all theÅ¿e things by the impoÅ¿ition of their hands, and then wee will acknowledge them for a true Presbytery.</hi> See the vanity of theÅ¿e men, and the inÅ¿tability of their faith, by their own confeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; miracles will make them believe any thing, if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit their own words, though never Å¿o contrary to their <hi>judgement</hi> and to the <hi>faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> It is well known to the Learned, that the ApoÅ¿tles and thoÅ¿e Primitive chriÅ¿tians had extraordinary and wonderfull gifts, that raviÅ¿ht the world then into admiration; and it is confeÅ¿t alÅ¿o by all underÅ¿tanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians, that thoÅ¿e wonder-working miracles were but temporary, as the miraculous feeding of the people with <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneÅ¿Å¿e, where they were fellow-commoners with the Angels, and continued but till they came into <hi>the Land that flowed with Milk and Honey.</hi> So thoÅ¿e miracles of the Primitive chriÅ¿tians continued but for a time, till the GoÅ¿pell and the truth of the ChriÅ¿tian faith and doctrine was confirmed and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, which being once done, and the holy Scriptures which were to be the rule of faith to the end of the world being left to poÅ¿terity, and to which we are tyed and commanded <hi>not to be wiÅ¿e above that which is written,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and forbid in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwiÅ¿e then we have been taught, though the ApoÅ¿tles or an Angell from heaven Å¿hould teach otherwiÅ¿e;</hi> after, I Å¿ay, the Doctrine of the ChriÅ¿tian Faith and Religion was confirmed, the ordinary working of Miracles ceaÅ¿ed. And it is Å¿aid of AntichriÅ¿t in 2 <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿.</hi> chap. 2. <hi>That he Å¿hall come with Å¿trong deluÅ¿ions and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, and with all deceiveableneÅ¿s in them that periÅ¿h, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they received not the love of the truth, that they might be Å¿aved.</hi> So that I cannot Å¿ufficiently wonder, to Å¿ee the dealing of theÅ¿e men, who in theÅ¿e dayes expect and look for miracles to confirme their faith, when notwithÅ¿tanding we are forwarned to <hi>take heed of all falÅ¿e deluÅ¿ions,</hi> and commanded to the contrary. <hi>Shew us Å¿ome miracles,</hi> Å¿ay they, <hi>and then we will believe you are true PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi> So dealt the Jewes with ChriÅ¿t, <hi>What Å¿igne Å¿heweÅ¿t</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48122:98"/>
                  <hi>thou that wee may beleeve in thee?</hi> But when ChriÅ¿t had Å¿hewed them Å¿igne upon Å¿igne, and miracle upon miracle, were they ever the more convinced? Did thoÅ¿e miracles create beliefe in them? No Å¿urely, but rather hardned them and made them blaÅ¿pheme. When he caÅ¿t out Devils, they Å¿ay <hi>he did it by the Prince of Devils.</hi> So without doubt, if the Presbyters had thoÅ¿e gifts of miracles, that they could gratifie theÅ¿e men with daily prodigies and workes of wonder, they would then Å¿ay, <hi>they came with lying wonders, and with the working of Satan,</hi> and they would make the world abhor them the more. There is an old Å¿aying, <hi>that hee muÅ¿t riÅ¿e early and never goe to bed, that will pleaÅ¿e all men:</hi> and truly it would be not onely difficult, but an impoÅ¿Å¿ible thing, for any State or great Councell, were it never Å¿o wiÅ¿e, to pleaÅ¿e all the people under them. God himÅ¿elfe, nor <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> nor <hi>Aaron</hi> his Å¿ervants, could pleaÅ¿e the IÅ¿raelites though they Å¿aw never Å¿uch wonders continually before their eyes, to confirme their authority; yea they told <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to their faces, <hi>that they tooke too much upon them.</hi> And afterwards they caÅ¿t off Gods own government &amp; <hi>God himÅ¿elfe,</hi> as the Lord complains to <hi>Samuel,</hi> in 1 <hi>Samuel, and would Å¿et up a governement after the modell of their owne braine,</hi> as it is at large Å¿et downe in that Booke. And not long after they changed the manner of Gods worÅ¿hip, in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time, <hi>and taught the feare of God,</hi> as the Lord complaineth, <hi>IÅ¿ay</hi> 29. <hi>after the precepts of men,</hi> and rejected Gods commandements, as ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. and <hi>Marke</hi> 7. So that what they thought beÅ¿t in their owne eyes, that was ever beÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ing unto them. They would not content themÅ¿elves <hi>with the Written Word,</hi> though they were never Å¿o often by <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> and all the reÅ¿t of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, commanded to cleave unto it, Å¿aying, <hi>to the Law and to the TeÅ¿timony, IÅ¿ay</hi> 8. Even Å¿o it is now in theÅ¿e dayes, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not themÅ¿elves with that Ordinance <hi>that is Å¿et downe in the Written Word,</hi> but Å¿ay, <hi>Come Å¿hew us Å¿ome miracles, and then wee will beleeve you are a right Presbyterie.</hi> Our Saviour Å¿peaking to the Jewes concerning Saint <hi>Iohn the BaptiÅ¿t</hi> and HimÅ¿elfe, <hi>Iohn,</hi> Å¿aith hee, <hi>came neither eating nor drinking, and ye Å¿ay behold hee hath a Devill; the Sonne of Man came both eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ye Å¿ay, hee is a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi> So that whatÅ¿oever method or way God uÅ¿ed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them, they cavil'd againÅ¿t it, and were never Å¿atisfied;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48122:98"/>
alwayes reÅ¿iÅ¿ting the Spirit of God, as <hi>Stephen</hi> told them in <hi>Act.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>So now, in theÅ¿e our times they looke for miracles, and a new way of teaching. But all good ChriÅ¿tians are forbid to liÅ¿ten af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to give heed to miracles: <hi>and are Å¿ent unto</hi> MoÅ¿es <hi>and the Prophets, Luke</hi> 16. <hi>and are commanded to Å¿earch the Scripture, John</hi> 5. Yea our Saviour himÅ¿elfe in the perÅ¿on of <hi>Abraham, Luke</hi> 16. Å¿aith, <hi>That if men will not beleeve MoÅ¿es and the Prophets, they will not be perÅ¿waded by miracles:</hi> and I am confident, that could the Presbyters doe all thoÅ¿e miracles theÅ¿e men deÅ¿ire, they would the more reproach them, and exclaime againÅ¿t them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme they <hi>wrought by the Devill,</hi> as the Jews told our <hi>Saviour</hi> he did. I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e, I am of a contrary opinion to theÅ¿e men, not only in the matter of miracles, but in all external performances; for I am inÅ¿tructed in the holy Å¿criptures, <hi>that the Devill can transforme himÅ¿elfe into an Angell of light, and that the Deceivers and falÅ¿e Teachers Å¿hall come forth in Å¿heeps clothing, and for outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Å¿halequalize, if not exceed, the faithfulleÅ¿t &amp; trueÅ¿t PaÅ¿tors and MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t;</hi> and therefore we are in Å¿peciall, commanded to take heed of Å¿uch: and for my particular, if any men whatÅ¿oever of never Å¿uch Å¿eeming Å¿anctity, Å¿ufficient abilities, unblameable life, Å¿hould come forth and teach any other <hi>Doctrine of Faith, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> then that I have been taught in the <hi>holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and Å¿hould confirme this their Doctrine with never Å¿o many miracles, I will Å¿till continue Å¿tedfaÅ¿t in the <hi>Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles,</hi> and cleave unto the <hi>written Word,</hi> and will never beleeve contrary to that, though I Å¿hould undergoe the greateÅ¿t miÅ¿ery, or be expoÅ¿ed to the greateÅ¿t want by it, that any man ever Å¿aw: for I know that all theÅ¿e momentary trials and afflictions are not worthy that exceeding weight of glory that Å¿hall be revealed. And for this very point of the Presbytery, in that Å¿enÅ¿e I take it, I am Å¿o well aÅ¿Å¿ured that it is Gods Ordinance, as I am of any point in Religion. But as I Å¿aid before, if men may argue after this way. <hi>The Presbyters in the ApoÅ¿tles times did miracles, and Å¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

MoÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> faÅ¿ted forty dayes and forty nights, and

did many miracles, do you Å¿o, and then we will beleeve you are true Prophets, and Å¿ent to us of God, otherwiÅ¿e we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you to be true Prophets. Yea all the wicked and ungodly men of theÅ¿e times may argue thus alÅ¿o: <hi>God gave unto his Church ApoÅ¿tles, EvangeliÅ¿ts, Prophets, &amp;c. and they Å¿pake all Å¿trange tongues and divers languages, and did many miracles; but you and your Congregations, have neither ApoÅ¿tles, Prophets, nor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliÅ¿ts, nor ye have not the gifts of Tongues, nor yee can do no Miracle:</hi> Ergo, <hi>you are not the true Church.</hi> The Primitive ChriÅ¿tians and the Å¿ervants of God in thoÅ¿e times, had the gifts of Tongues and PropheÅ¿ie, and the holy GhoÅ¿t came down upon them, and they Å¿pake by direction from God his infallible truth and GoÅ¿pell, whoÅ¿e Å¿peeches were not tyed to time, and to one Å¿peaker, <hi>but many Å¿pake one after another by Interpreters,</hi> as it is at large Å¿et down in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 14. verÅ¿. 27. 28, 29, 30. &amp;c. So that they Å¿pake infallible truth by direction from God: <hi>But you have none in your Congregations Å¿o miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louÅ¿ly inÅ¿pired with Å¿undry languages, and divers tongues, nor ye do not Å¿peake infallible truths by direction from God; nor you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cure diÅ¿eaÅ¿es nor do miracles:</hi> ErgÃ², <hi>your religion is not the Å¿ame Religion; nor your Congregations the true Church: Å¿hew us theÅ¿e miracles and then we will beleeve you to be the true Church, otherwiÅ¿e we may not, we dare not acknowledge you to be the true Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again they may argue thus:</hi> The Apostles and Primitive Pastors, and Teachers preached freely, and laboured with their own hands, and were helpfull to the neceÅ¿Å¿ities of others, and were not burthenÅ¿ome and exacting from others, and spake <hi>ex tempore,</hi> by direction from God: but your Ministers in your Congregations do not preach freely, nor labour not with their own hands, nor are not helpfull to to others neceÅ¿Å¿ities, but are rather burdenÅ¿ome and exacting from others; nor they do no miracles, nor speake not immediately by inspiration, and <hi>ex tempore;</hi> but by Study and out of their Bookes, and are confined to time, and Å¿peake not in Å¿trange tongues and languages, one after another by Interpreters. <hi>ErgÃ²,</hi> Your MiniÅ¿ters are not Gods Ministers, nor your Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the true Church, nor your people true ChriÅ¿tians; for you want all thoÅ¿e things that the Primitive ChriÅ¿tians and the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches had.</p>

There is a Pamphlet lately come out, and highly eÅ¿teemed and priÅ¿ed amongÅ¿t many, full of Å¿uch conÅ¿equences as theÅ¿e, which if they hold good againÅ¿t the Presbyters, they may alÅ¿o for ought I know, be of equall validity to overthrow, not onely all ChriÅ¿tian Congregations, but indeed all ChriÅ¿tian Religion. But briefly to anÅ¿wer.</p>
               <p>We look upon the ApoÅ¿tles and Primitive Presbyters, as men miraculouÅ¿ly and extraordinarily gifted, and as wonder-working men for the confirmation of the truth of the GoÅ¿pell to all Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages; and we conÅ¿ider in them and in the ChriÅ¿tians of thoÅ¿e times, Å¿omething extraordinary and temporary, <hi>as their working of miracles, and Å¿peaking of Å¿trange tongues, and gifts of healing, &amp;c.</hi> And thoÅ¿e we conceive were to continue no longer in the church, then for the confirmation of the truth of the GoÅ¿pel; ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe proclaiming thoÅ¿e bleÅ¿Å¿ed, <hi>that believe without Å¿eeing of miracles,</hi> Å¿peaking unto <hi>Thomas, Iohn</hi> 20. 29. <hi>BecauÅ¿e thou haÅ¿t Å¿een me,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>thou believeÅ¿t, bleÅ¿Å¿ed are they that have not Å¿een, and have believed.</hi> So that miracles now are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and we are tied to the written Word. But we conÅ¿ider likewiÅ¿e in the ApoÅ¿tles and Primitive Presbyters, that that was permanent and to continue in all MiniÅ¿ters and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Å¿ucceeding ages to the end of the world, and that was the power of order and preaching, and the power of juriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that is of ruling (which is not denied by the moÅ¿t learned of the Independents themÅ¿elves) and this I have proved by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> to be tranÅ¿acted over to all <hi>ChriÅ¿tian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> whoÅ¿e Presbyters have that power given unto them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the Learned Brethren deny it, whatÅ¿oever the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may do. Yea, the very name of a Presbytery (as I Å¿aid before) if we look through the whole Scripture, Å¿ignifieth a <hi>MagiÅ¿tracy,</hi> or <hi>Signiory,</hi> or <hi>Corporation</hi> inveÅ¿ted with authority of governing and ruling; and Å¿uch a counÅ¿ell and company of men, as upon whom the government under ChriÅ¿t is laid, and to be extended Å¿o far, as their juriÅ¿diction extendeth, and as far as by common conÅ¿ent it may make for the good and edification of the church, and for the Å¿afety of the Å¿ame. And Å¿uch was the government of all thoÅ¿e churches of the New TeÅ¿tament, which were as Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Committees, their limits and bounds prefixed them, as at this dayall Committees through the Kingdom have in their Å¿everall Hundreds, Rapes, Wapentakes, and Cities, to whom the ordering
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48122:100"/>
and government of thoÅ¿e places that are under them, are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Å¿o that all that is done or tranÅ¿acted, muÅ¿t be done by the joynt conÅ¿ent, and councell of the whole Committee, not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man or any two of them Å¿everally conÅ¿idered by themÅ¿elvs, can make an order; but that order onely is binding which is made by the joynt conÅ¿ent and common agreement of them all, or the greateÅ¿t part of them aÅ¿Å¿embled together. <hi>Even Å¿o all thoÅ¿e par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations that are within the compaÅ¿Å¿e and juriÅ¿dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Å¿everall PreÅ¿byteries, are to be ordered and governed by the common and joynt councell of the Å¿everall PreÅ¿byters, or the greater part of them.</hi> For this was the order the ApoÅ¿tles eÅ¿tabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed, appointing in every City a Presbytery; and when they had Å¿o ordered the Churches, they Å¿et them all to their Å¿everall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the <hi>PreÅ¿byters to command,</hi> and all the <hi>people and particular AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations under them, to obey;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ever found in the holy Scriptures, that the people were joyned with the Presbyters in their CommiÅ¿Å¿ion. So that they that oppoÅ¿e this government, reÅ¿iÅ¿t Gods Ordinance. And if we looke into all the <hi>EpiÅ¿tles</hi> writ by the <hi>ApoÅ¿tles</hi> to the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Churches,</hi> we Å¿hall finde in them, <hi>That they enjoyne all the Å¿everall Congregations to yeeld obedience to their PaÅ¿tors and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over them, and Å¿ignifie unto them that they owe unto them double honour, eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch as labour in the Word and Doctrine;</hi> that is, they muÅ¿t yeeld unto them, not onely due reverence and Å¿ubjection, and obedience to their councell and juÅ¿t commands in the Lord; but that they Å¿hould alÅ¿o afford them the honour of maintenance, and take order there be a Å¿ufficient and competent, yea, an honourable allowance for their Å¿upport; <hi>and that as they miniÅ¿ter to them spirituall food for their Å¿oules, they Å¿hould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e miniÅ¿ter unto them all things neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the maintenance of them and their Families,</hi> that they may comfortably and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Å¿olicitous care, follow their holy imployments and wait upon their Å¿everall MiniÅ¿teries. So that the place and imployment of the Presbyters, is <hi>to teach and rule the people;</hi> and this is their proper worke, and peculiarly belongs unto them; and the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and place of the Å¿everall congregations under them, is <hi>to hear and obey:</hi> and therefore if the Å¿everall congregations do aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume unto themÅ¿elves the power of ruling, they take more upon them then by God is allowed them: and the Presbyters in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48122:100"/>
yeilding unto it, reject their own right, and deveÅ¿t themÅ¿elves of that authority that God hath put into their hands; and by Å¿o doing in time may not onely bring confuÅ¿ion into the Church, but to all thoÅ¿e Countries where Å¿uch uÅ¿urpations are tolerated. I cannot but Å¿peake my conÅ¿cience in this point: And truly, very reaÅ¿on dictates unto a man, that they only Å¿hould have the authority of commanding and ruling over the Churches, to whom the power of the Keyes is given. Now it is given only to the MiniÅ¿ters and Presbyters, as we Å¿ee it in <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. Where our Saviour ChriÅ¿t eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed <hi>a Å¿tanding government, to be continued to the end of the World,</hi> the violating and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of the which, was the cauÅ¿e of all thoÅ¿e confuÅ¿ions, both in doctrine and manners that is now come upon the world; and was the cauÅ¿e, not only of the riÅ¿e, but the growth of AntichriÅ¿t. And the reducing of it again into the Church, and the re<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>Å¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hing of it, will be the confuÅ¿ion of that <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and of all the <hi>AntichriÅ¿tian-brood,</hi> and be a meanes of eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing truth and peace through the ChriÅ¿tian world. But it will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e a little to conÅ¿ider that place in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>If thy Brother,</hi> Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t <hi>Å¿hall treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t thee, go and tell him of it between thee and him alone: if he Å¿hall heare thee, thou Å¿halt gaine thy brother; but if he will not heare thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneÅ¿Å¿es, every word may be eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed. And if he Å¿hall neglect to heare them; then tell it unto the Church: but if he neglect to heare the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen man and a Publican. Verily, verily I Å¿ay unto you, whatÅ¿oever ye Å¿hall binde on earth, Å¿hall be bound in heaven, and whatÅ¿oever ye Å¿hall looÅ¿e on earth, Å¿hall be looÅ¿ed in heaven.</hi> In theÅ¿e words our Saviour ChriÅ¿t has reÅ¿pect unto the order and cuÅ¿tome of judicature in thoÅ¿e times in cenÅ¿uring mens manners and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which among the Jewes was ordered and adminiÅ¿tred by an aÅ¿Å¿embly and counÅ¿ell of learned, experienced, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and by a Presbytery, ConÅ¿iÅ¿tory, or Colledge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men for government, choÅ¿e and Å¿elected out of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for this very purpoÅ¿e, by Å¿uch as could judge and diÅ¿cerne of their abilities: the which aÅ¿Å¿embly and company, is by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf called a Church, becauÅ¿e it did repreÅ¿ent the Church, and in this place ChriÅ¿t did eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the like to be continued in the ChriÅ¿tian church to the end of the world, making his ApoÅ¿tles
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48122:101"/>
this repreÅ¿entative body, and their Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors all the godly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly MiniÅ¿ters and Presbyters, and gives unto them the Å¿ame power and Authority, to judge and determine of all things belonging unto faith and manners that was obÅ¿erved in the JewiÅ¿h church, in all EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall DiÅ¿cipline. For otherwiÅ¿e, the ChriÅ¿tian church Å¿hould be inferior to that of the Jews, if they had not the Å¿ame Priviledges for the cenÅ¿uring of manners and Doctrines, and the Å¿ame power of juriÅ¿diction and ruling that they had. Now all power of juriÅ¿diction among the Jews, was exerciÅ¿ed not by the promiÅ¿cuous multitude, or by the whole congregation, nor by any particular man, nor by two or three (as the place above Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies) but by an <hi>AÅ¿Å¿embly, Senate, Councell,</hi> or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> of <hi>underÅ¿tanding men aÅ¿Å¿igned to that purpoÅ¿e,</hi> which our Saviour himÅ¿elf calleth <hi>a Church;</hi> &amp; this government eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian church, are the Å¿everall Presbyteries, where all things are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿acted by common and joynt conÅ¿ent: and this was the practiÅ¿e of the ApoÅ¿tles at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> who did all buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of publike concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by common and joynt conÅ¿ent, as is manifeÅ¿t, <hi>in the firÅ¿t chap. of the</hi> Acts, <hi>in chuÅ¿ing of an ApoÅ¿tle in</hi> Iudas <hi>his place,</hi> and in the 5. chap. in cenÅ¿uring <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> and in the 6. chap. in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing <hi>Deacons, and in the</hi> 15. <hi>chapter in determining the queÅ¿tion there in hand,</hi> all in a Presbyterian way and by common conÅ¿ent.</p>
               <p>And this is that government, that God hath commanded to be perpetuated to the end of the world, in theÅ¿e words; <hi>WhatÅ¿oever ye Å¿hall binde on earth, Å¿hall be bound in heaven, and whatÅ¿oever ye Å¿hall looÅ¿e on earth Å¿hall be looÅ¿ed in heaven.</hi> So that the Presbyters onely have the power of the keyes, &amp; it is their place only to ordain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters and Church Officers, (whatÅ¿oever Authority the people may exerciÅ¿e in the chuÅ¿ing of them) as <hi>Paul</hi> writes unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>they onely are to judge and determine and to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure in matters of manners and doctrine,</hi> and <hi>the people are to allow and approve it according to the Word of God.</hi> Yea the very Synagogues of the Jews, which were the Å¿ame that our churches are, were governed by a Presbytery, (as our brethren acknowledge) called by the name of the Rulers of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, who governed by joynt and common councell; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and manifeÅ¿t, in that there were Å¿uperior and inferior Judges<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Commanders, and Rulers, according as their yeares, gravity and wiÅ¿dome made them more emninent then others, and venerable to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48122:101"/>
the people: as may appeare in many places as <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. It is Å¿aid there, <hi>That CriÅ¿pus the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved with all his houÅ¿hould.</hi> So that if there were a chiefe Ruler, or Iudge, or a PreÅ¿ident; there muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be a Councell or Segniory of inferiour ones, that had Rule and Authority over others as well as he: and where there is a chiefe JuÅ¿tice or Judge, there are other Judges joyned with him, as all reaÅ¿on perÅ¿wades, and there muÅ¿t needs be a Court of Judicature, where all things are tranÅ¿acted, by conjoynt and common conÅ¿ent and agreement: and Å¿o it was in the Synagogues of the Jewes, who were Å¿ubject to, and ordered by the determinations and abitrement of their Rulers and Governours. So that the Å¿everall Churches or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues under the Jews were in Å¿ubjection to thoÅ¿e Rulers, and were governed according as by common councell they ordered. And <hi>Mat.</hi> the 5. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 22. <hi>And behold there came one of the Rulers of the Synagogue, whoÅ¿e name was Iairus<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> here was a Å¿peciall <hi>Ecce</hi> added to take notice, that a great man, and one in authority, came unto ChriÅ¿t, and that in a publick way, and one of the Rulers of the Synagogue. So that wee may obÅ¿erve the people in every Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue were governed and commanded by their Rulers, and they were to yeeld obedience unto them, and were not joyned with them in CommiÅ¿Å¿ion, but Å¿tood to their determination, as all men uÅ¿e to doe in Courts of Judicature, that appeal unto them for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice. And this cuÅ¿tome and manner of government was tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted over to the ChriÅ¿tian Churches; and thoÅ¿e that were called Rulers among them, are among ChriÅ¿tians Å¿ometimes called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> Å¿ometimes <hi>Guides,</hi> Å¿ometimes <hi>Rulers,</hi> and by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe and by his ApoÅ¿tles, are appointed over all ChriÅ¿tian Churches as Å¿o many corporations; to which all the AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations under them, and committed to their charge, are to yeeld <hi>obedience and Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, in whatÅ¿oever they command in the Lord, and according to his bleÅ¿Å¿ed Word;</hi> for that muÅ¿t be the rule both of their <hi>commanding</hi> and of the peoples <hi>obeying.</hi> And this Presbyterian government, is that manner and way of ruling all AÅ¿Å¿emblies and particular Congregations under it, that God hath appointed in his Church, to be continued to the end of the world; <hi>the which whoÅ¿oever reÅ¿iÅ¿teth, reÅ¿iÅ¿teth the Ordinance of God.</hi> And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿poken in generall, in way of proofe, <hi>That all Churches wee have mention of under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament,</hi>

               <p>And now I come to prove in order the foure PropoÅ¿itions or concluÅ¿ions I undertooke to make good.

Now when it is Å¿aid that a City goeth out, it is to be underÅ¿tood either of the whole people, Man, Woman, and Child, old and young, with all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; as many times it happens, in great Earth-quakes, or Å¿ome PeÅ¿tilence or Inundation, that all the Inhabitants are forced to leave a City, and to Å¿eek Å¿ome other habitation, or of Å¿ome great part; but we cannot conceive the going out of JeruÅ¿alem to <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> in that large Å¿enÅ¿e and expreÅ¿Å¿ion; Å¿o that in this place it muÅ¿t be taken Synecdochycally, and we are to underÅ¿tand <hi>a great part,</hi> or <hi>a chiefe part for the whole:</hi> as when a City is Å¿aid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine a King, or to go out to meet a King, here it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood principally of the chief <hi>Officers,</hi> as the <hi>Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and the Common-councell, and all their Å¿everall <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and chiefe <hi>Captaines</hi> and <hi>Commanders,</hi> with all their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence; Å¿o that in this notion the <hi>common people</hi> and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Citizens are not thought on, or at leaÅ¿t are not numbred.

UÅ¿urper and a Tyrant, and all his Nobles, Peers, and Great men being confederate with him, and adjutors in his uÅ¿urpation and tyranny, and conceiving that ChriÅ¿t was an earthly Monarch; and that after the manner of the Kings of the Earth, he would not onely pull down the UÅ¿urper, but likewiÅ¿e call all them in queÅ¿tion, as guilty of High TreaÅ¿on, and cut them of as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices and abettors; this made them tremble and feare; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it was the generall fear of all the great men in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and of all the Courtiers and Officers under <hi>Herod,</hi> therefore it is Å¿aid, <hi>that</hi> Herod <hi>and all IeruÅ¿alem with him was troubled.</hi> So that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and their complices never have any reall peace.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48122:103"/>
PhariÅ¿ees and the PrieÅ¿ts; all the people, or the generality of the people in IeruÅ¿alem were baptized, and became ChriÅ¿tians, and imbraced the GoÅ¿pell: and this was accounted among the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that was wrought in thoÅ¿e dayes, and as a thing of Å¿peciall obÅ¿ervation, and as a matter of wonder; as we may Å¿ee in the meÅ¿Å¿age our Saviour ChriÅ¿t Å¿ent unto <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> by his DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he bad them relate unto their MaÅ¿ter, what they had Å¿een and heard in the 22. <hi>VerÅ¿e; Tell him</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>That the blinde Å¿ee, the lame walke, the Leapers are cleanÅ¿ed, the deafe heare, and the dead are raiÅ¿ed, and the poore receive the GoÅ¿pel;</hi> this I Å¿ay, was among the miracles, that the generality of the poore imbrace the GoÅ¿pel, and were baptized and made Believers: which muÅ¿t needs import a mighty multitude, and a great increaÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e it would not have been a thing of Å¿uch wonder, and have been Å¿ent unto Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> as a miraculous thing; and a thing worthy to prove ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf to be the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿iah</hi> looked for; for no meere man could have wrought Å¿uch a work, asto draw the hearts of the the people to imbrace the GoÅ¿pel, but the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿iah</hi> himÅ¿elf; <hi>For Paul may plant, and Apollo may water,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. but God only the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿iah,</hi> muÅ¿t give the increaÅ¿e; he muÅ¿t move the heart to imbrace the GoÅ¿pel, and to believe; <hi>for faith is the gift of God, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2. and therefore this was the wonder that the generality of the people did believe and were baptized, and this was the Å¿ole work and operation of ChriÅ¿t, and therefore proved him to be the Prophet they looked for. And it Å¿tands with all reaÅ¿on that there were infinites of people in JeruÅ¿alem that believed; and that <hi>Iohn</hi> was greatly magnified of the people, and publickly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, becauÅ¿e for a time, <hi>Herod</hi> himÅ¿elfe countenanced <hi>Iohn Mark.</hi> 6. 20<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>and feared him, knowing that he was a juÅ¿t man and an holy, and obÅ¿erved him, and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</hi> And although we read not that he was baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet he highly honoured him; till <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him, <hi>and told him, it was not lawfull for him to have his Brothers Wife.</hi> And in this interim of his Å¿eeming favour, we may conceive, that the Courtiers alÅ¿o and the great men would do as their MaÅ¿ter did: for if we obÅ¿erve the manner of all Courts to this day, what the King does the Courtiers alÅ¿o do; if the King laugh, though there be perhaps a cauÅ¿e of mourning, they will all laugh; and if he frownes, though there be a cauÅ¿e of cheerfulneÅ¿Å¿e
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48122:104"/>
and Å¿miling, they will al frown; and if the King commends any man, they will all admire him; and if he hears any MiniÅ¿ter glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will all heare him willingly: and if he when he is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, be angry and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed, and will cut off his head whom he had Å¿o honoured but the day before, then all the Courtiers, they will helpe him, and further the worke: as we may Å¿ee, not only in the example of <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> but in <hi>Haman;</hi> as Å¿oon as the King frownd upon him, the Courtiers they covered his face, and up they truÅ¿Å¿ed him; be it right or wrong it is all one to Courtiers. But in that interim, I Å¿ay, that <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t</hi> was in favour with the King, without doubt it animated the people greatly to follow him, and by hearing him, many thouÅ¿and Saints were converted, and the multitudes of them were numerous, as is manifeÅ¿t from <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 5. for it is Å¿aid, <hi>That when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude, becauÅ¿e they counted him as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> Here are two obÅ¿ervables, the one, <hi>That he that feared not God, was afraid of his Å¿ervants.</hi> The Å¿econd, <hi>that it was a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty multitude of Believers that were in IeruÅ¿alem; for a few could not have awed the King and kept him in feare: and therefore he was forced to defer the cutting off of his head, till he had got to him all the Å¿trength of Galilee, all his Lords and high Captains, and his chiefe EÅ¿tates and Commanders, Mark</hi> 6. 21. And when he thought himÅ¿elfe Å¿trong enough, then he exerciÅ¿ed his tyranny. Yea, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was taken away, yet the multitudes of the people <hi>continued stedfaÅ¿t in the faith,</hi> as we may Å¿ee in <hi>Luke</hi> 20. by the confeÅ¿Å¿ion of the very enemies: for when our Saviour asked them concerning the baptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn, Whether it was from Heaven or of Men? And they reaÅ¿oned among themÅ¿elves, Å¿aying, if we Å¿hall Å¿ay from Heaven, he will Å¿ay, why then believed ye him not? and if we Å¿ay of Men, all the people will Å¿tone us, for they be perÅ¿waded that Iohn was a Prophet.</hi> Here by the confeÅ¿Å¿ion of the very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, all the people, or the generality of them were Believers; and it muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be a mighty multitude, that kept all the PrieÅ¿ts and all the Elders that had all the power in their hands, in awe, that they durÅ¿t not Å¿o much as open their mouthes againÅ¿t <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t.</hi> From all which places, and many more that might be produced, to prove, <hi>That there were Å¿o many Believers in IeruÅ¿alem as could not all meet in one place or roome, or in one Congregation, to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip;</hi> I thus argue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48122:104"/>
Where there was an infinite multitude, or a mighty City of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, there they could not all meet together in one place or roome, or in one Congregation, for the enjoying of all acts of worÅ¿hip, and for edification (which is required in the Churches, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 26.)</hi> but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, and divers diviÅ¿ions, that they might be all edified, and partake in all Ordinances. But in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, by the very baptiÅ¿me and preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> there were infinite multitudes, and a very City of Believers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place or roome, or in one congregation for the enjoying of all acts of worÅ¿hip, and for edification (which is required in the Church of God) but of neceÅ¿Å¿itie must be distributed into Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, and divers diviÅ¿ions, that they might all be edified, &amp; partake in all ordinances. For the major, it is cleare, by the very light of nature, and all reaÅ¿on: for there is no one place or houÅ¿e that can contain a whole City, or infinite multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and if any great place could containe them, they could not all be edified and partake of all the acts of worÅ¿hip. For if the very great raw-bon'd building of <hi>Pauls</hi> it Å¿elf were cramm'd full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and had a Preacher of the Å¿trongeÅ¿t lungs in the City, half the people could not hear and be edified, as daily experience telleth us; Å¿o that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, if they would be edified, and partake in all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers congregations, and Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies. <hi>I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured that there were Å¿uch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Believers in JeruÅ¿alem, that five Å¿uch buildings as</hi> Pauls <hi>could not have contained their very bodies within their wals, much leÅ¿Å¿e receive them, or entertaine them for edification. So that for the major, I am confident there is no intelligible man will doubt of it. For the Minor, it is manifeÅ¿t from the places above produced; for our Saviour Å¿aith,</hi> excepting the PhariÅ¿ees and the Lawyers <hi>(which were but a little handfull)</hi> all the people, or the generality of them, juÅ¿tified God, and were baptized, and were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. <hi>So that the concluÅ¿ion from the premiÅ¿es doth neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arily follow. But from the former places I argue yet further after this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where there was Å¿uch an infinite company and multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians and Believers, as kept a tyrannicall King in awe, and all the MagiÅ¿trates and Elders in whoÅ¿e hands was all the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and Å¿truck Å¿uch a fear and terror into them all, that they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48122:105"/>
durÅ¿t not exerciÅ¿e their cruelty and tyranny over them, though they were their inveterate enemies, and deÅ¿ired it: There of neceÅ¿Å¿ity the number of the Believers muÅ¿t be Å¿o great, as they could not all meet together in one place or roome, or in one congregation, for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and partaking in all the acts of worÅ¿hip; but if they would be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies. But in IeruÅ¿alem there were Å¿uch an infinite company and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ChriÅ¿tians and Believers, as kept Herod himÅ¿elf, the tyrant, in awe, all the MagiÅ¿trates and Elders, in whoÅ¿e hands was all the power and authority; and Å¿truck Å¿uch a feare and terror into them, that they durÅ¿t not exerciÅ¿e their cruelty and tyranny over them, though they were their inveterate enemies, and deÅ¿ired it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> of neceÅ¿Å¿ity the number of the Believers was Å¿o great, as they could not all meet together in one place or roome, or in one congregation, for the enjoying and partaking in all acts of worÅ¿hip; but if they would be edified, muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers Congregations and AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblies.</p>
               <p>For the Major and Minor of this SyllogiÅ¿me, beÅ¿ides the force of reaÅ¿on and common underÅ¿tanding, which were enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any rationall creature of the truth of them: the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it Å¿elf (as from the places above Å¿pecified, is manifeÅ¿t) proves them. So that none can doubt of the truth of the concluÅ¿ion, but Å¿uch as will call in queÅ¿tion truth it Å¿elfe. I might out of the Å¿everall places above mentioned draw many more Arguments to prove the concluÅ¿ion; but becauÅ¿e I Å¿tudy brevity, theÅ¿e for the preÅ¿ent Å¿hall Å¿erve, to prove, <hi>That by the very baptiÅ¿me and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tery of</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t, there were Å¿uch an infinite company of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, as they could not al meet together in one place or congregation, for the injoying of all the Ordinances.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To theÅ¿e firÅ¿t arguments of mine, by which I proved that by the very BaptiÅ¿me of S.</hi> Iohn <hi>there were more converted and made ChriÅ¿tians and believeres in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem <hi>then could meete in any one place or Congregation, MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>anÅ¿wers by denying the minor of my SyllogiÅ¿mes, and</hi> I.

The
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48122:105"/>
Scriptures quoted by the Doctor Å¿peak no Å¿uch thing. ThoÅ¿e places in <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> tell us of very many who were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and by ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples; but doe not declare how many of thoÅ¿e baptized perÅ¿ons were of the Church of IeruÅ¿alem; and the Scripture witneÅ¿Å¿eth, <hi>Act. 9. 31.</hi> That there were Churches through all Iudaea, as well as in IeruÅ¿alem; and for ought I know, or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor either, many of thoÅ¿e baptized perÅ¿ons might be in thoÅ¿e Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yea the moÅ¿t of them, and but a few in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem;</hi> it may be no more but thoÅ¿e hundred and twenty mentioned, <hi>Act. 1. 13, 14, 15.</hi> to whom were added about three thouÅ¿and Å¿oules, who continued in the doctrine of the ApoÅ¿tles, and in breaking of bread and prayers, Acts the <hi>2. 42, 43, 44. This is all MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>hath to Å¿ay by way of anÅ¿wer for the enervating of the Å¿trength of my Arguments and ReaÅ¿ons, by which I proved there were more converted by</hi> Iohns <hi>MiniÅ¿terythen could meet in any one place in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem.</p>
               <p>Now here before I come to reply, I referre my Å¿elfe to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader, whether from the forgoing places, which I quoted out of the Holy Word of God, &amp; from the ReaÅ¿ons and Arguments deduced out of it, it was not Å¿ufficiently evinced, <hi>That there were an infinite number of beleevers, and a very Citie of them in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, and therefore more then could meet in any one place or Congregation:</hi> I demand I Å¿ay of any intelligible ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, whether thoÅ¿e Scriptures I cited with the Arguments deduced from them doe not Å¿peake and perÅ¿wade Å¿uch a thing? I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident all Å¿uch as know any thing in learning, will Å¿ay they doe. But for anÅ¿wer, MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> himÅ¿elfe, grants that very many were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> diÅ¿ciples, and none were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized then but Beleevers, as he and all the Independents doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e and acknowledge; but Å¿aith he, <hi>the Scriptures quoted, do not declare how many of thoÅ¿e baptized perÅ¿ons were of the Church of IeruÅ¿alem; for the Scriptures witneÅ¿Å¿e that there were Churches through all Iudaea, as well as in IeruÅ¿alem, and for ought</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>I know or the Doctor either, many of thoÅ¿e baptized perÅ¿ons might be of thoÅ¿e Churches, yea the moÅ¿t of them, and but a few in IeruÅ¿alem, it may be no more but thoÅ¿e hundred and twenty, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Acts the</hi> 1. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>If a bare denyall of any Argument with a Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e ReaÅ¿on or two, and an it may be, were a Å¿ufficient conviction of a truth, then MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> would be a very precious DiÅ¿putant, and to Å¿ay
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48122:106"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thou lyeÅ¿t, would be enough to confute all the PapiÅ¿ts: But in matters of this nature and of Å¿o high concernement, there is more required then bare denials, and vaine evaÅ¿ions and may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee's: And therefore I will take this liberty to tell MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollis,</hi> that hee trifles in Divinity, and deales not like a Å¿erious nor learned ChriÅ¿tian, nor to the purpoÅ¿e: for this is not in queÅ¿tion betweene mee and the Independents, <hi>how many of thoÅ¿e baptized perÅ¿ons through all Iudaea and the Regions round about were reÅ¿ident in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem?</hi> This I Å¿ay was never controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us; for no man that I know of, ever doubted but that all thoÅ¿e that came out of al <hi>Iudaea</hi> and the Regions round about to the MiniÅ¿try &amp; BaptiÅ¿m of <hi>Iohn</hi> and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples, returned home againe to their Å¿everall habitations, and there remained and aboad, as thoÅ¿e that came out of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> to <hi>Iohns</hi> Preaching and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, after they were baptized, repaired to their Å¿everall houÅ¿es &amp; habitations in that Citie, and remained there waiting upon the publick Ordinances; this I conceive all men that have any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding beleeve. And the Scripture Å¿ufficiently declareth, that the multitudes of Beleevers that came out of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, (to Å¿peake nothing now of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles and Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples) were numberleÅ¿Å¿e, and therefore were more then the hundred and twenty names; yea they were innumerable, &amp; therefore more then could meet in any one place or a few. And if the Reader will but looke backe to the Scriptures above quoted, out of which I framed my Arguments, and conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inÅ¿uing Scriptures and ReaÅ¿ons from them, he will eaÅ¿ily perceive that MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> is a meere Quibler, and a man no way fit for either diÅ¿putation, or any Å¿erious imployment.</p>

               <p>And the Å¿ame is further ratified by the words of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29. 30. who Å¿aith, <hi>that all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juÅ¿tified God, being baptized by the BaptiÅ¿me of</hi> John, <hi>but the PhariÅ¿ees and Lawyers rejected the Councell of God againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, being not baptized.</hi> So that now by the mouth of three witneÅ¿Å¿es and by the teÅ¿timony of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe it is Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, <hi>That if JeruÅ¿alem and all the people of JeruÅ¿alem went out and were baptized by</hi> John <hi>(except the PhariÅ¿ees and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers) that there was an innumerable multitude, and therefore more then could poÅ¿Å¿ibly meet in any one place or a few, and many more then the hundred and twenty names Å¿poke of in the firÅ¿t of the Acts;</hi> which fond conceit of Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> is yet more evidently refuted out of the Å¿econd of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is related that there were at that time Inhabitants and Dwellers at JeruÅ¿alem <hi>devout men,</hi> that is, <hi>true WorÅ¿hippers and Beleevers from out of all the Nations under Heaven.</hi> To Å¿ay nothing of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and of <hi>JoÅ¿eph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea</hi> and of many other Rulers, and of all the people and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that cryed <hi>HoÅ¿anna</hi> and that received ChriÅ¿t into the City with all their acclamations and believed in him; the moÅ¿t of which were Inhabitants aud Dwellers in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> and Å¿uch as had their aboad there, Å¿o that by this I have now Å¿aid, the folly and vanity of Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and his cavill is apparantly manifeÅ¿t, and this truth Å¿ufficiently clear to all, that there was an infinite number and a very City of Beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that were of the other Churches in <hi>Judea,</hi> and therefore could not all meet in one place: For the Scripture Å¿aith that IeruÅ¿alem and they of IeruÅ¿alem went out and were baptized by <hi>Iohn the BaptiÅ¿t;</hi> and therefore all good ChriÅ¿tians I am confident will ever beleeve the Scriptures and give credit unto the word of God rather then unto Mr <hi>Knollys;</hi> and if they will beleeve the Scripture of truth, then they will not onely beleeve there was an infinite number and a very City of Beleevers in IeruÅ¿alem, and that by the very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿try and preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> is a very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and blaÅ¿phemous creature as who giveth the Å¿pirit of God the lye and oppoÅ¿eth alÅ¿o all good reaÅ¿on: For the Å¿pirit Å¿aith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem</hi>

               <p>This is the Å¿um of my firÅ¿t Argument. The Å¿econd is this.</p>
               <p>Where there was Å¿uch an infinite company and multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians and believers, as kept a tyrannicall King in awe and all the MagiÅ¿trates and Elders, in whoÅ¿e hands was all the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and Å¿truck Å¿uch a terror into them all, as they durÅ¿t not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e their cruelty and tyranny over them, though they were their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemies, there of neceÅ¿Å¿ity the number of them muÅ¿t be Å¿o great, as they could not all meet together in one place or congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to partake in all Acts of worÅ¿hip. But, in the Church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem there was Å¿uch a company of believers by the very baptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn;</hi> ergo they could not all meete together in any one place or congregation.</p>
               <p>This is the Å¿umme of my arguments, which I made good out of the Word of God, and from Å¿ound reaÅ¿on, as they that have read my booke with judgement, I am confident will acknowledge.</p>

               <p>And to Å¿ay the truth, all the Independents ordinarily uÅ¿e this method in their pretended anÅ¿wers, as firÅ¿t, to let the bookes they reply unto be forgotten, and after that to blurte out Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againÅ¿t them, concealing the truth, and then they crow out as victors and conquerers, that they have beate up our quarters and puld downe the pillars of our diÅ¿courÅ¿e, as <hi>I S.</hi> doth vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this his Pamplet, when it will appeare to all intelligible men that he hath onely caÅ¿t a Å¿quib or two at them, and then as a meere freÅ¿h water Souldier Å¿peedily ran away, and left that worke to others, as he unaduiÅ¿edly in the tenth page and in his wiÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tle confeÅ¿Å¿eth, Å¿ayning indiÅ¿poÅ¿ition of body, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it was his want of wit, learning, honeÅ¿ty, and courage.</p>

               <p>And this I conceive, was the cauÅ¿e that moved my brother <hi>Burton</hi> in the ninth page of his booke in the beginning of his anÅ¿wer, to Å¿ay, <hi>`as for your indefinite enumeration of thoÅ¿e multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes baptized by</hi> Iohn <hi>the</hi> BaptiÅ¿t <hi>and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples, we take no notice of them.</hi> This is his expreÅ¿Å¿ion there, concerning the which in due place. Surely if my brother <hi>Burton</hi> had thought them ChriÅ¿tians, he would have demeed them worthy to have been taken notice of: but in this he agreeth with <hi>I. S.</hi> and the PapiÅ¿ts.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t is becauÅ¿e <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> they were baptiÅ¿ed into ChriÅ¿t that was to dye, and not dead; therefore in his dialect they were no ChriÅ¿tians.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd, they were not baptized with the holy GhoÅ¿t and with fire; therefore thy were no ChrÅ¿tians.</p>
               <p>The third, they were no more ChriÅ¿tians then the Iewes that paÅ¿Å¿ed through the red Sea; but they were no ChriÅ¿tians; <hi>ergo</hi> they alÅ¿o that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were no ChriÅ¿tians.</p>
               <p>The fourth, The baptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> was not perfect, <hi>ergo</hi> thoÅ¿e that were baptiÅ¿ed by him were no ChriÅ¿tians.</p>
               <p>The fifth, thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> did not only haÅ¿itate, but were Å¿candalized at the true <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿iah,</hi> and under the forme of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiÅ¿me did fight againÅ¿t the true baptiÅ¿me and baptiÅ¿er the Lord JeÅ¿us: <hi>ergo</hi> they were no ChriÅ¿tians.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were not caÅ¿t into a Church mould, according to the New<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>teÅ¿tament forme, neither were they members of one ChriÅ¿tian Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> ergo they were not ChriÅ¿tians; and this Argument is brought in by way of a corallary.</p>
               <p>This muÅ¿t needs be the Å¿cope of his anÅ¿wer, or elÅ¿e he Å¿ayth nothing to the purpoÅ¿e in denying my Arguments, which were not only to prove, <hi>that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by</hi> Iohn BaptiÅ¿t <hi>were ChriÅ¿tians and beleevers, but alÅ¿o that they were in Å¿uch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes as they could not all poÅ¿Å¿ibly meete in any one place, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to communicate in all the Ordinances and all Acts of worÅ¿hip to edification.</hi> The dint and force of the which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

he thinkes he Å¿ufficiently evadeth, by denying that they were ChriÅ¿tians at all. So that if this AnÅ¿wer be well looked into and examined, it will appeare that whiles he boaÅ¿teth and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he hath beate up my quarters, he beates up Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> quarters, yea ChriÅ¿ts quarters, and all his DiÅ¿ciples quarters before ChriÅ¿ts death and AÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, and all the quarters of all ChriÅ¿tians that now live in the world: For if none are well BaptiÅ¿ed and made ChriÅ¿tians indeede, but Å¿uch as are BaptiÅ¿ed with the Holy GhoÅ¿t and with fire, then all thoÅ¿e that were baptiÅ¿ed before ChriÅ¿ts AÅ¿cenÅ¿ion were no true ChriÅ¿tians, nor no ChriÅ¿tians in theÅ¿e our times, nor many Generations before us, who were not baptiÅ¿ed by the Holy GhoÅ¿t and with fire; and by theÅ¿e his fond cavills he overthroweth the Scripture it Å¿elf and all Divine and humane Authority, and gives the Spirit of God the lye.</p>
               <p>And truly Å¿uch a peece of impious ignorance with Å¿uch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent confidence my eyes yet never beheld before <hi>I. S.</hi> and his complices came into the World. So that it Å¿tranges me e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly that Å¿uch men as he and they are, Å¿hould be Å¿uffered by thoÅ¿e of the Congregationall way to go unpuniÅ¿hed, who may Å¿hame them all, as indeed they are a Å¿hame to all ChriÅ¿tian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For I appeale to the judgement of all Å¿uch as have any knowledge in Religion or love to the truth, or have any modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or good temper yet left in them, whether this be a thing tolerable in any that has the name of a ChriÅ¿tian, to play not only the juglers, to deceive and delude the poore people, but to give the Spirit of God the lye, and then to vapour and brag of it as of a conqueÅ¿t?</p>
               <p>But now I will Å¿et downe his Arguments in his owne words, and give my anÅ¿wer to them Å¿everally. <hi>We</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>anÅ¿wer to your reaÅ¿ons.</hi> So that he writes in the name of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as one of the Commanders and Captaines in their Militia, and as one of their Champions, and therefore in the name of them all, Å¿ayeth, <hi>We anÅ¿wer to your reaÅ¿ons.</hi> Now take notice what he anÅ¿wers in the name of the whole Fraternity.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48122:110"/>
purpoÅ¿e he uttered theÅ¿e words: for they are a manifeÅ¿t fighting againÅ¿t the Scripture of truth; as all the judicious and learned will wel perceive. And I have heard both learned &amp; pious men Å¿ay, <hi>that they did not beleeve, that I. S. did well underÅ¿tand himÅ¿elfe when he writ this book:</hi> and there is Å¿ome reaÅ¿on of this their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for hee confeÅ¿Å¿eth in his wiÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tle, that hee was in a courÅ¿e of PhyÅ¿ick at the wels; &amp; who knowes but the man might then be Å¿omewhat diÅ¿temperd in his braine, and Å¿o might doe the actions of a man craÅ¿ed? and his very language doth in a manner Å¿peake as much, both in this his AnÅ¿wer, and in many other paÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Book, as in their due places will appeare, yea the very title alÅ¿o, and his EpiÅ¿tle being Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e, calling his Pamphlet <hi>Flagellum flagelli, and the beating up of Doctor BaÅ¿twicks quarters,</hi> when he never came nigh them, and the taking hold and Å¿haking of the Pillars of his diÅ¿courÅ¿e, when hee never Å¿o much as touched them, with many Å¿uch other expreÅ¿Å¿ions, all which have no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿pondency amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, and Å¿hewes that the man is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a very Å¿tranger in Rhetorick, not knowing how to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe to his Metaphor, or elÅ¿e that hee is craÅ¿ed indeed; and truly Å¿o every one will conceive, if they duly weigh and conÅ¿ider all paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ages in his booke; eÅ¿pecially this anÅ¿wer of his to my Arguments: by which hee labours to prove that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t were no ChriÅ¿tians, no Beleevers; which he doth by very Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e reaÅ¿ons: the firÅ¿t of which I have related, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they were baptized into ChriÅ¿t to dye and not dead,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his opinion they were no ChriÅ¿tians. I omit his latine expreÅ¿Å¿ion, as thinking it a vaine thing in him to inÅ¿ert latine Å¿entences writing in the vulgar tongue, eÅ¿pecially in handling points of divinity, &amp; thoÅ¿e of great concernment, which the people Å¿hould have Å¿et before them in perÅ¿picuous and plaine termes.</p>
               <p>But now take notice how the man contradicteth himÅ¿elfe in his anÅ¿wer; for the drift of it is to prove, <hi>that thoÅ¿e that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Iohn the BaptiÅ¿t were no ChriÅ¿tians,</hi> and yet hee Å¿ayeth, they were baptized into ChriÅ¿t. Then they were ChriÅ¿tians by his owne confeÅ¿Å¿ion, <hi>for IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was yeÅ¿terday, and to day, and the Å¿ame for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. and He was ever the MeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iah, <hi>the Å¿eed of the woman that Å¿hould breake the Serpents head, that Rocke upon which the Church was built, againÅ¿t which the gates of Hell Å¿hould never prevaile, Mat.</hi> 16. So that they that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48122:111"/>
into IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, whether whiles hee was living or dead, whether before his Nativity, death or aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, or after, are all good ChriÅ¿tians; therefore he contradicteth himÅ¿elfe in Å¿aying they were not ChriÅ¿tians; for it is not the circumÅ¿tance of time that makes an alteration in the Å¿ubÅ¿tance and eÅ¿Å¿ence of any thing: for the PaÅ¿Å¿eover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was the Å¿ame for Å¿ubÅ¿tance that it was in the WilderneÅ¿Å¿e, and in the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> for otherwiÅ¿e it Å¿hould follow that the Supper of the Lord celebrated by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe before his paÅ¿Å¿ion, and in memoriall of his death, Å¿hould not be the Å¿ame with that it was after ChriÅ¿ts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection and AÅ¿cenÅ¿ion; and that the ApoÅ¿tles that received the Lords Supper, were not ChriÅ¿tians then as well as after his death, which I thinke <hi>I. S.</hi> will not dare affirme; but if he Å¿hould, I am confident all the well grounded ChriÅ¿tians in the world would be his adverÅ¿aries in this; for the ApoÅ¿tle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25. makes them all one for Å¿ubÅ¿tance; and as the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was the Å¿ame for eÅ¿Å¿ence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ChriÅ¿ts death that it was after, Å¿o was the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, to all that were baptized; and hee was as good a ChriÅ¿tian that was baptized in to ChriÅ¿t before his death, as hee that was baptized into him after his AÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, as all good reaÅ¿on will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wade; for ChriÅ¿t was ever the MeÅ¿Å¿iah and King of his Church; which will yet more evidently appeare, if wee compare earthly things with heavenly.</p>
               <p>I demand therefore of <hi>I. S.</hi> or any of the congregationall way, whether all Å¿uch Å¿ubjects as take the oath of allegiance, or Å¿weare fealty to any King, who is owned by the people and whole Kingdome to be their lawfull King, as appointed and Å¿et over them of God, and is openly proclamed through the whoÅ¿e Realm to be their King, though at that time hee be in an other Countrey, and but now comming to take the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of his Kingdome, I Å¿ay I demand whether Å¿uch Å¿ubjects as take the oath of allegeance and Å¿ware fealty unto him, before he comes and Å¿its viÅ¿ibly upon his Throne, be not by this their oath become that Kings Å¿ubjects, as truly and as really, as if the King were bodily preÅ¿ent? I demand further, when hee is in perÅ¿on come into his Kingdome, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ibly amongÅ¿t them, Å¿aluted and entertained and owned by the people for their King, whether or no thoÅ¿e Å¿ubjects that then take their oath of allegeance, and promiÅ¿e by that their oath their Å¿ubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48122:111"/>
unto him, bee not as really and truly his Å¿ubjects, as thoÅ¿e that after hee is inaugurated and gone into one of his other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, take then the oath of allegeance, and Å¿ware Å¿ubjection unto him in all his juÅ¿t commands? I am confident that all men that are but a little skilled in politicks, or any good learning, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that either of the former Å¿ubjects, are as truly and really Å¿ubjects unto him though they never Å¿aw him (as many hundred thouÅ¿ands never did their Kings) as thoÅ¿e that tooke the oath when hee was gone in triumph into an other of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. And thus it was with thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, that great Officer of ChriÅ¿ts kingdome, and the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tle, thoÅ¿e Stewards, Secretaries, privie CounÅ¿ellors, &amp; EmbaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿adours of his Royaltie, who all baptized thoÅ¿e that came unto them into IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the King and MeÅ¿Å¿iah, as well before his death as after, and all they owned him as well then for their King as after, crying HoÅ¿anna thou Å¿onne of <hi>David,</hi> and Å¿trowing their garments in the way, Å¿aying, <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in Heaven, and glory in the HigheÅ¿t, Luke</hi> 19. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 4. and therefore it is a Å¿enÅ¿leÅ¿Å¿e reaÅ¿on, yea contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory unto it Å¿elfe that <hi>I. S.</hi> bringeth, conÅ¿idering there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the matter, though there be Å¿ome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in reÅ¿pect of the circumÅ¿tance of time; and in this fond error of <hi>I. S.</hi> is my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and the PapiÅ¿ts, who thinke there was a great difference between the BaptiÅ¿me before ChriÅ¿ts death and that after his death, when indeed for Å¿ubÅ¿tance there was none, no more then was betweene the Sacrament of the Lords Supper before ChriÅ¿ts death and after. And therefore all thoÅ¿e that received either of thoÅ¿e Sacraments or both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his paÅ¿Å¿ion, were as good ChriÅ¿tians as thoÅ¿e that received them after; for hee was owned by them at that time to be the Lambe of God that was to take away the Å¿ins of the world of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and to be the King of the Iews, the Saviour of his people, to be the anoynted ChriÅ¿t, &amp; they took the Sacraments upon it, which is as much as the oath of allegeance to any King, which were Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make them as good ChriÅ¿tians as any that Å¿hould come after them, and therefore they that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿t into ChriÅ¿t to dye, which <hi>I. S.</hi> doth acknowledge, they were all as good ChriÅ¿tians as any now baptized by the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and therefore that hee faith to the contrary and in oppoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48122:112"/>
to this truth is a meer babble and a contradiction of himÅ¿elfe. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿poke to his firÅ¿t anÅ¿wer to prove that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t were as good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians as any other that were baptized after ChriÅ¿ts death.</p>
               <p>His Å¿econd is as Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e, which is this. <hi>To Å¿ay</hi> (Å¿aith he) that the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn was the Å¿ame with ChriÅ¿ts and the ApoÅ¿tles, is flat contrary to the aÅ¿Å¿ertion of</hi> Iohn <hi>himÅ¿elfe and the ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> Mat. 21. 25. Act. 18. 25. <hi>I baptize you with water</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>but there comes one after me, who Å¿hall baptize with the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and with fire.</hi> TheÅ¿e are the words of his Å¿econd argument to prove that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t were no ChriÅ¿tians. In the entrance of this his anÅ¿wer he beats the ayre, and fights with his owne Å¿hadow and falÅ¿ifies my words; for I never Å¿aid nor thought it, that the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> was the Å¿ame with ChriÅ¿ts; for the Scripture relateth <hi>that ChriÅ¿t baptized not at all, Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 2. I Å¿aid indeed, it was the Å¿ame with the ApoÅ¿tles, and that is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t out of many places of the holy Scriptures, as out of the 3. of <hi>Luke, ver.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> the 1. <hi>v.</hi> 33. where <hi>Iohn</hi> himÅ¿elf Å¿peaking Å¿aith, <hi>hee that Å¿ent mee to baptize with water, the Å¿ame Å¿aid unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Yea one of thoÅ¿e places quoted by himÅ¿elfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 25. Å¿ufficiently declares that <hi>Iohn</hi> had his CommiÅ¿Å¿ion from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, (whoÅ¿e Prophet he was) to baptize with water, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles themÅ¿elves before ChriÅ¿ts death and AÅ¿cention baptized but with water, and had no other CommiÅ¿Å¿ion but that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t had, and <hi>Iohn baptized with the BaptiÅ¿me of Repentance, Å¿aying unto the people, that they Å¿hould beleeve on him which Å¿hould come after him that is on ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, Act.</hi> 19. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 4. and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ApoÅ¿tles BaptiÅ¿me before ChriÅ¿ts death vvas no other but the BaptiÅ¿me of repentance and to beleeve in <hi>ChriÅ¿t;</hi> yea faith and repentance was the Å¿umme of all the Preaching, both of <hi>Iohn</hi> and of all the holy ApoÅ¿tles, both before ChriÅ¿ts death and after, as wee may Å¿ee, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 21. where the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, <hi>TeÅ¿tifying both to the Iewes, and alÅ¿o to the Greeks, repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and faith towards our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> Now when the BaptiÅ¿me of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and the ApoÅ¿tles, both before ChriÅ¿ts death and after was all one for Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and all into ChriÅ¿t, as wee may yet further Å¿ee, <hi>Acts the</hi> 8. 16. where it is Å¿aid <hi>they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the name of the Lord IeÅ¿us.</hi> It was no error in mee to Å¿ay that the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> was into ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us, and the very Å¿ame with that of the ApoÅ¿tles, for the Holy GhoÅ¿t which is the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48122:112"/>
Å¿pirit of truth hath Å¿o taught mee: and therefore all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t were as good ChriÅ¿tians and beleevers as thoÅ¿e that were baptized by the ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God and faith towards our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and being baptized into him could make good ChriÅ¿tians; which were blaÅ¿phemy to gain-Å¿ay, and nothing elÅ¿e but to give the Å¿pirit of God the lye: and therefore <hi>J. S.</hi> affirming that there was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> and that of the ApoÅ¿tles, and denying that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were ChriÅ¿tians, gives the Å¿pirit of God the lye: for the holy word of God which was penned by his Å¿pirit aÅ¿Å¿erteth the contrary: And for that text that he citeth out of the third of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>I baptize you with water, but there comes one after me who Å¿hall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with the Holy GhoÅ¿t and with fire;</hi> this is nothing to his purpoÅ¿e nor nothing againÅ¿t my opinion: For, as I Å¿aid before, it was never my beliefe that the baptiÅ¿me of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>Iohns</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me was all one, Å¿eeing Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> hath taught the contrary, as in the words alledged it is Å¿ufficiently declared: But I demand of <hi>I. S.</hi> whether the ApoÅ¿tles, all whoÅ¿e names were written in heaven, were not as good ChriÅ¿tians and Beleevers in JeÅ¿us <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> by <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiÅ¿me, before they had received the gifts of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and were baptized with fire (which we read of <hi>Act.</hi> the 2.) as they were after the cloven tongues appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? <hi>ver.</hi> 3. If either he or any of his fraternity Å¿hall deny it, then they muÅ¿t deny the Å¿ixteenth chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the Å¿ixt of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> where we finde that honourable confeÅ¿Å¿ion of all the ApoÅ¿tles where they teÅ¿tifie their faith in ChriÅ¿t into whom they had been baptized before that, yea they muÅ¿t deny the whole Scriptures of the New TeÅ¿tament which affirme the contrary: And if the baptizing of any with the Holy GhoÅ¿t and with fire be that thing onely that makes men ChriÅ¿tians and Beleevers, then none that were not Å¿o baptized were good chriÅ¿tians: for the gifts of the Holy GhoÅ¿t as the diverÅ¿ity of tongues and working of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, were not promiÅ¿cuous and given to all as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth Å¿ufficiently declare, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 30. <hi>Have all the gifts of healing?

And therefore thoÅ¿e gifts made them not ChriÅ¿tians but declared them to be beleevers, and were the effects of their faith, which notwithÅ¿tanding were not conferred by the ApoÅ¿tles, but were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately given by the Å¿pirit of ChriÅ¿t: So that thoÅ¿e viÅ¿ible gifts were not eÅ¿Å¿entiall for the making of any ChriÅ¿tians and Beleevers; for they were alwayes Beleevers before they received them; and if thoÅ¿e gifts had been eÅ¿Å¿entiall and abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the making of any ChriÅ¿tians, then all that had received them Å¿hould have been Å¿aved, which they were not; beÅ¿ides then, many hundred thouÅ¿ands of the primitive ChriÅ¿tians Å¿hould not have been true Beleevers and ChriÅ¿tians indeed; for all men generally received them not (as I proved before) and all the ChriÅ¿tians, for ought I know, Å¿ince the Primitive times, and all that now live Å¿hould be no good ChriÅ¿tians: for they were not and now are not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the holy GhoÅ¿t &amp; with fire.

So that howÅ¿oever they had not the name of chriÅ¿tians and were not Å¿o called which makes nothing againÅ¿t the reality of the thing, for we contend not about words, yet they were all true chriÅ¿tians, they being all built upon that Corner Å¿tone and upon the foundation JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing for the eÅ¿Å¿ence and Å¿ubÅ¿tance or object of their faith from any that did Å¿ucceed them in all ages to come.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> affirming that by the baptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> the beleevers then were not made ChriÅ¿tians, and that the <hi>IÅ¿raelits</hi> BaptiÅ¿ed by <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> in the cloude were no ChriÅ¿tians, overthrowes the holy Scriptures and gives ChriÅ¿t the lye, and confutes <hi>Paul</hi> himÅ¿elf who in the 10. of the 1 of the <hi>Cor. ver.</hi> 1. 2. 3. <hi>affirmes, that our fathers were under the cloude, and all paÅ¿Å¿ed through the Sea and were all baptiÅ¿ed by</hi> MoÅ¿es <hi>in the cloude and in the Sea, and all eate the Å¿ame Å¿pirituall meate, and did all drink the Å¿ame Å¿pirituall drinke (for they all drank of the Å¿ame Å¿piritual Rock that followed them and that Rock was ChriÅ¿t)</hi> by the which teÅ¿timony of the ApoÅ¿tle they were as good ChriÅ¿tians: as the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> for he comparing them together, Å¿heweth that they were equall to them in priviledges, and were as good ChriÅ¿tians as they, according to that of <hi>Peter Acts</hi> the 15. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 9. and put <hi>no difference</hi> between <hi>us and them purifying their hearts by faith;</hi> &amp; as he had proved that the <hi>IÅ¿raelits</hi> were equall in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48122:114"/>
Priviledges with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and all other ChriÅ¿tians, Å¿o he declareth likewiÅ¿e if the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and all other ChriÅ¿tians did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againÅ¿t God as the <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> did, they Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e be equall to them in puniÅ¿hments: <hi>For God was no respector of perÅ¿ons,</hi> but as inevery <hi>nation he that feareth God &amp; worketh righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, Acts</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 35: Å¿o whatÅ¿oever ChriÅ¿tians, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Å¿o ever, whether <hi>Iewer</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> Å¿hall offend as the <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> did, they Å¿hall be equally puniÅ¿hed. So that by the witneÅ¿Å¿e and teÅ¿timony of <hi>Paul</hi> in this tenth chapter of the 1 of the <hi>Cor.</hi> and the 11. of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and from the above cited Scriptures all our fathers under the cloude and all the Patriarkes, and all thoÅ¿e Martyrs, and all thoÅ¿e that were baptiÅ¿ed by the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> and ChriÅ¿t DiÅ¿ciples, were all as good ChriÅ¿tians as any Baptized after ChriÅ¿ts death or now by thoÅ¿e of the Congregationall way or any ChriÅ¿tians in the world; and all that I here Å¿ay is moÅ¿t true if any beliefe may be given to the holy Word of God. And therefore <hi>I. S.</hi> affirming the contrary blaÅ¿phemeth. And now I come to his fourth Argument. Which is this.</p>
               <p>The learned and judicious know <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> was but the MeÅ¿Å¿enger before ChriÅ¿t <hi>Mal. 3. ver. 1.</hi> And his baptiÅ¿me was but as the Å¿treaming of light in the Heavens before the day, and he did only bring and reÅ¿tore all things to their legall perfection by water, the element of the law; but ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us he comes and Baptizes with fire, conÅ¿ummats all things with this transforming powerfull element, even his Å¿pirit, <hi>Thus</hi> I. S. <hi>Å¿peaketh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To examine all the errors in theÅ¿e words, would take up much time, and require a large diÅ¿courÅ¿e, but I Å¿tudy brevity. As for the firÅ¿t part of this his anÅ¿wer, where he Å¿aith, <hi>the learned and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious know, that</hi> Iohn <hi>was but the MeÅ¿Å¿enger before ChriÅ¿t, &amp;c.</hi> it is a peece of vanity in him to produce the teÅ¿timony of men to prove that <hi>Iohn</hi> was a MeÅ¿Å¿enger of ChriÅ¿t, when the holy Scripture in many places aÅ¿Å¿ertsit, and when ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf hath declared that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> was that <hi>Elias</hi> that was foretold Å¿hould prepare the way before the Lord and make his pathes Å¿traight: but this I may truly Å¿ay of <hi>I. S.</hi> that he is a meere Å¿tranger in all good learning and as ignorant in all Divinity and in the holy Word of God, as thoÅ¿e judicious he Å¿peakes of, were Å¿ingularly excellent and mighty in the Scriptures and all Å¿ound theologie, whoÅ¿e works and godly Å¿olid writings, if ever he had read with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48122:115"/>
he could never have bin Å¿o prodigiouÅ¿ly blaÅ¿phemous as he is in all his diÅ¿courÅ¿e and chiefly in theÅ¿e his anÅ¿wers: for there is not any one of them in which there is not great impiety to be diÅ¿covered: as in this to accuÅ¿e <hi>Iohns BaptiÅ¿me</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿try of imperfection, and to Å¿ay they were but as the Å¿trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingsoflight in the Heavens before the day, when notwithÅ¿tanding ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf hath often given Å¿o many honourable teÅ¿timonies of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his MiniÅ¿try, Å¿aying in the 5. of <hi>Iohn</hi> 32. <hi>that he bare witneÅ¿Å¿e of him, and that his witneÅ¿Å¿e was true, and</hi> in the 35. ver. in expreÅ¿Å¿e words affirming <hi>that he was a burning and Å¿hining light,</hi> and that the <hi>Iews</hi> for a Å¿eaÅ¿on did rejoyce in his light. And yet <hi>I. S.</hi> boldly and peremptorily affirmeth that the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> was but as the Å¿treamings of light, and that they were not conÅ¿ummate ChriÅ¿tians that were baptiÅ¿ed by him. Who Å¿hall we beleeve? <hi>I. S.</hi> or IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t? ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith Iohn <hi>was a burning and Å¿hining light. I. S.</hi> Å¿ayeth he was but as the Å¿treaming of light; if this be not to give ChriÅ¿t the lye, I know not what it is! ChriÅ¿t in the Å¿eventh chapter of <hi>Luke</hi> and the 28. <hi>verÅ¿e,</hi> Å¿ayth, That <hi>Iohn the BaptiÅ¿t was the greateÅ¿t Prophet that was ever borne of women.</hi> Then, he was inferior in his MiniÅ¿try to none of them, no not to <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> himÅ¿elf, of whom the author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> chap. 3. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 5. Å¿aith with <hi>a verily,</hi> that <hi>he was faithfull in all the houÅ¿e of God as a Å¿ervant for a teÅ¿timony of thoÅ¿e things that were to be Å¿poken after.</hi> Now if <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> did his worke perfectly, as he did, and baptized thoÅ¿e perfectly in the Cloude and in the Å¿ea as <hi>Paul</hi> aÅ¿Å¿erteth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and did all he did in perfection and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the paterne Å¿hewed him in the Mount and according to the will of God, and did perfectly conÅ¿ummate his MiniÅ¿try, then <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> alÅ¿o did the like, <hi>for ChriÅ¿t</hi> Å¿aith that amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that <hi>are borne of women, there is not a greater Prophet then</hi> Iohn <hi>the</hi> BaptiÅ¿t: <hi>that is there</hi> was not one more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and that did his worke more compleatly and with more perfection: which ChriÅ¿ts owne words in the third of <hi>Matthew</hi> do yet more fully declare verÅ¿. 15. <hi>Å¿aying Å¿uffer it</hi> to be Å¿o now: <hi>for thus it becommeth us to fulfill all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> Now if the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> did fulfill all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in his MiniÅ¿try, then he did it compleatly and made thoÅ¿e that were baptized by him perfect, compleat and conÅ¿ummated ChriÅ¿tians; for he in his Office, <hi>fulfilled all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e;</hi> if therefore there were any imperfection
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48122:115"/>
(as <hi>I. S.</hi> Å¿aith) in the BaptiÅ¿me and MiniÅ¿try of <hi>Iohn,</hi> then he did not fulfill all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and then ChriÅ¿ts words Å¿hould not be true, which is a high point of blaÅ¿phemy to thinke, much more to Å¿ay and print as <hi>I.

S.</hi> my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, whether ChriÅ¿t was well baptized, or no by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t?</hi> I preÅ¿um they will not deny but that he was perfectly baptized. And if ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe was well baptized, then all that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> were alÅ¿o well baptized and were perfect and compleat ChriÅ¿tians, for <hi>John</hi> was Å¿ent of God to baptize; and he obeyed Gods command in this his MiniÅ¿try, and in that alÅ¿o fulfilled all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and therefore all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; by the ApoÅ¿tles before ChriÅ¿ts death and aÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, were as perfect ChriÅ¿tians as any that were baptized after ChriÅ¿ts reÅ¿urrection; and if they were not well baptized then ChriÅ¿t was not well baptized, which were high impiety to affirme; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I ever be induced to beleeve, that <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t</hi> did not know as well how to make compleat ChriÅ¿tians, as <hi>I. S.</hi> or as any of the Independent MiniÅ¿ters; for I know <hi>Iohn</hi> was Å¿ent of God for this worke, and that he fulfilled all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in it, and I know alÅ¿o that he was faithfull in his MiniÅ¿try to the death, and feared not the face of <hi>Herod</hi> nor of any Mortall creature: for all this the Scripture aÅ¿certanieth unto me; but that our Independent MiniÅ¿ters were ever Å¿ent of God, and bid to Å¿et up their new lights and to preach, up their congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall way or a toleration of all Religions, I doubt it. For firÅ¿t I know that they ranne back-ward, and forward, to and fro, before they were ever Å¿ent, and that they preach that they were never commanded from God, and that when they Å¿hould have preached andÅ¿tood to witnes the truth, many of them ran away and deÅ¿erted it and did not Å¿tand to it as <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t</hi> did, but like thoÅ¿e hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ChriÅ¿t Å¿peaks of, <hi>Iohn</hi> the tenth, when they Å¿aw the Wolfe comming, cowardly ranne away, and left their poore flocks to the fury of thoÅ¿e beaÅ¿ts and many of them now have left their flocks in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e and have deÅ¿erted their charges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the command of God <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 28. who Å¿aith by the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Take heede therefore unto your Å¿elves, and to all the</hi>

                  <hi>flocke, over which the holy GhoÅ¿t hath made you BiÅ¿hops, to feeds the Church of God, which he hath purchaÅ¿ed with his own bloud.</hi> In all theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, and many more that I could name, I greatly doubt whether the Independent MiniÅ¿ters were ever Å¿ent of God: but for <hi>Iohn,</hi> I know he was, and I know in like manner that he fulfilled all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in his MiniÅ¿tery, and made thoÅ¿e he Baptized perfect ChriÅ¿tian; I know likewiÅ¿e that he made innumerable multitudes of them, and that JeruÅ¿alem came out and was Baptized alÅ¿o, which when <hi>I. S.</hi> denyeth I aÅ¿Å¿ert he is a wicked and blaÅ¿phemous fellow, and that if he had his due deÅ¿erts, he ought to be Å¿pued not only out of their Å¿even new churches here in <hi>London,</hi> but out of all their Å¿everall new fangled congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations through the Kingdome as an Alien and Å¿tranger from the common-wealth of all learning and goodneÅ¿Å¿e. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿poke to the fourth learned anÅ¿wer. I now come to the fifth as good as the reÅ¿t; his words are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So farre was it</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that all that were Baptized by</hi> Iohn, <hi>were made ChriÅ¿tians, that even</hi> Iohns <hi>owne DiÅ¿ciples (who had the beÅ¿t and frequenteÅ¿t inÅ¿truction) not onely heÅ¿itated, but were right downe Å¿candalized at the true MeÅ¿Å¿ias</hi> Iohn 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>and others did under the forme of</hi> Iohns <hi>baptiÅ¿me, fight againÅ¿t the true baptiÅ¿me and baptizer the Lord IeÅ¿us. So that I conceive</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>this Argument (were it granted that all the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> Iohns <hi>baptiÅ¿me) will Å¿tand in little Å¿teade to prove the concluÅ¿ion,</hi> viz: <hi>that they were made ChriÅ¿tians, much leÅ¿Å¿e cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church mould, according to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and leaÅ¿t of all that they were all members of one ChriÅ¿tian Church at IeruÅ¿alem.</hi> TheÅ¿e are his formall expreÅ¿Å¿ions, by which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to prove, that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> were no ChriÅ¿tians; in theÅ¿e his words there is a double Argument by which he indeavours to unchriÅ¿tian all thoÅ¿e that were BaptiÅ¿ed by the BaptiÅ¿t. The firÅ¿t is, becauÅ¿e as he falÅ¿ly Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿eth they were enimies of ChriÅ¿t. The Å¿econd is in that they were not rightly moulded. So that in this his laÅ¿t Paragraffe or Section, we have two Arguments together. Which being added to the former make up Å¿ix in all, by which the profound diÅ¿putant <hi>J. S.</hi> unchurches and unchriÅ¿ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ns all thoÅ¿e that were baptiÅ¿ed by <hi>John.</hi> Now becauÅ¿e <hi>I. S.</hi> and his complices do place Å¿o much Å¿trength in theÅ¿e two laÅ¿t Arguments, I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire the reader the more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48122:116"/>
Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to weigh and conÅ¿ider them with the concluÅ¿ions deduced from them by <hi>I. S.</hi> and my reply to them.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t whereas hee denieth that all that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were made ChriÅ¿tians, as it is a begging of the queÅ¿tion, Å¿o in his thus Å¿peaking hee overthrows the whole MiniÅ¿try of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿t, and contradicts the Holy Scriptures, and all thoÅ¿e places I quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of them in my former reply; and which is more, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth himÅ¿elfe: for hee confeÅ¿Å¿eth that <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptized in to ChriÅ¿t, and he baptized none, as all the Independents acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but beleevers; therefore they were ChriÅ¿tians by his owne confeÅ¿Å¿ion; and yet here as often formerly he denieth they were ChriÅ¿tians. But becauÅ¿e I have Å¿poke of this before, I will now come to his reaÅ¿ons. His firÅ¿t reaÅ¿on, to prove they were not ChriÅ¿tians, is, becauÅ¿e (Å¿aith he) <hi>Iohns owne DiÅ¿ciples</hi> (who had <hi>the beÅ¿t and frequenteÅ¿t inÅ¿truction) not only heÅ¿itated,</hi> that is doubted, <hi>but were right downe Å¿candalized at the MeÅ¿Å¿iah.</hi> The Å¿econd is becauÅ¿e <hi>others did under the forme of</hi> Iohns <hi>BaptiÅ¿me, fight againÅ¿t the true baptiÅ¿me and the Baptizer the Lord IeÅ¿us.</hi> TheÅ¿e his reaÅ¿ons, I affirme, are nothing elÅ¿e but a meer calumny, and a falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ation, and to Å¿peake the truth, are but his owne wicked and groundleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿urmiÅ¿es; and if every man, from his owne fictious and fond conceits, and Å¿uppoÅ¿ed premiÅ¿es, may take the liberty thus to vent himÅ¿elfe, I know no truth in the whole word of God, but may be called in queÅ¿tion, yea overthrown and I know no ChriÅ¿tians nor Saints but may at any time be unÅ¿ainted and unchriÅ¿tianed. Our Saviour ChriÅ¿t in the 7. of <hi>Luke, verÅ¿.</hi> 32, 33, 34. compareth thoÅ¿e of his time, <hi>unto little children Å¿itting in the market place, and calling one to another, and Å¿aying; wee have piped unto you, and you have not danced; wee have mourned unto you, and ye have not wept; for</hi> Iohn <hi>the BaptiÅ¿t came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye Å¿ay he hath a Devill. The Sonne of man is come eating and drinking, and ye Å¿ay, behold a glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous man, and a wine Bibber, afriend of Publicans and Sinners. But wiÅ¿edome is juÅ¿tified of all her children.</hi> By which words of our Saviour wee Å¿ee nothing could pleaÅ¿e the Gentlemen of his time.</p>
               <p>Now if ever there were an age in the world, or company of men in it, that might be compared to theÅ¿e little children, then this of ours, and the people in it, eÅ¿pecially the Independents may
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48122:117"/>
be, who are pleaÅ¿ed with nothing, and can leaÅ¿t of all indure any Vniformity in the Church, againÅ¿t which they profeÅ¿Å¿edly both write and preach, and as thoÅ¿e in our Saviours dayes did Å¿peake againÅ¿t the MiniÅ¿try of <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, and againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf; Å¿o at this very day amongÅ¿t us, there are many that make nothing of the MiniÅ¿try of <hi>Iohn,</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿ing they take no notice of thoÅ¿e that were baptized by him or ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples, and <hi>I. S.</hi> peremptorily affirmeth, that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by him were no ChriÅ¿tians, and that his MiniÅ¿try was imperfect; and therefore I conceive all men will judge, that the Independents may well be compared to thoÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿ts time, who unchurch all but themÅ¿elves. But Å¿aith <hi>I. S.</hi> they were <hi>Iohns</hi> owne DiÅ¿ciples that both doubted and heÅ¿itated, and were right downe Å¿candalized at the true MeÅ¿Å¿ias, and for proofe of this his Å¿aying hee produceth the 3. of <hi>Iohn, verÅ¿.</hi> 26. I will therefore Å¿et downe the words of the text with the forgoing verÅ¿e, which will give Å¿ome light to the buÅ¿ines in hand, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 25. <hi>Then there aroÅ¿e</hi> (Å¿aith the EvangeliÅ¿t) <hi>a queÅ¿tion betweene Å¿ome of</hi> Iohns <hi>diÅ¿ciples and the Iewes about purifying, and they came unto</hi> Iohn <hi>and Å¿aid unto him,</hi> Rabbi, <hi>hee that was with thee beyond Iordan, to whom thou bareÅ¿t witneÅ¿Å¿e, behold the Å¿ame baptizeth and all men come to him.</hi> TheÅ¿e are the words out of which <hi>I. S.</hi> grounds all his accuÅ¿ation againÅ¿t <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples, by which hee would prove them no ChriÅ¿tians. But if men would but duly weigh and examine the text, they will eaÅ¿ily perceive, there is not Å¿o much as a very Å¿imilitude of the illation and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <hi>I. S.</hi> inferres from thence. For firÅ¿t the queÅ¿tion there Å¿tarted, was not betweene <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples and ChriÅ¿ts, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the DiÅ¿ciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Jewes, that is betweene the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees and <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples, who were enemies of <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t as well as of ChriÅ¿t, and therefore queÅ¿tioned all they did, ever and anon asking <hi>Iohn</hi> and ChriÅ¿t by what authority they preached and did thoÅ¿e things they did. And Å¿o here the Jewes, they queÅ¿tioned with <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples concerning his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿try, (as by all conjecture it may be gathered) &amp; about legall puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, of which they were very Å¿tudious and great obÅ¿ervers, to which the PhariÅ¿ees had added many of their ovvne, as wee may Å¿ee, <hi>Matth,</hi> the 15. and <hi>Marke</hi> the 7. and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples about purifying, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing, that there was no need of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiÅ¿me and waÅ¿hing, Å¿eeing they had Å¿o
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48122:117"/>
much rinÅ¿ing and purifying already amongÅ¿t them. So that it Å¿eemes the contention betweene the Jewes and <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples aroÅ¿e upon this, that <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples much magnified the BaptiÅ¿me of their MaÅ¿ter, and the Jewes and PhariÅ¿ees, they extolled as much their Purifications, thinking them neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿alvation, which error of the Jewes, notwithÅ¿tanding, had often by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets beene confuted, as in <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 1. and many other places. Now <hi>Iohn,</hi> that hee might revoke all men from this error, that they Å¿hould not reÅ¿t in corporall vvaÅ¿hings and in outvvard perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, exhorts them to looke unto ChriÅ¿t, vvho vvas the truth of which all thoÅ¿e ceremonies were but the Å¿hadowes and were all fulfilled in him, and therefore that they Å¿hould by faith wholy rely upon him for Å¿alvation as the Å¿equell of the chapter doth Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Å¿hew. Now in the heate of this diÅ¿pute, the EvangeliÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth in the 26. <hi>verÅ¿e,</hi> that <hi>they came unto</hi> Iohn, <hi>and Å¿aid unto him, Rabbi, hee that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou beareÅ¿t witneÅ¿Å¿e, behold the Å¿ame baptizeth, and all men come to him.</hi> Out of which words I Å¿ee no reaÅ¿on why <hi>I. S.</hi> Å¿hould gather, that <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples not only heÅ¿itated, but were right downe Å¿candali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the true MeÅ¿Å¿ias, but I Å¿ee very good ground, why the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may be concluded; if they were <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples and that they dearely eÅ¿teemed ChriÅ¿t and much honoured him rather then that they vvere offended with him.</p>

            <div n="101-200" type="pages">
               <p>But firÅ¿t, it is not Å¿aid that <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples came unto him, onely it is related that Å¿ome came unto <hi>Iohn, they came unto him Å¿aith the Scripture:</hi> which they, it is not Å¿pecified; for <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples and the Jewes contended, and the Jewes are put in the laÅ¿t place, Å¿o that it may be gathered that they were the Jewes, rather then <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples that came unto him, as being laÅ¿t Å¿poken of &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: and if they were the Jewes, then they vvere the knovvn and profeÅ¿t enemies, both of <hi>Iohn</hi> and of <hi>ChriÅ¿t;</hi> and therefore were none of <hi>Iohns DiÅ¿oiples,</hi> as <hi>I.

For if any Å¿hould hear Å¿ome one of the Independent miniÅ¿ters greatly magnifie one of his brethren and fellow miniÅ¿ters, as to be a man Å¿ent from heaven, and Å¿hould Å¿ay of him, <hi>That he was the rareÅ¿t preacher one of them in the world,</hi> as they do mightily extoll one another: and upon the praiÅ¿es and commendations of this man many thouÅ¿ands of people Å¿hould by and by flock after him, whereÅ¿oever they Å¿hould hear he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: and Å¿ome one or more of his followers Å¿hould come unto this miniÅ¿ter that Å¿o prayÅ¿ed him and Å¿ay, <hi>Sir, Å¿uch a man who you Å¿o commended in Å¿uch a place, behold he now preacheth and all men come to him and follow his miniÅ¿try!</hi> would Å¿uch a relation I pray, as this made unto him that had formerly praiÅ¿ed that miniÅ¿ter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that thoÅ¿e that told him of Å¿uch concourÅ¿es of people as ran af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him not only heÅ¿itated but wer right down Å¿candalized at him? I am confident that upon mature deliberation no rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would make Å¿uch an inference. Neither can I Å¿ee any ground why either <hi>I.

For the Scripture relateth every where that there was fairer agreement, and much love and amity between <hi>Johns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples and <hi>ChriÅ¿ts,</hi> and that they knew one another very well and deÅ¿ired to imitate one another: Å¿o that they did not envy one anothers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters proÅ¿perity, nor doubted not of one anothers maÅ¿ters mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿try, nor were Å¿candalized one at anothers maÅ¿ters happineÅ¿Å¿e: And there is very good reaÅ¿on for it: For they all knew that <hi>John</hi> had Å¿o honourable an eÅ¿teem of <hi>ChriÅ¿t, as he thought himÅ¿elf not worthy to carry his Å¿hooes</hi> Mat. 3. 11. they knew alÅ¿o how highly <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> had often magnified <hi>Iohn, proclaiming him to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t prophet that ever was borne of women, and how that ChriÅ¿t had commanded</hi> John <hi>to baptize himÅ¿elfe,</hi> Å¿o much he honoured his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿try. They by their experience likewiÅ¿e knew that their was great correÅ¿pondency &amp; continued amity between their maÅ¿ters, and that they juÅ¿tified each others miniÅ¿try and that before all the people, <hi>John</hi> teaching the people, <hi>That he was the MeÅ¿Å¿iah and the Lambe of God, that was to take away the Å¿ins of the world;</hi> and <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> upon all occaÅ¿ions making mention of <hi>John</hi> with great prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es Å¿aying, <hi>That his miniÅ¿try was from heaven and that he was his meÅ¿Å¿enger to prepare his way before him.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Again, in the 1. of <hi>Iohn</hi> it is related there, <hi>that</hi> Iohn <hi>openly among all the people proclaimed ChriÅ¿t to be the Lambe of God, and Å¿ayeth that hee knew him Å¿o to be, by the diÅ¿cending of the Å¿pirit from Heaven upon him,</hi> becauÅ¿e, <hi>that God that Å¿ent him to baptize with water, Å¿aid unto him, upon whom thou Å¿halt Å¿ee the Spirit diÅ¿cending and remaining on him, the Å¿ame is hee which baptizeth with the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and I Å¿aw</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>and bare record that this is the Sonne of God.</hi> And all this was Å¿poke in the hearing of <hi>Johns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples, Å¿o that they could not doubt now of the MeÅ¿sias, or be Å¿candalized at him, for then they Å¿hould have beene very untaught Schollers, which the words following, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 33.

deÅ¿ired by all manner of wayes hee could, to publiÅ¿h the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the MeÅ¿Å¿ias, and knew that the more witneÅ¿Å¿es ChriÅ¿t had, and them of knowledge of reputation, the more their report and preaching of him would be credited, eÅ¿pecially when they themÅ¿elves could Å¿ay, that they had Å¿eene him working miracles, and that ChriÅ¿t bade them goe and <hi>tell</hi> Iohn <hi>what things they had Å¿eene and heard, how that the blind Å¿ee, and the lame walke, and the Lepers are clenÅ¿ed, the deafe heare, the dead are raiÅ¿ed, and the poor receive the GoÅ¿pel:</hi> and for this very end did <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿end two of his DiÅ¿ciples to ChriÅ¿t, not that either he or they doubted whether he was the MeÅ¿Å¿ias or no, but that they might be eye witneÅ¿Å¿es and relate theÅ¿e things with the more confidence both unto the people, and to thoÅ¿e that Å¿hould be pen men of the Holy Scriptures, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the 1 chapter <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye witneÅ¿Å¿es and MiniÅ¿ters of the Word:</hi> according to that of Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> the 1. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 21. <hi>Wherefore of theÅ¿e men which have companied with us, all the time that the Lord IeÅ¿us went in and out amongÅ¿t us, beginning from the baptiÅ¿me of</hi> Iohn <hi>unto the Å¿ame day hee was taken up from us, muÅ¿t one be ordained to be a witneÅ¿Å¿e with us of his reÅ¿urrection.</hi> So that it may well be gathered, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t had a Å¿peciall eye to the future, and deÅ¿ired not only in his owne perÅ¿on to preach up ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome, but that his DiÅ¿ciples after him might relate to their Auditors and to the holy pen-men what they had both heard with their owne eares, and Å¿eene with their own eyes, and Å¿o might the better witneÅ¿Å¿e unto ChriÅ¿t: neither will any man deny but that <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples, might alÅ¿o be much Å¿trengthned in their faith in beholding thoÅ¿e wonderful miracles of ChriÅ¿t, though they no way doubted or heÅ¿itated or were Å¿candalized at the MeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asbefore, no more then the people in <hi>Samaria</hi> doubted concerning him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. after the woman had Å¿aid to the men of that Citie, <hi>Come Å¿ee a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the ChriÅ¿t? then it is Å¿aid, they went out and came unto him, and many of them beleeved for the Å¿aying of the woman which teÅ¿tified hee told mee all that ever J did; but many more beleeved becauÅ¿e of his owne word, and Å¿aid unto the woman, now wee beleeve, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e of thy Å¿aying, but becauÅ¿e wee have heard him our Å¿elves, and know that this is indeed the ChriÅ¿t the Saviour of the world.</hi> The Scripture Å¿aith they beleeved before upon the womans relation,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48122:119"/>
but wee now coroborated in their faith, and Å¿o it was with <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples and followers. But Å¿hall there be any therefore from that bee Å¿o Å¿tupid as to thinke that any of <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples that had the beÅ¿t and frequenteÅ¿t inÅ¿truction concerning the MeÅ¿Å¿ias, could either doubt or be Å¿candalized at him, becauÅ¿e the people followed ChriÅ¿t, and <hi>John</hi> Å¿ent his DiÅ¿ciples to him? No Å¿urely, none would Å¿o conclude but <hi>I. S.</hi> and his Fraternity. Much leÅ¿Å¿e would they Å¿ay, that others did under the forme of <hi>Iohns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, fight againÅ¿t the true BaptiÅ¿me and Baptizer the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us; which is <hi>I. S.</hi> his Å¿econd reaÅ¿on, or rather folly and madneÅ¿Å¿e; and upon this their wicked conceit and groundleÅ¿Å¿e opinion inferre that they were no ChriÅ¿tians as <hi>I. S.</hi> doth. For there is not any one word in all the Holy Scripture, that does relate that any that were baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> did under the forme of that BaptiÅ¿me, fight againÅ¿t the true BaptiÅ¿me and Baptizer the Lord JeÅ¿us: what a wicked and abominable Fellow then is this <hi>I. S.</hi> that dares thus at pleaÅ¿ure traduce the generation of the juÅ¿t, and falÅ¿ely accuÅ¿e all <hi>Iohns</hi> owne DiÅ¿ciples, and all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by him to be enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the MeÅ¿Å¿ias? and upon this bare opinion of his to unchriÅ¿tian them all? it may now be no wonder to any good ChriÅ¿tian that the whole rout of the Independents unchurch us, and make no ChriÅ¿tians of us, and aÅ¿perÅ¿e and Å¿peak all manner of evill of us at pleaÅ¿ure, calling us the profeÅ¿t enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t &amp; his Kingdom Å¿eeing upon all occaÅ¿ions they doe the Å¿ame to all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples all which <hi>I. S.</hi> proclaims to be no ChriÅ¿tians, as his words doe Å¿ufficiently Å¿peak. But from the teÅ¿timony that he produceth to prove that <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples were Å¿candalized at ChriÅ¿t: I gather the contrary for the reaÅ¿ons above Å¿pecified, and conclude with al, that there were innumerable multitudes daily converted by ChriÅ¿ts and <hi>Iohns</hi> MiniÅ¿try, &amp; were all made good ChriÅ¿tians; for it is Å¿aid in the chapter quoted by him, that all men came to him, &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> and they were all baptized; Å¿o that not a few congregations could contain all them that came from <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> for all JeruÅ¿alem came out to <hi>John</hi> and our Saviour Å¿ent this meÅ¿Å¿age unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 7. of <hi>Luke</hi> as one of the miracles he wrought, <hi>that the poor received the GoÅ¿pel,</hi> that is, not onely the poore in Å¿pirit, but the multitudes of people that were poore and indigent in reÅ¿pect of theÅ¿e outward things and wanted thoÅ¿e riches that others abounded with, and he affirmes of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48122:120"/>
theÅ¿e <hi>that they received the GoÅ¿pell and imbraced the free grace and favour of God,</hi> and that they were the PhariÅ¿ees and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers only <hi>that reiected the counÅ¿ell of God againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves; but for all the poore</hi> Å¿aith he <hi>and all others that heard</hi> Iohn, <hi>they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the GoÅ¿pel, and were GoÅ¿pel ChriÅ¿tians and Å¿uch as believed aright and as they ought to beleeve,</hi> and therefore if the teÅ¿timony of ChriÅ¿t may be credited, they were caÅ¿t into a Church mould, according to the New TeÅ¿tament forme and were very good ChriÅ¿tians, and that in mighty multitudes; <hi>for all</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>and the poore received the GoÅ¿pel,</hi> and therefore <hi>they could not meet in one and a few congregations together at any one time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauÅ¿e <hi>I S.</hi> Å¿o peremptorily affirmes, <hi>that were it granted, that all the people received</hi> Iohns <hi>BaptiÅ¿me,</hi> yet it <hi>would Å¿tand me in little Å¿tead to prove the concluÅ¿ion:</hi> viz <hi>that they were made ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> TheÅ¿e are his words, adding with all, <hi>much</hi> leÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>that they were caÅ¿t into a Church mould according to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and leÅ¿t of all that they were all members of one Christian Church at IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which is one of their chiefe Arguments by which <hi>I. S.</hi> &amp; they of his fraternity uphold their opinion of Independency, and by which they unchurch all other churches but their own at this day. I Å¿ay in all theÅ¿e regards I will Å¿pend the more time about this argument, the which howÅ¿oever it be brought in by <hi>I. S.</hi> but as as a corallary, yet it may Å¿tand for his Å¿ixth Argument and the beÅ¿t in the bunch, to maintaine and uphold there with their way of Independency, therefore I will firÅ¿t put his words into a SyllogiÅ¿ticall frame, then conÅ¿ider the waight of the reaÅ¿ons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Å¿uch as were not caÅ¿t into a Church mould according to the New teÅ¿tament forme, and leÅ¿t of all were members of one, ChriÅ¿tian church in IeruÅ¿alem, they were not made ChriÅ¿tians: but all they of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem that went out to</hi> Iohns <hi>baptiÅ¿me and were baptized by him, were Å¿uch as were not caÅ¿t into a Church mould according to the New teÅ¿tament forme; leaÅ¿t of all, were they members of one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian Church in IeruÅ¿alem;</hi> ergo <hi>they were not made ChriÅ¿tians.</hi> This is <hi>I. S.</hi> his Argument which he Å¿ets downe by way of a corallary; the <hi>Minor</hi> of which I deny, affirming they were caÅ¿t into a church mould as the Å¿equell wlil Å¿hew. But becauÅ¿e by this Argument, the Independents do not only unchurch and unchriÅ¿tian all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> but indeed unchurch and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48122:120"/>
unchriÅ¿tian all the ProteÅ¿tant Churches through the world and all other churches but their owne; I Å¿hall be Å¿omething the larger in examining it with the Å¿everall termes and expreÅ¿Å¿ions of the Å¿ame, and then Å¿hew and diÅ¿cover the futility and vanity of it, by which I am confident the errors of their wayes will the better appeare; for by that it will be manifeÅ¿t, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent doctrine is but an old peece of Popery in new clothes: though varniÅ¿hed over with fine colours, that it may come forth into the world more lovely and leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿pected, and it is as little prevalent to maintaine their cauÅ¿e as the PapiÅ¿ts is to uphold their Babell.</p>
               <p>The PapiÅ¿ts and the Independents here agree in theÅ¿e two things.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, <hi>They both deny, that thoÅ¿e beleevers that were baptized by</hi> Iohn <hi>the</hi> BaptiÅ¿t <hi>into ChriÅ¿t to come, were formed into a ChriÅ¿tian church or churches;</hi> for we have <hi>I. S.</hi> his formall words in this his anÅ¿wer in the name of all the Independents confidently <hi>denying that they were made ChriÅ¿tians;</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> in expreÅ¿Å¿e termes page 9. of his booke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth unto him, Å¿aying in the name of all his brethren, we take <hi>no notice of them as formed into a church or churches,</hi> and pag. 16. of his booke he produceth the PapiÅ¿ts doctrine to prove this their opinion to be legitimate: So that in this point of their beliefe the PapiÅ¿ts and the Independents agree againÅ¿t all the current and the whole Schooles of all the moÅ¿t Orthodoxe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tant Divines who hold they were ChriÅ¿tians.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they agree in this alÅ¿o <hi>that both of them hold that the forme of a church muÅ¿t ever be viÅ¿ible and apparent:</hi> So that were their never Å¿o many AÅ¿Å¿emblies of ChriÅ¿tians in a city or country, and all beleevers, if they be not caÅ¿t into Å¿uch and Å¿uch a mold and forme, then theyare not churches properly Å¿o called, but in their dialect they are either Heritickes or no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians, but proclaimed enemies of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdom. So that according to the PapiÅ¿ts doctrine, <hi>all thoÅ¿e ChriÅ¿tians that are not within the limits, compaÅ¿Å¿e and bounds that they have circumÅ¿cribed their church with, and are not under that viÅ¿ible forme of government they have appointed; they accompt them all Heritickes and no churches:</hi> as all men know. And in the Å¿ame manner, do the Independents unchurch all churches in the world
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48122:121"/>
but Å¿uch as in their opinion are caÅ¿t into a church mould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and have their diÅ¿tinct Officers and Members, united into one body reÅ¿pectively. That is to Å¿ay, Å¿peaking in their owne language, all Å¿uch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and aÅ¿Å¿embles, as are fluid and are not joyned and united together by an explcite particular Covenant &amp; fixed in their officers and Members &amp; having a Presbytery of their own, with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olute Soverainty and power within themÅ¿elves Independent, they are no churches, and all thoÅ¿e ChriÅ¿tians that are not within the compaÅ¿Å¿e and limits of this their new mould or modell, <hi>they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them enemies of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his kingdome, and accompte of them as a company of infidels and affirme that they are no true churches, nor churches properly Å¿o called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we Å¿ee, that both the PapiÅ¿ts and Independents agree in this, that they bound and limit all churches to Å¿uch and Å¿uch an externall forme; Å¿o that whereÅ¿oever that is wanting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their dialect, though otherwiÅ¿e they have the preaching of the GoÅ¿pel, the right adminiÅ¿tration of the Sacraments and the true invocation of God; they are no churches properly Å¿o called. And both of them farther accorde and agree in this, that the forme of their churches conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the diÅ¿tinction of their Officers and members and the uniting of them into one body reÅ¿pective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they muÅ¿t not be fluid as they Å¿peake, but they muÅ¿t be fixed in their Officers and Members, and having a Presbytery of their owne, with abÅ¿olute Å¿overainty and juriÅ¿diction within themÅ¿elves Independent. But in this the PapiÅ¿ts deale far more honeÅ¿tly then the Independents: for they have in many large volumes fully Å¿et downe the modell of their government, and what it is, and Å¿hew how they are fixed in their Officers and Members; and for their chiefe Officers, they Å¿ay they are the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery at Rome,</hi> the <hi>Cardinals, Patriarchs, Primates, Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, ArchbiÅ¿hops</hi> &amp;c. and we know where to finde them, and what their modell and government is to a hare: But what the Independents modell is or will be, no man could yet ever learne but by conjecture: which I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e Å¿eemes a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing to me, that they Å¿hould thus at pleaÅ¿ure unchurch and unchriÅ¿tian all churches and ChriÅ¿tians as not formed into a church mould after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and yet never declare what that forme and mold is. And yet this is, their daily wicked practice.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48122:121"/>
So that all men may Å¿ee, if they will not put out their eyes, that in this and many other of their tenents and opinions the Independents are but a company of Mungrell PapiÅ¿ts, and would have all men belieeve with an implicit faith <hi>as their Churches believe,</hi> and take all they Å¿peake as Oracles, though it be never Å¿o groundleÅ¿Å¿e. But we have learned ChriÅ¿t better then Å¿o, who is the <hi>Prophet and King of his Church and who hath commanded us to heare him Matth.</hi> 17. <hi>and to obey his voyce</hi> Iohn 10. and <hi>not to give eare unto Å¿trangers.</hi> And from his bleÅ¿Å¿ed Word we have learned theÅ¿e two leÅ¿Å¿ons, the firÅ¿t that whereÅ¿oever the GoÅ¿pel of the Kingdome of <hi>IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t</hi> is faithfully and truly Preached by MiniÅ¿ters Å¿ent by him, and where this EverlaÅ¿ting GoÅ¿pell is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and believed and yeelded obedience unto by the people, and where there is the right AdminiÅ¿tration of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the true invocation of God, they are a true church or churches, although they be fluid, and be not fixed in their Officers and members, and have not that externall forme either the PapiÅ¿ts or the Independents Å¿peake of; and for this our faith, we have warrant from Gods holy Word. Secondly we are taught out of the holy Scriptures, alÅ¿o that there may be a true church or churhes in many nations and kingdomes where they injoy not all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in a publicke manner: nor where their very meetings together are not allowed unto them by authority; for all Å¿uch as confine a church or churches to theÅ¿e externall formes they Å¿peak of, they confound the eÅ¿Å¿ence and Å¿ubÅ¿tance of a church with the adjuncts and Accideuts of it; whereas churches may be true churches, and yet want the externall forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as may by innumerable places of holy Scripture be proved: as for inÅ¿tances. In <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> where God had Å¿et up his owne worÅ¿hip and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed a forme of Government, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it Å¿hould punctually be obÅ¿erved, yet we read in the 2 of the <hi>Chron. chap.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> the 3. theÅ¿e words: <hi>Now for a long Å¿eaÅ¿on</hi> IÅ¿rael <hi>was without the true God, and without a teaching PrieÅ¿t, and without law.</hi> So that from this place we may gather, that their did not then appeare any externall forme of a church, no not in <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> when the true God was not publickly known amongÅ¿t them, and yet notwithÅ¿tanding God had there his true church amongÅ¿t them, yea in the greateÅ¿t height of Idolatry when all the Prophets were perÅ¿ecuted and lay hid in Caves,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48122:122"/>
yet at that time alÅ¿o, <hi>God had Å¿even thouÅ¿and that never bowed knee to Baal;</hi> So that it is evident that it is not the externall forme that is abÅ¿olutely required for the making of a true church, but it may be a true church without that externall appearance they Å¿peak of: For a church is one thing, and the outward forme and diÅ¿cipline is another.</p>

I will briefly name Å¿ome.</p>
               <p>We know that the <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> and <hi>Hebrewes</hi> the onely people of God and his firÅ¿t borne, continued many generations as Å¿trangers in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> all the which time they never offered up any outward Sacrifices unto God; for that had been an abomination to the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> and they would not tolerate and Å¿uffer that in their land; which moved <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> to Å¿ollicite <hi>Pharaoh, to give the people of God leave that they might go a dayes journy to Å¿acrifice in the WilderneÅ¿s,</hi> giving him the reaÅ¿on of his poÅ¿tulation Å¿aying, <hi>that they could not Å¿acrifice in Aegypt, for that was an abomination to the Aegyptians:</hi> So that it is apparent that all the time they remained in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they had not that publike Ordinance &amp; that externall form of worÅ¿hip: And yet all that while they were a true Church and were viÅ¿ibly known by their Religion to be diÅ¿tinct from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as who profeÅ¿Å¿ed the knowledge and worÅ¿hip of the true God <hi>whoÅ¿e name they called upon through all their tribes and whom they Å¿erved night</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48122:122"/>
                  <hi>and day:</hi> and yet I Å¿ay they had not the uÅ¿e of publike Å¿acrifices: onely they had CircumciÅ¿ion amongÅ¿t them that diÅ¿criminating Ordinance from other nations. But if that had been the forme of this true Church, then all the time they remained in the wilderneÅ¿s which was forty years, there was no viÅ¿ible forme of a Church: for they circumciÅ¿ed not their children there, and that reproach was not taken away till they came to <hi>Gilgall,</hi> or at leÅ¿t had paÅ¿Å¿ed the red Sea. So that if the Church had been tyed to externall formes, we Å¿hall for many years together finde no true formed Church in thoÅ¿e times. Nay when they were come into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> how often was the face of the Church in the dayes of the Judges Å¿o deformed as no man almoÅ¿t could Å¿ee any forme or comlineÅ¿Å¿e in it; all the externall beauty which was the worÅ¿hip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either wholy forgotten or Å¿o adulterated and polluted with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry as there was not left any appearance of a true Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t them? and yet at that time they were the people of God and his choÅ¿en people and a true Church; but if they had Å¿ought to know it by any externall form it could never have bin found: <hi>So that the Church of God may be a true church though it want an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form and diÅ¿cipline.</hi> Yea after that God had Å¿et up his worÅ¿hip in the dayes of <hi>David and Solomon,</hi> and had commanded that that forme of Government Å¿hould be continued and perpetuated to the coming of the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿iah,</hi> how many alterations notwithÅ¿tanding were there found both in <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> and how did Idolatry Å¿pread it Å¿elfe abroad through both thoÅ¿e Kingdomes, <hi>So that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry was not only committed under every green tree and in all groves and upon every mountain and high place, but even in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>the holy city yea in the very Temple?</hi> So that now there was no exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall forme of a Church left, and yet then alÅ¿o had God his Church there, and they were the people of God and dearly beloved of him.</p>
               <p>And again when they were carryed into captivity into <hi>Babilon,</hi> we know that all the time they continued there, they had neither Å¿acrifices nor many other ordinances that God had appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t them, they could not Å¿o much as Å¿ing a Å¿ong of <hi>Sion</hi> in that Å¿trange land, and wee read of no other exerciÅ¿es amongÅ¿t them but of the morall worÅ¿hip of prayer and reading the prophets and of prophecying and comforting of one another in the Lord, and of their reÅ¿olution not Å¿o much as to bow in the leaÅ¿t to worÅ¿hip any
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48122:123"/>
Idoll of the heathens, or Å¿o much as Å¿tooping to reverence any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ed enemy of the people of God, as <hi>Mordecay would not to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor the three children to the idoll of</hi> Nebuchadnezer, <hi>nor</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel <hi>leave his praying;</hi> but all theÅ¿e kinde of Å¿ervices are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the forme of a Church amongÅ¿t the learned, and yet wee read of no other formes of worÅ¿hip the Jews had, neither through all the Provinces of <hi>AhaÅ¿uerus</hi> and through all <hi>Babilon</hi> and <hi>AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿yria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> where they were Å¿cattered; We read indeed that they faÅ¿ted and prayed upon all occaÅ¿ions, and that they Å¿pake one to another, and they exerciÅ¿ed amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves the morall worÅ¿hip in all their Synagogues which were all the true Churches of God then through the world; and yet they had not that viÅ¿ible forme that God had appointed, in any of thoÅ¿e Countryes whither they were driven and carryed captives; they onely made their prayers and Å¿upplications toward <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and the Temple the holy place.</p>
               <p>So that if the Church of God had been at any time tyed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall formes they could not then have been Churches properly Å¿o called, as not having any externall forme; and yet they were all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law and under the law and Å¿ince the law true Churches, notwithÅ¿tanding they wanted the externall forme and diÅ¿cipline. And the Å¿ame may be Å¿aid of the Church of God Å¿ince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and growth of AntichriÅ¿t, that it hath been Å¿o defaced for many generations together that none by its externall forme or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cipline could find a true Church in it; yet God had in this Å¿pirituall <hi>Babylon</hi> a true Church ever; and therefore the true Church is not confined to externall formes and diÅ¿cipline. But to Å¿ay nothing of that, if the ChriÅ¿tian Church be bounded within theÅ¿e limits, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the PapiÅ¿ts or the Independents encompaÅ¿Å¿e in their Churches with, then I affirme <hi>that the very Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>was not a true formed Church, which notwithÅ¿tanding they both acknowledge was a true Church, and the Independents confeÅ¿Å¿e that it was the firÅ¿t formed Church,</hi> Acts <hi>the Å¿econd:</hi> For in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> there was neither <hi>Pope,</hi> nor <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> nor <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> nor <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,</hi> nor <hi>Paultripolitans,</hi> nor <hi>ArchbiÅ¿hops,</hi> nor any <hi>Conclave,</hi> nor any <hi>MaÅ¿Å¿es,</hi> nor any of that <hi>Service they have Å¿et up in their RomiÅ¿h Church,</hi> nor that <hi>Forme of Church Government they have eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> neither had they any of theÅ¿e fixed officers.

Nay, if the doctrine of the Independents be true and orthodox, the very Church of JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>Acts the</hi> 2. which they call <hi>the firÅ¿t formed church,</hi> was no more a true formed church, nor caÅ¿t into a Church mould according to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, then thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn the BaptiÅ¿t</hi> were; for they deÅ¿cribe a Church unto us after the New TeÅ¿tament forme to be <hi>a company of Saints or Beleevers, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of no more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then can all meet together in one place or congregation, having their diÅ¿tinct officers and members united together into one body by a particular explicite Covenant: So as that aÅ¿Å¿embly or church muÅ¿t not be fluid, but fixt in its members and officers; having a PreÅ¿bytery of its own with abÅ¿olute authority and juriÅ¿diction within it Å¿elfe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent and injoying all Gods holy Ordinances.</hi> This is the diÅ¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Independent Church after the New TeÅ¿tament forme as they call it, as far as by their practiÅ¿e and writings we can gather; So that whatÅ¿oever Church wants this forme according to their language, is no true formed church, as not being caÅ¿t into a church mould after the New TeÅ¿tament forme: And by this their modell the church it Å¿elfe of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was not a true moulded church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the New TeÅ¿tament forme, as I Å¿hall here briefly in Å¿ome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars Å¿hew, and more largely demonÅ¿trate when I come to my brother <hi>Burton.</hi> For it is confeÅ¿t by the Independents that at that time <hi>there were three thouÅ¿and Å¿oules added to the church, and five thouÅ¿and after that,</hi> it was then a true formed Church after the New TeÅ¿tament forme<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and yet at that time they acknowledge they wanted Deacons and Presbyters; and they confeÅ¿Å¿e withall as we Å¿hall Å¿ee in its due place, they wanted that part of diÅ¿cipline of caÅ¿ting out corrupt Members, Å¿o that then they had not a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem;</hi> and withall the Independents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <hi>that many of the Beleevers and Saints of IeruÅ¿alem were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of other churches through Iudaea;</hi> for they Å¿ay there were many other churches there, and that many of thoÅ¿e belonged unto the other churches, and it is Å¿ufficiently proved alÅ¿o out of the holy word of God and acknowledged by my brother <hi>Burton, that there</hi>

               <p>From all which I gather, that the difinition or deÅ¿cription of the Independents Church is erroneous, or if it be orthodoxe, then the very Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was not a true formed Church after the New TeÅ¿tament formewhen, they Å¿ay it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For firÅ¿t,</hi> there were more Beleevers in IeruÅ¿alem then could all meet in one congregation, or a few, yet though in Å¿everall and diÅ¿tinct places and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, they all made but one Church: <hi>which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Independents doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they had no fixt Officers and Members united into one body reÅ¿pectively nor no Presbitery: for if there were not then Deacons at all, nor Elders as the Independents doe acknowledge, and if many of the Beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> were Å¿trangers, and had their habitations in other cities as they Å¿ay, then they were not fixt, neither in their Officers nor Members, <hi>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

all alone without either Å¿heep or Lambes; they alÅ¿o were not fixed, bnt were afterward Å¿ent into all nations to teach and baptize<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as I Å¿aid before; withall the Independents confeÅ¿Å¿e, they had no DiÅ¿cipline in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> for they want ed that part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> excommunication, and therefore they had no Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in it, nor no juriÅ¿diction within it Å¿elfe, <hi>Ergo</hi> it was not a true formed Church after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, if their doctrine be true and good, neither could they then injoy all the acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip; and therefore was no better then thoÅ¿e that were made chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians by the BaptiÅ¿meof <hi>Iohn; for in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, there were more then could meet in any one place,</hi> which the Independents wil not admit of by their difinition, &amp; they had neither fixed offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers nor Members nor that part of diÅ¿ciplin, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they did not injoy all Gods Ordinances.

               <p>And therefore all that <hi>I.

               <p>But now to returne and come more cloÅ¿ely to examine <hi>I.

               <p>I will therefore that thoÅ¿e that are the moÅ¿t ignorant may the better underÅ¿tand the termes theÅ¿e Juglers uÅ¿e, FirÅ¿t Å¿ay Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing briefly concerning the governement of the Church of the Iewes under the Law in <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> his time, and under the Kings both of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> through all their cities, and what it was that was requiÅ¿it and thought neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the caÅ¿ting off any into a Church mould after the old TeÅ¿tament forme; which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the trifling of all the Independent MiniÅ¿ters will be more obvious to all men.</p>
               <p>For the manner of the governement of the Church of the Iews, wee are to conÅ¿ider it under a double nation, as it had a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Å¿ervice and a morall worÅ¿hip and both appointed by God; yet the former but temporary, the other for duration. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner of the adminiÅ¿tration it was divers; for the ceremoniall worÅ¿hip was ordered after a monarchicall way; there was a high PrieÅ¿t that typified ChriÅ¿t<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that was to make the atonement betweene God and the people, who was in a Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner to mediate with God for the twelve Tribes of <hi>IÅ¿rael<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> and hee had many PrieÅ¿ts under him for the offering up of daily Å¿acrifices, either of prayÅ¿es or of reconciliation in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Temple they were tyed; but the High PrieÅ¿t onely went once a yeare into the Holy of holies, for the making of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for himÅ¿elfe and the people, and this way of adminiÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church continued to the coming of ChriÅ¿t who was the true high PrieÅ¿t typified, and <hi>who through the eternall Å¿pirit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offered himÅ¿elfe without Å¿pot to God, to purge our conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead workes to Å¿erve the living God,</hi> Heb. 10. verÅ¿e 14. <hi>and for this cauÅ¿e is the Mediator of the New TeÅ¿tament;</hi> by his death and Å¿uffering hee hath put an end to that way of adminiÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But there was an other way of AdminiÅ¿tration in reÅ¿pect of the morall worÅ¿hip, which was ever to remaine in the Church; and that was in their Å¿everall <hi>Cities,</hi> in their <hi>Synagogues</hi> and <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,</hi> and all thoÅ¿e <hi>Synagogues</hi> that were through all <hi>Iudaea</hi> and <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> and through the vvorld, vvho vvere all governed by PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Elders vvhich vvere called Rulers; Å¿o that all thoÅ¿e Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48122:125"/>
that vvere in the Å¿everall Villages or Hamlets within the juriÅ¿diction and limits of every Citie were all of them governed after a claÅ¿Å¿icall and collegiate way, and thoÅ¿e Synagogues were as our PariÅ¿h Churches now at this day are amongÅ¿t us.</p>
               <p>Now theÅ¿e Elders and Rulers in <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> time were firÅ¿t appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rule and governe the people in common, Å¿o long as they were in the WilderneÅ¿Å¿e; but after they were come into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then they had their Elders and Rulers in every Citie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed over them, who had the government of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, and whoÅ¿e care it was <hi>that the morall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip and Å¿ervice of God, as the reading of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the interpretation of the Å¿ame Å¿hould be every Sabbath day continually preÅ¿erved in all their Synagogues, by their PrieÅ¿ts and Levites, and Scribes and Lawyers,</hi> and they had alÅ¿o the power in their hands of conventing any before them upon Delinquency, and of cenÅ¿uring and puniÅ¿hing of them upon proofe of the Å¿ame: And they were called <hi>the Church,</hi> as is to be Å¿eene <hi>Matthew</hi> the 18. and there is not any truth almoÅ¿t in all the new teÅ¿tament that is more evidently cleare than this, that all the Synagogues were governed by a Court or ClaÅ¿Å¿is or College of Rulers, for they had inferior judges and Superiour in them yea many chiefe rulers in all cities as we may Å¿ee in <hi>Antioch and PiÅ¿idia Acts the</hi> 13. 14. 15. where <hi>Paul</hi> and his company <hi>went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day and Å¿ate downe,</hi> and <hi>after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the chiefe</hi> Rulers (for Å¿o it is in the originall) <hi>Å¿ent unto them, Å¿aying men and brethren, if you have any word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation for the people, Å¿ay on.</hi> Out of which words theÅ¿e three things are obÅ¿ervable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That there were many Governors and chiefe Rulers as well as inferior rulers that governed their Synagogues in every city in common, and that they had a Courte in them to order all the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues and people under their juriÅ¿diction, and that they were all AriÅ¿tocratically governd and by the common counÅ¿ell of them all, not by any particular Iudge or Ruler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd obÅ¿ervable is,</hi> that their whole imployment was to uphold and preÅ¿erve the true worÅ¿hip of God, and to Å¿ee that the Holy Scriptures were read and interpreted, that men women and children might be brought up in the nurture and feare of the Lord, and that all things Å¿hould be managed with order and decency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third thing obÅ¿ervable, is this,</hi> that their people yeelded

Å¿ubjection unto thoÅ¿e Rulers, and did not intermeddle with their government, nor did not take upon them to command any Minister to Preach or appoint any one to exhort: but it was the place of the Rulers to doe this, and they willingly Å¿ubmitted themÅ¿elves to this Government without joyning themÅ¿elves in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion with them, as knowing it was their place to obey.</p>
               <p>And this kind of Government, was that that was eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in all cities through the world where the Jewes were permitted to exerciÅ¿e their Religion, and this kind of government was tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted over to the ChriÅ¿tian church to be perpetutated to the ende of the world, and therfore there was through all cities Presbyters ordained as the Scripture Å¿aith <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. that were to governe the church by their common councell; and this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded unto by all the Independents who acknowledge that in the ApoÅ¿tles times and many Generations after, all the churches of the New teÅ¿tament were governed <hi>communi conÅ¿ilio presbytero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> And that the Church of JeruÅ¿alem in reÅ¿pect of the moral worÅ¿hip was governed both in ChriÅ¿ts time and after his death and aÅ¿cention, by a colledge of Elders and Presbyters, all the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliÅ¿ts and the Acts of the ApoÅ¿tles doe teÅ¿tifie it; and this way of government I Å¿ay was tranÅ¿acted over to the ChriÅ¿tian church and is that forme and mould of church government that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, into the which mould of government thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> were caÅ¿t which was a Presbytery.

And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿poke at this time and in this place concerning the manner of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration of the government both in reÅ¿pect of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Å¿ervice and morall worÅ¿hip under the Law, and what it ought to be under the GoÅ¿pel.</p>
               <p>And now a word or two concerning the manner of admitting members then into the church of the Iewes and what was reputed neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the making of any one a member and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elite there after the old teÅ¿tament forme; and what is required now for making of any a member of the ChriÅ¿tian church. The whole Scripture of the old teÅ¿tament and the new declares <hi>that all thoÅ¿e that were aliens and Å¿trangers unto the common-wealth of</hi> IÅ¿rael, <hi>if they deÅ¿ired to be made partakers of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the</hi> Iews <hi>and to be all accompted in the number of</hi>

                  <hi>the people of God, they were to be inÅ¿tructed in the Law of</hi> MoÅ¿es, <hi>and they were to yeeld obedience unto that, and in token that they beleeved in the true God, and Å¿ubmitted themÅ¿elves to his Law and to that diÅ¿cipline he had taught in the bookes of</hi> MoÅ¿es <hi>and the Prophets, they were to be circumciÅ¿ed, which when they yeelded unto and tooke the Covenant of CircumciÅ¿ion, they were forthwith made members of the Church of the</hi> Iewes, <hi>and had as good right to all the ordinances of God under that government as any other of the Iewes;</hi> and this I Å¿ay is Å¿ufficiently confirmed in the holy Scriptures everywhere. Now under the New teÅ¿tament the Church of God being compared Å¿ometimes to a Kingdom and Empire, and Å¿ometimes to a city; and all the members of it being compared to free Denizons and citizens, where Å¿o ever the GoÅ¿pel of this Kingdom and City is faithfully preached, and the people by the EmbaÅ¿Å¿adours and MiniÅ¿ters of the Å¿ame being invited to come in and yeeld obedience unto it, <hi>if they do believe and obey,</hi> that is, <hi>if they do beleeve and repent and willingly Å¿ubmit unto the Å¿ound of it, and offer themÅ¿elves to make profeÅ¿Å¿ion of it,</hi> and in Å¿igne of this their obedience and faith <hi>receive the Å¿eale of this Covenant and are baptized,</hi> they are forthwith to be admitted without any reluctation, and having once received the Å¿eale of this Covenant the Å¿eale of BaptiÅ¿me, they are forthwith made free Denizons of this Kingdome and free-men of this city, and have as good right to all the priviledges of the Å¿ame as any other, and may through the whole world of ChriÅ¿tians partake in all the Ordinances of that Kingdome and City as well as any other ChriÅ¿tians: as in the Roman Empire and now in all Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions through the world, they that were Citizens of Rome or they that are Freemen in any of them, as they did then partake in all the priviledges of the Romans and might abide and dwell in any place, and trafficke, buy and purchace in what part of it they pleaÅ¿ed, injoying all thoÅ¿e inmmnities that any then did, and Å¿o likewiÅ¿e now as thoÅ¿e that are Free-men of any city or corporation do in their Å¿everall precincts injoy all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of each of them, and may Å¿et up in any PariÅ¿h or in any part of the city or within the juriÅ¿diction of the Å¿ame, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿e all their Å¿everall trades, and have as much priviledge for their Å¿o doing as any of the other Citizens; Å¿o I Å¿ay in the Å¿ame manner, it is in the Kingdom of ChriÅ¿t and his city which

               <p>Now when all thoÅ¿e that came out of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> did repent and beleeve and were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> they were caÅ¿t into a Church mould after the New TeÅ¿tament forme and were all made as good members of that church as any that were baptized after <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> death and aÅ¿cention by <hi>Peter</hi> and the other ApoÅ¿tles, and might whenÅ¿oever they went from <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> to any other place where chriÅ¿tians dwelt, partake in all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as thoÅ¿e did that by reaÅ¿on of the perÅ¿ecution were Å¿catte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who we read of that whereÅ¿oever they came they went into their Synagogues and Churches, and they preached and converted the people, and partaked and communicated in all the ordinances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t them without any gain-Å¿aying; and Å¿o all the ChriÅ¿tians that are true Beleevers and are baptized, whereÅ¿oever they travell

or dwell whether in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany, Italy</hi> or the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes,</hi> or in any part of the world amongÅ¿t the true ProteÅ¿tants, they have as great right to all the ordinances in thoÅ¿e churches as any of the Natives: For they are all free Denizons of <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> Kingdome and free men of the city the church of God which is <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall body, and therefore as members of the Å¿ame may partake in all the Priviledges and Benefits that any member may do; I mean in reÅ¿pect of the ordinances, as breaking of bread, hearing of the word preached and in prayer and all the eÅ¿Å¿entiall priviledges; for to all thoÅ¿e they have right unto by their very admiÅ¿Å¿ion into the church by their baptiÅ¿me, and whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall refuÅ¿e communion with them that beleeve, and are baptized and live a godly holy and pious life, unleÅ¿Å¿e they will obÅ¿erve their own traditions, they are Delinquents &amp; Prevaricators againÅ¿t the King of his church <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and do no way Å¿et him up upon his throne, but by this meanes they diÅ¿-throne him. And therefore <hi>J.

               <p>For in the holy Scripture we have never read of any other Church mould or of any New TeÅ¿tament forme, <hi>but of publiÅ¿hing the Gospel and of preaching faith and repentance, and of yeelding obedience unto it, and of beleeving and repenting and being baptized,</hi> which both <hi>John</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t and all <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> DiÅ¿ciples and the bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles and all the faithfull MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion to do, and a command withall, and a bleÅ¿Å¿ing annexed unto it, that whoÅ¿oever did repent, beleeve and was baptized, Å¿hould not onely be admitted a viÅ¿ible member of the catholicke viÅ¿ible Church, but Å¿hould be Å¿aved. The words of our Saviour <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> unto his DiÅ¿ciples, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. are theÅ¿e, <hi>Go</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:48122:128"/>
(Å¿aith he) <hi>into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; he that beleeveth and is baptized Å¿hall be Å¿aved; but he that beleeveth not Å¿hall be damned.</hi> Out of the which words and commiÅ¿Å¿ion of our Saviour I evidently gather that when <hi>John</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples in their Å¿everall miniÅ¿tryes went according to their commiÅ¿Å¿ion preaching from place to place and from city to city and publiÅ¿hing the glad tydings of the kingdom of the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and baptizing Å¿uch as beleeved, they caÅ¿t them into a Church mould after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and therefore made them all members not onely of the Catholique viÅ¿ible Church but of all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall particular Churches and Synagogues through all the cities of <hi>Judaea</hi> and through the world where they preached the GoÅ¿pel, as well as at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that as many of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> as were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> DiÅ¿ciples were all members of that Church and as truly moulded into a Church mould after the New TeÅ¿tament forme and made as reall members and free deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons of ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome as any of the new congregations at this day, unleÅ¿Å¿e any will think and beleeve that <hi>John</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t and the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles were ignorant how to gather Churches, and neÅ¿cient of the right mould and forme of the New TeÅ¿tament chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and had not learned their leÅ¿Å¿on Å¿o well as our Independent MiniÅ¿ters: which were a piece of impiety and horrid wickedneÅ¿Å¿e to affirme: For then it would follow, that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and by the ApoÅ¿tles and <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples, were never Å¿aved: For <hi>I. S.</hi> denyes they were ChriÅ¿tians and that they were caÅ¿t into a church mould after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, or members of the chriÅ¿tian church, and therefore by conÅ¿equent they were in the Å¿tate of damnation.</p>
               <p>But if all this be wickedneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿o much as to think, then there is a way yet to Heaven and that a Å¿afe one which the Independents are ignorant of; for they preach up their way as the narrow way to heaven, proclaiming all thoÅ¿e that are out of it to be enemies of JeÅ¿us <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and his kingdome, and in the Å¿tate of perdition; and yet <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t was ignorant of their way and caÅ¿t not his DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into their mould, and yet they went Å¿afely to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, yea they entred into it by violence as our Saviour Å¿peaketh.</p>
               <p>And therefore by this that I have now Å¿aid by way of anÅ¿wer, all men may Å¿ee the futility and impiety of <hi>I. S.</hi> and how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48122:128"/>
all his arguments are, and may very well conclude, <hi>That all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by</hi> John <hi>the BaptiÅ¿t and by ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples before his death, were members of ChriÅ¿ts Church and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and that as many of them as came from</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>were members of that church;</hi> and they may alÅ¿o from the foregoing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments gather, <hi>That thoÅ¿e that came out of JeruÅ¿alem to his baptiÅ¿m were in Å¿uch multitudes (for all IeruÅ¿alem went out unto him and were baptized) as they could not all poÅ¿Å¿ibly meet in any one place or congregation or a few;</hi> &amp; therfore I am confident that all thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall read both what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> have fondly and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly replyed to my arguments, and what by way of anÅ¿wer I have here Å¿et down, will adjudge, that Å¿uch unworthy wranglers and cavillers as theÅ¿e are ought by their Å¿everall Churches to be Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely cenÅ¿ur'd for this their ignorance and impiety. And this Å¿hall Å¿erve to have replyed to theÅ¿e their exceptions againÅ¿t my firÅ¿t arguments concerning the multitudes baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿t: I Å¿hall anÅ¿wer to all their other Å¿everall cavills in their due places.</p>
               <p>I will now therefore go on to Å¿hew the increaÅ¿e of beleevers that were made by the miracles and preaching both of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and his ApoÅ¿tles, and from the Å¿everall places out of the holy Scripture frame my arguments as out of the former to prove the Å¿ame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ion. <hi>John</hi> the 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Now when the Lord knew how the PhariÅ¿ees had heard that IeÅ¿us made and baptized more DiÅ¿ciples then Iohn (though IeÅ¿us himÅ¿elfe baptized not, but his DiÅ¿ciples:)</hi> Here obÅ¿erve that where there was a miÅ¿take in the relation, there the EvangeliÅ¿t forthwith Å¿hews it to rectifie mens underÅ¿tandings; as where it was reported <hi>that ChriÅ¿t baptized,</hi> he Å¿hewes it was a miÅ¿take, <hi>for his DiÅ¿ciples onely baptized:</hi> but where it is Å¿aid, <hi>that IeÅ¿us made more DiÅ¿ciples then Iohn,</hi> that is taken <hi>pro confeÅ¿Å¿o;</hi> and it was true; for <hi>Iohn</hi> himÅ¿elfe in the 3. chapter ver. 30. had Å¿aid, <hi>He muÅ¿t increaÅ¿e, but I muÅ¿t decreaÅ¿e.</hi> ChriÅ¿t therefore made many more DiÅ¿ciples and Beleevers then <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>added dayly to the church, that was then in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>Å¿uch as Å¿hould be Å¿aved; for he came to Å¿ave the loÅ¿t Å¿heep of the houÅ¿e of IÅ¿rael, and he received all that came to him,</hi> John <hi>the</hi> 6. 37. <hi>And as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Å¿onnes of God, even to them that beleeve upon his name,</hi> John 1. 12. And theÅ¿e were infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, as we Å¿hall Å¿ee by and by. In <hi>Iohn</hi> the 7. 31. it is Å¿aid <hi>that</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:48122:129"/>
                  <hi>many of the people of IeruÅ¿alem beleeved on him;</hi> And verÅ¿e the 40. they Å¿aid, <hi>of a truth this is that Prophet:</hi> And in the Å¿ame chapter when the high PreiÅ¿ts Å¿ent the officers to apprehend ChriÅ¿t, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning without him, and the high PrieÅ¿ts demanding the reaÅ¿on why they had not brought him, the officers replyed Å¿aying, <hi>That never man Å¿pake as this man.</hi> ver. 47, 48. <hi>Then anÅ¿wered the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ees, are ye alÅ¿o deceived? Doth any of the Rulers or the PhariÅ¿ees believe in him? But this people that knoweth not the Law is curÅ¿ed.</hi> Take here notice of the confeÅ¿Å¿ion of the very <hi>PhariÅ¿ees;</hi> excepting themÅ¿elves and the High PrieÅ¿ts, they acknowledge <hi>that the generality of the people believed in him.</hi> Here was increaÅ¿e upon increaÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿tians and Believers, all the people generally believed in him: certainely one place could not have contained them all. And which is yet more to be obÅ¿erved; that whereas the PhariÅ¿ees Å¿aid, none but the curÅ¿ed people believed in him, and none of the Rulers; in this very chapter we finde one Ruler one <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> VerÅ¿. 50. none of the leaÅ¿t of the Rulers. And in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 42. it is affirmed, <hi>That among the chiefe Rulers many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him, but becauÅ¿e of the PhariÅ¿ees they did not confeÅ¿Å¿e him, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould be put out the Synagogue.</hi> And in VerÅ¿e 11. of the Å¿ame chapter, it is aÅ¿Å¿erted, <hi>That many of the Iewes went away and believed on IeÅ¿us;</hi> here was multiplication upon multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Believers. And in VerÅ¿. 19. <hi>The PhariÅ¿ees therefore Å¿aid among themÅ¿elves, perceive ye how ye prevaile nothing? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the world is gone after him.</hi> TheÅ¿e words the PhariÅ¿ees Å¿pake in private among themÅ¿elves deliberately, and confeÅ¿t that the world of men were turned ChriÅ¿tians; all <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> Å¿warmed with Believers; <hi>without doubt all theÅ¿e could not meet in one place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed through all the EvangeliÅ¿ts we Å¿hall reade of infinite multitudes that believed in him; and the reaÅ¿on is given, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 29. <hi>BecauÅ¿e he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes:</hi> and did Å¿uch works of wonder, and wrought Å¿uch miracles, as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 31. they confeÅ¿t <hi>none could do but ChriÅ¿t:</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>VerÅ¿.</hi> 11. it is related, <hi>that the raiÅ¿ing up</hi> Lazarus <hi>from the dead made many believe on him,</hi> and was the cauÅ¿e that Å¿uch multitudes of people followed him, and did Å¿o high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour him and magnifie him; and did receive him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> with Å¿uch an acclamation, crying, <hi>HoÅ¿anna,</hi> as in this 12 Chapter is Å¿pecified; and is more largely Å¿et downe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48122:129"/>
in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 8. where it is related, <hi>That a great multitude Å¿pread their garments in the way, and others cut down branches,</hi> and the people that went before, and they that came after, cryed <hi>HoÅ¿anna,</hi> and Å¿aid, <hi>this is JeÅ¿us the Prophet of</hi> Nazareth; <hi>they all believed in him, and confeÅ¿Å¿ed him before the world.</hi> Now our Savionr Å¿aith, <hi>He that Å¿hall confeÅ¿Å¿e me, and own me before men, I will confeÅ¿Å¿e and own him before my Father in Heaven.</hi> Here is a whole City of Believers and ConfeÅ¿Å¿ors. Yes, the very children believed in him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and openly, and in the Temple cried <hi>HoÅ¿anna.</hi> And ChriÅ¿t him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf allowed of their teÅ¿timony, and avouched they did well, and accordingly as was written. And in <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 47, 48. it is Å¿aid, <hi>That he taught dayly in the Temple, but the chief Priests and Scribes, and the Elders of the people Å¿ought to destroy him, and could not finde what they might do; for all the people were very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to heare him.</hi> The univerÅ¿ality therefore of the people by all theÅ¿e places were believers, and Å¿uch as followed ChriÅ¿t: So that a man may wonder, how that <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> it Å¿elf, though it were a mighty City, could containe Å¿uch multitudes of people as believed in ChriÅ¿t: Å¿o far improbable it is, <hi>that any one place or Congregation could containe the hundreth part of them.</hi> And we may alÅ¿o gather, that the great miracles at his Suffering, and at his ReÅ¿urrection, and the apparition of Å¿o many <hi>that roÅ¿e from their graves and went into the holy City,</hi> made a great increaÅ¿e and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of DiÅ¿ciples and new Believers; Å¿o that the number was daily augmented; we finde no diminution: but if Å¿ome that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ChriÅ¿t for bread, that were but Hypocrites, left following him; yet in thoÅ¿e places we read again and again of numberleÅ¿Å¿e companies that daily came in, and believed in him.</p>
               <p>And to all this we may adde, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> and his DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, a little before his death; and ChriÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿ciples, by reaÅ¿on of the increaÅ¿e of the multitudes of Believers, were forced to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in Å¿everall places. For Å¿o it is in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>After theÅ¿e dayes came IeÅ¿us and his DiÅ¿ciples into the land of Iudea, and there he tarried with them and baptized, and</hi> Iohn <hi>alÅ¿o was baptizing in</hi> Enon<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>neere</hi> Salim, <hi>becauÅ¿e there was much water there, and they came and were baptized.</hi> And very reaÅ¿on will tell all men, that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity there muÅ¿t be an innumerable multitude of beleevers, (for none were Baptized but beleevers) that muÅ¿t take up an hundred preachers or thereabouts; for our Saviour had twelve ApoÅ¿tles, and 70. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciples,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48122:130"/>
as we may Å¿ee in the 9. of <hi>Luke,</hi> and in the 10. chapter of the Å¿ame book: and <hi>Iohn</hi> had alÅ¿o many DiÅ¿ciples, though not Å¿o many as <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and all theÅ¿e were imployed in preaching the GoÅ¿pell, and many of them in working miracles and wonders; Å¿o that the very Devills were Å¿ubject unto them, as they rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly confeÅ¿t to <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> when they returned to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their MiniÅ¿tery. And without doubt if theÅ¿e miracles wrought Å¿o with the very DiÅ¿ciples, they prevailed much more generally with the people to make them beleeve; Å¿o that infinite multitudes of people came in and were Baptized, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it Å¿elfe informeth us. And of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, Å¿o many MiniÅ¿ters, muÅ¿t have Å¿everall places to Preach in, and Å¿everall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and AÅ¿Å¿emblies to Preach to, and Å¿everall places to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in: for otherwiÅ¿e there would have beene great confuÅ¿ion; for but one of them could Å¿peake at once; and all theÅ¿e DiÅ¿ciples were taken up in their Å¿everall MiniÅ¿teries, and had their hands full, as the Scripture it Å¿elf Å¿ufficiently declareth in expreÅ¿Å¿e words; for it is Å¿aid, <hi>That ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples Baptizedin Indaea: and</hi> Iohn <hi>in</hi> Enon <hi>neere</hi> Salim, <hi>becauÅ¿e there was much water there.</hi> It Å¿eemes there was too little water to Baptize them in, in others places, which expreÅ¿Å¿ion is worthy to be taken notice of. And amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that came to be Baptized, multitudes of them came from <hi>IeruÅ¿alem.</hi>

               <p>And if wee compare times with times, which will make much for the evidencing of the truth, and conÅ¿ider the divers paÅ¿Å¿ages in the holy Scriptures, wee Å¿hall find the like diviÅ¿ion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in thoÅ¿e dayes; Å¿ome Å¿tanding for ChriÅ¿t and <hi>Iohn</hi> BaptiÅ¿t, and Å¿peaking in the juÅ¿tification of them and their MiniÅ¿tery, and others that were of the PhariÅ¿aicall faction, and of the high PrieÅ¿ts company; as is even in theÅ¿e our dayes, betweene them they call Caviliers, and thoÅ¿e they call Parliamentiers. Now what twenty or thirty places in the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> can containe all the Parliamentiers <hi>to partake in all acts of WorÅ¿hip?</hi> Or what ten places can hold all thoÅ¿e of the Prelaticall Faction, that contend for their BiÅ¿hops and Service, and all their other trumpery and accoutrements? And yet, although they be in divers and Å¿undry AÅ¿Å¿emblies, they are Å¿till the Prelaticall party, and all of them of the Malignant Church: and as the diverÅ¿ity of the places changeth not their complexions, Å¿o it altereth not their faith, nor manners,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48122:130"/>
but they continne Å¿till Malignants and remaine all Members of the Malignant Church.</p>
               <p>And as in theÅ¿e dayes all that wiÅ¿h well unto the true Religion through both citie and kingdome, and love their countrey, Å¿tand for the Parliament; Å¿o in thoÅ¿e dayes thoÅ¿e <hi>that loved</hi> Zion <hi>and the proÅ¿perity of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>cleaved unto ChriÅ¿t and the GoÅ¿pel and Å¿tood for him, and all his MiniÅ¿ters;</hi> and by all computations, though all the power and Authority was in the hands of the malignant MagiÅ¿trates of thoÅ¿e times, who were Å¿wayed and guided by the Scribes, PhariÅ¿ees, Elders, and the high PrieÅ¿ts; yet to one Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ee or Malignant Scribe or Ruler, there was ten of thoÅ¿e that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in ChriÅ¿t, and honoured him and all his MiniÅ¿ters and DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Yea the PhariÅ¿ees themÅ¿elves do acknowledge it, not once but many times, as is evident from the places above cited, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more that might be produced.</p>
               <p>So that if I Å¿hould frame no Argument out of them, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that thoÅ¿e new additions of Beleevers that were converted by ChriÅ¿t and his MiniÅ¿try, conÅ¿idered by themÅ¿elves a part, from thoÅ¿e that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t converted, were Å¿o great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, <hi>that they could not all meet in any one place for partaking of all acts of worÅ¿hip,</hi> but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Congregations</hi> and <hi>AÅ¿Å¿emblies,</hi> if they would all be edified; much leÅ¿Å¿e could they all meet together, being joyned to thoÅ¿e that beleeved through the BaptiÅ¿me and MiniÅ¿try of <hi>Iohn.</hi> But out of the former places above Å¿pecified I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where there was an innumerable multitude of beleevers, in a word, the whole people and Citie of IeruÅ¿alem, whom the PhariÅ¿ees accounted accurÅ¿ed, there they could not all meet at any one time, or in any one roome or place and in one Congregation, to partake in all the Ordinances, but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t bee diÅ¿tributed into Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aÅ¿Å¿emblies, and divers Congregations, if they would all bee edified: But in IeruÅ¿alem (the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees, and Rulers, by their owne confeÅ¿Å¿ion, being excepted) there was an innumerable multitude of beleevers, and in a word, the whole people and Citie of JeruÅ¿alem, whom the PhariÅ¿ees accounted accurÅ¿ed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet together at one time, and in one place to partake in all the Ordinances, but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aÅ¿Å¿emblies and divers congregations, if they would all be edified.</p>

the Scriptures, or is but a little acquainted with the HiÅ¿tories of thoÅ¿e times. For the minor, it is evident from the places produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and therefore the concluÅ¿ion doth neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow. But I yet further thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where there was a world of beleevers, with many Rulers and men of great place and office, with infinite multitudes of men and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; all the people, they could not al meet together at one time, and in one place and congregation to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip; but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers aÅ¿Å¿emblies and Å¿everall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, if they would all be edified. But in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> there was a world of beleevers, with many Rulers and men of great place and office, with multitudes of men and children, and all the people. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet together at one time and in one place, to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip, but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies if they would be all edified.</p>
               <p>For the Major, it is evident by the very light of nature, neither will any rationall man deny it, that hath not reÅ¿olved to Å¿acrifice himÅ¿elfe to Å¿tupidity. For the Minor, the places above Å¿pecified prove it: for in expreÅ¿Å¿e words it is Å¿aid, <hi>that the world followed him;</hi> that is, <hi>believed in him,</hi> and that great multitudes entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with their acclamations, and crying <hi>HoÅ¿anna,</hi> the very children alÅ¿o Å¿econding them.

But out of the former places I yet further thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where ther was Å¿uch an increaÅ¿e of multitudes of Beleevers, as that there was not water enough in any one place to baptize them all, nor any one place in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e capable to containe or receive them all; Å¿o that ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, and his Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples, and twelve ApoÅ¿tles, and Iohn BaptiÅ¿t and all his DiÅ¿ciples, were for the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meroÅ¿ity

But in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> there was Å¿uch multitudes of beleevers that went out to the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>John</hi> and ChriÅ¿t, as that there was not water enough in any one place to baptize them all, nor any one place in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e capable to containe or receive them all: Å¿o that ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe and his Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples, and his twelve ApoÅ¿tles, and Saint <hi>John</hi> BaptiÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿ciples, were for the numeroÅ¿ity of them forced to divide themÅ¿elves into Å¿everall places, and Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations, that all the people might partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip, and be edified. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet at any one time, or in any one place, but were of neceÅ¿Å¿ity forced to divide and diÅ¿tribute themÅ¿elves into divers places, and Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, that they might all be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>For the Major and Minor of the SyllogiÅ¿me, they are Å¿o evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both by reaÅ¿on, and the holy Scripture, that no man that hath not reÅ¿olved with himÅ¿elfe to remaine incredulous, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in his obÅ¿tinacy, can deny the truth of them; Å¿o that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ion of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t from the premiÅ¿es be granted. And all theÅ¿e multitudes of people were beleevers before ChriÅ¿ts Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ReÅ¿urrection, and AÅ¿cenÅ¿ion.</p>
               <p>Now before I goe on to declare what infinite multitudes of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were added to thoÅ¿e that were converted by <hi>Iohns</hi> and the DiÅ¿ciples MiniÅ¿try in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> after ChriÅ¿ts death, and aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, which makes it an impoÅ¿Å¿ible thing, <hi>that they Å¿hould all meet in one place or a few;</hi> I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire the Reader here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider what MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and <hi>I.

               <p>TheÅ¿e are MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> formall words, and all the ground of his denyall of the minor of all my Arguments, yea all that he hath to Å¿ay againÅ¿t them. And it is wonderfull to Å¿ee, how the people are Å¿atisfied with Å¿uch deluÅ¿ions. But by this kind of DiÅ¿puting, if it be Å¿ufficient for refutation, to deny any Arguments grounded upon the holy Scriptures, confirmed and corroborated by Å¿ound reaÅ¿ons: then for ought I know, men may not only confute the whole word of God, and whatÅ¿oever is evidently proved from thence, but indeed deny the ChriÅ¿tian Religion. But that all men may take notice of this mans ignorance, and blaÅ¿phemy (for to Å¿ay the truth, he giveth the Spirit of God the lye, whiles hee labours to maintaine his erroneous opinion) &amp; that my anÅ¿wer may be the more Å¿atisfactory, I will make theÅ¿e two PropoÅ¿itions evidently appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> that the world here mentioned that went after ChriÅ¿t, were Å¿uch as beleeved in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, that</hi> there was a world of beleevers in the Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem, and that they were inhabitants there, <hi>both which if I make good, then my Arguments will Å¿tand for ever immoveable, and it will follow,</hi> that there were more beleevers in the Church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem before ChriÅ¿ts death converted by himÅ¿elfe, and by his DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then could all poÅ¿Å¿ibly meet in any one place, or congregation or a few; <hi>beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that were converted by</hi> Iohns <hi>MiniÅ¿try, and that this deniall of Mr.</hi> Knollys <hi>is groundleÅ¿Å¿e, vaine and impious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For proofe therefore of my firÅ¿t PropoÅ¿ition, <hi>viz. that the world here mentioned were beleevers,</hi> it is manifeÅ¿t by the inÅ¿uing reaÅ¿ons.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t from the manner of the Scriptures dialect, and that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, which intimate and prove, <hi>that to follow ChriÅ¿t with love, affection, and approbation, is to be his Schollers and DiÅ¿ciples, and to beleeve in him,</hi> Matth. <hi>the</hi> 16. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 24.

                     </gap>ter ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and to follow him in Å¿incerity, is, <hi>to be ChriÅ¿ts Scholler and DiÅ¿ciple, and to beleeve in him:</hi> For Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, this is Å¿o cleare a truth, that the very blind PhariÅ¿ees, <hi>thoÅ¿e Leaders of the blind</hi> did well perceive it, and tooke the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes following of him in this Å¿enÅ¿e, <hi>that they beleeved in him,</hi> which their very expreÅ¿sion doth Å¿ufficiently declare: For Å¿ay they <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 29. <hi>Perceive yee not how you prevaile nothing?

               <p>Thirdly, the Å¿ame is confirmed by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his witneÅ¿Å¿e in private alÅ¿o, who knew very well how the people of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> Å¿tood generally affected towards ChriÅ¿t, and what opinion they had of him: heare therefore what hee Å¿aith, <hi>Iohn</hi> the 3. of whom the EvangeliÅ¿t Å¿peaketh thus. <hi>There was a man of the PhariÅ¿ees named</hi> Nicodemus, <hi>a Ruler of the Iewes, the Å¿ame came to IeÅ¿us by night, and Å¿aid unto him Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God, for no man can doe theÅ¿e miracles except God bee with him.</hi> Here <hi>Nicodemus</hi> gives in teÅ¿timony, &amp; devidene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> that the generality of thoÅ¿e in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and of the principalleÅ¿t of them as well as of the meaneÅ¿t, that they beleeved in JeÅ¿us, <hi>Å¿aying we know,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48122:133"/>
that is to Å¿ay, <hi>all the people know,</hi> that thou <hi>art a Teacher come from God;</hi> they knew it with the knowledge of Faith and approbation, and did really beleeve that hee was come from God, and he gives a reaÅ¿on of his and their faith, Å¿aying, <hi>that no men can doe thoÅ¿e miracles except God bee with him,</hi> and therefore they beleeved in him: Å¿o that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> which was a DiÅ¿ciple of ChriÅ¿t, though in Å¿ecret and a great honourer of him, would give in no falÅ¿e ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, nor make no falÅ¿e MuÅ¿ters, and he knew very well the opinion and the eÅ¿teeme the people had of him, and he aÅ¿Å¿erteth that both himÅ¿elfe and the people knew that ChriÅ¿t was Å¿ent of God, which is as much as to beleeve in him: for the Å¿ame confeÅ¿Å¿ion did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles make, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 6. Å¿aying, <hi>we know that thou art the Sonne of the living God.</hi> So that to acknowledge ChriÅ¿t, and to beleeve in him, is all one in the language of holy Scripture, and to follow and go after ChriÅ¿t out of Å¿incerity and love and to beleeve in him, is the Å¿ame if the word of God may be judge in this controverÅ¿ie. So that to goe after ChriÅ¿t then, and to follow him cordially and without worldly ends, both in the language of God and men, is to Å¿erve ChriÅ¿t and to beleeve in him: and therefore for all the above mentioned reaÅ¿ons, the world that went after ChriÅ¿t, &amp; the people and multitudes that followed him, were all beleevers, and the others that either tarried at home, and followed their owne imployments, or oppoÅ¿ed him, were unbeleevers.</p>
               <p>Now then when a multitulde from <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> followd <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and when a world within <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> went after him, and when all the curÅ¿ed people (as they called them) beleeved in him, not only by the very teÅ¿timony of the enemies of <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> but by the witneÅ¿Å¿es of the holy Scripture, it is Å¿ufficiently apparent that the World Å¿pake of in the 12. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> were all beleevers, amongÅ¿t the which alÅ¿o out of Å¿ame Chapter is proved, <hi>That many of the Rulers alÅ¿o believed in him.</hi> So that MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> denying all this, is little better then an Infidell: For an Infidell can do no more then deny the holy Scripture and the manifeÅ¿t truths diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in them; and by this that I have now Å¿aid, though I Å¿hould not adde a word more, it is manifeÅ¿t, <hi>That there were more beleevers at that time in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>then could all meete in any one place to partake in all the Ordinances,</hi> except a mighty city and a world of beleevers may <hi>all meete together in one room<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Scripture is Å¿o cleare in this point, that there were innumerable believers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> as in the Å¿econd of the <hi>Acts,</hi> beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that were natives there, it is Å¿aid there were <hi>dwellers in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>worÅ¿hippers, or devout men, that is</hi> to Å¿ay <hi>beleevers out of all nations under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And all theÅ¿e Å¿ayeth the Scripture had their dwelling there. And without all doubt all theÅ¿e Å¿everall Nations, had their Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Synagogues in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> where they heard the Word of God in their owne language, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> and other Nations, here in <hi>London</hi> have their churches. And the multitudes of the inhabitants in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> at all times, by the relation of the HiÅ¿torians of thoÅ¿e dayes, were Å¿carÅ¿e ever leÅ¿Å¿e then Å¿even or eight hundred thouÅ¿ands; and without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ie the number was now increaÅ¿ed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> becauÅ¿e they daily and hourely expected the comming of the <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿ias</hi> whoÅ¿e appearing they every moment looked for: and therefore all the believing Iewes out of all Countries repaired in multitudes to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> So that Å¿uch numberleÅ¿Å¿e numbers, both of the native <hi>Iewes</hi> and Å¿trangers; required a mighty number of Teachers, and a many places to heare and to be taught in: and that there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove foure hundred Synagogues in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> (which are chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in our dialect) the pen-men and HiÅ¿toriographers of thoÅ¿e times have recorded it: and all this is probable, from the numero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity of Preachers and Teachers there, which the holy Scripture relateth, as the PrieÅ¿ts &amp; Levits, Scribes, PhariÅ¿ees, Lawyers, which all Å¿ate in <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> Chaire, and all of them diligently taken up in Preaching to the people and in inÅ¿tructing them, upon whoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿tery by ChriÅ¿ts command all the multitude and his very fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were to attend <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 1. 2. 3. So that there was no Å¿eparation then to be made from the publicke AÅ¿Å¿emblies where the Law and GoÅ¿pell was taught, nor no gathering of new Churches, under pretence of eaÅ¿ting them into a Church mould according to the New teÅ¿tament forme. ChriÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿ciples were not then Å¿o deepely learned as to be in that high
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48122:134"/>
forme of Divinity; ChriÅ¿ts followers notwithÅ¿tanding were all GoÅ¿pell ChriÅ¿tians, and were all in a Church way, and I am Å¿ure of it, in the right way to heaven, <hi>if the way, the truth and the life</hi> could teach them the Å¿traight way thither: and yet they all followed the old lights Å¿till, <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and the Prophets; ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles were all their MaÅ¿ters; we heare then of no new lights, nor new borne truths, nor of new Church moulds, and yet <hi>then the Kingdome of heaven Å¿uffered violence, and the violent tooke it by force Matth.</hi> 11, 12. they went all well to Heaven, as well and as cheerfully as any of our Independents with their new lights, and their congregationall way. But this by the by.</p>
               <p>Now I Å¿ay if there were Å¿uch multitudes, both of Hearers and Teachers, there was without all doubt many places for them Å¿eveally to heare in, and it Å¿tands withall reaÅ¿on that the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Å¿trange Nations had Synagogues by themÅ¿elves, and Å¿uch men to Teach unto them in their own language as they could underÅ¿tand, or elÅ¿e they could not have been edified, and there is very good ground to induce men to beleeve that I now Å¿ay: For if there was a Synagogue in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> of the Libertines, (as there was) that is to Å¿ay of thoÅ¿e that had beene Å¿lives and bond-men, but were made free, then can any man beleeve that all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Nations of the free-men, that abounded alÅ¿o with wealth and honour, (or elÅ¿e if they had not had great riches, they could never have journied Å¿o about from Country to Country and tranÅ¿ported their families thither) I Å¿ay in all theÅ¿e regardes it Å¿tands withall reaÅ¿on that they had their particular Synagogues alÅ¿o, and therefore that they were in mighty multitudes, Å¿o that a few places could not containe them all to communicate in all Acts of worÅ¿hip, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity in ChriÅ¿t his time they were diÅ¿tributed into many and Å¿everall Congregations; and all this I Å¿ay beÅ¿ides the holy Scripture very reaÅ¿on dictats to any man but MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I.

I referre therefore that which I have now Å¿pake, to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the judicious and learned, whether we ought rather to believe the Holy Scripture of truth, which was indited by the Spirit of truth, or MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> who Å¿aith and writeth the contrary by the Å¿pirit of error<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿pake for proofe of my firÅ¿t propoÅ¿ion, <hi>to wit that the world that went after ChriÅ¿t were believers,</hi> which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> moÅ¿t fondly and impiouÅ¿ly denyeth.</p>

for the 5 Members, there was not a woman or a child that had a head as big as a crab, but cryed for the Priviledges of Parliament, &amp; commonly as the cock crows, Å¿o crows the hen &amp; the chickens. And by all probability it was at that time in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> in reÅ¿pect of ChriÅ¿t, as it was then here in reÅ¿pect of the Parliament; the generality of all the inhabitants believed in him and honoured him, as the people generally in the city did the Parliament; which is yet more evident from the great indignation and wrath of the PrieÅ¿ts and Scribes who were diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed to Å¿ee the wonderfull things he did, and eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that they heard the children crying in the Temple Å¿aying, <hi>HoÅ¿anna to the Å¿onne of David;</hi> by which they well perceived that the children Å¿pake no otherwiÅ¿e then their fathers would have them, and that the whole city of Inhabitants were Å¿uch as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him.

               <p>The reader may remember that in his former reply, he Å¿eemed not to doubt concerning the number of thoÅ¿e that were baptized, onely he denyed that thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn, were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians, and that they were caÅ¿t into a Church mould after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, much leÅ¿Å¿e that they were members of one ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church at</hi> JeruÅ¿alem; theÅ¿e are his own words and by this hee thought to overthrow that argument: Now here he uÅ¿eth another method; tacitly denying the Minor of all my SyllogiÅ¿mes; and the reaÅ¿on of his denyall is, becauÅ¿e as he Å¿peaketh, I made falÅ¿e mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters; he thinks me, it Å¿eemes, like the Independents, who would perÅ¿wade the Å¿imple that all are Independent; and amongÅ¿t other things he Å¿aith that I gave the Independents occaÅ¿ion Å¿hrewdly to Å¿uÅ¿pect my ignorance.

where the Doctor having got a multiplying glaÅ¿Å¿e in his hand, goes on to make Å¿trange diÅ¿coveryes of the increaÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿tian believers. <hi>pag. 36.</hi> he tells us, that ChriÅ¿t made many more DiÅ¿ciples and Beleevers then <hi>John,</hi> and added dayly unto the Church, that was then in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem, Å¿uch as Å¿hould be Å¿aved.

               <p>If I Å¿hould diÅ¿cover all the errors that are in this reply, I might make a very large volume: but in regard that all learned men will eaÅ¿ily perceive the vanity, childiÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e and horrid impiety of the man in the very reading of it: I Å¿hall not be Å¿o larg in my anÅ¿wer as otherwiÅ¿e I had thought to have been: and yet before I come to it, I cannot but complain of the diÅ¿honeÅ¿ty of the man that thus cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taileth my arguments every where, not plainly Å¿etting them down, that the people may Å¿ee my reaÅ¿ons; but this is the ordinary way of his diÅ¿puting who conceales the truth from the ignorant and Å¿imple that he may the better poyÅ¿on them with his errors and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltyes. After the very Å¿ame manner dealeth my brother <hi>Burton</hi> with me, as we Å¿hall Å¿ee in its due place, who paÅ¿Å¿ing by all my arguments not Å¿o much as mentioning any one of them, makes a <hi>rombobombo SyllogiÅ¿me</hi> of his own, which as I Å¿uppoÅ¿e he fetcht out of the howling wilderneÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>America,</hi> and then with <hi>Phocions</hi> hatchet, that carnall weapon, he fights with his own Å¿haddow, and vapors like a conquerour as <hi>I.

                  <hi>The Å¿econd,</hi> that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould adde dayly to the Church that was then in IeruÅ¿alem.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e in <hi>I. S.</hi> his opinion are paradoxes, that is matters of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibry in his dialect. Yet both theÅ¿e truthes I Å¿pake of, are cleere out of the Word of God, and therefore whiles he wounds me, he vulnerateth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> and blaÅ¿phemeth, for he giveth the Spirit of God the lye, and denyeth the Scripture that aÅ¿Å¿erts that <hi>ChriÅ¿t made mo DiÅ¿ciples then John,</hi> and therefore added more unto the church: for of unbelievers and of enemies they were made DiÅ¿ciples, ChriÅ¿tians and friends; and therefore taken out of the world and brought into ChriÅ¿ts fold and church, and by that worke of converÅ¿ion they were added to it; as he that Å¿hould this day take any of our MiniÅ¿ters and faithfull PaÅ¿tors Å¿heep out of their folds and Å¿teale them away, (as too too many of the Independent MiniÅ¿ters daily do) and bring them into their new congregations, may not that Independent MiniÅ¿ter, without any marvilous anticipation or miÅ¿take, or without any error, truly be Å¿aid to have added Å¿o many more to his new

church, when the number of his members is thus increaÅ¿ed? And if another MiniÅ¿ter be joyned with him as a teacher in that congregation or Å¿ucced him, if he alÅ¿o Å¿hall run plundering about both city and country, as a gifted brother, and bring in a great many more poore Å¿illy Å¿heepe into his fold then the other did, as they are notable cunning theeves, may not it truly be Å¿aid of him and that without any marvilous anticipation, and miÅ¿take, that he alÅ¿o added unto the church, when Å¿till the the number is daily increaÅ¿ed? I am confident that all men of Å¿ound reaÅ¿on will Å¿ay there is no error in all this! And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope by all the judicious I Å¿hall be free from any blame or error, in that I Å¿aid thoÅ¿e that were converted by ChriÅ¿t and made DiÅ¿ciples by his MiniÅ¿try, were added to the church and to thoÅ¿e that were formerly converted by the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t.</hi> But Å¿aith <hi>J.

And therefore taking <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> Synecdochically as I then did, it is alÅ¿o here to be Å¿o taken, and then ChriÅ¿t did make mo DiÅ¿ciples out of the people of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> that remained yet unconverted, then <hi>Iohn</hi> had done before him, and added them unto the church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem,</hi> that particular mother church in that Nationall church, which as it was at that time in reÅ¿pect of morall worÅ¿hip go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernd by a Colledge of Elders or Presbyters as the Scripture everywhere relateth, which is called a church, Å¿o it was ever after governed by a Presbytery, all thoÅ¿e Synagogues and Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall churches being all combind together under the rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of that Presbytery, and making all but one church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its precinct, after which manner all the other city churches throught <hi>Iudea</hi> following the example of this mother church were ever to be governed to the end of the world; and this is indeed the true chuch mould, according to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, that all churches ought to be caÅ¿t into, if we will imitate the government of the mother church <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and all the daughter churches both in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> as that of <hi>Samaria</hi> and into this mould did the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> caÅ¿t all they converted. Therefore when I Å¿aid <hi>that ChriÅ¿t made more DiÅ¿ciples in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem then</hi> Iohn, <hi>and that he added them unto that Church,</hi> I Å¿peake nothing but that I have warrant for out of the good Word of God and the Scripture of truth, and which is Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently backt and corroborated alÅ¿o by all Å¿ound reaÅ¿on: And therefore, it is wickedneÅ¿Å¿e in I.<hi>S.</hi> to Å¿ay that in Å¿o Å¿peaking it is a paradox.

               <p>Now for the following Arguments, by which I proved it was much more impoÅ¿Å¿ible for them to meet together, after there were daily added Å¿o many thouÅ¿ands to the Church after ChriÅ¿ts AÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion by the miracles and MiniÅ¿try of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles, and ChriÅ¿ts Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples, and the other MiniÅ¿ters of thoÅ¿e times: <hi>I.

Å¿aith S. <hi>Peter, of theÅ¿e men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord IeÅ¿us went in and out among us, beginning from the baptiÅ¿me of Iohn, unto that Å¿ame day he was taken up from us, muÅ¿t one be ordained to be a witneÅ¿Å¿e with us of the reÅ¿urrection. And they appointed two, &amp;c. and they prayed, &amp;c. and they gave forth the Lots<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. all buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es here were managed and carryed in an AriÅ¿tocraticall and Presbyterian way, and all was done by a joynt conÅ¿ent and the common councell of them all. Here wee finde none of the multitude of the people, though Beleevers; here were no Women that gave forth their lots. Neither doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿ay, Men, Mothers, and Brethren; or Men, Women, and Brethren; or Men, Brethren, and SiÅ¿ters; but <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> For howÅ¿oever in the foregoing VerÅ¿es it is Å¿aid, <hi>that theÅ¿e</hi> (meaning the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders) <hi>all continued with one accord in prayer and Å¿upplication, with the women, and Mary the Mother of JeÅ¿us, and with his Brethren,</hi> by which they fitted themÅ¿elves for the MiniÅ¿tery after they Å¿hould receive the Holy GhoÅ¿t; though I Å¿ay, they joyned with them in thoÅ¿e duties of humiliation and prayer, which any women may do, in the Å¿ociety and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of godly MiniÅ¿ters: yet when they went about other acts of Church government, as chooÅ¿ing of an ApoÅ¿tle, then the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders onely by themÅ¿elves, to whom the power of the Keyes was given, ordered that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, and left the Women to their private devotions, and their Å¿everall imployments: for in this action of giving forth their lots, there is no mention of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And it is manifeÅ¿t from the Text it Å¿elfe, that this chooÅ¿ing of <hi>Matthias</hi> was at another time, and without all doubt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Å¿et day for this purpoÅ¿e; for it is Å¿aid VerÅ¿e 15. <hi>And in thoÅ¿e dayes Peter Å¿tood up in the middest of the DiÅ¿ciples, and Å¿aid Men and Brethren.</hi> Here was onely DiÅ¿ciples, Men and Brethren, and no SiÅ¿ters. Till Pope <hi>Joans</hi> time, and our dayes, <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes never hung at any womans Girdle; and we heare not in Scripture that they had any voyce in chooÅ¿ing of Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>officers, and admi ting of members into the Church, or caÅ¿ting out of any, till theÅ¿e unhappy times; an uÅ¿urpation not beÅ¿eeming that Sex, as afterwards in its due place I hope to make appear. But this by the way.</p>
               <p>Now to the matter in hand, I Å¿ay it is apparent to any that will not Å¿hut their eyes, that all thoÅ¿e, or moÅ¿t of them that were in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48122:142"/>
                  <hi>Peters</hi> company, and at that time met together, were capable of an ApoÅ¿tleÅ¿hip, and Å¿uch as were the moÅ¿t eminent of all ChriÅ¿ts followers, and Å¿uch as were beÅ¿t inÅ¿tructed in ChriÅ¿tian Religion, as having been bred up in the doctrine of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> and under the MiniÅ¿try of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of his Church; and therefore they were the Teachers of the Church and people, who were their flock which they all fed in common: And from thence it argueth, <hi>That the multitude of Beleevers in IeruÅ¿alem was not onely a diÅ¿tinct company from them, but that it was exceeding great and numerous, that had Å¿o many PaÅ¿tors and Teachers over them:</hi> For if they had been but Å¿o Å¿mall a company as is here mentioned, and that the whole Church had conÅ¿iÅ¿ted but of Å¿ixÅ¿core names, then the PaÅ¿tors exceed the number of the flocke; which is not onely abÅ¿urd to thinke, but againÅ¿t the evident truth of the holy Scriptures, which relate unto us multitudes upon multitudes <hi>that were day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted by the miniÅ¿tery of</hi> John <hi>the</hi> BaptiÅ¿t, <hi>and of ChriÅ¿t and his Apostles, and added unto the Church before this their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that by this I have now Å¿aid, it is moÅ¿t clear and evident, that all or moÅ¿t of theÅ¿e, were the moÅ¿t eminent MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pell, and the Presbytery of the Church. But in this, that our Brethren do acknowledge, <hi>That this aÅ¿Å¿embly here spake of were the church,</hi> it makes as much againÅ¿t them, and greatly for us: for it is manifeÅ¿t<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> from the Text, that they were the MiniÅ¿ters and Preachers of the GoÅ¿pell, and in that they give them the name and title of the Church, it followeth that the repreÅ¿entative body and Presbytery is a Church, and that to them onely belongs the power and authority of the Keyes: according to that of our Saviour in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 17, 18. <hi>Tell it unto the Church, &amp;c. and whatÅ¿oever ye binde on Earth Å¿hall be bound in Heaven; and whatÅ¿oever ye looÅ¿e on Earth Å¿hall be looÅ¿ed in Heaven.</hi> By which words, all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is put into the true MiniÅ¿ters hands; Å¿o that they onely have the power and authority of ordaining PaÅ¿tors and Presbyters among themÅ¿elves; as <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿ufficiently declares in his EpiÅ¿tles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> and that they have not onely the title of the Church, but a Charter and Warrant alÅ¿o granted unto them of ruling and governing the Church, and of ordaining Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and that by joynt and common conÅ¿ent among themÅ¿elves,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48122:143"/>
without the helpe and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the people and congregations under them, which by God were never joyned in commiÅ¿Å¿ion with them.</p>
               <p>And howÅ¿oever <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 6. for the taking away the Å¿candall in going to Law before unbeleevers, gave them liberty to make choyce of Å¿omethat were <hi>leaÅ¿t eÅ¿teemed in the Church, for the deciding of their controverÅ¿ies;</hi> yet that did not authorize them to make choyce of all other Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; for he limits them <hi>to go no farther then to the choyce of Å¿uch as are of leaÅ¿t eÅ¿teeme.</hi> And howÅ¿oever likewiÅ¿e, the ApoÅ¿tles in the 6. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> to free themÅ¿elves from all impediments, that they might the better attend upon their MiniÅ¿teries, and that without interruption they might Preach the GoÅ¿pell, gave them liberty to chuÅ¿e their Decons and DeconeÅ¿Å¿es: yet they preÅ¿cribe the Rule by which they Å¿hall chuÅ¿e them, and keep the authority of ordaining them Å¿till in their own hands: <hi>Looke you out among you,</hi> Å¿ay they, <hi>men of honest report, full of the holy GhoÅ¿t, and wiÅ¿edome, whom we may appoint over this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and when they had choÅ¿e Å¿uch, Å¿aith the Scripture, <hi>They put them before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</hi> So that howÅ¿oever they gave unto them a Liberty to chuÅ¿e, yet it was with limitation, not an abÅ¿olute liberty; for if they had choÅ¿e men that had not been of <hi>approved honeÅ¿ty, well gifted, and wiÅ¿e, and qualified as they appointed,</hi> it was arbitrary in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles to reject their choyce; for they keep the power of Ordination Å¿till in their own hands, and to them it did belong to ratifie their Election; Å¿o that the people had not the power of Ordination then, nor have not to this day, no not of the meaneÅ¿t Deacon or DeaconeÅ¿Å¿e, that belongs onely unto the Presbytery, much leÅ¿Å¿e have they power of ordaining Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Indeed for the deciding of controverÅ¿ies and differences, they have a liberty given them of making choiÅ¿e of Å¿ome petty men amongÅ¿t them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and that they may do without the Presbytery; but they have no power of Ordination. Neither did I ever yet read in the Sacred Scriptures that the people or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation had any hand at all in chooÅ¿ing of MiniÅ¿ters and PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, neither were they fit for that imployment; for it is one thing to judge of mans externall carriage and manners, and another thing of his Å¿ufficiency for his indowments and abilities
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48122:143"/>
of learning, and that men of learning and knowledge onely can do, and the Sons of the Prophets; and it is in Å¿peciall given in charge to the Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters, as it is manifeÅ¿t in the EpiÅ¿tles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. And they onely know how rightly to examine them, in the knowledge of the tongues and Sciences, and Å¿uch Arts as are requiÅ¿ite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides the knowledge of the holy Scripture; all which are little enough for the making of a MiniÅ¿ter compleat and fit for that Sacred imployment. And all the Primitive Churches in the ApoÅ¿tles times willingly Å¿ubmitted themÅ¿elves to what the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery then did, and aÅ¿Å¿ented to their choyce, as in the 14. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verÅ¿. 23. it appeareth.</p>
               <p>But I Å¿ay, in that our brethren do acknowledge this company this hundred and twenty names, to be a church, and in that it is alÅ¿o Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeÅ¿t, that they are conÅ¿idered in a diÅ¿tinct notion from the people, which alÅ¿o in the holy Scriptures, when they are joyned with their MiniÅ¿ters, are called a church (as is frequently to be Å¿een through the acts of the ApoÅ¿tles) and in that it doth abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by what hath formerly been Å¿poken, and will yet in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diÅ¿courÅ¿e be farther elucidated, <hi>that there were many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies of beleevers in the Church of</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>and that they were all governed by the joynt conÅ¿ent and Common Councell of the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters, to whom the ApoÅ¿tles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves were Å¿ubject; who were Å¿ent this way and that way by their direction, and to whom they were to give an account of their MiniÅ¿tery,</hi> as we Å¿ee in divers places in the <hi>Acts, and were ordered by them, what they Å¿hould do, and alÅ¿o made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals unto the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters in any buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concernment:</hi> I Å¿ay, in all theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects, it is evident, <hi>That the Church of</hi> IeruÅ¿alem <hi>conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, and was yet but one Church, and that governed by a Presbyterian Government, and by a Common Councell of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters, to whoÅ¿e order all the Å¿everall Congregation were to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themÅ¿elves;</hi> And therefore this their Argument maketh much againÅ¿t them and greatly for us. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wered to this their firÅ¿t Objection; which, to Å¿peak the truth, is that that carrieth the moÅ¿t appearance of any Argument they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to prove their AÅ¿Å¿ertion and tenent: for all their other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raiÅ¿ed from the Å¿everall meetings of the ApoÅ¿tles and people,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48122:144"/>
and from the multitude comming to them about the ordaining of Deacons, by which they would perÅ¿wade the world, <hi>That the company of Believers in the Church of</hi> IeruÅ¿alem <hi>was not Å¿o numerous at any time, but that they might all meete in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or in one place, to partake of in acts of worÅ¿hip;</hi> they conÅ¿iÅ¿t moÅ¿t of them in Homonymies, and meere ParalogiÅ¿mes, which indeed beÅ¿eeme not the gravity of reverend men, and in the weighty matters of Divinity, would be undecent in a Å¿ucking SophiÅ¿ter; and therefore are much more blameworthy in them, who by Å¿uch fallacies labour to amuÅ¿e the people, to the diÅ¿tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the whole Church and Kingdome, and alienating the affections of Brethren one from another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Å¿hall briefly runne over them.</hi> Acts <hi>2. 46. where it is related,</hi> that the Believers and new Converts continued daily with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e. <hi>From theÅ¿e words the Brethren conclude,</hi> That the multitude of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was not Å¿o great<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but that they might all meete in one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and in one place, to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip; <hi>for here in expreÅ¿Å¿e words, the place where they met is Å¿pecified, and it is Å¿aid</hi> to be the Temple. <hi>I appeale to the wiÅ¿dome of any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, or but of a rationall ChriÅ¿tian, whether this be a candid or ingenuous way of arguing;</hi> That becauÅ¿e <hi>3000.</hi> ChriÅ¿tians that were newly converted might meet together in the Temple of JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that believed in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> that were converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> and all that believed by ChriÅ¿ts miniÅ¿tery and miracles, and all that were converted by the ApoÅ¿tles, and the Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples before ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ufferings, and all that were after his ReÅ¿urrection converted for twenty years together, by the MiniÅ¿try of all the ApoÅ¿tles, and all the other MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pell, they might yet all meete in any one place or Congregation, to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip, and to edification. <hi>I refer this, I Å¿ay, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration of any Learned man, or any intelligible</hi> ChriÅ¿tian, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be an ingenuous way of arguing. I believe if one Å¿hould argue againÅ¿t them after the Å¿ame manner, they would laugh at him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If one Å¿hould thus diÅ¿pute;</hi> Within theÅ¿e Å¿even years, all the Independents continued daily with one accord in Å¿uch a place, and they all met together in one congregation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is but one congregation, and but one Church Å¿till of Indeperdents in <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:48122:144"/>
and they all meet together in one congregation. <hi>Would not the Brethren make themÅ¿elves as merry with Å¿uch a way of diÅ¿pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as they have made others Å¿ad with their way of arguing? yes doubleÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, their way of arguing is not to their owne honour, to Å¿peake but favourably of it, as will appeare. For Å¿hould I grant unto them, that at that time this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Å¿peakes of, there had beene no more Believers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> but thoÅ¿e hundred and twenty names Å¿pecified in the firÅ¿t Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and theÅ¿e three thouÅ¿and new Converts; and accord alÅ¿o unto them, <hi>that all theÅ¿e did meet together in on place, and in one congregation, and did partake in all the Ordinances, which notwithÅ¿tanding</hi> I cannot grant them, for divers reaÅ¿ons: for in the Å¿ame place it is Å¿aid, <hi>That although they continued daily in the Temple, yet they brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e;</hi> that is to Å¿ay, Å¿ome of them did daily meet to hear the Word in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then followed their Å¿everall imployments, and others in private, and they had the holy Communion or Sacrament in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall houÅ¿es; from which it is manifeÅ¿tly evident, that then when there were newly added to the Church but three thouÅ¿and Believers, they had many and Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and without all doubt as the multitudes of Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿ed, they were Å¿till diÅ¿tributed into more congregations: for it is Å¿aid, <hi>They brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e;</hi> that is, <hi>they had their aÅ¿Å¿emblies and meetings in Å¿everall houÅ¿es and places, beÅ¿ides the Temple<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> and in thoÅ¿e Å¿everall houÅ¿es, they had not only <hi>the preaching of the Word and Prayer, but the adminiÅ¿tration of the Sacrament, and communicated in all the Ordinances;</hi> which they could not do in the Temple, as afterward will appeare: and all that I now Å¿ay is evident from the 41. VerÅ¿e of the Å¿ame Chapter to the 47.</p>
               <p>But I Å¿ay, Å¿hould I Å¿ilence my own reaÅ¿on, and Å¿uffer it to Å¿peake nothing; and Å¿hould I grantto our Brethren, <hi>that there were but three thouÅ¿and, and that theÅ¿e three thouÅ¿and Believers might all meet in one congregation, and partake in all the ordinances to edification:</hi> would it follow, that when ten thouÅ¿and were added unto them, and twenty thouÅ¿and more to them, and thirty thouÅ¿and more to all theÅ¿e; would any may think or believe, that ten thouÅ¿and men can <hi>meete in one congregation to edifie, and to partake in</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:48122:145"/>
                  <hi>all the Ordinances,</hi> much leÅ¿Å¿e when there is Å¿o many thouÅ¿ands more added to them, <hi>that they could Å¿till meete in any one place or congregation?</hi> I thinke no man that hath not abdicated his underÅ¿tanding will Å¿o conclude. So that all men may Å¿ee, not onely the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of this argumentation, but the Å¿trength of truth: For this very weapon with which they had thought to have defended themÅ¿elves, and wounded the Truth, they wound themÅ¿elves, and overthrow their own tenent; as God willing, I Å¿hall more fully by and by make appear.</p>
               <p>But out of Chap. 5. our Brethren conceive they have a very Å¿trong and invincible Argument: where it is related, <hi>That after</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Saphira <hi>were miraculouÅ¿ly taken away, for lying unto the Spirit of God;</hi> It is Å¿aid, <hi>That great feare came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard theÅ¿e things. And by the hands of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles were many Å¿ignes and wonders wrought among the people, and they were all with one accord in</hi> Solomons Porch. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Å¿ay, they, the number of Believers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> was not Å¿o great, <hi>but that they might all meet together in one congregation;</hi> for the place where they did meet, is Å¿et downe, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Solomons Porch:</hi> and it is further Å¿pecified, <hi>That they were all with one accord in that place.</hi> This is their Argument faithfully and truly Å¿et downe, and with the beÅ¿t advantage for their cauÅ¿e. But to Å¿peake the truth, this kinde of arguing hath no force in it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> neither doth it beÅ¿eem grave men, to trifle thus, in the matters of God and Religion. For Å¿hould I grant unto them, that all the Beleivers that then were in <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and had been converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> and by ChriÅ¿t, and all his DiÅ¿ciples, before the PaÅ¿Å¿ion and Sufferings of the Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t; and the three thouÅ¿and converted by the firÅ¿t Miracle and Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> after they had received the gift of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and the five thouÅ¿and after by the Å¿econd Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Sermon, and after the new additions of Å¿o many multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Believers both of men and women, by reaÅ¿on of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle wrought upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his Wife; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miracles that the fifth Chapter Å¿peaketh of; Å¿hould I Å¿ay, grant that all theÅ¿e might yet have met in one place, and in any one congregation to communicate in all the Ordinances, which all reaÅ¿on forbids me to yeild to; will it follow, that when there were additions upon additions, and that of multitudes of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they might Å¿till meet in any one congregation to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48122:145"/>
and have communicated in all acts of worÅ¿hip? For in all reaÅ¿on we may conceive, had we no teÅ¿timony out of the holy Scripture to back it, that if eight thouÅ¿and were converted beÅ¿ides multitudes both of Men and Women, with a few Miracles and Sermons: and if at the firÅ¿t Preaching of the GoÅ¿pell after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection there was Å¿uch a great encreaÅ¿e, and Å¿uch a multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ChriÅ¿tians; all underÅ¿tanding, I Å¿ay, perÅ¿wades, that in the Å¿pace of twenty years, there will be innumerable multitudes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded daily to the Church, when the miraculous working of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with the Å¿ame doctrine Å¿till continued<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and with all, the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on will dictate to any man, <hi>That then the whole multitude of all thoÅ¿e Believers could not all meete together in one place, and in one congregation for edification, to communicate in all Ordinances.</hi> So that any judicious man, without the help of any great Schoole-learning, may perceive the invalidity and vanity of Å¿uch argumentations.</p>
               <p>And truly were it not that they are Brethren, and that I deÅ¿ire in the Å¿pirit of meekneÅ¿Å¿e to deale with them, I would have made it appear, that it is Å¿o poore a way of diÅ¿puting, that it did not beÅ¿eeme men of gravity, much leÅ¿Å¿e of learning; and that there were many wayes to evade the dint of Å¿uch reaÅ¿oning, and to prove the nothingneÅ¿Å¿e of the Argument, and that by the words of the Text: the people there Å¿pake of, to be in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Porch,</hi> are to be limited and confined within the number of thoÅ¿e that were converted by the laÅ¿t miracle, and Å¿ome other new miracles of the ApoÅ¿tles, which they were then wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in <hi>Solomons Porch;</hi> for there is the place where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles and they were together; and I doe acknowledge, that as many as were then, and at that time, in <hi>Solomons Porch</hi> with the ApoÅ¿tles, were of one accord. But doth this with any rationall man conclude, that every Believer in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> both Men and Women and all the ChriÅ¿tians &amp; DiÅ¿ciples in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> were then together in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> and in one Congregation? I am confident that no wiÅ¿e man will thinke Å¿o; for without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverÅ¿ie there were then Å¿uch multitudes of Believers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> as neither many Porches nor many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples could have contained their bodies, <hi>much leÅ¿Å¿e could they have all met in any one congregation to edifie.</hi> But I Å¿ay I will not deale with Brethren Å¿o rigidly as I might, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48122:146"/>
wave many things that I might juÅ¿tly here utter.</p>
               <p>But grant it were Å¿o, that now in the beginning of the ChriÅ¿tian, church and if I may Å¿o Å¿peake in the infancy of it, <hi>That all the Believers then in IeruÅ¿alem might all meet together in one place;</hi> doth it follow that they might ever Å¿o doe in Å¿ucceeding times, when there was Å¿uch infinite increaÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿tians daily added to the church? all reaÅ¿on wil contradict that aÅ¿Å¿ertion. Within this Å¿even yeares, as all men know, one place and congregation would have contained all the Independents; but will one place now or ten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them? And there is no man as I conceive will deny, but that the ApoÅ¿tles and thoÅ¿e Primitive MiniÅ¿ters, had another manner of converting faculty then our Brethen; for the ApoÅ¿tles as it is well known did not build upon others foundations; yea, they took it as a diÅ¿paragement unto them; for Å¿o Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 15. of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> v. 20. affirmeth. Now our Brethren they build upon others foundations, and gather the Å¿heep, and them the good and the fat Å¿heep, with good fleeces on their backs; yea, the Velvit-Å¿heep, and the PluÅ¿h-Å¿heepe, and the Sattin and Taffity-Å¿heep, out of other Sheepheards folds; and while they Å¿eeme to gather Churches, they Å¿catter them, and the poorÅ¿heep.</p>
               <p>But I will proceed to the other Argument out of the Å¿ixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is related, <hi>That when the number of the DiÅ¿ciples was multiplyed</hi> (here we may take notice of multiplication) <hi>There aroÅ¿e a murmuring of the Greeks againÅ¿t the Hebrews, becauÅ¿e the widdows were neglected in the daily miniÅ¿tration. And the ApoÅ¿tles called the multitude of the DiÅ¿ciples unto them, and gave them liberty to chooÅ¿e their Deacons, and it pleaÅ¿ed the whole multitude,</hi> Å¿aith the Scripture. From thence our brethren conclude, <hi>That all the beleevers in the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>came here together to the ApoÅ¿tles, and were then no more then could all meete in one congregation:</hi> as if our brethren Å¿hould thus argue; As the wheel-barrow goes rumble, rumble, even Å¿o is Prelaticall EpiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy better then the Presbyterian Government. But to be Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: Should I grant unto the Brethren, <hi>That at this time, all the beleevers that were in the Church of</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>did then come together, and were all in one place, and might meet in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;</hi> doth it follow, when there was a dayly increaÅ¿e of more beleevers, and that of multitudes of them (as this very chapter Å¿ignifies) that then alÅ¿o they <hi>might all meete together in</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48122:146"/>
                  <hi>one place or in one congregation in Å¿ucceeding ages?</hi> I Å¿uppoÅ¿e no man will think or believe Å¿o But I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s, that I cannot grant unto them, that by the multitude of beleevers here Å¿pake of, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood every individuall ChriÅ¿tian, or the greateÅ¿t part of them, much leÅ¿Å¿e that all the whole body of them came together, and that for warrantable reaÅ¿on to the contrary. For the controverÅ¿ie and murmuring here Å¿poken of, was not among all the DiÅ¿ciples and beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> but onely between two Nations of them, <hi>viz.</hi> between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Now we are informed out of the Å¿econd of the <hi>Acts</hi> verÅ¿e 5. <hi>That there were dwelling in IeruÅ¿alem Iews, devout men, out of every Nation under heaven:</hi> for Å¿o in expreÅ¿Å¿e words, it is Å¿aid, of the which the <hi>Greeks</hi> were but one Nation, and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> another. So that all the ChriÅ¿tians and Beleevers of all the other Nations, were of one minde, and in good accord among themÅ¿elves, as the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters tell, and were at peace one with another, Å¿o that there was no murmuring amongÅ¿t them, nor no controverÅ¿ie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or variance, and they all continued quiet in their Å¿everall houÅ¿es, and lived in love, and were none of that multitude here Å¿poken of: Å¿o that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, by the multitude in this place, we are to underÅ¿tand the <hi>Greeks</hi> onely and the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> for Å¿o in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿e words it is Å¿pecified: and this every rationall man can eaÅ¿ily perceive.</p>
               <p>Againe, by multitude here is to be underÅ¿tood not a confuÅ¿ed company going in a tumultuous way, but a conÅ¿iderable number of rationall men of each differing and diÅ¿Å¿enting party, and Å¿uch as were called and Å¿ent for by the ApoÅ¿tles, as it is commonly Å¿een in thoÅ¿e that go by way of complaint to petition to any councell, they Å¿end a competent multitude of underÅ¿tanding and able men, to grace their cauÅ¿e and to mannage the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e: and not every particular and individuall perÅ¿on, men and women to negotiate it, which could not be without mighty confuÅ¿ion, which was not in this multitude: and therefore <hi>by multitude and the whole multitude,</hi> we are to underÅ¿tand, that both thoÅ¿e parties that came to negotiate this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, were well Å¿atisfied with the ApoÅ¿tles Order, and they obeyed it: but from hence if any man would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and conclude, <hi>That every one of the beleeving Hebrews, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individuall beleeving Greek, that was then in IeruÅ¿alem, and that all the Greek Church and all the Hebrew Church, both men and</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:48122:147"/>
                  <hi>women, not one perÅ¿on excepted were all in one place together before the ApoÅ¿tles;</hi> the whole world would judg, that this man thatÅ¿hould thus argue, were very much craÅ¿ed in his brain: but much more would it argue a great imbecillity of wit and judgment in any one, to conclude, <hi>That all the beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem were there:</hi> And unleÅ¿Å¿e they can Å¿o conclude, the Argument is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoÅ¿e, nor of any validity to evince and prove the AÅ¿Å¿ertion of our brethren. But if I Å¿hould yeeld unto the brethren, theÅ¿e two things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the firÅ¿t, <hi>That all the beleeving Greeks and all the beleeving Hebrews, none excepted, were all before the ApoÅ¿tles in one place:</hi> yet Å¿till this will follow, that all the beleevers of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Å¿everall Nation were not in this multitude and number: for they had nothing to do in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, for they were no parties; Å¿o that the Argument is nothing to the purpoÅ¿e, but a meer fallacy to delude unÅ¿table Å¿oules, and to make them beleeve that bladders are Lanthorns.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Å¿hould I grant unto the brethren, that by <hi>multitude here, and by the whole multitude,</hi> all the beleevers then in <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> were to be underÅ¿tood, <hi>and that then they might all meet in one congregation:</hi> doth it therefore follow, that many years after, when there was dayly Å¿uch additions of multitudes of Beleevers, <hi>that they might all Å¿till meet together in one place, and in one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for all acts of worÅ¿hip, and to be edified?</hi> I beleeve our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren themÅ¿elves the Independents will not grant it; yet they muÅ¿t grant it if they will Å¿tand to their principles.</p>
               <p>But from this murmuring between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> I, with very good reaÅ¿on, can frame an Argument to overthrow our Brethrens Tenent, and may from thence gather, <hi>That in the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>there were many and Å¿everall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where they had all acts of worÅ¿hip;</hi> and that every Å¿everall nation had their Å¿everall congregations and Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies, where they might heare the Word of God in their own language and to edification, and communicate in all Ordinances with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For if there Å¿hould ariÅ¿e a controverÅ¿ie in <hi>London,</hi> between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> about points of Religion, or about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other matter of practice concerning Religion; and they Å¿hould all apply themÅ¿elves to the grave and learned AÅ¿Å¿embly for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ion of it; would not all men gather that there were two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct congregations of them in the City? So it may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48122:147"/>
againÅ¿t our Brethren, that every Å¿everall Nation of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> had their Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies apart, (as well as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Hebrewes)</hi> where they might partake in all Ordinances to edification, and underÅ¿tand their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters Preaching to them in their owne language. As for my part, I verily beleeve it was Å¿o, and from warrantable reaÅ¿ons: and yet <hi>all theÅ¿e Å¿everall congregations made but one Church, and were under one Presbyterie:</hi> and for this my beliefe I Å¿hall give my reaÅ¿ons in the enÅ¿uing diÅ¿courÅ¿e. But had there beene but one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> Å¿o many thouÅ¿and Believers as the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates there was, <hi>could not all have met in one place, and in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as all reaÅ¿on will perÅ¿wade.</hi> So that all the Arguments of our brethren to the contrary, are but as Å¿o many Squibs which onely make a noiÅ¿e, and then vaniÅ¿h in the ayre; to Å¿ay no more.</p>
               <p>And theÅ¿e are the moÅ¿t rationall objections that as yet I ever heard from them, to the which I have briefly given my Å¿everall anÅ¿wers, which I hope by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance I Å¿hall ever be able to make good againÅ¿t them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now I will goe on to prove,</hi> That by the miniÅ¿try of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles, and the divers miracles daily wrought by them, after they had received the gifts of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, there were Å¿uch additions of multitudes of Believers to thoÅ¿e that were converted by Saint <hi>John</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> and our Saviour and his DiÅ¿ciples, before the death of <hi>John</hi> and the Å¿ufferings of our Saviour, that they could not all meet at any one time and in one place or congregation, to partake in all Ordinances; no, nor in a few; but were of neceÅ¿Å¿ity forced to be diÅ¿tributed into Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations, and that before the PerÅ¿ecution, under the PerÅ¿ecution, and after the PerÅ¿ecution. <hi>And for proving of what I lay downe, which is Å¿till but the firÅ¿t concluÅ¿ion I undertooke to make good, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the firÅ¿t eight Chapters of the</hi> Acts, <hi>and then goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the enÅ¿uing Å¿tory of the Å¿ame Booke in order, to prove my aÅ¿Å¿ertion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it is related how the holy ApoÅ¿tles imployed themÅ¿elves in their Å¿everal MiniÅ¿teries, after they had received the gifts of the holy GhoÅ¿t, &amp; were indued with all power of working miracles, and had received the gifts alÅ¿o of tongues and languages; and the effects alÅ¿o of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿try, preaching, and miracles, are there Å¿et downe at large: and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48122:148"/>
it is Å¿pecified, that by meanes of that firÅ¿t miracle, when all the people of Å¿everall Nations heard the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿peak to them, every one in their Å¿everall tongues and languages (who were very well knowne to bee <hi>Galileans)</hi> that they were amazed to heare the wonderfull Works of God, and from their amazement it is Å¿aid, they gave attention to the Sermon of <hi>Peter;</hi> the Sermon it Å¿elfe being there Å¿et downe, and the effect of it, which was, <hi>That when they had heard it, they were prickt in their heart, and Å¿aid unto</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>and the reÅ¿t of the ApoÅ¿tles, Men and Brethren, what Å¿hall we do? Then</hi> Peter <hi>Å¿aid unto them, Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, for the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins; and yee Å¿hall receive the gift of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, &amp;c. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the Å¿ame day were added unto them about three thouÅ¿and Å¿oules. And they continued Å¿tedfaÅ¿t in the ApoÅ¿tles Doctrine and fellowÅ¿hip, and in breaking of bread, and prayer; And feare came upon every Å¿oule: and many Å¿ignes and wonders were done by the ApoÅ¿tles: and all that believed were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had all things common: and they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, did eat their meat with gladneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿ingleneÅ¿Å¿e of heart, prayÅ¿ing God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the Church daily Å¿uch as Å¿hould be Å¿aved.</hi> Here wee Å¿ee, that by vertue of one Miracle and Sermon (God working with them) were added to the Believers, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> and ChriÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿ciples had converted, and Å¿uch as were formerly baptized, <hi>three thouÅ¿and more;</hi> a great Miracle: all which, with the many other that were converted afterward are called <hi>but one Church.</hi> For it is expreÅ¿ly Å¿aid, that the <hi>Lord added to the Church daily Å¿uch as Å¿hould be Å¿aved.</hi> We heard of the great multitudes, and of a world of Å¿uch as beleeved in ChriÅ¿t, before this Miracle and Sermon. And can any man in reaÅ¿on conceive, <hi>that all theÅ¿e could meet in any one place or congregation, to partake in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip?</hi> But let us goe on. In the 3. and 4. Chapter, by means of that Miracle that was wrought upon the Impotent Man, who was knowne to all the people to have bin a Cripple from his Mothers wombe, and through the powerfull preaching of <hi>Peter,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>them to repent and to be converted, that their Å¿innes might be blotted out, when the time of refreÅ¿hing Å¿hould come from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> It is Å¿aid, <hi>that many which heard the word</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:48122:148"/>
                  <hi>believed;</hi> and the number of thoÅ¿e new Believers is there Å¿pecified to be about five thouÅ¿and men, which were alÅ¿o added unto the Church, and joyned to all the former Beleevers; Å¿o that wee have here eight thouÅ¿and new Members added unto the Church, in a very little time: and this was a greater Miracle then the former. So that the PropheÅ¿ie in the 110. <hi>PÅ¿alme,</hi> verÅ¿e 3. was now fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; <hi>That in the day of ChriÅ¿ts power, his willing people from the wombe of the morning Å¿hould be multiplied as the Dew upon the Earth.</hi> And which is not tobe paÅ¿Å¿ed by without due notice, It is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed by the beÅ¿t Interpreters, and the moÅ¿t orthodoxe Writers, (and there is good reaÅ¿on for it) that theÅ¿e new Converts were <hi>Men,</hi> not <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children.</hi> And without doubt, theÅ¿e new Believers endeavoured to convert their Wives, Children, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Neighbours: and there is good reaÅ¿on alÅ¿o why wee Å¿hould be induced to beleeve, that Truth, with Å¿uch wonders and miracles annexed to it, Å¿hould be as prevalent to convert Women, Children, Servants, and Neighbours, and whole Families; as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and novelties, in theÅ¿e our dayes, are able to miÅ¿leade thoÅ¿e poore creatures, that are ever learning, and never come to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and the which are carried about with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and beleeve every new-borne truth (as they terme it) and follow every New Light, and every new-found way, though it tend to the confuÅ¿ion of the Church and Kingdome. It is Å¿aid <hi>of that man of Sin, that Sonne of Perdition, that hee Å¿hall come after the working of Satan, with all power and Å¿ignes and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneÅ¿Å¿e and unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h, becauÅ¿e they received not the love of the truth, that they might be Å¿aved,</hi> 2 <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 2. But to Å¿ee people <hi>Å¿o deluded without Miracles, is a Miracle.</hi> So that thoÅ¿e poore Women that are carried about with every wind of doctrine, from that truth that was taught by ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles, and confirmed by Å¿o many Miracles; and thoÅ¿e that doe and have miÅ¿-led them, have all of them a great deale to anÅ¿wer for. But this I Å¿peake by the way, conceiving that all thoÅ¿e new Converts would endeavour, as the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman did after her converÅ¿ion, not only to bring their Wives, Children, and Families, but their Neighbours alÅ¿o, and whole Cities to the Å¿ame faith. And I have that opinion alÅ¿o of all the Women and people of that Age, that they were as ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, as the Women and people of this Age and in theÅ¿e
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48122:149"/>
our times are to follow errors. But let us now Å¿ee what effects the other Miracles wrought upon the people that are related in the 5. C. as of <hi>Ananias &amp; Saphira</hi> his wife, who <hi>for tempting the Spirit of God, were both Å¿tricken downdead and gave up the GhoÅ¿t;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracles wrought by the ApoÅ¿tles. It is Å¿aid in VerÅ¿. 11. <hi>That fear came upon all the Church, and to as many as heard theÅ¿e things</hi> (&amp; that to the reÅ¿t, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees, the Maglinant party) <hi>durÅ¿t no man joyne himÅ¿elfe<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And Believers were added unto the Lord, multitudes, both of men and women:</hi> Here come in the good Women now. And in VerÅ¿e 26. it is Å¿aid, <hi>that the Captaine, with the Officers, brought the ApoÅ¿tles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence (for they feared the people, leaÅ¿t they Å¿hould have Å¿toned them.)</hi> It will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e briefly to take notice of the Å¿everall effects theÅ¿e Miracles wrought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ThefirÅ¿t is,</hi> That great fear of offending God came on all the Church, Gods own people; which notwithÅ¿tanding of the many additions of Believers is called Å¿till but one Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd</hi> That none durÅ¿t joyne themÅ¿elves to the contrary party, the PhariÅ¿aicall malignant crew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third,</hi> That Believers were added to the Church, and that multitudes, no Å¿mall companies both of Men and Women. <hi>Here is a new increaÅ¿e, and that a great one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth is,</hi> that the very Captain and Officers were awed and kept in feare, by reaÅ¿on of the multitude of Believers: Å¿o that thoÅ¿e that feared not God were afraid of his Å¿ervants. <hi>By which it may be gathered,</hi> That the party of Believers did ballance the number of the incredulous and PhariÅ¿acall party, if not by far exceed them, <hi>And therefore by all probability, muÅ¿t needs be an innumerable company and a mighty multitude; and Å¿uch a number</hi> as could not all meet in any one place or congregation, to partake in all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>And to Å¿ay nothing of the diverÅ¿ity of Tongues and Languages which were not given to the ApoÅ¿tles to be uÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e and of no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; nor to Å¿peake any thing of the <hi>divers Jewes that were then dwelling at</hi> JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>devout Men and Women, out of every Nation under Heaven;</hi> which notwithÅ¿tanding may be a Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument to prove, <hi>That they all had their Å¿everall meeting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and their Å¿everall MiniÅ¿ters to preach unto them in their Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Languages, that they might be edified. I Å¿ay, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48122:149"/>
to wave all this, let us take notice what is poÅ¿itively Å¿et down in the laÅ¿t VerÅ¿e of the fifth Chapter, that is, <hi>That the ApoÅ¿tles daily in the Temple and in every houÅ¿e, ceaÅ¿ed not to teach and preach JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t;</hi> That is to Å¿ay, they preached both publickly and privately, and the very places where they preached are Å¿et down, as in the Temple, and in every houÅ¿e. So that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, there muÅ¿t be Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies of Belivers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> according to that in the 2. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verÅ¿. the 46. where it Å¿aid, <hi>That they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking of bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e,</hi> which by all Interpreters is underÅ¿tood the adminiÅ¿tration of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and that the Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations were wont uÅ¿ually to meet in private houÅ¿es, is frequently mentiond in the holy Scriptures, as in the 16. of the <hi>Romanes</hi> verÅ¿e the 5. and in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> chap. 16. verÅ¿. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 14. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verÅ¿. 20. Å¿aith, <hi>That he kept back nothing that was profitable unto them, but taught them publikely and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e,</hi> Å¿o that they had their AÅ¿Å¿emblies as well private as publicke, even in the Church of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> where they did partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip; and in that Church alÅ¿o they had many PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and yet were but one Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now I will paÅ¿Å¿e on to the Å¿ixth chapter in the 1, 2, 3. and 7, verÅ¿es it is Å¿aid,</hi> That in thoÅ¿e dayes, when the number of DiÅ¿ciples was multiplyed, there aroÅ¿e a murmuring of the Grecians againÅ¿t the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, becauÅ¿e their widdows were neglected in their dayly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tration. Then the twelve called the multitude of the DiÅ¿ciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and Å¿aid, It is not reaÅ¿on that wee Å¿hould leave the Word of God and Å¿erve tables. Wherefore brethren looke you out among you Å¿even men of honeÅ¿t report, and full of the holy GhoÅ¿t and wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whom we may appoint over this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e. But we will give our Å¿elues contiunally to prayer and to the miniÅ¿tery of the Word, <hi>verÅ¿. 7.</hi> And the Word of God increaÅ¿ed, and the number of the DiÅ¿ciples multiplyed in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> greatly, and a great company of the PrieÅ¿ts were obedient unto the faith. <hi>In the which words, we may take notice briefly of theÅ¿e obÅ¿ervables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t, of the cunning and policy of the Devill, who when he cannot by all his wiles and Å¿tratagems aÅ¿Å¿ault the Church without, then he labours to aÅ¿Å¿aile it within, as here with civill diÅ¿cords and differences among brethren: and in other Churches in all ages even
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48122:150"/>
in, and from the ApoÅ¿tles times, by diÅ¿Å¿entions in opinions, by Sects, SchiÅ¿ms, Factions, and HereÅ¿ies; and by theÅ¿e his wiles and craft, he firÅ¿t bringeth in difference in opinion, and afterwards diverÅ¿ity of affection, and that among brethren; and all this he doth, that in fine, he may bring ruine upon them all. And thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> raiÅ¿ing a controverÅ¿ie between the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who complained <hi>That their widdows were neglected in the daily miniÅ¿tration;</hi> as either that they were not made DeaconeÅ¿Å¿es, as the widdows of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were, or that there was not an equall diÅ¿tribution of the Almes, according to the intention of the Church, <hi>who Å¿old their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions and goods to that end, that they might be parted to all men, as every one Å¿hould have need, Acts</hi> 2. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 44, 45. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 35.

               <p>The Å¿econd obÅ¿ervable, is, To whom the differing and diÅ¿Å¿enting parties did apply themÅ¿elves and appeal; <hi>and that was to the Presbytery or Colleage of ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> not to any one of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, but to the twelve; as in that difference at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 15. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas and certain other of the Brethren in the Church of</hi> Antioch <hi>appealed to the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters,</hi> and in both thoÅ¿e differences all the Churches Å¿ubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves <hi>to the ApoÅ¿tles Order, and that willingly:</hi> and this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ApoÅ¿tles, is the Rule for ordering of all controverÅ¿ies that all the reformed Churches Å¿et before them; deciding all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in Religion by the Word of God, and according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ident they have laid downe unto them, by the ApoÅ¿tles and PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem.</hi> Here I Å¿ay, the whole Presbytery and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ApoÅ¿tles determined the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e; neither do we reade, that the AÅ¿Å¿emblies of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> pretended their own Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent authority, though Å¿everall Congregations, or challenged a power within themÅ¿elves, of chooÅ¿ing their own Officers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of differences amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, or pleaded that they had Authority within themÅ¿elves, to make their own Laws by which they would be orderd, or that they challenged any Å¿uch priviledges unto themÅ¿elves, but they all appealed unto the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> as the Å¿upreameÅ¿t EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Court, and freely Å¿ubmitted themÅ¿elves to their arbitrement, and to the Order they Å¿et down, as the Å¿tory Å¿pecifieth.</p>

The third obÅ¿ervable is, the imployment in which the ApoÅ¿tles were all taken up, and the effect of it; and their imployment is Å¿aid <hi>to be continuing in prayer and the MiniÅ¿tery, and preaching of the Word;</hi> and the effect of this their MiniÅ¿tery was, <hi>That the Word of God increaÅ¿ed, and the number of the DiÅ¿ciples multiplyed in JeruÅ¿alem greatly, and a great company of the PrieÅ¿ts were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the faith.</hi> By all which it is moÅ¿t apparent, that Å¿uch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes being dayly added to the Church, and where there was Å¿uch variety of teachers, and Å¿o many ApoÅ¿tles, and all of them taken up in preaching; and where there was Å¿o many different Nations, and Å¿uch diverÅ¿ities of tongues and languages as was in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem, they could not all meet together at any one time, or in any one place to edification, and that they might all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in all the Ordinances, but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, if they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde confuÅ¿ion;</hi> and all that I now Å¿peak is evident by the very light of Nature and all reaÅ¿on; and therefore it followeth, <hi>That there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblyes and Congregations in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>and yet all made but one Church, and that that Church was PreÅ¿byteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly governed.</hi> But that I may make this truth more evidently yet appear, I will firÅ¿t out the former diÅ¿courÅ¿e frame Å¿everall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then go on to the enÅ¿uing hiÅ¿tory.

               <p>For the <hi>Major</hi> it is Å¿o evident, that I cannot beleeve that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rationall man will deny it: for who yet did ever Å¿ee an AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of above ten thouÅ¿and people in any one place or Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that could partake in all the Ordinances to edification?</hi> Yea, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this, is to fight againÅ¿t common reaÅ¿on and dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

               <p>This Argument, is Å¿o well grounded upon the Scripture of truth, and corroborated alÅ¿o with Å¿uch Å¿olid reaÅ¿ons as it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing, that there Å¿hould bee any man now living in theÅ¿e dayes of light and knowledge that Å¿hould be either Å¿o ignorant or erroneous as to gainÅ¿ay it; and yet learned MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> in his moderate anÅ¿wer as he calleth it, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. and 9. replyeth and anÅ¿we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to it, by denying the <hi>Minor</hi> of my SyllogiÅ¿me for very Å¿len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reaÅ¿ons as his cuÅ¿tome is after this manner: I will give you his owne words which are theÅ¿e.</p>

               </p>
               <p>What man but of ordinary capacity, that had but curÅ¿orily read over my Arguments, would not have obÅ¿erved the truth Å¿o plaine and evidently laid downe in them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and confirmed with Å¿uch reaÅ¿ons, as hee would not onely have beene well Å¿atisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but would have judged it either great blockiÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e in any and apparent ignorance to have yet doubted of it, or great temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and contentiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿pirit to have gainÅ¿ayed Å¿uch evident demonÅ¿tration of verity? And yet Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> out of the Å¿ublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his learning, being a confident DiÅ¿putant, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes mee, but repels the very Scripture it Å¿elfe, and reÅ¿iÅ¿ts the Spirit of God, which is uÅ¿ually with him and his Complices, and all out of the Å¿pirit of error and contention to maintaine their Å¿everall factions. So that it may be admired, that Å¿uch men are not abandoned and abhorred of all people truly fearing God, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when they Å¿ee their whole Å¿tudy and indeavour, is, to delude and Å¿educe poore Å¿illy creatures. But I deÅ¿ire the Reader here deliberately to weigh and conÅ¿ider what the man Å¿aith; hee deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is any mention in any Scripture quoted by mee, of eight thouÅ¿and new Converts, beÅ¿ides women and children, whereas in the Å¿econd Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> which I cited, there is mention made of three thouÅ¿and added to the Church by the firÅ¿t Miracle and Sermon of the DiÅ¿ciples, and this MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> himÅ¿elfe doth acknowledge, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. of his Pamphlet. His words are theÅ¿e. <hi>To whom were added,</hi> viz. <hi>to all thoÅ¿e that were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before by</hi> Johns <hi>and ChriÅ¿ts MiniÅ¿try about three thouÅ¿and Å¿oules,</hi> &amp;c. Here hee confeÅ¿Å¿eth there were three thouÅ¿and Å¿oules added to the Church; neither is there any mention of women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t them; and in the fourth Chapter hee likewiÅ¿e acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that the number mentioned there, is five thouÅ¿and. His words are theÅ¿e. <hi>For the Reader may conÅ¿ider, that the number of them there mentioned, are but five thouÅ¿and.</hi> Thus hee. Now all the world knowes, that three thouÅ¿and and five thouÅ¿and are eight thouÅ¿and, and the Scriptures quoted by mee made mention of theÅ¿e eight thouÅ¿and, what Å¿o ever M. <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith to the contrary. So that no man of underÅ¿tanding, can doubt of the truth of what I aÅ¿Å¿erted. For that which is confirmed by the teÅ¿timony of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48122:152"/>
Scripture, were it Å¿ingle and by it Å¿elfe, ought by all ChriÅ¿tians to be beleeved; but that which hath both the holy Scripture, and learned MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his owne witneÅ¿Å¿e to confirme it, that hee cannot with any good reaÅ¿on deny, but that there was three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and Å¿oules at the firÅ¿t Miracle and Sermon of the ApoÅ¿tles after ChriÅ¿ts AÅ¿cenÅ¿ion added to the Church, and five thouÅ¿and after, both the Holy Scripture affirmeth, and MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there were eight thouÅ¿and new Converts added unto the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> for theÅ¿e were diÅ¿tinct actions or effects of the MiniÅ¿try of the ApoÅ¿tles, and produced at Å¿everall times, and upon Å¿everall occaÅ¿ions, from the Miracles and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ApoÅ¿tles: for otherwiÅ¿e they would not have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Å¿uch notice of as Å¿uch wonders, and have beene Å¿o diÅ¿tinctly Å¿et downe with all the Å¿everall circumÅ¿tances both of time, place, and perÅ¿ons; neither would there have beene Å¿uch running and going, queÅ¿tioning and conÅ¿ulting about that buÅ¿ines, by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trates and Officers, as there was, if Å¿ome new and Å¿trange thing had not happend and falne out: for men doe not uÅ¿ually wonder at ordinary occurrences. Now when the holy Scripture relateth this new miracle in the 4. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> as an unexpected thing and Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly hapning &amp; as a matter of great admiration &amp; aÅ¿toniÅ¿hment, yea of terrour to the enemies, from the curing of the Criple, &amp; from the preaching of <hi>Peter &amp; Iohn,</hi> &amp; aÅ¿Å¿erteth withal, <hi>that many which heard the word, beleeved, &amp; the number of the men was about</hi> 5. <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and, v.</hi> 4. It is apparently evident, that as this was a new act &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct from the former: Å¿o that the converÅ¿ion of theÅ¿e five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and, was a new effect and diÅ¿tinct one from the former, and is of purpoÅ¿e Å¿et down by the holy GhoÅ¿t by it Å¿elfe Å¿everally, to be taken notice of as a matter of more admiration than the converÅ¿ion of three thouÅ¿and, by how much it was a greater work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, by another miracle and Sermon, to convert five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and, then three thouÅ¿and. And without all controverÅ¿ie, it was thus recorded with all its circumÅ¿tances for this very end, that it Å¿hould for ever be taken notice of, as a diÅ¿tinct miracle and work of wonder from the former. For the holy GhoÅ¿t is very accurate in the relation of it, and very carefull that there Å¿hould be no miÅ¿take in the whole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e: for in expreÅ¿Å¿e words and termes it is Å¿aid, NotwithÅ¿tanding all the oppoÅ¿ition that was made by the PrieÅ¿ts and by the Captain of the Temple, and the Å¿ouldiers, to hinder the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48122:152"/>
preaching of the Word, and to Å¿mother this miracle, <hi>yet many of them that heard the word</hi> (Å¿aith the Scripture) <hi>beleeved.</hi> And that there might yet be no miÅ¿take or fallacy in the Å¿tory and narration, the very Å¿um and accompt of thoÅ¿e that were converted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by reaÅ¿on of this laÅ¿t miracle and Sermon, is Å¿pecified, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularized, and Å¿et down in theÅ¿e words, <hi>and the number of the men,</hi> (viz. <hi>that beleeved,</hi> Å¿aith the Scripture) <hi>was about five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and.</hi> So that the Scripture it Å¿elfe Å¿ets down the number and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them <hi>men,</hi> and not women and children. And it is very Å¿afe alwayes to Å¿peak as the word of God teacheth us. So that to any intelligible ChriÅ¿tian, there can be no doubt or Å¿cruple any longer left about this point. For that which God himÅ¿elfe hath dictated by his holy Å¿pirit and recorded in his holy word, we may not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ay; but God hath dictated by his holy Å¿pirit and recorded it in his holy word that the multitude that was converted and believed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that new miracle and preaching of <hi>Peter &amp; Iohn</hi> was about five thouÅ¿and men; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not to be gainÅ¿aid but to be beleeved and received as an everlaÅ¿ting truth by all ChriÅ¿tians. For as I Å¿aid before, this was a new effect or a new act and diÅ¿tinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the former; and therefore theÅ¿e five thouÅ¿and are to be conÅ¿idered by themÅ¿elves and apart. Now five thouÅ¿and and three thouÅ¿and put and joyned together make up eight thouÅ¿and, which were all added to the Church, to all the former that were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the MiniÅ¿tery of <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, ChriÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿ciples in ChriÅ¿ts life time; and therefore there is no miÅ¿take in my addition as Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> fondly and childiÅ¿hly concludes: and his reaÅ¿ons by which he would prove my miÅ¿take, are as vaine and Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e. <hi>For</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>Å¿ome of the three thouÅ¿and (may be) were women, and how can the Doctor Å¿ay there were eight thouÅ¿and new converts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides women?</hi> Take notice I pray of the vanity of his expreÅ¿Å¿ion; <hi>Some of the three thouÅ¿and</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>may be were women:</hi> and it may be they were not, and it Å¿tandeth with as good reaÅ¿on they were not, as any he can bring to prove they were, although I did not Å¿et it down as my own opinion, but Å¿aid onely, That it was the judgement of many learned men, that all thoÅ¿e eight thouÅ¿and that were converted by thoÅ¿e two miracles and Sermons were men, and not women and children: and therefore Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> here commits a double errour: firÅ¿t, in making that my opinion and aÅ¿cribing that to me which I onely then related as the judgement of others, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48122:153"/>
then left it in <hi>medio;</hi> that is his firÅ¿t error; his Å¿econd is worÅ¿e: for whereas the Holy Scripture Å¿aith, that there were three thouÅ¿and Å¿oules added unto the Church by the firÅ¿t Miracle and Sermon, and five thouÅ¿and by the Å¿econd, in the fourth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> peremptorily affirmeth they were but five thouÅ¿and in all, &amp; Å¿o gives the Spirit of God the lye; who declares there were three thouÅ¿and at one time, &amp; five at another added to the Church. But if there were but 5. thouÅ¿and in all, as M. <hi>Knollys</hi> aÅ¿Å¿erteth, then by his own acknowledgement they were all men and not women; and Å¿o then I had committed no error, neither can M. <hi>Knollys</hi> convince me of an error if I had Å¿aid it as my own opinion that al thoÅ¿e that were converted by thoÅ¿e two Miracles, had been all men, and not women and children: For, for the five thouÅ¿and, the word of God Å¿aith they were all men and not women, the words are theÅ¿e in the Originall, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>

But were I of as contentious a Å¿pirit as MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and that it tended to edification, I could bring better reaÅ¿ons to prove they were men only and not women, then either he or any of his Fraternity can produce to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> himÅ¿elf Å¿eemeth but faintly to aÅ¿Å¿ert that there
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48122:153"/>
were any of them Women and Children: for he Å¿aith, <hi>it may be Å¿ome of the</hi> 3. <hi>thouÅ¿and were women,</hi> &amp; thus he trifles in his anÅ¿wer to my firÅ¿t Argument, Å¿aying, <hi>it may be there were no more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in IeruÅ¿alem at the FeaÅ¿t of PentecoÅ¿t but the hundred and twenty names.</hi> Now all the learned know, that to Å¿ay, it may bee there were Å¿ome women, makes no reall conviction of a miÅ¿take, it is but a naked and groundleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uppoÅ¿ition of a miÅ¿take, eÅ¿pecially when there may be many Å¿olid reaÅ¿ons produced to prove they were all men and no women and children.</p>
               <p>And therefore Å¿uch kind of triflings are not Å¿ufferable in any that pretend to fear God: for vain janglings and needleÅ¿Å¿e contentions about words, is that that is condemned by the ApoÅ¿tle in all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters, in his EpiÅ¿tles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and it troubles me not a little, that I have to do with Å¿uch vaine kind of creatures, whoÅ¿e cheeÅ¿e bable is about words. But notwithÅ¿tanding I Å¿ee a providence in it: for in this, the man Å¿hewes but his ignorance, and whiles he would perÅ¿wade the Reader, that he is very acute he Å¿hewes himÅ¿elfe to be a very child in the art of diÅ¿putation. <hi>There is an old Å¿aying, give Å¿ome men rope enough and they will hang themÅ¿elves.</hi> Even Å¿o it is here with MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> whiles he takes that liberty to himÅ¿elf to run out in his diÅ¿courÅ¿e he intangles himÅ¿elf on every Å¿ide as by the Å¿equell will appeare, as here. He Å¿ayd that there was <hi>no mention in any Scripture quoted by me of eight thouÅ¿and, and he denyed withall that the Scripture doth prove any Å¿uch thing:</hi> and aÅ¿Å¿erted moreover that the whole number of all thoÅ¿e converts amouted but to five thouÅ¿and, and he Å¿aid that all theÅ¿e were men and not women, and yet here he confutes himÅ¿elf; I deÅ¿ire all therfore to take notice of the vanity of the man. He had confidently concluded there were but five thouÅ¿and in all, and aÅ¿Å¿erted that they were all men, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding as it were in the Å¿ame breath, he makes mention of three thouÅ¿and more of another company amongÅ¿t the which he Å¿ayth <hi>Å¿ome of them might be women:</hi> So that by his own conceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, here is two diÅ¿tinct numbers or companies, one conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of 5. thouÅ¿and and all men and no women, and another conÅ¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three thouÅ¿and more, of which he makes a Å¿cruple Å¿aying <hi>that amongÅ¿t them there might be Å¿ome women:</hi> So that if the five thouÅ¿and were all men, and there was yet another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of three thouÅ¿and more beÅ¿ides, amongÅ¿t which there might

be Å¿ome women, as MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith, then this three thouÅ¿and was a diÅ¿tinct company from the former: now three thouÅ¿and amongÅ¿t the which there might be Å¿ome women, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and all men, makes up full eight thouÅ¿and, Å¿o that MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> by his whibling againe and againe <hi>Volens nolens</hi> confirmes my aÅ¿Å¿ertion that the full number of thoÅ¿e converts by theÅ¿e two mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles &amp; Sermons was eight thouÅ¿and, and for ought any thing can be Å¿aid to the contrary, they were all men beÅ¿ides women and children; and this is all he gaines by his fond caviling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to prove himÅ¿elfe a very jangler, and one like that wicked Å¿ervant, that condemns himÅ¿elf by his own mouth. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿pake for proofe of the number viz: that there were eight thouÅ¿and beÅ¿ides women and children.</p>
               <p>And now I come to his Å¿econd reaÅ¿on, by which he labours to evince and prove they were not converts &amp; beleevers, which I hope to make appeare to be not only groundleÅ¿Å¿e, but to be moÅ¿t impious and wicked, as giving the Spirit of God the lye and indeede de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructive to their own tenents and principles. His words are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e five thouÅ¿and <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> are onely called men, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, not believers; for howbeit, many of them hearing the word believed, yet it is not Å¿aid the five thouÅ¿and men beleeved. And the truth is, the text well conÅ¿idered, only holds forth that the number of men was made up five thouÅ¿and. <hi>Thus MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys.</p>
               <p>For my owne particular, I Å¿tand aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed at the vanity, Å¿enÅ¿leÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e of the man; for his words are not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the light of reaÅ¿on and the judgement of all the learned, and the very opinion of the Independents themÅ¿elves, who hold that they were all converts and beleeves, but they are contradictory to the Spirit of God, giving the holy GhoÅ¿t the lye as I Å¿aid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the Scripture Å¿aith notwithÅ¿tanding all the reÅ¿iÅ¿tance and oppoÅ¿ition made by the enemies of the GoÅ¿pell to hinder the work of the MiniÅ¿try: and notwithÅ¿tanding all the perÅ¿ecution that was rayÅ¿ed againÅ¿t them for this very end, I Å¿ay notwithÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their indeavour, the holy GhhÅ¿t Å¿aith, that <hi>many of them which heard the word believed, and the number of men was five thouÅ¿and.</hi> Here are two truths evidently laid downe contrary to MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his errors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:48122:154"/>
                  <hi>The firÅ¿t is,</hi> that they are not only called men, but beleevers: <hi>for Å¿aith the Scripture,</hi> they that heard the word believed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the number of thoÅ¿e that believed, is there <hi>in terminis</hi> Å¿et downe to be five thouÅ¿and, and <hi>the number</hi> of the <hi>men</hi> (viz. that believed) Å¿aith the text <hi>was five thouÅ¿and<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> So that from this teÅ¿timony of Scripture and from all my arguments deduced from thence, theÅ¿e two concluÅ¿ions do follow evidently.</p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t, that MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> is a very wicked man, that thus at pleaÅ¿ure can give the Spirit of God the lye and oppoÅ¿e the truth it Å¿elfe upon all occaÅ¿ions.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd, that there were more believers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, then could poÅ¿Å¿ibly all meete in any one place and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip, and that in its very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; for here we read of eight thouÅ¿and more cnoverts beÅ¿ids wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children; for the Scripture maketh mention of no women nor children newly added to all thoÅ¿e that were converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> and by the miniÅ¿try of ChriÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿ciples in ChriÅ¿ts life time, and all they were innumerable: for all <hi>JeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> went out unto them and were baptiÅ¿ed, beÅ¿ides the many other thouÅ¿ands that the Scripture recordeth were daily added to theÅ¿e, all which I Å¿ay could not poÅ¿Å¿ibly meete in one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to edification. And the truth of theÅ¿e concluÅ¿ions I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, will appeare Å¿o cleare in the judgement of all the learned as they wil gather that Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> &amp; his complices that thus Å¿ottiÅ¿hly oppoÅ¿e it, ought Å¿everely to be puniÅ¿hed for theÅ¿e their wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices who for the upholding of their own errors and for their baÅ¿e lucre and gain &amp; for worldly ends care not what they Å¿ay or do to the diÅ¿turbance of church &amp; State, for the Å¿educing of the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and hindring of the work of reformation Å¿o much to be deÅ¿ired.</p>
               <p>But before I paÅ¿Å¿e on to MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knoylls</hi> his other Cavills, I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire the reader a little to conÅ¿ider what I have yet in this place to Å¿ay to him. <hi>TheÅ¿e five thouÅ¿and</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>are called men, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, not believers; for howbeit many of them hearing the Word belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet it is not Å¿aid the five thouÅ¿and men believed. And the truth is, the text well conÅ¿idered, only holds forth that the number of men was made up</hi> 5. <hi>thouÅ¿and.</hi> From hence I gather if theÅ¿e words of his may be credited, that it may be a very well formed Church after the new teÅ¿tament forme, (for this Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was Å¿uch an one by the confeÅ¿Å¿ion of all the Independents) although they be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48122:155"/>
not all viÅ¿ible Saints, but many of them unbeleevers, Iewes and Infidels, and be not true converts; and that for the moulding up of a true Church after the new teÅ¿tament forme, it is not abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary that they Å¿hould be all viÅ¿ible Saints; for here MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿ays they were mixt good and bad together, <hi>it is not Å¿aid Å¿aith he the five thouÅ¿and men believed</hi> and yet they were all members: Å¿o that by his doctrine Å¿ome of them were unbelievers, and notwithÅ¿tanding they were all moulded up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church body: Å¿o that they were not all viÅ¿ible Saints, and yet the true Saints and believers made no Å¿eparation from the other: but they all continued together in Church fellowÅ¿hip both Saints and infidels and communicated in all Ordinances. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> by this doctrine of his doth not fight againÅ¿t the opinion of all his brethren, and utterly overthrow all the new fabricke of Independency, I leave it not onely to the judgement of the learned of the congregationall way (if there be any Å¿uch) but to the cenÅ¿ure of the Å¿even new churches of which he is one of the paÅ¿tours, and an other Saint <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> who if they do not puniÅ¿h him for this his Grollery, I will Å¿ay they deÅ¿erve cenÅ¿ure and puniÅ¿hment themÅ¿elves.</p>
               <p>But this is not all I have here to Å¿ay to Mr <hi>Knollys;</hi> I have this alÅ¿o to adde, that if any credit may be given to his words, there will then be no certainty in any thing the Scripture relateth unto us. For he Å¿aith, <hi>That thoÅ¿e five thouÅ¿and that were added to the Church are called men, and not Converts and Beleevers; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many of them believed, yet it is not Å¿aid the five thouÅ¿and believed.</hi> So that if he may be credited, all that the holy Scripture hath related unto us concerning the converÅ¿ion of theÅ¿e men is a meere fable: for the Scripture Å¿aith they believed, and he affirmeth the contrary, and Å¿ayth <hi>they were only called men and not converts not believers.</hi> Whether this fellow therefore ought not to be caÅ¿t out of the Å¿even Churches, and out of all the Churches of the world for this his wickedneÅ¿Å¿e and temerity, I leave it to the judgement of all the learned, either dependents or independents. and Å¿o I will paÅ¿Å¿e to his other good Å¿tuffe which in its due place you Å¿hall meete with. But in the meane time out of all the above quoted places of Scripture, I thus farther argue.</p>
               <p>Where there was almoÅ¿t an hundred preachers and MiniÅ¿ters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides the twelve ApoÅ¿tles, and all theÅ¿e continually taken up in prayer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48122:155"/>
and preaching, and could not leave their MiniÅ¿try to Å¿erve tables: and where there was Å¿uch a company of believers and people as did imploy them all; there of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>Å¿e congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, if they would all be edified and avoyd confuÅ¿ion, and partake in all ordinances. But in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> there was almoÅ¿t an hundred preachers and MiniÅ¿ters, beÅ¿ides the twelve ApoÅ¿tles; and all theÅ¿e were continually taken up in prayer and preaching and could not leave <hi>their miniÅ¿try to Å¿erve</hi> tables: and where there was Å¿uch a company of believers and people as did employ them all, there of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into diverÅ¿e congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, if they would all be edified, and avoyd confuÅ¿ion and partake in all Ordinances.</p>
               <p>For the major, very reaÅ¿on and the common light of underÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, without any reluctation will aÅ¿Å¿ent unto it. And for the Minor, it is manifeÅ¿t from Chapter the 1. ver. 21. 22. and from chapter the Å¿ixt ver. the 2 and 4. and chapter the 8. ver. 1. So that the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion is undenyable. But out of all the former places I thus farther argue.</p>
               <p>Where there were people of al nations under the heavens, and them in Å¿ome multitudes, and moÅ¿t of them believers and devout men and women which waited upon the Ordinances and had a deÅ¿ire daily to heare the Word; there of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers and Å¿undry congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, and have Å¿uch to preach unto them Å¿everally in their owne language; or elÅ¿e they could not partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip to edification. But in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> there were people of all Nations under the Heavens, and them in Å¿ome multitudes, and moÅ¿t of them Believers and devout Men and Women, that waited upon the Ordinances, and had a deÅ¿ire dayly to heare the Word. <hi>Ergo,</hi> of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, and have Å¿uch to preach unto them Å¿everally in their owne language, or elÅ¿e they could not partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip to edification.</p>
               <p>For the Major, no reaÅ¿on can gainÅ¿ay it, for the ApoÅ¿tles and the other MiniÅ¿ters imployed all thoÅ¿e gifts of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and thoÅ¿e divers languages which they had received for the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, to the utmoÅ¿t, and did improve all opportunities for the converting of the people committed unto their charge, and for the further building of them up in their holy faith, which was
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48122:156"/>
their calling and imployment: and this they could not have done, unleÅ¿Å¿e they taught thoÅ¿e Nations in their Å¿everall Languages; and that they could not do without confuÅ¿ion, unleÅ¿Å¿e they were diÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted in Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies, where they might diÅ¿tinctly heare their own Languages. For otherwiÅ¿e, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. if men Å¿hould Å¿peak to the people with unknown tongues, <hi>if the unlearned,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>come in and unbelievers, will they not Å¿ay that they are all mad?</hi> And therefore Tongues are given for a Å¿igne, not to them <hi>that believe, but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not.</hi> Now they were <hi>devout Men in IeruÅ¿alem and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> and therefore the ApoÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters were to Å¿peake to them Å¿everally in their own languages: and for that purpoÅ¿e God gave them thoÅ¿e Tongues, and that diverÅ¿ity of languages, <hi>that thoÅ¿e that were Believers might be more edified, and that the unbelievers and unlearned, &amp; Å¿uch as belonged unto Gods election, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and judged of all; and that the Å¿ecrets of their hearts might be manifeÅ¿ted, that Å¿o falling down upon their face they might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip God, and report that God was in them of a truth,</hi> as the ApoÅ¿tle there Å¿aith. So that I Å¿ay for the Major, no reaÅ¿onable creature will call it in queÅ¿tion.</p>
               <p>And for the Major, it is manifeÅ¿t out of the Chap. 2. VerÅ¿. 5. &amp;c. and in Chap. 6. VerÅ¿. 1. and VerÅ¿. 2. 4. And for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ion, that from the PremiÅ¿es doth alÅ¿o enÅ¿ue.</p>
               <p>Againe, I thus further argue out of the former Chapters.</p>
               <p>That which the holy Scripture in expreÅ¿Å¿e words and in diverÅ¿e places hath declared unto us that every ChriÅ¿tian is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but the Scripture in expreÅ¿Å¿e words and in diverÅ¿e places hath declared unto us, that there were diverÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿emblies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Believers in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that the ApoÅ¿tles and all the Believers in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> did continue daily with one accord in the Temple; and that they brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, and that daily in the Temple, and in every houÅ¿e, they ceaÅ¿ed not to teach and preach IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was diverÅ¿e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies of Believers in the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem,</hi> where they did daily partake in all the Ordinances, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all acts of worÅ¿hip.</p>
               <p>For the Major, no ChriÅ¿tian can deny it. For the Minor, it is manifeÅ¿t from 46 VerÅ¿e of the 2 Chapter, and Chap. 5. verÅ¿. 12. and verÅ¿. 42. and Chap. 3. verÅ¿. 12, 13. and many more
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48122:156"/>
places that might be produced. And in thoÅ¿e places it is not onely Å¿aid they preached in every houÅ¿e, <hi>but that they brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e;</hi> by which expreÅ¿Å¿ion all Writers interpret, the holy Communion, and partaking of the Lords Supper: and if it Å¿hould not Å¿o be underÅ¿tood, we never can reade that any ChriÅ¿tians in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> beÅ¿ides the ApoÅ¿tles, ever enjoyed all acts of worÅ¿hip, eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e that are peculiar to Church Communion.</p>
               <p>It is related often that they preached the Word daily in the Temple, which was common to <hi>Iewes</hi> and ChriÅ¿tians (though no JewiÅ¿h worÅ¿hip) as all men acknowledge. And by evident Arguments it may be proved, <hi>that they never adminiÅ¿tred the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the Temple,</hi> thoÅ¿e diÅ¿criminating and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing Ordinances of the ChriÅ¿tian Church; as all the moÅ¿t Orthodox Interpreters gather from the enÅ¿uing words, where it is Å¿aid, <hi>They continued daily with one accord in the Temple;</hi> but when they Å¿peake of the AdminiÅ¿tration of the Lords Supper, it is expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed in theÅ¿e words, <hi>and breaking of bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e,</hi> which is interpreted by all Divines, of Sacramentall bread; which phraÅ¿e and manner of Å¿peaking is uÅ¿ually Å¿o expounded by all the Learned, upon <hi>Acts</hi> the 20. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> the 7. And our Brethren do not deny this. And it is well known, that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians had their meetings and aÅ¿Å¿emblies in private houÅ¿es, as by the many places is manifeÅ¿t, which I cited but a little before.</p>
               <p>BeÅ¿ides, the Sacrament of breaking bread is no Temple-ordinance; and therefore could not be adminiÅ¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ed in the Temple with the Å¿afety of the ChriÅ¿tians and Believers: for if they were Å¿o highly diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed with the ApoÅ¿tles, for preaching <hi>IeÅ¿us</hi> and the ReÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in the Temple, as it appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 2. They would not have Å¿uffered them to have adminiÅ¿tred the Sacraments there. And if <hi>Paul</hi> was Å¿o aÅ¿Å¿aulted, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 28. for being but Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to have brought Greeks into the Temple, what would theÅ¿e men have done, if one Å¿hould have brought in a new Ordinance, and a new worÅ¿hip and Å¿ervice; and that Å¿o contrary to their legall rights? Surely the <hi>Iewes</hi> would never have Å¿uffered it, neither do the Brethren contend for this.</p>
               <p>Now it is well known that in the Primitive Church, if not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, yet every firÅ¿t day of the Week at leaÅ¿t, <hi>they met together to break bread;</hi> that is to receive the holy Sacrament, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without preaching, as we Å¿ee in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. and in the places
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48122:157"/>
above quoted: in which it is Å¿aid, <hi>they dayly brake bread together,</hi> and that in Å¿everall and particular houÅ¿es; and that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be; for a few houÅ¿es could not have held Å¿o many thouÅ¿ands, as all reaÅ¿on will dictate: and if they were or could be contained under one roof, yet they muÅ¿t be forced to be in diverÅ¿e and Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall chambers or roomes. So that what is done and Å¿poke in the one, the other knowes nothing of it, Å¿o that they are Å¿till Å¿everall congregations: as under the roofe of <hi>Pauls</hi> there are diverÅ¿e meeting<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>places where Men may partake in all Ordinances, and they are called Å¿everall Churches; and they that meet there Å¿everal congregations, though under one roof: for the diÅ¿tinction of the places under one covert, makes alwayes a diÅ¿tinct aÅ¿Å¿embly, as it is dayly Å¿een in the Å¿everall Committees at WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter; where every Committee of both HouÅ¿es have their Å¿everall roomes and equall authority, and are yet all but one Parliament, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tributed into Å¿o many Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblyes. So here, they had Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall aÅ¿Å¿emblies, and that in Å¿everall houÅ¿es, as is declared: and reaÅ¿on it Å¿elfe, without any teÅ¿timony of holy Scripture, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wade this: for the ApoÅ¿tles they all preached, and that dayly; and they muÅ¿t have Å¿everall roomes to preach in, to avoyde confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion: for all things in the Church muÅ¿t be done in order, and they muÅ¿t have Å¿everall auditories or aÅ¿Å¿emblies, or elÅ¿e they Å¿hould preach to the walls: Å¿o that if the ApoÅ¿tles would all preach; and the people all heare, of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblyes, to avoyde diÅ¿order; and that there were Å¿everall congregations and Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces above Å¿pecified do declare and tell us. So that there is no man that reÅ¿olves not to oppoÅ¿e all truth that is contrary to his received opinion, but may evidently perceive <hi>that there were many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, and yet they all made but one Church, and were govern'd by one PreÅ¿bytery;</hi> as the many Committees in both HouÅ¿es are in divers roomes, and make divers aÅ¿Å¿emblies, and have equall power and authority among themÅ¿elves; and yet they all make but one Parliament; and all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Committees are govern'd by the joynt conÅ¿ent of the Great Civill Presbytery of the Kingdome, which is all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all this without confuÅ¿ion, yea, with moÅ¿t excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decency.</p>
               <p>This is the laÅ¿t argument I produced out of the above cited
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48122:157"/>
Scriptures to prove that there were many aÅ¿Å¿emblies of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> before the perÅ¿ecution: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this argument Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> before he comes to anÅ¿wer it, makes a little Å¿ucking preamble. His words are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> hath one argument which is more to the purpoÅ¿e then all the other, which I deÅ¿ire the reader Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>page 64. Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His AnÅ¿wer to this Argument is as followeth, I will Å¿et down all his own words, which are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>Now I deÅ¿ire the Reader to conÅ¿ider how the Doctor proves his Minor, which he Å¿aith it manifeÅ¿t from <hi>Acts 2. 46.</hi> and chapter the <hi>5. 12. 42.</hi> and chapter <hi>3. 11. 12.</hi> and many more places that might be produoed. <hi>page 64, 65, 66.</hi> In all which diÅ¿courÅ¿e, the Doctor gives you nothing but his own Å¿uppoÅ¿itions and concluÅ¿ions, for the proofe of his Minor propoÅ¿ition, which is his manner of diÅ¿courÅ¿ing through his booke.</p>
               <p>This Argument <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> I anÅ¿wer; FirÅ¿t by denying the aÅ¿Å¿ump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Minor propoÅ¿ition, and the reaÅ¿on of my denying it is, becauÅ¿e the Scriptures produced by the Doctor, do not in expreÅ¿Å¿e words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that there were divers aÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem.</hi> The Scriptures quoted do in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿e words declare the contrary to what the Doctor would prove. For <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>2. verÅ¿e 42. 46.</hi> All that beleeved were together, and they continued with one accord in the Temple.

Minor propoÅ¿ition, the latter part of it, That the Apostles and all the Beleevers in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> did continue dayly with one accord in the Temple, and that they brake from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e; and this Å¿hall Å¿uffice for refutation of what the Doctor hath written touching the first propoÅ¿ition.</p>
               <p>Thus profound Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> confutes my arguments. I have Å¿et down all his words at large: And as he earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ired the Reader Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to conÅ¿ider my Argument; So I in like manner intreat him that he would but looke back upon it and adviÅ¿edly weight whether there be nothing either in that or any other of my arguments and in all my diÅ¿courÅ¿e, but my own Å¿uppoÅ¿itions and concluÅ¿ions for proofe of what I Å¿ay, as he affirmeth, and whether I have not both Scripture and reaÅ¿on for what I Å¿ay through my whole book; and if he Å¿hall upon mature examination perceive that I have good authority for what I Å¿ay, then let him judg whether or no M. <hi>Knollys</hi> &amp; all his complices that thus upon all occaÅ¿ions tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me, bee not a generation of the accuÅ¿ers of the brethren, and whether both Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and all his confederats be not a company of calumniators &amp; raylors, and Lyers rather then Saints. For I bleÅ¿s God I have both Scripture and Å¿ound reaÅ¿on for all that I Å¿ay, and I Å¿peak it here in the preÅ¿ence of the great GOD, that if I had ever Å¿een the leaÅ¿t ground of truth, in all the Scripture of truth, for what they of the congregationall way hold about their Church, I would rather have Å¿uffered any miÅ¿ery in the world then ever have opened my mouth againÅ¿t their way, much leÅ¿Å¿e have written againÅ¿t it; but finding it not only a novell Opinion, but hereticall &amp; indeed the very Å¿ourÅ¿e of all hereÅ¿ies and errors, and of dangerous conÅ¿equence, and Å¿uch an one that if it be not Å¿peedily looked unto, will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring down the plagues and judgements of God upon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and overthrow all the ChriÅ¿tian Religion and all power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneÅ¿Å¿e, but all government in Church and State through City and Country and bring a miÅ¿erable deÅ¿olation and utter ruine upon the 3 Kingdoms, <hi>which God of his infinite mercy and goodneÅ¿Å¿e prevent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the conÅ¿ideration of all theÅ¿e things, in the preÅ¿ence of God I Å¿ay it again, and no other, put me upon this imployment to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e the error of the wayes of all the Independents and Sectaries, and in this courÅ¿e I am now in, by the grace of God and his bleÅ¿Å¿ed aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance I will perÅ¿evere in with all my endeavours to the laÅ¿t period of my dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:48122:158"/>
And now I come to reply to what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath here Å¿et down by way of anÅ¿wer, and although I have formerly given an anÅ¿wer to all the fond cavills of the Independents concerning their Å¿everall meetings together in the Temple and in Solomons Porch, which the Reader I am confident will Å¿ay is Å¿atisfactory enough to any that know what reaÅ¿on is, yet here again for MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> farther Å¿atisfaction, if he will with any thing be Å¿atisfied, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer as followeth to what he childiÅ¿hly bables againÅ¿t this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This argument of the Doctors</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>I anÅ¿wer firÅ¿t by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the AÅ¿Å¿umption,</hi> &amp;c. One would have expected that when MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> began with this word <hi>firÅ¿t,</hi> which amongÅ¿t lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rationall men in diÅ¿puting, it being a word of relation, hath ever reference to Å¿ome Å¿econd anÅ¿wer at leÅ¿t if not a third and fourth; that he had had Å¿ome Å¿econd and third reÅ¿erve of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons at leaÅ¿t to have fallen upon my argument with, this I Å¿ay all wiÅ¿e men would have imagined. And yet there followes neither a Å¿econd, third or fourth anÅ¿wer. But howÅ¿oever he may Å¿peak nonÅ¿enÅ¿e by his calling, and by vertue of his Independency, I will take no advantage againÅ¿t him for that: I will examine onely the futility of his denyall which he calls a reaÅ¿on, which indeede is a meer contradiction not only of himÅ¿elfe, but of the holy Scripture and is a giving of the Å¿pirit of God the lye as at other times, as will forth with appear,</p>
               <p>For whereas he Å¿aith that the Scriptures produced by me do not in expreÅ¿Å¿e words declare, that there were divers AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of JeruÅ¿alem; and that the Scriptures quoted do in expreÅ¿Å¿e termes declare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is moÅ¿t abominably falÅ¿e, and that by his own confeÅ¿Å¿ion, as we Å¿hall by and by Å¿ee. For Å¿hould I grant unto MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> which I cannot do for many reaÅ¿ons Å¿et down in my foregoing DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, <hi>That when there were but three thouÅ¿and converted and added to the Church, that they might then all meet together in any one place or congregation to partake in all Ordinances, and that when there were five thouÅ¿and more added to them, they might Å¿till likewiÅ¿e all meet together, either in the Temple or in Solomons Porch to hear the Word:</hi> I Å¿ay Å¿hould I to gratifie MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> grant him all this; yet it will not follow, that when there were dayly new additions upon additions of other Converts and Beleevers, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48122:159"/>
that of many thouÅ¿ands, that then they could Å¿till doe the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>But I cannot grant all this, for it would be againÅ¿t all reaÅ¿on, and contrary to daily experience, which tels us, that eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and men cannot <hi>meet in any one Congregation to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip to edification.</hi> Yea, if I Å¿hould grant this to MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> both hee himÅ¿elfe and all his Fraternity would laugh at mee, &amp; all learned men would conclude that I were indeed a mad man, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿peakes of mee; for it is moÅ¿t certaine, that all the Beleevers and Converts in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> did never all together <hi>partake in all Ordinances, and in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, either in the Temple, or in</hi> Solomons <hi>porch:</hi> for wee never reade that they either baptized or brake bread in either of them: neither would the MagiÅ¿trate have ever indured, or Å¿uffered it, and yet both theÅ¿e were the diÅ¿criminating, and Å¿ealing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, by which all ChriÅ¿tians were diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from Jewes and Gentiles, and all Vnbeleevers, and it is well knowne that there was no room in any private houÅ¿e that could containe Å¿uch a multitude to partake in all Ordinances to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and this my brother <hi>Burton</hi> accordeth to, Å¿aying in expreÅ¿Å¿e words, <hi>that there was no roome or place large enough (to containe them all)</hi> and the very Scripture alÅ¿o is cleare in this point in many places. Yea, MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> aÅ¿Å¿enteth to this, though hee takes no notice of what hee Å¿ayes at any time. But becauÅ¿e hee perhaps will beleeve himÅ¿elf rather then me, and becauÅ¿e alÅ¿o his Followers and Schollers will give credit to his words, rather then to any reaÅ¿ons produced by mee, let them I pray heare what hee Å¿aith.</p>

Lords Supper: the ApoÅ¿tles and the MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pell only had the charge to feed ChriÅ¿ts Å¿heep and Lambes, Å¿o that the Å¿heep and lambes were not to feede their PaÅ¿tor? Now all the people under them were either Å¿heepe or lambs, and they were not to intermedle in thoÅ¿e holy Ordinances to adminiÅ¿ter them, though they might receive them from them; and therefore what the holy Word of God relateth to us, that we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but the holy Word of God relates unto us that in <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and that in the very infancy of the Church, they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies every day in many Å¿everall houÅ¿es at one time; yea in every houÅ¿e. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations of believers in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that in the very infancy of it: and this MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; for he confeÅ¿Å¿eth they had their meetings day by day, and houÅ¿e by houÅ¿e, that is to Å¿ay every day and in every houÅ¿e they had their Congregations in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and Å¿o he is conÅ¿trained to confeÅ¿Å¿e that which he had Å¿o often and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily denied: but Å¿uch is the force, power, and efficacy of truth as it will breake out of the mouth of the enemie and fly in their faces: for MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth confeÅ¿Å¿e, that beÅ¿ides their meetings in the Temple and in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> and that daily, they had their meetings alÅ¿o houÅ¿e by houÅ¿e <hi>Domatim,</hi> Å¿o that their meetings and congregations in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleÅ¿Å¿e, if they were from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e. But if neither the Scripture, nor his owne confeÅ¿Å¿ion, can convince his error, at leaÅ¿t let his owne Words take Å¿ome place with him who in the 23. pag. of his learned anÅ¿wer hath theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions. <hi>Some god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men of approved gifts came to Å¿ojourne in this city, and preached the Word both publickly and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, and daily in the Temples, and in every houÅ¿e they ceaÅ¿ed not to Teach and Preach</hi> IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, <hi>and Å¿ome of them have dwelt in their owne houÅ¿es and received all that came unto them</hi> &amp;c.</p>

I am confident they will none of them deny it: Yea they will acknowledge that in as many places as the Word of God is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongÅ¿t them, and the Sacraments adminiÅ¿tred, that in all thoÅ¿e they have a Å¿everall Church, congregation, and aÅ¿Å¿embly &amp; this very reaÅ¿on will dictate unto any man.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48122:162"/>
they preach publikely, and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, and in every houÅ¿e; not onely becauÅ¿e Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith it, but becauÅ¿e every mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on will convince him of it: after the Å¿ame manner every man will conclude, <hi>That in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem there was many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies;</hi> for the Scripture relates, <hi>That the word of God was preached publikely in the Temple and in Solomons Porch, and that the Saints brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, and that the ApoÅ¿tles ceaÅ¿ed not to teach and preach IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in every houÅ¿e;</hi> and therefore all ChriÅ¿tians are bound to beleeve this <hi>becauÅ¿e the mouth of the Lord hath Å¿poke it,</hi> yea and it is acknowledged by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter <hi>Knollys;</hi> from all which it doth now evidently appear to all the world, <hi>that there were many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblyes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding doth wickedly deny, affirming there were no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> then could all meet in any one place, and Å¿o he not onely contradicts himÅ¿elfe and fights againÅ¿t the very light of reaÅ¿on, but which is more he gives the Å¿pirit of God the lye, and therefore he ought by all thoÅ¿e of the Å¿even Churches to be Å¿everely dealt with as a wicked impoÅ¿tor and deceiver and ought indeeed to be thrown out of all their Congregations as a jugler and a falÅ¿e prophet.</p>
               <p>Having thus evidently proved that there were many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the church of JeruÅ¿alem, before the perÅ¿ecution: I will by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance make good that there were alÅ¿o many AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes under the perÅ¿ecution, and after the perÅ¿ecution; and this I do the rather undertake, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome of the brethren have Å¿aid that howÅ¿oever it could be proved that before the perÅ¿ecution there were many Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies: yet by reaÅ¿on of the diÅ¿perÅ¿ion of the beleevers, the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was Å¿o waÅ¿ted and Å¿cattered that there were no more left then could all meet in one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And were it Å¿o, that after the Å¿cattering of the Beleevers and ChriÅ¿tians in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> it could never be evinced and made good that there were more then could meet together in one place: yet all this were nothing for the enervating of the argument: for we muÅ¿t ever look upon the firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution and government of the Church, and what it was originally and by divine conÅ¿titution, and not what it was accidentally and through perÅ¿ecution and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion and by the violence of men: for governments of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are often changed from their Primordiall State through many
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48122:163"/>
caÅ¿ualties as it happened often in the Church of the Jewes: and therefore in all reformations things are to be reduced to the firÅ¿t rule and originall pattern: and we are not to look upon them as by occaÅ¿ion they vary and change through the injury of the times.</p>
               <p>And therefore if we look into the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> as Å¿he was in her youth and in her moÅ¿t flouriÅ¿hing age, we Å¿hall finde her conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of <hi>divers Congregations and many AÅ¿Å¿emblies,</hi> and all them governed by a Common Councell and joynt conÅ¿ent of a Presbytery, which muÅ¿t be the patterne of all Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the end of the world, if wee will in our Reformation conforme our Å¿elves to Gods Ordinance and to the firÅ¿t conÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But becauÅ¿e I Å¿ay they think it Å¿o difficult a thing to prove ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations in JeruÅ¿alem after the perÅ¿ecution, I will now God willing make it evident; and not onely after the perÅ¿ecution, but even in, and under the perÅ¿ecution: and I will do it firÅ¿t out of that very place our brethren bring againÅ¿t us, and by which they labour to evince the contrary: the place is in the 8. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verÅ¿e 1, 2, 4. In theÅ¿e words, <hi>And at that time there was a great perÅ¿ecution againÅ¿t the Church which was at IeruÅ¿alem; and they were all Å¿cattered abroad through the Regions of Iudea and Samaria, except the ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> verÅ¿e 3. <hi>As for Saul he made havock of the Church, entring into every houÅ¿e and haling men and women, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to priÅ¿on. Therefore they that were Å¿cattered abroad, went every where preaching the word:</hi> From whence the brethren gather, <hi>that there were no more beleevers left, than could meet in one Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I come to prove my AÅ¿Å¿ertion, I muÅ¿t give Å¿ome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons to evince and make good, that this diÅ¿perÅ¿ion and Å¿cattering of the Beleevers here Å¿poken of, was not Å¿o generall and univerÅ¿all and Å¿o great, <hi>as that there might not yet remain more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>and more people then could poÅ¿Å¿ibly meete in any one place or two:</hi> for perÅ¿ecution is the bellowes of the GoÅ¿pell, which blowes every Å¿park into a flame: Å¿o that this their diviÅ¿ion proved their multiplication at home and abroad, as wee Å¿hall Å¿ee after I have Å¿et down my Arguments and ReaÅ¿ons, Å¿o that it was no cauÅ¿e why we Å¿hould conceive that there were fewer aÅ¿Å¿emblies in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> then before; for although

                  </gap>h to all Å¿orts both Preachers and ChriÅ¿tians, becauÅ¿e it is Å¿aid, <hi>They were all Å¿cattered abroad through all the Regions, &amp;c. except the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> both which notwithÅ¿tanding I cannot yeeld unto for Å¿ome reaÅ¿ons following: but I Å¿ay Å¿hould I grant all this, yet I affirme that this perÅ¿ecution rather made more Congregations in <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> then fewer then there were before, though they might be Å¿mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and leÅ¿Å¿er, then Å¿o, to waÅ¿t them and bring them to Å¿uch a pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, <hi>as they might all meet in one Congregation:</hi> for this their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion was a cauÅ¿e of their multiplication at home and abroad, as I Å¿aid before, and will afterwards appear.</p>
               <p>And even as it was here in <hi>England</hi> in the time of the Prelates power, when any aÅ¿Å¿embly of thoÅ¿e they called Puritans, were at any time found together, they were haled before Authority, (as the whole Kingdome can witneÅ¿Å¿e) and theÅ¿e people were all Å¿cattered; yet Å¿o, as they Å¿till had their meetings in leÅ¿Å¿e numbers; and whereas before they met perhaps a hundred in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, now this hundred was divided into three or four Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies, which were Å¿o many Å¿everall Churches; for in all theÅ¿e <hi>they enjoyed all the acts of worÅ¿hip, and did partake in all the Ordinances</hi> as fully as if they had been in the moÅ¿t crowded aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblyes; but this they did for their own Å¿afety, and that there might not be Å¿uch notice taken of them: for commonly if men Å¿ee a good company of people goe into a houÅ¿e, and none of them come out again, they will by and by gather, that there is Å¿omething there to be done, more than ordinary; and that there is Å¿ome exerciÅ¿e of Religion, or Å¿ome conÅ¿ultation and plotting about Å¿ome deÅ¿igne or other; and therefore it Å¿tirs up the people to take more notice of it, and then they begin to examine the occaÅ¿ion of that concourÅ¿e, and to pry into their proceedings: whereas, if they come but in Å¿lender companies, they conceive it to be Å¿ome ordinary entertainment, and think no farther of it; Å¿o that they then more peaceably enjoy the Å¿ociety and fellowÅ¿hip one of another, without any interruption, which they could not Å¿o well have done, if they had come in greater aÅ¿Å¿emblies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48122:164"/>
And even Å¿o it was among the Beleevers and ChriÅ¿tians in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> in that perÅ¿ecution; they could not now meet in the Temple, nor poÅ¿Å¿ibly at their wonted meeting houÅ¿es, and yet even then they had their aÅ¿Å¿emblies; no terrours could make them forÅ¿ake the companying of themÅ¿elves together. For in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ecution that is Å¿poken of in the 12. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we finde <hi>the Church aÅ¿Å¿embled in Å¿everall places; for they were praying in the houÅ¿e of</hi> Mary, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 12. there was one Congregation, to which <hi>Peter</hi> comes and relates unto them the manner of his delivery, and bids them <hi>go and tell it</hi> James <hi>and the brethren;</hi> and there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other aÅ¿Å¿embly; and without doubt <hi>Peter</hi> went unto a third: for he would not goe among the enemies: and it Å¿tands with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, that in this perÅ¿ecution alÅ¿o, they were as zealous as then, and therefore did not forÅ¿ake the aÅ¿Å¿embling of themÅ¿elves together. Neither would the ApoÅ¿tles be idle, who gave themÅ¿elves continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prayer and the miniÅ¿tring of the Word, which they could not have done if there had been but as many ChriÅ¿tians in <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem as could all have met in one place and in one Congregation;</hi> for one or two of the ApoÅ¿tles could have preacht unto them all, and then to what end or purpoÅ¿e did all the other ApoÅ¿tles tarry in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem</hi> (who in all their motions and Å¿tayes, were directed by the Spirit of God) unleÅ¿Å¿e it were to comfort and Å¿upport the Church there, in the heat and rage of this perÅ¿ecution, when they had Å¿cattered their other teachers from them? From all which it may evidently appear, that there was a very great multitude of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers at this time in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that they were not diminiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Å¿cattered, though all their PaÅ¿tors and MiniÅ¿ters, Å¿aving the ApoÅ¿tles, were.</p>
               <p>And I have very good reaÅ¿on to induce me to beleeve, <hi>That this perÅ¿ecution did not extend to all ChriÅ¿tians promiÅ¿cuouÅ¿ly, and that all the Beleevers were Å¿cattered and diÅ¿perÅ¿t except the ApoÅ¿tles, as our brethren conceive.</hi> For if wee conÅ¿ider the uÅ¿uall method of the perÅ¿ecuting <hi>Jews,</hi> and the manner and cuÅ¿tome of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Church in all ages, wee Å¿hall ever obÅ¿erve that they chiefely aymed at the taking away and extirpating of their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and MiniÅ¿ters, and thoÅ¿e that inÅ¿tructed them.

                  <hi>you Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees hyprocrites, becauÅ¿e ye build the tombes of the Prophets, and Å¿ay, if we had lived in the dayes of our Fathers, wee would not have been partakers with them of the blood of the Prophets; and therefore ye witneÅ¿Å¿e unto your Å¿elves, that ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets. Wherefore behold I Å¿end unto you Prophets, and wiÅ¿e men, and Scribes, and Å¿ome of them you Å¿hall kill and crucifie,</hi> &amp;c. Here our Saviour ChriÅ¿t declares what method they had formerly uÅ¿ed in their perÅ¿ecutions; and that was chiefely to perÅ¿ecute their teachers, and what method they would for the future take, and that was principally <hi>To kill and crucifie, the Prophets, WiÅ¿emen, and Scribes;</hi> which PropheÅ¿ie of ChriÅ¿t, was here in this perÅ¿ecution manifeÅ¿tly fulfilled: for here it is Å¿aid, They were all <hi>(viz.</hi> their teachers) Å¿cattered abroad and perÅ¿ecuted, except the ApoÅ¿tles. It was I Å¿ay ever the method and cuÅ¿tome of perÅ¿ecutors to ayme principally at the rooting out and taking away of thoÅ¿e they Å¿uppoÅ¿ed were ableÅ¿t to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truct the people, and this enraged them againÅ¿t <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t and ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe; and that made them at this time Å¿o miÅ¿chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouÅ¿ly to perÅ¿ecute their MiniÅ¿ters and Teachers. Neither do I read in all the New TeÅ¿tament, before thÅ¿s perÅ¿ecution, that as yet they were come to the maÅ¿Å¿acring of the common people; they had Å¿lain the Lord of Life, and Å¿toned <hi>Stephen;</hi> and after in the 12. of the <hi>Acts</hi> we read, <hi>How Herod Å¿lew James, and becauÅ¿e it pleaÅ¿ed the Jews, he proceeded to take Peter:</hi> they alwayes had their eyes upon their teachers and haled them to priÅ¿on, as they did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 4. of the <hi>Acts;</hi> but for the people, the onely puniÅ¿hment they under-went, till this perÅ¿ecution, was this, <hi>That they were cast out of the Synagogues, if any of them did publickly profeÅ¿Å¿e ChriÅ¿t.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed in this perÅ¿ecution their violence extended to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of men and women to priÅ¿on; But before, we read of no violence offered unto the people; onely they railed on them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, and reproached them, as all wicked men, whoÅ¿e tongues are Å¿et on fire from Hell, uÅ¿e to do, on all the generation of the juÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>The Å¿ame method did the Prelates here in <hi>England</hi> uÅ¿e; they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more principally perÅ¿ecuted the faithfull and painfull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and MiniÅ¿ters every where, and Å¿uch as they thought beÅ¿t able to inÅ¿truct the people, and Å¿elected but here and there Å¿ome
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48122:165"/>
private families for to Å¿care others, and this method AntichriÅ¿t and his complices had learned from the devill and the Jewes. So that when it is Å¿aid <hi>they were all Å¿cattered except the ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> it is to be underÅ¿tood <hi>that all their Preachers and Teachers,</hi> the ApoÅ¿tles only excepted, <hi>were Å¿cattered;</hi> For the word <hi>all</hi> in this place, muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood, either of all the Beleevers, or of all the Teachers and Officers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem, except the ApoÅ¿tles.</hi> But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underÅ¿tood of all the beleevers, that they were all Å¿cattered; and therefore it muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood of all the Teachers, and that for many reaÅ¿ons.</p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t, if all the beleevers had been Å¿cattered and none left, to what end then Å¿hould the twelve ApoÅ¿tles have remained in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem?</hi> They were not to Preach to the walls, neither would they have remained there idle, but would rather have Å¿haken off the duÅ¿t of their feet, (as ChriÅ¿t commanded them) <hi>for a witneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t them, Luke</hi> 10. And would have departed and have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the reÅ¿t of the Teachers, as all good reaÅ¿on perÅ¿wades.</p>
               <p>A Å¿econd reaÅ¿on is; becauÅ¿e if this particle <hi>all</hi> be alwayes exceptive or taken to the utmoÅ¿t, and in the largeÅ¿t extent, as Å¿ome of the brethren imply and would have it; then there Å¿hould not one believer have been left in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> beÅ¿ides the ApoÅ¿tles, which is expreÅ¿ly againÅ¿t the Text, for <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 3. It is Å¿aid, <hi>That Saul brake into houÅ¿es, haling men and women, committing them to priÅ¿on,</hi> and this he did at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> at this time, as he acknowledgeth himÅ¿elfe <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. And therefore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity it muÅ¿t follow, <hi>That all the beleevers were not Å¿cattered abroad, for Å¿ome of them were in priÅ¿on in IeruÅ¿alem.</hi> And for ought I can gather, all the reÅ¿t were in their Å¿everall houÅ¿es, or elÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles could have had no harbour: for if all their friends had been Å¿cattered by this tempeÅ¿t, and if all the Å¿heep had been drove away and the whole flock diÅ¿perÅ¿ed, their PaÅ¿tors without doubt would have followed them: for he would be counted a very bad Shepherd that Å¿hould not follow or look after the poor Å¿heep that were Å¿cattered by the Wolves.</p>
               <p>Neither can we imagine that the ApoÅ¿tles that were the PaÅ¿tors of the flock of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and to whoÅ¿e care he had committed his Å¿heep and his Lambes, with a Å¿peciall charge that they Å¿hould feed them, would relinquiÅ¿h their care and chooÅ¿e rather to dwell amongÅ¿t a company of Wolves, from whome they
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48122:165"/>
could expect no faire meaÅ¿ure, then amongÅ¿t the Å¿heepe: But in that all the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿till remained in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> I rather gather, and that without all controverÅ¿ie, they continued there for this very purpoÅ¿e, <hi>that they might comfort and Å¿upport the Church there, and refreÅ¿h the Beleevers in this heate of PerÅ¿ecution, when they wanted the helpe of their other faithfull MiniÅ¿ters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is very evident from the Text, they were onely the Preachers that were Å¿cattered; for <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 4. It is Å¿aid, <hi>That they that were Å¿cattered went every where preaching the Word,</hi> which expreÅ¿sion in the Originall, as may be proved by innumerable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Å¿ignifieth Å¿uch teachers as were MiniÅ¿ters by Office, and Å¿uch as preached by way of Sermons to a multitude, though they might likewiÅ¿e in private conference inÅ¿truct, which their publike Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿tery did not exempt them from. And although private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians may teach and inÅ¿truct one another, as <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>PriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla</hi> taught <hi>Apollos,</hi> and as all ChriÅ¿tians are commanded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truct one another, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 16. Yet this text Å¿peaks not of Å¿uch a teaching, but of preaching, <hi>They went every where,</hi> Å¿aith the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>preaching the Word.</hi> For teaching may be an act of Charity, but preaching is an act of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; <hi>for how can they preach except they be Å¿ent? Rom.</hi> 10. So that by vertue of their Office, they might both publikely preach, and in private converÅ¿e alÅ¿o inÅ¿truct others whereÅ¿oever they came, whether they were Å¿ent out by perÅ¿ecution or by miÅ¿Å¿ion. As I do conceive of any of thoÅ¿e Godly MiniÅ¿ters that were not many yeares Å¿ince, drove from their habitations, and that were perÅ¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of their places by the Prelates, that they might have preached publickly in any Congregation as MiniÅ¿ters and men in Office, and might alÅ¿o have inÅ¿tructed privately; but the one was an act of duty as it was their Office, and the other of love and charity. And Å¿o may a well gifted private ChriÅ¿tian inÅ¿truct and teach others upon occaÅ¿ion, and in private conference, which is an act of love; but hee cannot properly be Å¿aid to Preach, which is an act of one in Office, and belongs onely to the Presbyters and PaÅ¿tors, and Å¿uch as for their Å¿ufficient learning and abilities are called unto the MiniÅ¿try and ordained and Å¿et apart to this Office: and Å¿uch onely were thoÅ¿e that were Å¿cattered, <hi>except the ApoÅ¿tles:</hi> and by all probability theÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters and Preachers that wee
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48122:166"/>
Å¿cattered were thoÅ¿e that were at the chooÅ¿ing of <hi>Matthias,</hi> the Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples and many more. So that for ought I can gather, all the beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> yet remained in their Å¿everall habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and dwellings, except thoÅ¿e that were haled to priÅ¿on. And therefore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity there muÅ¿t bee many AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations yet in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> that made all the ApoÅ¿tles abide and continue Å¿till among them all, which makes exceeding Å¿trong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove, that there were innumerable multitudes of Beleevers Å¿till in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which of neceÅ¿sitie were forced to divide their aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblies into more diÅ¿tributions and leÅ¿Å¿e Congregations then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and therefore rather multiplyed their aÅ¿Å¿emblies then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e, that by Å¿uch Privacy they might avoide perÅ¿ecution, as in our times, good ChriÅ¿tians here in <hi>London</hi> were wont to doe, when the Prelates were in their ruff. But out of this place I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where there were twelve of the moÅ¿t able, painfull, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Preachers in the world, and that gave themÅ¿elves continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prayer and the MiniÅ¿tery of the Word, and at Å¿uch a time as there was moÅ¿t need of preaching, and when they could not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely come together, by reaÅ¿on of the PerÅ¿ecution, and where there were innumerable multitudes of beleevers of all nations to be taught and preached unto in their Å¿everall Languages and tongues; there of neceÅ¿Å¿ity there muÅ¿t be Å¿everall Congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies for the imployment of them all, both Preachers and hearers. But in the Church of JeruÅ¿alem in the time of the hotteÅ¿t perÅ¿ecution, there were the twelve ApoÅ¿tles, the moÅ¿t able, painefull, and diligent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the world, and that gave themÅ¿elves continually to prayer, and the MiniÅ¿tery of the Word, and when they could not publickely come together, by reaÅ¿on of the perÅ¿ecution, and where there were innumerable multitudes of beleevers of all nations to be taught and preached unto in their Å¿everall Languages and tongues. Therefore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity there muÅ¿t be Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies for the employment of them all, both Preachers and hearers.</p>
               <p>For this SyllogiÅ¿me, all and every part of it, is Å¿o cleared by what hath formerly beene Å¿aid, as I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, no rationall man will call either of the PropoÅ¿itions in queÅ¿tion. But from the former place I thus further argue.</p>
               <p>Where there were Å¿uch multitudes of beleevers of all Nations and Countries, Å¿till remayning even in the hotteÅ¿t time of perÅ¿ecution, as
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48122:166"/>
had for many years imployed and continually taken up above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred painefull MiniÅ¿ters and Teachers, there they could not all meet together in any one place or roome, but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t bee diÅ¿tributed into divers Congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, if they would all be edified; and much more now they were forced unto it, if they would avoyd PerÅ¿ecution, and provide for their owne Å¿afety: But in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem in the hotteÅ¿t time of PerÅ¿ecution, there were Å¿uch multitudes of Beleevers of all Nations and Countries Å¿till remayning, as had for many yeeres imployed and continually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up above an hundred painefull MiniÅ¿ters and Teachers: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet together in any one place or roome: but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, if they would all be edified, and much more now were they forced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, if they would avoid perÅ¿ecution, and provide for their owne Å¿afety.</p>
               <p>The Major of this SyllogiÅ¿me by the very light of nature and reaÅ¿on, which we may not in a matter of diÅ¿putation eÅ¿pecially relinquiÅ¿h, is manifeÅ¿t and evident. For the <hi>Minor</hi> it is alÅ¿o appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the foregoing diÅ¿courÅ¿e: by which it is proved, that their Preachers only were Å¿cattered, and all thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters that were at the chooÅ¿ing the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Matthias,</hi> chap. 1. and many more that inÅ¿tructed the people: but for the people and beleevers, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned Å¿till in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem;</hi> the concluÅ¿ion therefore is firme. But I will now goe on to evince, that after the perÅ¿ecution, there were more beleevers Å¿till in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> then could all meet in any one place and room together: and therefore of neceÅ¿sity, they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies: And for proofe of this AÅ¿Å¿ertion, the places following will Å¿uffice: and firÅ¿t that in the 9. chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> verÅ¿e 31. <hi>Then had the Churches reÅ¿t through all Indaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were all edified, and walking in the feare of the Lord, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, were multiplyed.</hi> Out of which words it may evidently appeare, that perÅ¿ecution is but the bellowes of the GoÅ¿pel; and that which the enemies of the GoÅ¿pel thinke to be a meanes of extinguiÅ¿hing the light of it, makes it but more gloriouÅ¿ly Å¿hine forth, and the farther to Å¿pread its rayes: for by blowing and puffing at it, they Å¿pread it the more, and extend it here and there farther abroad; as wee Å¿ee by this perÅ¿ecution and Å¿cattering of thoÅ¿e Preachers and MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel: for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48122:167"/>
this their diÅ¿perÅ¿ion, by which the perÅ¿ecutors had thought to have waÅ¿ted the Churches, was an occaÅ¿ion of the multiplication of them, and the cauÅ¿e of the increaÅ¿ing of Beleevers every where.</p>

            <div n="200-299" type="pages">
               <p>And here wee may alÅ¿o obÅ¿erve, <hi>That by how much more the rage of the enemy is great and violent,</hi> by Å¿o much it is leÅ¿Å¿e dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for this great perÅ¿ecution was but Å¿hort. And it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but they who were Å¿cattered by perÅ¿ecution, would upon the ceaÅ¿ing of it, returne againe to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> as moÅ¿t people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

And this alÅ¿o muÅ¿t needs be a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to induce others to the love of that Religion, which they Å¿ee God Å¿o much favoureth the Lovers and profeÅ¿Å¿ors of; the which the Lord Å¿o preÅ¿erveth, comforteth, and followeth with Å¿o many mercies, and upholdeth in all their afflictions and tryals, never forÅ¿aking nor never leaving them.

Out of the which words I thus argue.</p>
               <p>That Church before the PerÅ¿ecution and DiÅ¿perÅ¿ion of whoÅ¿e Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters and PaÅ¿tors, was Å¿o numerous and had Å¿uch multitudes of Beleevers in it, of all Nations, as they could not all meet in any one plaee or roome, for edification, and to partake in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, but were forced to preach in divers and Å¿undry places, as in the Temple, and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e; and after the perÅ¿ecution ceaÅ¿ed and the Church had reÅ¿t, was greatlier yet multiplied then before; and whoÅ¿e companies were more &amp; more in number increaÅ¿ed, they of neceÅ¿Å¿ity could not al meet together in any one place or room for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip, but muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be diÅ¿tributed into divers and Å¿undry Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies if they would all bee edified. But the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> before the PerÅ¿ecution and DisperÅ¿ion of her MiniÅ¿ters and PaÅ¿tors, was Å¿o numerous and had Å¿uch multitudes of Beleevers in it of all Nations, as they could not all meet in any one place or roome for edification<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip; but were forced to preach in divers and Å¿undry places, as in the Temple, and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e; and after the PerÅ¿ecution ceaÅ¿ed and the Churches had reÅ¿t, was greatlier yet multiplyed than before: and whoÅ¿e companies were

more and more in number increaÅ¿ed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Of neceÅ¿sity after the PerÅ¿ecution there were more beleevers in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> then could all meet together in any one place or roome for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip, but muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily bee diÅ¿tributed into divers Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies if they would bee edified.</p>
               <p>For the Major beÅ¿ides common underÅ¿tanding and ordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on which confirme it, it is manifeÅ¿t from the 2, 3. and 5. <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which in expreÅ¿Å¿e words Å¿ignifieth, That they met daily in the Temple, and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, yea in every houÅ¿e, and therefore that is true and out of all doubt: and for the <hi>Minor</hi> it is evident from the place above cited, where it is Å¿aid, The Churches, (that is to Å¿ay, all the Churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> of which <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was the Mother Church) <hi>were multiplyed,</hi> the word in the Originall <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And truly that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the firÅ¿t of the <hi>Galatians</hi> is an excellent Argument to evince that there were more Congregations in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> then one, where proving that hee had not received the GoÅ¿pel which hee preached, from men, but from God, hee uÅ¿eth this reaÅ¿on; That if hee had received it from men, it muÅ¿t bee from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and from the ApoÅ¿tles; for the Gentiles were ignorant of it, and hee was to carry the GoÅ¿pel unto them, and therefore they could not teach it him; and to prove that hee received it not from the ApoÅ¿tles; hee thus Å¿peaketh of himÅ¿elfe.</p>
               <p>When it pleaÅ¿ed God to reveale his Sonne unto mee, that I might preach him amongÅ¿t the Heathen, I immediately I conferred not with fleÅ¿h and blood, neither went I up to IeruÅ¿alem, to them that were ApoÅ¿tles before me; but I went into <hi>Arabia;</hi> Then after three yeares I went up to <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> to Å¿ee <hi>Peter,</hi> and aboade with him fifteene dayes; but other of the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿aw I none, Å¿ave <hi>James</hi> the Lords Brother.</p>
               <p>Out of the which words beÅ¿ides the Å¿ingular teÅ¿timony wee have that the preaching and writings of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> are the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48122:168"/>
of <hi>IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and the Word of the <hi>living God,</hi> againÅ¿t the PapiÅ¿ts: we may evidently gather againÅ¿t the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that after the perÅ¿ecution <hi>there were more believers in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem <hi>then either did or could all meet in one place:</hi> for in Å¿aying <hi>that he was with</hi> Peter <hi>fifteen dayes, but in all that time Å¿aw none of the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿ave</hi> Iames, this I Å¿ay, is a Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Argument to prove more Congregations and aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of beleevers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which Å¿o im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the ApoÅ¿tles in their Å¿everall MiniÅ¿teries asthey had not Å¿o much Å¿pare time to viÅ¿it <hi>Paul,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> alÅ¿o was Å¿o taken up in preaching there, that he had no leiÅ¿ure to viÅ¿it them. And for the diligence of the ApoÅ¿tles in their MiniÅ¿try it is Å¿aid in the Å¿ixth of the <hi>Acts, That they gave themÅ¿elves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to prayer and to the MiniÅ¿tery of the Word:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were never idle; and that the ApoÅ¿tles either all or the moÅ¿t of them continued reÅ¿ident for many years in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> before they diÅ¿tributed themÅ¿elves into Å¿everall Nations and Countries; and that very few of them were Å¿ent abroad, there are frequent teÅ¿timonies in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the ApoÅ¿tles; neither as yet did I ever hear it Å¿crupled, or call'd in queÅ¿tion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ApoÅ¿tles were then there or no, when <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem;</hi> for it is taken <hi>pro confeÅ¿Å¿o,</hi> that either all or the moÅ¿t of them were at that time in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> neither doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿ay, I Å¿aw none of the other ApoÅ¿tles becauÅ¿e they were abÅ¿ent, or were gone to Preach the GoÅ¿pell in other places.

Å¿o that it Å¿tandeth with all reaÅ¿on, that while he was in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem</hi> he was very Å¿edulous in Preaching, as who had both Å¿trength of body, and Gods Å¿peciall aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, and his immediate inÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alwayes to help him in his MiniÅ¿tery; Å¿o that I conceive, as of charity I am bound, that <hi>Paul</hi> was daily in one aÅ¿Å¿embly or other: now if there had been at that time, no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem then could have met in one place, congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and AÅ¿Å¿embly,</hi> then of neceÅ¿Å¿ity <hi>Paul</hi> muÅ¿t have Å¿een the other ApoÅ¿tles there, as well as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> (for they alÅ¿o were good Church-men, to Å¿peake a little in the Prelats dialect) and they never left the Word, but were alwayes taken up either in praying or preaching amongÅ¿t them in the Temple, and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, yea in every houÅ¿e: and if there had been but one Congregation or AÅ¿Å¿embly of beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> the ApoÅ¿tles would daily upon all occaÅ¿ion have been with their flock: Now in that <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aw them not in all that time he was in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> it is evidently apparent <hi>there were more Congregations of beleevers in the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>then one, and more ChriÅ¿tians then could</hi> all meet in any one <hi>or a few places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed to a place or two more for the further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this truth <hi>Acts</hi> 12. verÅ¿e 24. It is Å¿aid there, <hi>that the word of God grew and multiplped.</hi> Here alÅ¿o we have another good effect of a new Å¿ierce perÅ¿ecution in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem;</hi> it increaÅ¿ed the number and multitude of Believers there after the PerÅ¿ecutor was taken away, <hi>For the Word of God grew and multiplyed,</hi> Å¿aith the Holy GhoÅ¿t. Out of which words I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Where the Word of God daily more and more grew and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the perÅ¿ecution, that is to Å¿ay, where there were more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes and greater numbers of Believers added unto the Church; through the MiniÅ¿tery and preaching of the GoÅ¿pell then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which notwithÅ¿tanding was then Å¿o numerous, as they could not all meete in any one place or roome, to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification, there of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into diverÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification. But in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> after a double perÅ¿ecution, the Word of God daily more and more grew and mnltiplyed; that is to Å¿ay, there were more multitudes and greater numbers of Believers added unto the Church through the miniÅ¿tery
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48122:169"/>
and preaching of the GoÅ¿pell by the ApoÅ¿tles then was before: which notwithÅ¿tanding was then Å¿o numerous, as they could not all poÅ¿Å¿ibly meet in any one place and roome. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Beleevers after the PerÅ¿ecution then before: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they could not all meete in any one place or roome to communicate in all the Ordinances, but muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies if they would all be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>For the Major I conceive it is Å¿o evidently clear as no man of ordinary underÅ¿tanding will not Å¿ee the truth of it. For the Minor, the Text proveth it: and if we will compare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Scripture, the truth of it will by and by be out of controverÅ¿ie, for in the 15. of <hi>Iohn</hi> verÅ¿e 16. Our Saviour Å¿peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there to his DiÅ¿ciples, Å¿aith, <hi>I have choÅ¿en you and ordained you that you Å¿hould go and bring forth fruite, and that your fruite Å¿hould remaine:</hi> that is, I have choÅ¿e you to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pell and convert men, which is the fruite of preaching the Word; and cauÅ¿eth the multiplication of Beleevers, for Faith commeth by hearing, <hi>Romans</hi> 10. Now this Scripture is here fulfilled, for it is Å¿aid, that the Word of God grew and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed; that is, it brought forth the great fruite and increaÅ¿e of multitudes of Beleevers, and converted many, notwithÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the perÅ¿ecutions that were raiÅ¿ed againÅ¿t it and the Church. So that the concluÅ¿ion muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow from the premiÅ¿es, and it is moÅ¿t apparent, that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in JeruÅ¿alem after the PerÅ¿ecution. But in the 21 Chapter, 20 VerÅ¿e. there is a place that putteth an end to this ControverÅ¿ie; and with the which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my firÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ertion. In theÅ¿e words, <hi>Thou Å¿eeÅ¿t Brother</hi> (Å¿aith Saint <hi>James,</hi> and the Presbyters of JeruÅ¿alem to Saint <hi>Paul) how many ten thouÅ¿ands</hi> (for Å¿o it is in the Originall, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>of Jewes there are which beleeve, and they are all zealous of the Law:</hi> In this place the EvangeliÅ¿t Å¿peakes of the Inhabitants of IeruÅ¿alem that were Beleevers, and had their abode there, and not of Å¿trangers, as our Brethren Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e; and Å¿uch as they conceive were come up to JeruÅ¿alem at that time to the feaÅ¿t of <hi>PentecoÅ¿t,</hi> at which they thinke <hi>Paul</hi> then was: which opinion of theirs might be confuted with many reaÅ¿ons, if it were neceÅ¿Å¿ary; Å¿ome of the which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48122:169"/>
I Å¿hall briefly Å¿et downe. As firÅ¿t, it is well knowne that the feaÅ¿t of PentecoÅ¿t laÅ¿ted but one day, and that in the time of Wheat-harveÅ¿t, when ordinarily but few came to JeruÅ¿alem. BeÅ¿ides none of the Jewes that lived out of the Countrey of Judaea, and the confines of IÅ¿rael, were enjoyned to come to that feaÅ¿t, or any other of the feaÅ¿ts Å¿o farre as I remember; neither indeed could they, dwelling in Å¿uch remote countryes; except they Å¿pent all their time in running about. So that as I conceive is was arbitrary in the Iewes, that dwelt in other countries, whether they would come or no to all thoÅ¿e Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall FeaÅ¿ts: though I have this opinion of Å¿ome of the moÅ¿t zealous of them, and beÅ¿t ableÅ¿t and richeÅ¿t of them, and that had time and leaÅ¿ure, that they would Å¿pare neither paines nor coÅ¿ts, Å¿o they might enjoy the Ordinances and the Å¿ociety of their Brethren. BeÅ¿ides we reade but of very few Å¿trangers, that were at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> at this time when <hi>Paul</hi> was there, and they were them of <hi>AÅ¿ia,</hi> which were perÅ¿ecutors rather then believers, as the Å¿tory relateth, verÅ¿e 27, 28. Now the multitude of which there is mention made in this place in the 22. verÅ¿e, they were all Believers, and were inhabitants, and Å¿uch as were well knowne to Saint <hi>Iames</hi> and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and were all Å¿trangers to <hi>Paul;</hi> and Å¿uch as had onely heard that <hi>Paul taught all the Jewes that were among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to forÅ¿ake</hi> MoÅ¿es, &amp;c. And therefore none of theÅ¿e many ten thouÅ¿ands were of the believing <hi>Iewes amongÅ¿t the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> for they are clearly diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from them: for it is Å¿aid, that thoÅ¿e Myriads of believing <hi>Iewes were informed that Paul taught all the Iewes among the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. They then were informed that <hi>Paul</hi> had taught others. The Iewes among the Gentiles were they who <hi>Paul</hi> had Å¿o taught, and how could they be in the number of them that were informed? Had they neede to be informed by others what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had taught them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves? Therefore they muÅ¿t needs be the believing Iewes of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem, and the inhabitants and dwellers there. So that out of the Text I thus argue.</p>
               <p>Many ten thouÅ¿ands of Believers could not all meet at any one time, or in any one place or congregation to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification; but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e and Å¿undry congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, if they would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48122:170"/>
in all acts of worÅ¿hip and be edified. But in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> after all the perÅ¿ecutions, there were many ten thouÅ¿ands believers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they could not all meet together at any one time, or in any one place or congregation, for the enjoying of all acts of worÅ¿hip to edification; but of neceÅ¿Å¿ity muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e and Å¿undry congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, they would partake in all the Ordinances, and be edified.</p>
               <p>For the Major all reaÅ¿on will aÅ¿Å¿ent unto it; for the Minor, the text it Å¿elfe confirmes it; neither doth the word <hi>Myrias</hi> or <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riades</hi> ever expreÅ¿Å¿e leÅ¿Å¿e then ten thouÅ¿and, as might out of many places of Scripture be proved and divers authors. And truly to any man but of an ordinary underÅ¿tanding it would Å¿eem Å¿trange, yea an incredible thing that JeruÅ¿alem the Theater of Å¿o many miracles and where there were twelve ApoÅ¿tles, and the moÅ¿t of them for the moÅ¿t part reÅ¿ident, and Å¿o many famous Preachers and PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and who at the firÅ¿t beginning of their MiniÅ¿try, after they had received the gifts of the holy GhoÅ¿t by their powerfull preaching and a few miracles had in a Å¿hort time converted above eight thouÅ¿and people, beÅ¿ides great multitudes both of men and women, beÅ¿ides PrieÅ¿ts, and who preached dayly in the Temple, and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, and that for above twenty yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as it is againÅ¿t all reaÅ¿on, Å¿o it is againÅ¿t the expreÅ¿Å¿e words of the holy Scriptures as hath out of many places in the foregoing diÅ¿courÅ¿e bin Å¿ufficiently made appear, and out of the place laÅ¿t cited, which doth affirme, <hi>That there were many ten thouÅ¿and beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem after all the perÅ¿ecutions; all which could not meet in any one place to enjoy all Acts of WorÅ¿hip, no not in a few.</hi> Whether therfore it hath not by this and the many other teÅ¿timonies of holy Scripture and the arguments out of both been Å¿ufficiently proved, <hi>That there were many Congregations in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> I report my Å¿elfe to any that have not the pearle of prejudice in the eye of their judgement? And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿poke for the proof of my firÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ertion.</p>

                  </gap> Å¿ignifie Å¿ome great number that cannot Å¿uddainly be told, as MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirms, then it Å¿ignifies more then ten thouÅ¿and; for ten thouÅ¿and is not Å¿o great a number, nor Å¿uch a number but may without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty be Å¿uddainly told: for wee have read of five thouÅ¿and that have Å¿uddainly been fed, and of foure thouÅ¿and at another time, beÅ¿ides women and children that have all likewiÅ¿e been Å¿uddainly fed; and therefore ten thouÅ¿and may Å¿uddainly be told; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoÅ¿e five thouÅ¿and could meet together, and be Å¿uddainly fed in the fields, I will not be induced to beleeve that any one place or roome, in a Citie or houÅ¿e could have contained them all to communicate in al the ordinances. Now then if according to Mr. <hi>Konllys</hi> his learning there were many greatnumbers of Beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> that could not Å¿uddainly be told; all rationall men will gather, <hi>that they could not all meet in any one place or congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip;</hi> this I Å¿ay every good accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and intelligible man will eaÅ¿ily gather.</p>

               <p>Even Å¿o it is here, <hi>Beza</hi> and our TranÅ¿lators taking the liberty of Interpreters render the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And now I will briefly examine his following diÅ¿courÅ¿e, though it be little to the purpoÅ¿e, the vanity of the which having been Å¿o often againe and againe diÅ¿covered in the forgoing treatice. And then I will come to my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> anÅ¿wer. MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his words are theÅ¿e. <hi>Neither can the Doctor make good from thoÅ¿e Scriptures he produceth pag.</hi> 62. to wit <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. verÅ¿. 21. 22. Chapter 6. ver. 2. 4. and chapter the 8. 1. that there were almoÅ¿t an hundred <hi>Preachers and MiniÅ¿tes, beÅ¿ides the twelve ApoÅ¿tles in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> &amp;c. for anÅ¿wer in a few words, I boldly affirme what the Scripture teacheth me, viz: that before the perÅ¿ecution we read of in the 8. chap. v. 1. and before the diÅ¿perÅ¿ion and Å¿cattering of the believers, beÅ¿ides the ApoÅ¿tles there were in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> almoÅ¿t an hundred Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and MiniÅ¿ters. And for this the Word of God is cleare and evident: as in <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. verÅ¿e 21. 22. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (Å¿aith Saint <hi>Peter) of theÅ¿e men which have companyed with us, all the time the Lord IeÅ¿us went in and out amongÅ¿t us beginning from the baptiÅ¿me of Iohn, unto that Å¿ame day that he was taken up from us, muÅ¿t one be ordayned to be a witneÅ¿Å¿e with us of the reÅ¿urrection; and they appointed, two</hi> IoÅ¿eph <hi>called</hi> BarÅ¿abas <hi>and</hi> Matthias.</p>
               <p>Out of the which words theÅ¿e inÅ¿uing truths doe neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow; firÅ¿t, that they that were aÅ¿Å¿embled here with <hi>Peter</hi> and the other ApoÅ¿tles were ancient DiÅ¿ciples; for Å¿aith the text, they were Å¿uch as had companyed with the ApoÅ¿tles, all the time the Lord <hi>IeÅ¿us</hi> went in and out amongÅ¿t them, beginning from the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp;c. and therefore muÅ¿t needs be Å¿uch as had been dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Schollers all that time in ChriÅ¿ts Schoole and Å¿uch as were well inÅ¿tructed in all ChriÅ¿tian principles as is eaÅ¿ily gathered out of the very words; for any one of them were thought fit in the ApoÅ¿tles judgement to Å¿ucceede <hi>Iudas</hi> in his place and to be an ApoÅ¿tle, in regard that they had heard and Å¿eene all things ChriÅ¿t both Å¿pake and did till his death and aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion; for otherwiÅ¿e they could not have been witneÅ¿Å¿es of all things to his reÅ¿urrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All this I Å¿ay in the firÅ¿t place doth neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this truth alÅ¿o doth inÅ¿ue out of the forgoing words, that either all thoÅ¿e men were MiniÅ¿ters, or the moÅ¿t of them: for in expreÅ¿Å¿e termes it is related, that they had accompanied the ApoÅ¿tles the time the Lord IeÅ¿us went in and out amongÅ¿t
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48122:174"/>
them, beginning from the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> untill ChriÅ¿ts aÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion. Now amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that converÅ¿ed with the ApoÅ¿tles, beÅ¿ids <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿chollers ChriÅ¿t had Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples all MiniÅ¿ters, which he Å¿ent out two by two into all Cities to preach and to worke wonders, who came back again to him, rejoycing that the Divells were Å¿ubject unto them, and they Å¿til wayted upon ChriÅ¿ts MiniÅ¿try; we reade alÅ¿o of many of <hi>Iohns</hi> DiÅ¿ciples that came unto ChriÅ¿t, all which were MiniÅ¿ters likewiÅ¿e, and Å¿uch as preached and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: and all theÅ¿e were with <hi>Peter</hi> and the reÅ¿t of the ApoÅ¿tles at this time, &amp; continued with them till the perÅ¿ecution: for we reade of no departure of them, or Å¿eparation till then: and all theÅ¿e were men of Å¿ingular gifts and graces, and Å¿uch as by the ApoÅ¿tles were thought fit to Å¿ucceed <hi>Iudas</hi> in his ApoÅ¿tleÅ¿hip, and therefore were all Preachers and MiniÅ¿ters by Office, and were Å¿uch as had been formerly Å¿ent out by ChriÅ¿t or <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> to preach and baptize and to worke Miracles, and therefore I affirme were all MiniÅ¿ters and Preachers by their place and Office; and not only gifted brethren: and the Scripture is Å¿o cleere in it, as nothing can be more apparent: for it Å¿aith <hi>Wherefore</hi> of theÅ¿e <hi>men which have companyed with us all the time the Lord IeÅ¿us went in and out amongÅ¿t us beginning from the baptiÅ¿me of</hi> Iohn <hi>unto the Å¿ame day he was taken up from us, muÅ¿t one be ordained</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t needs be ancient and inveterate DiÅ¿ciples and MiniÅ¿ters by Office, or otherwiÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles would not have judged them fit for an ApoÅ¿tleÅ¿hip. And all theÅ¿e continued with the ApoÅ¿tles in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> for ought any thing related to the contrary till their perÅ¿ecution, and were of the Presbytery in that Church: and then it is Å¿aid they were all Å¿cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Å¿aving the ApoÅ¿tles: therefore thoÅ¿e that went abroad Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Word after their diÅ¿perÅ¿ion and publiÅ¿hing the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, were MiniÅ¿ters and Preachers by Office, which taught by the way of Sermons in all places where they came, and not out of charity as gifted brethren as I have formerly Å¿ufficiently proved upon that place, whether I referre the Reader, and therefore Å¿hall not feare here to conclude that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity there muÅ¿t be an innumerable company of believers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> that had imployed Å¿o many faithfull MiniÅ¿ters and diligent Preachers almoÅ¿t an hundred Å¿o long a time, and the which in this their hotteÅ¿t perÅ¿ecution tooke up and imployed

twelve of the moÅ¿t painfull and laborious MiniÅ¿ters in the world, who Å¿pent all their time in Praying and Preaching amongÅ¿t them: and for the performance of each of their duties, all intelligible ChriÅ¿tians will alÅ¿o gather, that they muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily have Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies: for all of them could not preach together at one time and in one place or roome, and therefore there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations even under the perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> the which afterward were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly multitplyed and increaÅ¿ed when the Churches had reÅ¿t as the Scripture recordeth, the which amounted to many ten thouÅ¿ands; all the which could not then poÅ¿Å¿ibly meete in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or a few. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have anÅ¿wered to what ever MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> had vainely and impiouÅ¿ly to Cavill againÅ¿t Å¿uch of my Arguments as they thought themÅ¿elves beÅ¿t able by their learning to deale with, for the Å¿educing of unÅ¿table and ungrounded people. And now I come to what my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> hath to Å¿ay againÅ¿t all my foregoing Arguments. WhoÅ¿e words are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>But I come briefly to your Arguments, whereby you would prove your ClaÅ¿Å¿icall PreÅ¿byterian government, and Å¿o upward. The paterne hereof you take from the ChriÅ¿tian Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem.</hi> Hereof many Arguments, or rather words, and tautologies you multiply, and toile your Å¿elfe and vexe your Reader withall, which you might have reduced to one. It is in Å¿umme this.</p>
               <p>In <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> were many ChriÅ¿tian Congregations, and all theÅ¿e made but one Church, and Å¿o were governed by one PreÅ¿bytery.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> being the prime ApoÅ¿tolicke Church, is a paterne for all Å¿ucceeding Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> all Church government ought to be regulated by that, and conÅ¿equently by a PreÅ¿bytery over many Congregations.</p>
               <p>As for your indefinite enumeration of thoÅ¿e multitudes baptized by <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> and by ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples, we take no notice of them, unleÅ¿Å¿e formed into a Church or Churches: but following the expreÅ¿Å¿e Scripture, the firÅ¿t formed Church we finde is in <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>2.</hi> which though conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of five thouÅ¿and, yet it was one intire particular Church, and not Churches; and they continued daily <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> with one accorde in one place together <hi>(verÅ¿. 1.)</hi> and in the Temple <hi>(ver. 44. 46.)</hi> growing from an hundred and twenty <hi>(Acts 1. verÅ¿. 15.)</hi> to three thouÅ¿and more <hi>(Chap. 2. 41.)</hi> and then
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48122:175"/>
in all to five thouÅ¿and <hi>(chap. 4. 4.</hi> and all theÅ¿e but one Church, which aÅ¿Å¿embled together to heare the Word in the Temple; and although they wanted a convenient place Å¿o Å¿pacious, as whereinto break bread, or receive the Lords Supper altogether, Å¿o as they were conÅ¿trained to Å¿ever themÅ¿elves into divers companies, in Å¿everall private houÅ¿es to communicate; yet this Å¿evering was not a dividing of the church into Å¿o many diÅ¿tinct formall Churches, or Church bodyes, being but Å¿o many branches of one and the Å¿ame particular Church; which though you call Å¿o many Congregations, yet properly Å¿o many Churches they were not. And therefore you never reade the Churches at or in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> but the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem.</hi> And this no nationall Church neither, witneÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e Churches in <hi>Iudea</hi> Gal. <hi>1. 22.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon I anÅ¿wer to your Argument; and firÅ¿t to your propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition. I deny that thoÅ¿e congregations you name are Å¿o many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches properly Å¿o called, having their diÅ¿tinct Officers and Members united into one Church body respectively: This I put you to prove: And without proving it, your <hi>11.</hi> or <hi>12.</hi> Å¿heets spent about that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prove to be meer waste paper. And for your aÅ¿Å¿umption, that the Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> as being a prime ApoÅ¿tolick Church, is therefore a pattern for all Å¿ucceeding Churches, and therefore for a ClaÅ¿Å¿icall PreÅ¿bytery over many Churches: You muÅ¿t firÅ¿t prove your propoÅ¿ition, as before, that there were many Churches in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem conÅ¿tituted in their diÅ¿tinct formes and bodyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly it being no more then one entire particular Church (and not any DioceÅ¿an, or Provinciall Church, or the PreÅ¿bytery thereof claÅ¿Å¿icall (as you would beare us in hand) it is a paterne for all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches in Å¿ucceeding ages; and yet by your favour not Å¿o perfect a paterne, as no ApoÅ¿tolick Church beÅ¿ides it Å¿hould alÅ¿o come in to make up the paterne compleat. For wee are neceÅ¿Å¿arily to take all the Churches in the New TeÅ¿tament together, to make up one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and perfect Church paterne. For in the Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> wee find election of Officers, but wee find not expreÅ¿Å¿ed that part of diÅ¿cipline for caÅ¿ting out of corrupt Members, as in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and Å¿o in the reÅ¿t. For the Churches were not brought forth to full perfection in one day. Their very conÅ¿titution had a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall growth. The Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> had not at firÅ¿t Deacons, till there was a neceÅ¿Å¿ity; and the largeneÅ¿Å¿e of the Church required Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Deacons, which is no patterne for every Church to have Å¿even Deacons. The Å¿umme is, to make up a compleat paterne, not onely
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48122:176"/>
the Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> but that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> thoÅ¿e of <hi>Galatia,</hi> that of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and the reÅ¿t, are to be conferred together, that each may caÅ¿t in its Å¿hot to make up the full reckoning, that Å¿o what is not expreÅ¿t in one, may be Å¿upplyed by the reÅ¿t, to make one entire platforme. For the Scripture conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of many parts, as Å¿o many Members in one body; one Member cannot Å¿ay to another I have no need of thee, <hi>1 Cor. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, the Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> if it muÅ¿t be a paterne for all other Churches, then in this that all other Churches muÅ¿t be Å¿ubject to Å¿ome one Church, becauÅ¿e <hi>(Acts 15.)</hi> things in queÅ¿tion were there debated, and determined, and Å¿ent to other Churches to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved. But for as much, as that Church, at that time in thoÅ¿e things was infallibly guided by the Holy GhoÅ¿t, wherewith the ApoÅ¿tles there were inÅ¿pired, in which reÅ¿pect their reÅ¿olutions were with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it pleaÅ¿ed the Holy GhoÅ¿t and us (that which no particular Church Å¿ince the ApoÅ¿tles could ever Å¿ay) it followeth that the Church then at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> remaines not in all things a paterne for other Churches; for a paterne muÅ¿t be in all things imitable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>LaÅ¿tly, for Appeales Å¿o much agitated, and preÅ¿Å¿ed, I have Å¿aid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before, and elÅ¿e-where (as in my vindication) to vindicate the right uÅ¿e of that in point of Church matters. And Å¿o I paÅ¿Å¿e briefly from your firÅ¿t queÅ¿tion to your Å¿econd; which is concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gathering of Churches, and admitting of Members and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48122:176"/>
him, and his frothy Pamphlets and language can teÅ¿tifie: for he Å¿pares not the King himÅ¿elfe, nor Parliament upon all occaÅ¿ions, to the one of which notwithÅ¿tanding hee was not onely obliged in all Loyaltie as a Å¿ubject, but as a Å¿peciall Å¿ervant: and to the other, if ever any man was ingaged in all the obligations of duty and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hee was, who is bound unto that great Councell for his Liberty, which is the life of life, and for his honour and good name, which is better then life; and yet hee hath Å¿pared neither, but hath moÅ¿t unchriÅ¿tianly, and undutifully, and that publickly and privately aÅ¿perÅ¿ed them upon all occurrences: and therefore if at pleaÅ¿ure hee can vilipend, Å¿leight, traduce and Å¿peake evill of thoÅ¿e dignities, I may not thinke my Å¿elfe agrieved, if hee moÅ¿t unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly in his Å¿criblings abuÅ¿e me.</p>
               <p>Yea, I am Å¿o farre from being offended at him, for this his Å¿o dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with mee, as I thinke my Å¿elfe honoured by it, and account it matter of rejoycing, having learned that leÅ¿Å¿on of my heavenly MaÅ¿ter, <hi>That when men revile me, reproach me and Å¿peake all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evill of me falÅ¿ely, for his names Å¿ake, that I Å¿hould rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for Å¿o they have done by all the Prophets, Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>Luke</hi> the 6. and <hi>Paul</hi> tooke Å¿uch dealing from the falÅ¿e Teachers of his time, for matter of triumph, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 10.) Å¿aying, <hi>I take pleaÅ¿ure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceÅ¿sities, in perÅ¿ecutions, in diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es for ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ake, for when I am weake then am I Å¿trong.</hi> This I apply unto my Å¿elfe, who have Å¿uffered as much from him, and thoÅ¿e of his party, in reproaches, in perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and in all manner of reviling and blaÅ¿ting language, as their daily Pamphlets and words can witneÅ¿Å¿e, as any man now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and for no other cauÅ¿e that I know of, but that I maintaine the truth againÅ¿t error, and oppoÅ¿e the novelties and groundleÅ¿Å¿e opinions of the times; all the which will the more aggravate their judgement; becauÅ¿e they did as immoderately prayÅ¿e me (as can be proved) before they knew my differing opinion from them, as they doe now maliciouÅ¿ly and cauÅ¿eleÅ¿ly vituperate mee: and the Lord knowes, that I am not changed in my opinion in any knowne truth from what I both beleeved and to my power pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿ed, above theÅ¿e thirty yeares; neither had I any reaÅ¿on to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from my Principles, they being grounded upon the unerring word of truth: and therefore for my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and his parties Å¿leighting of mee, and my indeavours, I wave them as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48122:177"/>
meere Grolleries, knowing that my bookes have beene read by more judicious men, then either himÅ¿elfe, or any of his Fraternity, and have had the approbation of learned men at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>And now I come to his Argument, for hee hath not Å¿o much candour, and faire dealing in him, as to lay downe my reaÅ¿ons, that the Reader might Å¿ee the grounds of truth, but conceals them all, and makes a SyllogiÅ¿me of his owne, or elÅ¿e hath borrowed it, from Å¿ome of his American friends, and fetcht it out of the new World: For I never read the like in either <hi>Europian</hi> or <hi>AÅ¿ian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; no nor in any <hi>African</hi> Author: &amp; yet that Country was famous for MonÅ¿ters, and uÅ¿ually eÅ¿teemed to be the Mother and NurÅ¿ery of prodigious births, and yet Å¿uch a SyllogiÅ¿me I never Å¿aw brought forth by any of that Nation, as this of his framing: and I am confident that every Å¿ucking SophiÅ¿ter will bee ready truly to Å¿ay of it, as hee falÅ¿ely Å¿peakes of thoÅ¿e multitudes baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples, that they were not formed into a Church or Churches: the Å¿ame I Å¿ay, will any but a Novice in the Art of diÅ¿putation conclude of his SyllogiÅ¿me, that it hath neither forme, mood, or figure: and that I could eaÅ¿ily make evident, were it not for miÅ¿pending of precious time, and that I deÅ¿ire not to diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e the good old Father, in diÅ¿covering his nakedneÅ¿Å¿e, and infirmities, who if hee were Å¿o highly offended with mee, becauÅ¿e hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived I meant him, when I Å¿pake of a Basket-hilted beard, how much would hee be inraged, if I Å¿hould diÅ¿cover his ignorance, and make it appeare, that hee is a meer Å¿tranger in the art of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which hee would perÅ¿wade the world hee were Å¿o great a MaÅ¿ter in.</p>
               <p>But leaving that, I will come the matter in hand, which is of publicke concernment: and in the firÅ¿t place, I muÅ¿t needs blame him for his Sacriledge and unjuÅ¿t dealing, who at one time robbs the Church of ChriÅ¿t of Å¿uch multitudes of believers as were converted and baptized by the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and by them added unto the Church of the Iews, who were then the only viÅ¿ible Church upon earth, and proclaimed by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf <hi>(Iohn</hi> 4.) to be the only true worÅ¿hippers, who Å¿aith that <hi>Salvation was of the</hi> Iews, <hi>and that the</hi> Samaritans, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hipped they knew not what.</hi> Now to the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> thoÅ¿e true worÅ¿hippers, thoÅ¿e that were converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t</hi> and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples, and baptized into ChriÅ¿t, were
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48122:177"/>
added: and therfore they were worthy to have been taken notice of by my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> as formed into a Church or Churches, if believing in ChriÅ¿t, repenting and being baptized in his name and by his authority, be Å¿ufficient to make men members of a Church: for as the Catholicke viÅ¿ible Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of many Nationall, Provinciall, and Presbyterian Churches, Å¿o did the Nationall church of the Iews of many citie &amp; Countries, Churches which were in their Dialect called Synagogues, which is the Å¿ame with our Churches both in cities and countries, as all the learned well know; for in all thoÅ¿e Synagogues they partaked daily in the morall worÅ¿hip, and had the Preaching of the law and the Keyes of Heaven. Now then when thoÅ¿e multitudes that I enumerated in my arguments, baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles, and the Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples were all gathered into ChriÅ¿ts fold, and made his Å¿heepe and true believers, and that by the Preaching of the GoÅ¿pell, and hearing of the voyce of their PaÅ¿tors, and had amongÅ¿t them all thoÅ¿e Å¿ealing and diÅ¿crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Ordinances, that were Å¿ufficient not only to forme them into a church or churches, but to difference them from Pagans and Infidels, <hi>as who were</hi> IÅ¿raelites, <hi>to whom pertained the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the glory, the Covenants and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the promiÅ¿es,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. verÅ¿. 4. all which I conceive were Å¿ufficent and avaylable to make any then living, members of ChriÅ¿ts Church.</p>
               <p>I Å¿ay, when they had circumciÅ¿ion, and the PaÅ¿Å¿oever, &amp; baptiÅ¿me, and the Law and the GoÅ¿pell and that worÅ¿hip of God that he had eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed amongÅ¿t them, and were his peculiar people, of whom ChriÅ¿t had given this teÅ¿timony that they were his true worÅ¿hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and when they were alÅ¿o gathered in according to Gods own appointment, by the Å¿ound of the GoÅ¿pell and by the preaching of Faith and Repentance and by the MiniÅ¿try of the Word, as all the Prophets had formerly gathered Churches, then thoÅ¿e that were Baptized by <hi>Iohn, who was</hi> a Prophet Å¿ent of God <hi>(Luke</hi> the 3.) and Å¿ent to baptize <hi>(Iohn</hi> the 1. 33.) and thoÅ¿e that were baptized by the DiÅ¿ciples <hi>who</hi> were Å¿ent from ChriÅ¿t as he was from his Father who Å¿aid <hi>Go teach all nations baptiÅ¿ing them, &amp;c.</hi> all they I Å¿ay ought by my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all the Independents to be taken notice of, as formed into a Church or Churches, what Å¿o ever he and <hi>I. S.</hi> Å¿ay to the contrary, who in this agree, that thoÅ¿e
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48122:178"/>
that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> and by <hi>ChriÅ¿ts</hi> DiÅ¿ciples were no ChriÅ¿tians, much <hi>leÅ¿Å¿e caÅ¿t into a Church mould, according to the New-TeÅ¿tament forme, and leÅ¿t of all that they were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one ChriÅ¿tian Church at</hi> IeruÅ¿alem. TheÅ¿e are <hi>J. S.</hi> his formall words pag. 9. So that whiles theÅ¿e men vvill diÅ¿pute againÅ¿t the truth, they blaÅ¿pheme and give the Spirit of God the lye: for ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿aid, that they that heare his DiÅ¿ciples, heare him, and that they that heare his voyce are his Å¿heepe; novv, vvhen all thoÅ¿e that vvere converted by their MiniÅ¿try, and vvere in token of their faith and obedience baptized, and had given up their names unto ChriÅ¿t, they were all incorporated into his fold, which is his church, his MyÅ¿ticall body, and were moulded into a church or churches, and Å¿o they are Å¿et down to us in the holy Scriptures as believers and true members of ChriÅ¿ts church; and therefore formed into a church or churches; for there is but one Shepherd and one Å¿heep-fold, and ChriÅ¿t had then no other church on earth that we reade of but that of the Iewes; and which is yet more, it was a reformed church; for ChriÅ¿t had caÅ¿t out all the Buyers and Sellers <hi>(John</hi> 2.) out of the Temple, and cals it his Fathers houÅ¿e, and the houÅ¿e of prayer, Å¿o that it was now a pure church, and clenÅ¿ed from all pollutions, and in the which all ChriÅ¿ts Ordinances were in their purity; here was the Preaching of the GoÅ¿pell, the Teaching of the Law, and all the Å¿ealing Ordinances, both old and new: here was CircumciÅ¿ion, the PaÅ¿Å¿eover, Sacrifices and Ceremonies, here was BaptiÅ¿me and the Lords Supper or breaking of bread; here was the true Invocation or calling on the name of God, and that in the houÅ¿e of Prayer, where all Supplications were heard, and that before ChriÅ¿ts death: Here we have all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls for the making or forming of a church or churches, or caÅ¿ting of ChriÅ¿tians into a church mould according to the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tament forme (to Å¿peak a little in the Independents dialect) for here we have viÅ¿ible Saints in multitudes, devoute men and true worÅ¿hippers from out of all the Nations under heaven <hi>(Acts</hi> 2): here we have ChriÅ¿t and his twelve ApoÅ¿tles, and his Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples, Elders and Teachers in abundance, beÅ¿ides many Women that followed him and miniÅ¿tred unto him; here was no want of MiniÅ¿ters and Officers and Members of all Å¿orts beÅ¿ides innumerable multitudes of believers and cryers <hi>HoÅ¿anna,</hi> and all
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48122:178"/>
this before ChriÅ¿ts death, as well as after, and all theÅ¿e ChriÅ¿tian believers, and Å¿uch as did partake of all Å¿ealing and Å¿aving Ordinances Å¿ufficient to caÅ¿t them into a church mould, and to forme them into a church or churches, as well as after ChriÅ¿ts aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion: and therefore my indefinite enumeration of thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples, ought by my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I.

up as they ought to be and formed into a Church or Churches; which if it be not the height of blaÅ¿phemy, I refer to the judgment of any intelligent Reader! AmongÅ¿t them in their new moulded congregations, a PaÅ¿tor &amp; a Teacher, and two Elders, and a Deacon and five or Å¿ix brethren more and three or four SiÅ¿ters can make up a formed Church after the New TeÅ¿tament form; Now is there any man Å¿o Å¿tupid and brutiÅ¿h as will not conclude that where ChriÅ¿t was the great PaÅ¿tor and Shepherd of our Soules, and where there were <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Å¿onnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> two Teachers or Doctors, thoÅ¿e <hi>Bonaerges,</hi> thoÅ¿e Å¿onnes of Thunder, and eight or nine Elders with Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples all Saints all whoÅ¿e names were writ in heaven with multitudes of Beleevers with many women that followed ChriÅ¿t the great Shepherd of our Å¿ouls, who had alÅ¿o a Decon amongÅ¿t them, <hi>Judas</hi> by name, that all theÅ¿e could not or did not make up a formed church or churches, when ten or twelve in their whibling congregations, Å¿o qualified as formerly, can make a formed church after the New TeÅ¿tament form? I Å¿ay he that Å¿hall not beleeve that the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the great Å¿hepherd of his Å¿heep, and all his DiÅ¿ciples, Schollers and followers cannot as well make a formed church, as a few in our new founded or rather confounded congregations, is voyd of all reaÅ¿on and underÅ¿tanding: And they that Å¿hall peremptorily and raÅ¿hly affirm that they were not a true formed church, I proclaim them guilty of blaÅ¿phemy and deÅ¿erving moÅ¿t condigne puniÅ¿hment: And therfore when my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and many of the Independents are guilty of this heinous and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinorous crime they ought Å¿everely to be dealt with, as prevaricators againÅ¿t the divine MajeÅ¿ty of the King of Saints and King of Kings and againÅ¿t the honour of the Saints in ChriÅ¿ts time, and ought by all ChriÅ¿ts true DiÅ¿ciples and Å¿uch as love the honour and dignity of their King and Saviour <hi>JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t</hi> to be abominated as a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of falÅ¿e teachers, calumniators and horrid Å¿educers, how godly Å¿oever they Å¿eem to the wrold to be.</p>
               <p>And as all Å¿uch teachers as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices are, ought by ChriÅ¿ts Saints and Servants to be looked on as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of grand impoÅ¿tors and juglers: So the poor and deÅ¿piÅ¿ed Presbyterians, who they terme Å¿inners and carnall people, and men of earth and enemies of ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdome, may comfort themÅ¿elves in this <hi>that they are like their maÅ¿ter and his DiÅ¿ciples, and all that were converted by John the BaptiÅ¿t and by the MiniÅ¿try</hi>

                  <hi>of ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles and DiÅ¿ciples and baptized by them:</hi> for they pronounce of us all, that we are not formed into a church or churches, nor caÅ¿t into a church mould according to the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament forme, and that we are not members of any true church nor Saints, but enemies of <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and at beÅ¿t but converts in part, as if <hi>ChriÅ¿t the authour and finiÅ¿her of our Faith,</hi> wrought his worke to the halves, this I Å¿ay may comfort all us the poore deÅ¿piÅ¿ed Presbyterians; for the Å¿ame they Å¿ay of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and his DiÅ¿ciples, and of all that were converted and baptized by <hi>Johns</hi> and their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿try and Å¿uch as partaked in all Ordinances, of all which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>That they were not formed into a Church or Churches according to the New TeÅ¿tament form:</hi> for in their babble, there was not a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med church, till that we reade of <hi>Acts</hi> the 2. So that neither <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> nor his DiÅ¿ciples nor <hi>John</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿ciples, nor the hundred and twenty names we read of <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. in their learning were a formed church, nor all the other worÅ¿hippers the Scripture Å¿peaks of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. nor thought worthy by them to be taken notice of for a church or churches; So that by this bold aÅ¿Å¿ertion of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> they do not only oppoÅ¿e the truth, but indeed many of thoÅ¿e of their own party and tribe, howÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they pretend they write in the name of them all, who I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured will give them little thanks for this their pains; for to my knowledge the learnedÅ¿t of them are againÅ¿t them in this point and diÅ¿avow their opinion: For the principalleÅ¿t of them hold that the hundred and twenty names we read of <hi>Acts</hi> the firÅ¿t, were a true formed church as all their writings and diÅ¿putes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: and therefore my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I.

               <p>And truly if the hundred and twenty names were not a true for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med church, there was then none upon Earth. And if they had not been a formed church according to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, they could not have given a forme to other churches; for all learned chriÅ¿tians agree in this, <hi>That it muÅ¿t be a true formed Church, that muÅ¿t make others true formed churches:</hi> For they cannot give and communicate that to others that they have not themÅ¿elvs: this is one of their own principles, and therefore they cannot deny it.</p>

               <p>But now to the matter in hand. My Brother <hi>Burton</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the Beleevers in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> were Å¿o many, in the very infancy of it, that for want of a convenient place, as wherein to breake bread, or receive the Lords Supper all together, they were conÅ¿trained to Å¿ever themÅ¿elves into divers companies; and to communicate in Å¿everall private houÅ¿es, which conceÅ¿Å¿ion of his quite overthrowes the opinion of thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way as they call it; yet Å¿aith hee, this Å¿evering was not a dividing of the Church into Å¿o many diÅ¿tinct formall Churches or Church bodies, becauÅ¿e but Å¿o many branches of one and the Å¿ame particular church, which though (Å¿aith hee) you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Å¿o many congregations, yet properly Å¿o many Churches they were not, as not having their diÅ¿tinct Officers and Members united into one Church body reÅ¿pectively. TheÅ¿e are his formall words. So that he diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿heth between church and congregation, as MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> doth betweene <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> not making them Å¿y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonima's, as other men and thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way uÅ¿ually doe, and thinkes by this his grollery to evade the dint of all Arguments that are brought to convince them. The queÅ¿tion therefore betweene me and my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> at this time, is, <hi>Whether a congregation and a company of beleevers communicating together in church FellowÅ¿hip, and in all the Å¿aving and Å¿ealing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, be a church properly Å¿o called,</hi> which my Brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> denies, Å¿aying, that although I called them Å¿o many congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet properly Å¿o many churches they were not; and puts mee upon the proofe of it: and therefore to gratifie my kind bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; to Å¿hew how willing I am to pleaÅ¿e his humour I do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that work. Now if I can make it appeare, &amp; evince, that thoÅ¿e Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations of Beleevers in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> wee reade of in the firÅ¿t Å¿ix chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> were Å¿o many Å¿everall churches properly Å¿o called, then hee will acknowledge and confeÅ¿Å¿e that my elevenor twelve Å¿heets Å¿pent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Argument prove no waÅ¿te paper; and then alÅ¿o the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ie

betweene us is at an end, and hee muÅ¿t turne Presbyterian Dependent if hee hath any honeÅ¿ty in him. This then is my taske to maintaine, and prove that thoÅ¿e congregations and Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies or companies of Beleevers in the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> were Å¿o many churches properly Å¿o called, which by the grace of God and his bleÅ¿Å¿ed aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance I doubt not but to make good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had Å¿ufficiently himÅ¿elf overthrowne the Independents doctrine, by the very granting there were many congregations in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by the way, before I come to prove what I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I will take this liberty to premiÅ¿e thus much, if That my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿peaketh of the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> bee orthodox di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Å¿evering of themÅ¿elves, into divers compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and into many Å¿everall congregations, in Å¿everall private houÅ¿es, for the partaking in all the Ordinances, and for the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the acts of worÅ¿hip, that they might be the better edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes them not Å¿o many diÅ¿tinct formall churches, or church bodies properly Å¿o called, (becauÅ¿e but Å¿o many branches of one and the Å¿ame particular church, the communicating and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating notwithÅ¿tanding in al the which Ordinances in al ages, was thought Å¿ufficient to conÅ¿titute a formall church, or a church body properly Å¿o called): then I affirme the Å¿ame may be concluded of the catholick viÅ¿ible church; for that is but one church, and one Å¿heep-fold, as being founded and built upon that one Rock <hi>IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> that onely PaÅ¿tor and Shepheard of his Å¿heepe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of theÅ¿e concluÅ¿ions muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily inÅ¿ue upon his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>viz.</hi> if the Å¿evering of a particular church into many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies makes them not Å¿everall churches or church bodies properly Å¿o called, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> teaches; becauÅ¿e it is but one and the Å¿ame church, and all thoÅ¿e congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are but Å¿o many branches of that one church: then the Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the catholike viÅ¿ible church into many congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies through the world, makes them not Å¿o many chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches properly Å¿o called, becauÅ¿e the church of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> is but one and the Å¿ame church, and all thoÅ¿e congregations are but Å¿o many branches of that one church: and Å¿o by his learning there Å¿hall now be no viÅ¿ible churches upon earth properly Å¿o called, although they injoy all ChriÅ¿ts Ordinances in each of them, for they are but Å¿o many branches of that one church.

Divinity, then let all men turne Expectants and Seekers, for wee have not in the world as yet any particular viÅ¿ible formed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for all theÅ¿e Å¿everall congregations are but Å¿o many branches of that one catholicke viÅ¿ible church: and a branch and a member of a church is not a church properly Å¿o called in my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> Dialect: and therefore wee have no true viÅ¿ible churches, or church bodies upon earth properly Å¿o called: this I Å¿ay will neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arily follow upon my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> unÅ¿ound Principles and this his opinion, which I am confident upon his more Å¿erious thoughts, and when he makes not Å¿uch haÅ¿te, (as he confeÅ¿Å¿es he did, when he writ this his book againÅ¿t me) he will acknowledge to be very erroneous.</p>
               <p>But if he Å¿hall againÅ¿t all reaÅ¿on, undertake to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Å¿ame doctrine concerning the Catholicke viÅ¿ible church he doth about the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> I am aÅ¿Å¿ured he will be highly condemned by the learnedeÅ¿t of his party as well as by the univerÅ¿all conÅ¿ent of all the judicious Divines in the world, who I know are of a contrary judgement. But I Å¿ay, if upon mature deliberation he Å¿hall acknowledge and grant that the Å¿everall congregations or churches of believers mentioned in the Scriptures, as that of <hi>Corinth, EpheÅ¿us, Galatia</hi> &amp;c. and their own Å¿everall congregations in their new gathered churches (howÅ¿oever he will not grant that title unto our aÅ¿Å¿emblies) I Å¿ay if he Å¿hall but accord that both the primitive churches and their new congregations be churches properly Å¿o called or church bodies, though but Å¿o many branches and members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke viÅ¿ible church, which yet is but one and the Å¿ame church: then likewiÅ¿e of neceÅ¿Å¿ity it will follow, and he muÅ¿t yeild unto it, that all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> were churches properly Å¿o called, though but Å¿o many branches of that one and the Å¿ame particular church, becauÅ¿e as the learned know, all particular congregations and churches that partake in all the Ordinances as they are Å¿imilar parts of the whole church, Å¿o they doe all partake of the name and nature of it and are all of them churches properly Å¿o called; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the very Å¿ame reaÅ¿on I Å¿ay, all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aÅ¿Å¿emblies in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> being parts of that Nationall city or Presbyterian church, that one and the Å¿ame church, as partaking both of the name and nature of that church,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48122:183"/>
are all of them churches properly Å¿o called; one of thoÅ¿e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ions, I affirme will neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> principles. And for the better evidencing of what I have Å¿aid, I will adde a few words more by way of a corollary, that whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the whole church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> had in it to make it the firÅ¿t formed church properly Å¿o called, the Å¿ame had all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies reÅ¿pective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Å¿everally conÅ¿idered, to make every one of them churches properly Å¿o called: And therefore if the whole church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> may challenge the name of a true formed church (as the Independents acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) then the Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies reÅ¿pective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Å¿everally conÅ¿idered, might do the Å¿ame, and were churches properly Å¿o called. For if the whole conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of viÅ¿ible Saints, Å¿o did every one of thoÅ¿e Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies conÅ¿iÅ¿t of viÅ¿ible Saints. And if the whole had the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles in it and ChriÅ¿ts Å¿eventy DiÅ¿ciples and all Å¿orts of church Officers, Å¿o had every Å¿everall congregation and aÅ¿Å¿embly of that church, though but a part and a branch of the whole. And if the whole church inioyed all the Å¿aving and Å¿ealing ordinances and all acts of worÅ¿hip, and continued Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly in the ApoÅ¿tles doctrine and fellowÅ¿hip and in breaking bread and in prayer, Å¿o did every one of thoÅ¿e congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies Å¿everally and reÅ¿pective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conÅ¿idered: And therefore when all the branches of that one particular church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem, viz:</hi> every congregation and aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿embly Å¿everally conÅ¿idered and as a part, were equall to the whole church in all priviledges immunities and in whatÅ¿oever is required for the making of a true formed church, Å¿o that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to either of thoÅ¿e congregations that the whole church partaked in and injoyed or could challenge for the making it a compleat Church, then it followeth and that neceÅ¿Å¿arily, that if the whole church be a true formed church and a church properly Å¿o called as the Independents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e, that all thoÅ¿e congregations &amp; aÅ¿Å¿emblies Å¿everally conÅ¿idered were churches properly Å¿o called. This I thought good to premiÅ¿e. And now I come to make good what I undertooke, which is to prove thoÅ¿e Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> to be churches properly Å¿o called, which I do by this argument.</p>
               <p>All Å¿uch aÅ¿Å¿emblies &amp; congregations as daily met together in diverÅ¿e companies in the Temple, and in <hi>Solomons Porch</hi> and in Å¿everall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

               <p>But in the church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> there were many Å¿uch aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and congregations as dayly met together in diverÅ¿e companies in the Temple and in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> and in Å¿everal private houÅ¿es, in the fellowÅ¿hip of the GoÅ¿pell, and in the name of ChriÅ¿t, and clothed with his power, and honoured with ChriÅ¿ts preÅ¿ence, being all believers and Saints, and Å¿uch as gladly received the Word, and were all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and continued Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly in the ApoÅ¿tles doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, and in the breaking of bread and in prayers, and injoyed amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves in their Å¿everall congregations, all the Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Å¿ealing Ordinances, and all acts of worÅ¿hip and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever priviledges and immunities the whole church partaked in, and the which the Independents themÅ¿elves repute and thinke Å¿ufficient for the making and conÅ¿tituting of a formed church, and who alÅ¿o had amongÅ¿t them in thoÅ¿e Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies MiniÅ¿ters immediately Å¿ent them of God and inÅ¿pired with the holy GhoÅ¿t, every one of the which had the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven given them by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, with a promiÅ¿e to be with them to the end of the world, and that whatÅ¿oever they looÅ¿ed on earth

               <p>For the Major, no well grounded ChriÅ¿tian will deny it, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Independents cannot gain Å¿ay it: for if two or three met together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the GoÅ¿pell and in ChriÅ¿ts name make a true viÅ¿ible church, as thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way hold and teach; then much more where two or three hundreds are met together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the GoÅ¿pell and in the name of ChriÅ¿t and in the which alÅ¿o they partaked in all the Å¿aving and Å¿ealing Ordinances, as in the preaching of the Word and Prayer, and in the Sacraments of BaptiÅ¿me and the Lords Supper, and that by lawfull MiniÅ¿ters and Officers appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Å¿ent by God himÅ¿elfe; I Å¿ay, by far better reaÅ¿on Å¿uch a congregation is a true and viÅ¿ible and compleate church proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿o called, as all rationall and intelligible men will eaÅ¿ily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; and therefore this cannot be denied by the Independents, eÅ¿pecially when (as I noted before) it is their owne Doctrine, taught in all their writings, and Preached by every one of the congregationall way, and confirmed by their own daily practice. And to paÅ¿Å¿e by many books writ of late by the MiniÅ¿ters of <hi>New-England</hi> and Å¿ome of the Independent MiniÅ¿ters here amongÅ¿t us, I will only at this time pitch upon one who hath in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, dealt more candidly then any of his brethren: for he kepes no reÅ¿erves <hi>Donec ad triarios redierit res,</hi> but Å¿ets downe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they hold.

                     <hi>Object.</hi> It may poÅ¿Å¿ibly here be objected, how will it appeare that Å¿o Å¿mall a number as two or three joyned together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the GoÅ¿pell, do conÅ¿titute a viÅ¿ible Church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> It will appeare evident by this inÅ¿uing argument. ChriÅ¿t hath given his power, and promiÅ¿ed his preÅ¿ence to two or three ioyned together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the Gospell; therefore two or three Å¿o joyned together, do conÅ¿titute a viÅ¿ible church.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is proved from the Words of ChriÅ¿t <hi>Matth. 18.</hi> If thy brother offend thee, tell him of it; if he refuÅ¿e to heare thee, take two or three; if he heare not them, tell it to the church: if he neglect to heare the church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen and a Publican. I Å¿ay unto you, whatÅ¿oever you Å¿hall binde on earth Å¿hall be bound in Heaven, and whatÅ¿oever yee Å¿hall looÅ¿e on earth Å¿hall be looÅ¿ed in Heaven. Loe! Here's their power given them by ChriÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>The preÅ¿ence of ChriÅ¿t is promiÅ¿ed by them. <hi>verÅ¿. 20.</hi> Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middeÅ¿t of them.</p>
                  <p>The conÅ¿equent cannot be denied; for what people in the world may be called a church, if they may not, to whom ChriÅ¿t hath given his power, and promiÅ¿ed his preÅ¿ence? If the gifts of ChriÅ¿t be of any force, if the power of ChriÅ¿t be of any efficacy, then they have a right to be Å¿o called. Neither is this deÅ¿titute of learned men, who have given their Å¿uffrage to it. <hi>Humfred.</hi> de religione vera conÅ¿ervanda pag. <hi>24.</hi> EccleÅ¿iam cum dico, non unum aut alterum Å¿acerdotem aut mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trum, Å¿ed legitimum ac ChriÅ¿tianum catum nomino et innuo.</p>
                  <p>BeÅ¿ides, the definition of a viÅ¿ible church, will prove the conÅ¿equent. A viÅ¿ible church is a myÅ¿ticall body whereof ChriÅ¿t is the head, the members be Saints, called out of the world, &amp; united together into one congregation by an holy covenant, to worÅ¿hip the Lord, and to edifie one another in all his holy Ordinances. This definition, though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly looke upon a compleate church, it is appliable to two or three that are joyned together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the faith of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2,</hi> Object: But is it like that two or three there is taken for the church mentioned <hi>verÅ¿. 17.</hi> to which ChriÅ¿t hath given his power?</p>
                  <p>AnÅ¿w. I do not Å¿ay that it is alwaies Å¿o taken, for becauÅ¿e the church doth frequently conÅ¿iÅ¿t <hi>of many; but</hi> this I Å¿ay, that it may be Å¿o taken, as the very coherence of the words Å¿hews.</p>
                  <p>BeÅ¿ide, it will further appeare thus; if two or three may meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, clothed with ChriÅ¿ts power, and honoured with ChriÅ¿ts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48122:185"/>
then two or three may be the church mentioned, <hi>verÅ¿. 17.</hi> but two or three may meet together, clothed with ChriÅ¿ts power; for they meet in his name (as the text speakes) <hi>1.</hi> e. clothed with his power, for name Å¿ignifieth power in Å¿everall Scriptures <hi>Prov.</hi> the <hi>18. 10.

                     <hi>3.</hi> Object. But Å¿uch a company being deÅ¿titute of Officers, can be no church.</p>
                  <p>AnÅ¿w. If it had been Å¿aid, they could have been no compleate church, I would have conÅ¿ented. But to Å¿ay, that they are not a compleat church, therefore they are no church, is a <hi>Non Å¿equitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man that wants a hand, or foot, or both, is notwithÅ¿tanding a man, though a maimed man, Officers do not concurr to the <hi>eÅ¿Å¿e</hi> or being of a church; but to the <hi>bene eÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> or well being of a church; for otherwiÅ¿e, put caÅ¿e the Officers of a church dye, then muÅ¿t the church be unchurched, and Å¿o <hi>Toties quoties</hi> as Å¿uch a thing happens, which in times of mortality may be often. Againe, a company of believers ioyned together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the GoÅ¿pell hath the matter and forme of a church, even before it hath any Officers, and therefore is a Church without them; it hath the matter of a Church, a company believing <hi>1 Cor. 1. 2. EpheÅ¿. 1. 1.</hi> and it hath the forme of a Church, <hi>viz.</hi> a combining and uniting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves together into one body by the bond of an holy Covenant.</p>
                  <p>I have Å¿poke Å¿ome thing the more in this particular, to Å¿treng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Å¿uch as have built upon this foundation; that upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any books, or hearig of any arguments on the contrary Å¿ide, their hearts may not (like the heart of Ahaz <hi>IÅ¿ai</hi> the <hi>7. 1.</hi> when he heard of the confederacy of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Ephraim)</hi> be moved, as the trees of the wood are moved with the winde.</p>

And if that alÅ¿o my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Å¿peakes, be true, then the very church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> (as I Å¿aid before) which he calles the firÅ¿t formed church, was not a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48122:186"/>
true formed church properly Å¿o called. All this occaÅ¿ionally I hope to make evident.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, I will make uÅ¿e of Å¿uch Arguments, as the new lights from the Summer Ilands afforde me, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of my major propoÅ¿ition, which was, that, All thoÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Congregations, met together in thoÅ¿e Å¿everall houÅ¿es at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> every one of them reÅ¿pectively and Å¿everally taken, were churches properly Å¿o called. And this I doe the more willingly, becauÅ¿e I conceive it will better Å¿ound in my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> eares, and thoÅ¿e of his party, to heare one of their own great Rabbyes who they uÅ¿ually call Giants, and tall fellowes, then to heare me, who at pleaÅ¿ure they Å¿tile a Pigmy and Dwarfe; from his words therefore I thus argue.</p>
               <p>If two or three met together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the GoÅ¿pell and in ChriÅ¿ts name, and clothed with his power, and honoured with his preÅ¿ence, doe conÅ¿titute a viÅ¿ible church, as he aÅ¿Å¿erteth and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to prove in the name of all the Independents: then much more two or three hundred met together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the GoÅ¿pell and in ChriÅ¿ts name, and clothed with his power, and honoured with his preÅ¿ence, having amongÅ¿t them alÅ¿o their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Officers and MiniÅ¿ters, and injoying likewiÅ¿e all thoÅ¿e Å¿aving and Å¿ealing Ordinances within themÅ¿elves, which the Independents confeÅ¿Å¿e are Å¿ufficient for the conÅ¿tituting of a Church properly Å¿o called, then I Å¿ay, and that with far better reaÅ¿on, that Å¿uch a company doe conÅ¿titute a compleat viÅ¿ible Church or a Church body properly Å¿o called: but in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem</hi> there was not onely two or three met together or two or three Å¿uch AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations, but at leaÅ¿t twelve, if not halfe twelve Å¿core, yea innumerable, in all and every one of the which, they met together in the fellowÅ¿hip of the GoÅ¿pell and in ChriÅ¿ts name, and clothed with his power, and honoured with his preÅ¿ence, and in all and every one of the which reÅ¿pectively and Å¿everally, they had alÅ¿o their lawfull Officers and MiniÅ¿ters, and injoyed all thoÅ¿e Å¿aving and Å¿ealing Ordinances, which the Independents confeÅ¿Å¿e arr Å¿ufficient for the conÅ¿tituting of a Church properly Å¿o called. <hi>Ergo</hi> all and every one of thoÅ¿e Congregations Å¿everally and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively conÅ¿idered were Churches properly Å¿o called.</p>
               <p>This Argument is grounded upon the Independents owne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and upon their very words, and corroborated with their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48122:186"/>
owne reaÅ¿ons, <hi>For what people</hi> (Å¿ay they) <hi>in the world may bee called a Church, if they may not, to whom ChriÅ¿t hath given his power, and promiÅ¿ed his preÅ¿ence? If the gifts of ChriÅ¿t be of any force, if the power of Christ bee of any efficacy, then they have a right to be Å¿o called.</hi> Thus the Independents Å¿peake; and therefore without they will renounce their owne Principles, and abjure all reaÅ¿on, and the very light of underÅ¿tanding given them of God, they muÅ¿t acknowledge <hi>thoÅ¿e Å¿everall congregations in the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>to be Churches properly Å¿o called, as having in every one of them whatÅ¿oever they thinke requiÅ¿ite and Å¿ufficient to conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a formed Church; for there were in each of them reÅ¿pectively Å¿uch MiniÅ¿ters and Officers, as to whom ChriÅ¿t had given his power, and promiÅ¿ed his preÅ¿ence, and that to the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore if all the Å¿everall Congregations of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents conÅ¿idered by themÅ¿elves reÅ¿pectively &amp; apart, may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their opinion be called churches, and that for the injoying but Å¿ome of the above mentioned Ordinances and Priviledges, that all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Congregations in the Church of</hi> IeruÅ¿alem <hi>did compleatly partake in, then all good reaÅ¿on will conclude</hi> that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48122:187"/>
all theÅ¿e Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> reÅ¿pectively and Å¿everally conÅ¿idered were compleate churches properly Å¿o called; and that <hi>(as I Å¿aid before)</hi> with a great deale more and better reaÅ¿on by how much it is certaine that thoÅ¿e congregations and Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> had both for Matter and Forme and all other requiÅ¿its, whatÅ¿oever in theÅ¿e our dayes can make a compleate Church or Churches properly Å¿o called.</p>
               <p>And this that I have now Å¿aid for the confirmation of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> PropoÅ¿ition of my Argument may Å¿uffice, it being grounded upon the Independents owne Principles and Doctrine, Å¿o that I Å¿hall not need any more ReaÅ¿ons for the corroborating of the truth of the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>As for my <hi>Minor</hi> PropoÅ¿ition, they that Å¿hall reade but the firÅ¿t Å¿ix Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the 18. of <hi>Matt.</hi> and the 28. of the Å¿ame Booke, and the Å¿ixteenth and twentieth of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Å¿hall find it Å¿ufficiently confirmed; yea, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> denys not, that there were many congregations in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that now, I hope every judicious and intelligible Reader from all the forgoing DiÅ¿courÅ¿e will Å¿ee, that I have proved what I undertook,</hi> viz. that there were not only Å¿everal Congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem (which all the Independents, Å¿aving my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>deny)</hi> but that all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, Å¿everally and reÅ¿pectively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered were Churches properly Å¿o called <hi>(which my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>thought a thing impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be evinced)</hi> and that all thoÅ¿e congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies notwithÅ¿tanding made but one Church, and were all of them under one Presbyterie governed communi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ilio Presbyterorum, <hi>which my Brother</hi> Burton &amp; <hi>all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents do acknowledge;</hi> and therfore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity it muÅ¿t follow there was in IeruÅ¿alem a Å¿ubordination or combining of many Churches; all which nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e were called but one Church, as being under one government, as the Churches at this day of <hi>Geneva, Bazill,</hi> and of the other reformed Cantons, all the which conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations or churches properly Å¿o called, being united and combined together and Å¿ubordinate, make up but one Church in their Å¿everall Precincts, after the example of the Church at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and the other Primitive and pureÅ¿t Churches, the government of all the which was left as a patterne of imitation to all Å¿ucceeding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> to the end of the world, to teach them to unite and combine themÅ¿elves<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:48122:188"/>
ther for the better and more orderly governing &amp; regulating of them.</p>
               <p>And it is very fit, that as the Mother Churches, and thoÅ¿e the moÅ¿t pureÅ¿t ones, were ruled and ordered, Å¿o Å¿hould all the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Churches be moderated and regulated in all following Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the full conÅ¿ummation of all things: yea, all reaÅ¿on will perÅ¿wade any intelligible man, that a Councel or colledge of grave Divines and experienced men, and men of Knowledge, Learning, and Integrity, Å¿hould know a great deale better how to governe, then a few giddy headed, witleÅ¿Å¿e and worthleÅ¿Å¿e men, &amp; women, which moÅ¿t of the new Congregations conÅ¿iÅ¿t of.</p>
               <p>Now in all the Primitive and ApoÅ¿tolicall Churches wee find this kind of government, as in the Å¿even Churches of <hi>AÅ¿ia,</hi> the which conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many and Å¿everall Congregations in their Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Precincts, and yet made but one Church in their particular JuriÅ¿dictions, and all thoÅ¿e my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿peaks of, and which hee brings in for the making up of a compleate paterne of Church government, were Å¿o governed <hi>communi conÅ¿ilio Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum,</hi> as that of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> as I Å¿hall by and by briefly prove, after I have anÅ¿wered to what my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> hath yet to Å¿ay in this buÅ¿ines, to whoÅ¿e words if any credit may be given, then the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> it Å¿elfe which hee cals the firÅ¿t formed Church, was not a perfect formed Church; for hee accuÅ¿eth that of imperfection, and not that only, but all the other Primitive and ApoÅ¿tolicall Churches, Å¿aying that they were not compleate within themÅ¿elves; Å¿o that to make up a compleate patterne of a true conÅ¿tituted Church, we muÅ¿t borrow Å¿omething from each of them; and he affirmes, that there is the Å¿ame relation betweene church and churches, that is betweene the Members of the body, every one having need of the other; Å¿o that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity by this his doctrine they were all dependent, by the which he doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e all his brethren of the congregationall way, who hold and labour to maintaine not the perfection onely of every one of the Primitive churches within themÅ¿elves; but the parity likewiÅ¿e of them, and the equall authority; and affirme that they were all Independent; which opinion of theirs, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes, making them all Dependent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let us heare himÅ¿elfe Å¿peake.</hi> Secondly, <hi>(Å¿aith hee)</hi> it being no more then one entire particular Church, and not any DioceÅ¿an, or Provinciall Church, or the Presbytery thereof claÅ¿Å¿icall, as you
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48122:188"/>
would beare us in hand it is a paterne to all particular Churches in Å¿ucceeding ages; and yet (by your favour) not Å¿o perfect, as no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tolick churches beÅ¿ides it Å¿hould alÅ¿o come in, to make up the patern compleat; for wee muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily take all the Churches, &amp;c. <hi>as you may Å¿ee at large in his words before quoted. I deÅ¿ire the Reader here in the Å¿econd part of his anÅ¿wer, to take notice of his expreÅ¿Å¿ions; where,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, there is <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> an ordinary Error amongÅ¿t Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiÅ¿ticall dealing men: hee begs the queÅ¿tion, denying the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> to be claÅ¿Å¿icall, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding the Scripture Å¿ufficiently evinceth, as hath beene abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many congregations, and notwithÅ¿tanding it was governed by the joynt conÅ¿ent and common counÅ¿ell of many Presbyters, to both which he accordeth, and yet as if nothing had beene granted by himÅ¿elf, or Å¿aid by me, to prove it, hee grolliÅ¿hly denieth it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I Å¿hall intreat the Reader to obÅ¿erve, how he doth not onely contradict himÅ¿elfe, but oppoÅ¿e all his brethren of the congregationall way: for they all acknowledge, That the church at JeruÅ¿alem, and the government of that, was to be a paterne of Government to all churches inÅ¿ucceeding times, as being a moÅ¿t perfect paterne, and the Mother church, in imitation of the which Government as they pretend, they mould up all their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregationall churches; Å¿aying, that as the church at JeruÅ¿alem had an abÅ¿olute power within it Å¿elfe, and was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon any other churches, as being compleate within it Å¿elfe, Å¿o ought every church in like manner, after the example of that church, to exerciÅ¿e all authority within it Å¿elfe, and not have dependency on any other; for in all particulars they avow, the church of IeruÅ¿alem was a perfect formed church, and the Å¿ame they aÅ¿Å¿ert of all the Primitive and ApoÅ¿tolicall churches. This I Å¿ay is the Doctrine of all the Idependents beÅ¿ides himÅ¿elfe, that I ever have read or talked with; yea, my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> in the beginning of his AnÅ¿wer to his owne Argument, Å¿aith, that the firÅ¿t formed Church we finde, is in the Å¿econd of the <hi>Acts.</hi> Then if it was a formed Church (as hee confeÅ¿Å¿eth) &amp; then there was nothing wanting unto it; Å¿o that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity it muÅ¿t be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate and perfect church; for that that is deficient and deformed, that cannot bee Å¿aid to be perfect and compleate and a formed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48122:189"/>
church; now if it were a formed church, as he above Å¿aid, then it was a perfect and an entire church, as all rationall men will eaÅ¿ily and readily gather. And yet notwithÅ¿tanding here he affirmeth that it was not a perfect paterne; and therefore (Å¿aith he) for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of a compleate paterne of church government, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ApoÅ¿tolicall churches beÅ¿ides it muÅ¿t come in. By which words of his, I maintaine, hee does not only oppoÅ¿e all thoÅ¿e of his owne party, who all hold the contrary, but contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let us heare himÅ¿elfe Å¿peake: of</hi> neceÅ¿Å¿ity <hi>(Å¿aith hee)</hi> we are to take all the churches of the New TeÅ¿tament together, to make up one entire and perfect Church patern. For in the Church of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> we find Election of Officers, but we find not expreÅ¿Å¿ed that part of DiÅ¿cipline for caÅ¿ting out of corrupt Members, as in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and Å¿o in the rest. For the Churches were not brought forth to full perfection in one day. Their very constitution had a graduall growth. The Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> had not Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons at firÅ¿t till there was neceÅ¿Å¿ity. The Å¿umme is, to make up a compleat patern, not only the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> but that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> thoÅ¿e of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Philippi</hi> and the reÅ¿t are to be conferred together, that each may cast in its Å¿hot, to make up the full reckoning, Å¿o that what is not expreÅ¿t in the one, may be Å¿upplied by the reÅ¿t, to make up one Entire Platform. For the Scripture conÅ¿ists of many Books, as Å¿o many Members in one body, one Member cannot Å¿ay to an other I have no need of thee, <hi>1</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. <hi>12.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus my brother <hi>Burton</hi> confuteth all his brethren, who in all their writings with an unanimous conÅ¿ent hold, <hi>that the church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>and all the other ApoÅ¿tolicke churches were prefect formed churches, and abÅ¿olute within themÅ¿elves and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent:</hi> where as he blames them all of imperfection, and Å¿ayes, <hi>They muÅ¿t all be conferred together to make up an entire platforme,</hi> which if it be not an oppoÅ¿ing of them all and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting of himÅ¿elfe, I referre to the Iudgement of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned! For he in the beginning of his anÅ¿wer Å¿aid, <hi>The firÅ¿t for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med church we met with was that in the</hi> 2. <hi>of the</hi> Acts, and yet he here accuÅ¿eth it of imperfection and faylings and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not formed: for at that time Å¿aith he it wanted Deacons, and we finde not expreÅ¿Å¿ed that part of DiÅ¿cipline for caÅ¿ting
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48122:189"/>
out of corrupt members at any time, as in the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and the reÅ¿t: So that by his Doctrine here was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and fayling in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and therefore it was not a church properly Å¿o called; for every church properly Å¿o called, according to his learning, muÅ¿t have not only a good DiÅ¿cipline but DiÅ¿tinct Officers and Members united into one church body reÅ¿pectively: for theÅ¿e are his formall words page 11. Now a church according to their diÅ¿cription truly formed and properly Å¿o called, is when it hath a particular PaÅ¿tor, and Teacher or Doctor and two to three Elders, and a Deacon with ten or eleven good men and women, with an explicite particular Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; now I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire my brother <hi>Burton</hi> in his reply to Å¿end me word which of all the MiniÅ¿ters that were there at that time was the peculiar-PaÅ¿tor of this formed church, and which of them was the Teacher or Doctor or who were their Elders and who were their Deacons for the diÅ¿tinction of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Members united into one church body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pectively, is that that makes up a formed church properly Å¿o called in their Dialect; and therfore if he cannot make all that I require of him clearly appeare, then he can never prove either the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> or any of the primitive and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tolicall churches, churches properly Å¿o called; for we reade not in all the holy Scripture, that any church had a particular PaÅ¿tor and Doctor peculiar to it Å¿elf, or but two Elders and a Deacon, with a Å¿mall company of men and women: or any particular Covenant; but we reade that in all the churches there were mighty multitudes of believers and many Deacons, and that they had many Presbyters Å¿et over them and church Officers to governe them in common, and nothing in particular of that diÅ¿tinction of Officers and Members united into one church body reÅ¿pectively, with any Å¿uch Covenant which he and all the Independents Å¿ay <hi>make a church properly Å¿o called:</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which in their Language it cannot be adiÅ¿tinct and formall church properly Å¿o called: from which I do with very good reaÅ¿on conclude and that from the new light I have from my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that either the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and all the other primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive churches were not churches properly Å¿o called or well formed churches according to the new-teÅ¿tament forme, which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious either to thinke or Å¿ay; or if they were, that then there may at
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48122:190"/>
this day be compleat churches properly Å¿o called although they have not diÅ¿tinct Officers and Members, united into one church body reÅ¿pectively, but Å¿erve their flocks and congregations in common.</p>
               <p>So that all the bable of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his brethren of the congregationall way, is but wickedly and unchriÅ¿tianly to abuÅ¿e the world and to delude poore people when they demande Å¿uch things of their brethren as eÅ¿Å¿entially neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of a church properly Å¿o called as God never required at his peoples hands, and of which there is neither precept nor preÅ¿ident in all the holy Scriptures: for this diÅ¿tinction of Officers they call for in all churches, and many other things they rigidly exact of us for the compleating and forming of a church after the New-TeÅ¿tament forme, were not in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther church, and yet it was by my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿ion the firÅ¿t formed church and that in the judgment of all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents beÅ¿ides himÅ¿elfe, a perfect church at that time.</p>
               <p>But becauÅ¿e he requres of me to Å¿hew him diÅ¿tinct Officers and Members, united into one body reÅ¿pectively in all the Å¿everall congregations in the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> without which he affirmeth they were no formed churches properly Å¿o called; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire of him likewiÅ¿e that he would Å¿hew me that diÅ¿tinction of Officers and Members in that whole church that he demands of me in its parts, without the performing of the which all that he hath written is nothing; and he muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity grant <hi>that the church at</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>was not a church properly Å¿o called, if that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinction I Å¿ay of Officers and Members be eÅ¿Å¿entiall to the complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a church or churches.</hi> For he confeÅ¿Å¿eth at that time he calls it a formed church, they had no Deacons, and all the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents that ever I have Å¿eene or talked with, Å¿ay they reade of no Elders in the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> till the 12. of the <hi>Acts</hi> which was a long time after the firÅ¿t forming of this church: and we reade not at any time of any particular PaÅ¿tor or of any Doctor or Teacher ioyned with that PaÅ¿tor as is uÅ¿ually in the churches of the Congregationall way, but that upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ions all the people applyed themÅ¿elves to all the ApoÅ¿tles, and and Å¿aid <hi>Men and brethren what Å¿hall we doe?</hi> and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Doctrine and fellowÅ¿hip of all the ApoÅ¿tles and that all things were tranÅ¿acted by the common CounÅ¿ell of all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48122:190"/>
the ApoÅ¿tles, and that they all laid their hands in the Ordination of the Deacons upon each of them; we heare nothing I Å¿ay of any particular PaÅ¿tor or Teacher or of any Elders all this while; and yet by my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> Doctrine it was a formed church then, and we neither heare nor reade alÅ¿o any thing of an explicit particular Covenant which the Independents call <hi>the forme of a church,</hi> neither doe we reade of many things they now rigidly require of all Å¿uch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore when he is at plow again (as now I underÅ¿tand he is) I deÅ¿ire him that he would furrow up this truth unto me, and Å¿hew me that diÅ¿tinction of Officers and Members; withall, I deÅ¿ire to be reÅ¿olved <hi>how he comes to make this diÅ¿tinction of Officers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, united into one church body respectively, to be the forme of a Church, when his brethren of the congregationall way make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite particular covenant to be the forme of a Church, and the Members and Officers to be the materials onely of a Church;</hi> All theÅ¿e truths I deÅ¿ire and that earneÅ¿tly, that my brother <hi>Burton</hi> at his next going to plow he would lay open and diÅ¿cover unto mee, and then I will conclude of him that he is a Å¿ingular tiller and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good husbandman in ChriÅ¿ts field his Church, or otherwiÅ¿e hee will never be fit either to make a compleat Independent Country courtier, or an abÅ¿olute Independent Gentleman, but he Å¿hall be a HaberdaÅ¿her in the Å¿mall wares of Independency, and with thoÅ¿e I perÅ¿wade my Å¿elfe he will be beÅ¿t able to trade with.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time till I heare from him I will affirme that if it be true he Å¿aith, <hi>That the Church of JeruÅ¿alem wanted Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and Church diÅ¿cipline and an explicite particular covenant and many other good things they require of us for the compleating of a church or churches properly Å¿o called, then that Church was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat,</hi> and yet we read not that the Saints of thoÅ¿e times made any Å¿eparation from their publike AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations though they wanted Officers and DiÅ¿cipline and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things required now by them, Å¿o that we may learn from thoÅ¿e primitive and holy ChriÅ¿tians that we ought not to forÅ¿ake the publike AÅ¿Å¿emblies of the Saints for want of Å¿ome part of DiÅ¿cipline, or for want of Å¿ome Officers, or for want of many things they now exact of all ChriÅ¿tians for the compleating and moulding of them into Church bodies pro perly Å¿o called: for we
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48122:191"/>
read, <hi>That in the Church of JeruÅ¿alem they were perfectly converted and were Saints indeed, and yet that for Å¿ome wants they made no Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, rent or Å¿chiÅ¿me from their brethren, but that they dayly met together in their publick AÅ¿Å¿emblies, as in the Temple and in Solomons Porch, and from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e openly and that in all love and charity with one accord;</hi> And yet if my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and the Independents may be beleeved, they had neither Deacons, nor Elders, nor diÅ¿tinction of Officers, nor a great part of DiÅ¿cipline nor many other of their requiÅ¿ites: So that from the pious and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly example of thoÅ¿e glorious Saints, I learn this leÅ¿Å¿on, <hi>That rents and Å¿ciÅ¿mes are not to be made amongÅ¿t brethren for Å¿ome failings in any Churches, yea though there be Å¿ome defects not onely in Officers and Members, but a very want of Officers themÅ¿elves and of a good DiÅ¿cipline alÅ¿o in any Church or Churches: and that they that do make rents and diviÅ¿ions have a great deal to anÅ¿wer for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Withall I learn that it may be a true Church though there be a failing in DiÅ¿cipline and a want of Å¿ome chiefe Officers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: For my brother <hi>Burton</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>That the Church at JeruÅ¿alem was a formed Church, although it wanted both Officers and DiÅ¿cipline, and all thoÅ¿e things they now require of all Å¿uch as deÅ¿ire to be made Members in their new Congregations.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this he now preacheth be Å¿olid and orthodox Divinity, and if he may be credited in what he writeth, as there was at that time no juÅ¿t ground of Å¿eparation from their publike AÅ¿Å¿emblies for want of thoÅ¿e things, Å¿o there is now in theÅ¿e our dayes no juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e of Å¿eparation from our AÅ¿Å¿emblies; if there be indeed a reall want of diÅ¿cipline and Church Officers, which we might long Å¿ince have injoyed had not he and his brethren hindred our happy begun Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. EÅ¿pecially I Å¿ay we ought not to Å¿eparate when there is no failing or want in any dominative or fundamentall pointe of Religion neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿alvation, and where all the counÅ¿ell of God requiÅ¿ite to eternall happineÅ¿Å¿e is dayly publikely taught in every one of our Congregations and Churches, all which the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents themÅ¿elves do acknowledge we want not.</p>
               <p>BeÅ¿ides it is granted by all orthodox Divines, that DiÅ¿cipline makes not for the <hi>eÅ¿Å¿e</hi> but the <hi>bene eÅ¿Å¿e</hi> of a Church: Yea the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents themÅ¿elves hold, That Officers in a Church make not for the <hi>eÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> but the <hi>bene eÅ¿Å¿e</hi> of it, as the New Lights from the <hi>Summer IÅ¿lands</hi> apparently delucidate: For they Å¿ay, Though
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48122:192"/>
the <hi>Officers</hi> all dye, yet the Church ceaÅ¿eth not to be a church.</p>
               <p>But to return to the matter in hand: Whereas my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> affirmeth that the Church at JeruÅ¿alem wanted DiÅ¿cipline and that it had not Deacons at firÅ¿t, and that the Churches were not brought forth to full perfection in one day, and that their very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution had a graduall growth, I maintain that in all he aÅ¿Å¿erteth, he is not onely exceeding erroneous and ignorant, but underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the very doctrine of the Independents, who are all againÅ¿t him in thoÅ¿e his aÅ¿Å¿ertions; for they all acknowledg and in expreÅ¿s words affirm it in their writings that all the Officers of the church were virtually in the ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿aying <hi>they were PaÅ¿tors, Teachers, ruling Elders and Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore they wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deacons nor Elders (if their conceÅ¿Å¿ion be true) nor any church Officers, which is point blank againÅ¿t my brother <hi>Burton</hi> his opinion. They confeÅ¿Å¿e likewiÅ¿e that all the ApoÅ¿tles and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, had the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, that is, the power of order and juriÅ¿diction, <hi>viz:</hi> the key of knowledg and authority: And therefore they had alÅ¿o in the church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> that part of DiÅ¿cipline of caÅ¿ting out corrupt Members. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in like manner that all the ApoÅ¿tles had equall power amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, and that they had authority over all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as having the care of all the churches who were committed to their charge, and that they left both the Presbyters and people in their Å¿everal churches to the exerciÅ¿e of all their particular rights, &amp; impeached neither of them of their liberties. And they do alÅ¿o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿s that as <hi>Paul</hi> by his own authority did excommunicate <hi>Hymene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. ver. 20. and others: Å¿o might the other ApoÅ¿tles have done, if they had had the like occaÅ¿ion given them, and might have put any church, not only in mind of their duty and reproved them for their neglect of DiÅ¿cipline, but have injoyned and commanded them alÅ¿o to have put it in execution, as both <hi>Paul</hi> did the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and Saint <hi>John</hi> the Å¿even churches of <hi>AÅ¿ia:</hi> which were all well conÅ¿tituted, and well and perfect formed churches, by their firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution and brought forth to full perfection in one day, Å¿o as they had no need of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall growth as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> affirmeth. All theÅ¿e things I Å¿ay, the Independents do accord unto. And all reaÅ¿on will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wade any well grounded ChriÅ¿tians, That the church of <hi>Corinth</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And it is confeÅ¿Å¿ed likewiÅ¿e by the Independents and by my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Burton <hi>himÅ¿elfe,</hi> That where there are Church Officers as a PaÅ¿tor and Teacher with an Elder or two and a Deacon, and where there are a few viÅ¿ible Saints if they amount but to the number of twenty, nay if they be but ten or twelve gathered together according to their method, that there is a compleat formed Church where ChriÅ¿t is Å¿et up as King upon his Throne, and that this Church is clothed with ChriÅ¿ts power and honoured with his preÅ¿ence, the which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e wanteth nothing for matter and forme, but hath plenary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity within it Å¿elfe; and therefore is as compleat a Church within it Å¿elfe as any church in the world; <hi>by all which it muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow and that upon their own principles, that it is brought forth in perfection in one day and hath no neede of a graduall growth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I Å¿hall never beleevethat thoÅ¿e glorious churches founded by the holy ApoÅ¿tles in every city in the which they had their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Presbyters and all other Officers appointed them, the which churches alÅ¿o conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of viÅ¿ible Saints, that they were not at their firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution as compleat churches, and in the which ChriÅ¿t was not as well Å¿et up upon his Throne, as any of our new gathered churches of the congregationall way. Yea it were an
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48122:193"/>
impiety to think that the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles did not know how to gather churches and how to Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t upon his Throne in them, and how to bring them to perfection in one day at their firÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution as well as our brethren the Independents, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding do all proclame they but imitate the ApoÅ¿tles, both in the gathering and conÅ¿tituting of their new churches. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Independent congregations, are all compleated at their firÅ¿t founding and conÅ¿titution, and be all compleat within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, as having plenary authority and power within themÅ¿elves, much more had all the ApoÅ¿tolicall and Primitive Churches abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute juriÅ¿diction within themÅ¿elvs at their firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution, which is yet more manifeÅ¿t from the reproofe given to the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> by S. <hi>Paul</hi> who blameth them for not caÅ¿ting out the inceÅ¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perÅ¿on; and from the reproof given to Å¿ome of the 7 churches of <hi>AÅ¿ia</hi> by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf: For otherwiÅ¿e they if they had not bin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat at their firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution, might have replyed and anÅ¿wered, <hi>That they had no power to caÅ¿t out corrupt Members, and that their churches were not compleatly moulded up at their firÅ¿t founding, and that they wanted that part of DiÅ¿cipline;</hi> but none of theÅ¿e churches pretended any Å¿uch thing, neither could they; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had given the church of <hi>EpheÅ¿us</hi> by name a caveat to take heed of Wolves, that would riÅ¿e up among them after his departure, and had armed them likewiÅ¿e with power and authority for the caÅ¿ting of them out, as it is at large to be Å¿een in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the <hi>Acts;</hi> and that church executed its power in finding out of falÅ¿e Teachers, and is praiÅ¿ed for it, though the other are blamed. So that the neglect of this their duty, and not executing of their DiÅ¿cipline was that that was found fault with in them, and that they had not exerciÅ¿ed that power that was given them in caÅ¿ting out of thoÅ¿e corrupt Members from amongÅ¿t them. This <hi>I</hi> Å¿ay was their failing, and for this were they blamed; Å¿o that it was not for want of DiÅ¿cipline or that they were not perfect at their firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution, but their negligence and their not doing their duty was their Å¿inne.</p>
               <p>Neither was the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> inferior to any other church in power, or wanted that part of DiÅ¿cipline of caÅ¿ting out corrupt Members, as my Brother<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>Burton</hi> boldly, and without all reaÅ¿on affirmeth: for it is well knowne, that the church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem</hi> had power of life and death, as wee may Å¿ee in the Å¿torie
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48122:193"/>
of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> his wife, the which if it could take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the very life of offendors, as it did theirs for lying to the Spirit of God, then it had power to caÅ¿t out any corrupt Members, and Å¿candalous perÅ¿ons, if they had had any amongÅ¿t them, as all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on will dictate to any well grounded ChriÅ¿tian.</p>
               <p>But that wee reade not of any excommunicated in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> it was not for any want of DiÅ¿cipline, or power in that Church of caÅ¿ting out offenders, but becauÅ¿e there was no open Delinquents and Å¿candalous perÅ¿ons; for they were all zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Law (as it is well knowne) and would Å¿uffer none in the leaÅ¿t to tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿e it without queÅ¿tioning them; nay, if they conceived but an offence in the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves, they would call them to an account, as wee may Å¿ee <hi>Acts</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For diÅ¿cipline in any church is as MagiÅ¿tracy in a Common-wealth or Kingdome, which is not a terrour to the good, but to the wicked, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaketh <hi>Rom.</hi> the 13. it is a comfort to well doers and as, the MagiÅ¿trate uÅ¿eth the Å¿word onely againÅ¿t Offendors and Delinquents; Å¿o the Officers of the Church exerciÅ¿e that part of DiÅ¿cipline only in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting out corrupt and Å¿candalous Members, (which is Å¿olely to bee put in execution againÅ¿t them:) and therefore that wee reade not of excommunication in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> it was not for want of that part of DiÅ¿cipline, but becauÅ¿e there were no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Å¿candalous perÅ¿ons there, as in the church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>

                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:48122:194"/>
BeÅ¿ides, all men know that DiÅ¿cipline is one thing, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of diÅ¿cipline is an other, and is but the reÅ¿ult and effect of diÅ¿cipline, as the church is one thing, and the AdminiÅ¿tration of the Sacraments is another: Power and Authority in a court, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall or civill, is one thing, and the execution of the power of that court is an other: and as the execution of its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority makes it not a court, nor giveth not the power to it, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it to be a court inveÅ¿ted with authority; as in the Parliament the great and Å¿upreme court of this Kingdome, the cutting off of <hi>Strafford</hi> and the Prelates heads gave not power to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but declared the power they had by their firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution: for they were a court before, and had the power of execution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but upon this occaÅ¿ion they exerciÅ¿ed it: but will any man Å¿ay, if they had not at this time exerciÅ¿ed their authority as they have not done for theÅ¿e many years before, that the great court had wanted that part of DiÅ¿cipline? all men that Å¿hould attempt to Å¿ay that great councell wanted that part of DiÅ¿cipline, I beeleeve they would exerciÅ¿e Å¿ome more of their authority to teach Å¿uch an one better manners or more wit.</p>
               <p>Even Å¿o it was in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> they had diÅ¿cipline in that Church, though wee reade not of the putting of it in execution, as we do in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> neither wil any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man conclude, that all the other Primitive Churches wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that part of diÅ¿cipline; becauÅ¿e I Å¿ay wee reade onely of the execution of it in the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> which is commended for it, and Å¿ome of the other Å¿even chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are blamed for not caÅ¿ting out their corrupt Members, and becauÅ¿e they had not at that time exerciÅ¿ed their authority, neither reade wee of it in the churches of <hi>Galatia, ColoÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> nor amongÅ¿t the <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿alonians,</hi> nor in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Antioch,</hi> nor in <hi>Samaria:</hi> will any man therefore Å¿ay that all theÅ¿e churches wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that part of DiÅ¿cipline, becauÅ¿e wee reade nothing of it in them? I am confident they will not be Å¿o fanaticall, as to make Å¿uch a concluÅ¿ion from Å¿o brainÅ¿ick a premiÅ¿e: much leÅ¿Å¿e will any intelligible chriÅ¿tian argue as my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> does, Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wee reade not of that part of DiÅ¿cipline in the church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem,</hi> of caÅ¿ting out corrupt Members, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it had it not: this would indeed prove <hi>a non Å¿equitur,</hi> and Å¿uch a conÅ¿equenct or concluÅ¿ion could leaÅ¿t of all have been made from the Church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem</hi>

upon Å¿uch an Antecedent, then from any of the other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, becauÅ¿e the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> had not only the power of the Keyes within it Å¿elfe, but a legiÅ¿lative power alÅ¿o, who gave Lawes to all other churches, both for the ordering and ruling of them, and for the exerciÅ¿ing of their DiÅ¿cipline in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that by Gods appointment; <hi>for out of</hi> Sion <hi>Å¿hall goe forth the Law</hi> (Å¿aith the Prophet) <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 23. <hi>and the word of the Lord from</hi> JeruÅ¿alem.

               <p>And I believe that the Independents would blame any of their Schollers and Members if they Å¿hould Å¿ay their new congregated churches wanted that part of DiÅ¿cipline of caÅ¿ting out of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Members, though they have not as yet in Å¿ome of them put it in execution: for they have learned to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h between the power of a Church and the execution of that power in a church: for as it doth not argue that a Court of JuÅ¿tice hath not power of life and death when notwithÅ¿tanding it is inveÅ¿ted with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of hanging and drawing, though perhaps after it is erected they either have no occaÅ¿ion of executing that authority that is given, or them out of Clemency will for a time Å¿hew mercy and uÅ¿e lenity towards offendors, not taking the extremity of the Law the more with humanity and kindneÅ¿Å¿e to reclaime them; even Å¿o in all well conÅ¿tituted Churches the not executing of the power given them by ChriÅ¿t, or the not having juÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion of putting that power in execution, doth not prove a want of that power: and if any of the Members of the new congregations Å¿hould Å¿o argue, againÅ¿t their new church Officers, I believe they would Å¿oone make uÅ¿e of their Keyes to Å¿hut Å¿uch a Member out of their Church doores, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> falÅ¿ly complaines that <hi>Truth was lately Å¿hut out of</hi> Aldermanbury <hi>Church doores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly if one of their whibbling congregations have no want of that part of DiÅ¿cipline, though they execute it not: Å¿hall any man be Å¿o temerarious and unadviÅ¿ed as to thinke that the power of the church, in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was evacuated or enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or that they had not that part of DiÅ¿cipline, when there was greater power in it then in any church in the world, all who had all the ApoÅ¿tles amongÅ¿t them and as ChriÅ¿ts and <hi>Iohn</hi> DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, all of them armed with the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, and when the Magazine and treaÅ¿ury of all power reÅ¿ided continually in that church, and therefore that part of DiÅ¿cipline, when all other churches derived their power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

their Å¿everall juriÅ¿dictions, and that all thoÅ¿e Churches I Å¿ay were ClaÅ¿Å¿ically governed, and were all dependent upon their Å¿everall Presbyters, as being Å¿ubordinate to them, and likewiÅ¿e Å¿ubject to the Synodicall Decrees at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem;</hi> then it will follow, that all churches in Å¿ucceeding ages to the end of the world are to be Å¿o governd: for all theÅ¿e churches make up an entire and compleat paterne or platforme of governing all churches for future ages, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> granteth. I Å¿hall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deÅ¿ire the reader (it being a buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿o great importance) to give me leave, as I proved the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> to conÅ¿iÅ¿t of many Congregations or Churches which my brother <hi>Burton</hi> calls branches of that Church, therefore neceÅ¿Å¿arily depending upon the Å¿tock: So now briefly to evince, that all thoÅ¿e Churches my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> enumerats conÅ¿iÅ¿ted likewiÅ¿e of many Congregations and were all ClaÅ¿Å¿ically governed. And then I will alÅ¿o prove, that according to the Independents definition of a Church, their very Congregationall Churches and AÅ¿Å¿emblies are not true Churches properly Å¿o called, and withall I Å¿hall make good by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance and that from their own Principles, that they are Dependent, All which I will doe in order.</p>
               <p>And firÅ¿t I will begin with the Church of <hi>Samaria</hi> which is one of the reÅ¿t my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿aieth muÅ¿t be taken in for the making up a compleat platforme. This City of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was the Regall City and the Palace or Chamber of the Kings of <hi>IÅ¿raell,</hi> and was one of the greateÅ¿t Cities then in the world, and next to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> the famouÅ¿eÅ¿t in all <hi>PaleÅ¿tine</hi> and one of the greateÅ¿t in all <hi>Canaan</hi> for extent, and it muÅ¿t needs be a great one that could entertaine the whoÅ¿e <hi>AÅ¿Å¿yrian</hi> army at one time, and it was exceeding populous, as all the Å¿tories of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> witneÅ¿Å¿e, in the which we know there was a true Church in ChriÅ¿ts time and that planted by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, as we may Å¿ee in the 4 of <hi>Iohn</hi> where we reade that our Saviour converted not onely the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> but many more who were made beleevers by his MiniÅ¿try, as they themÅ¿elves acknowledge and teÅ¿tifie; and to this Church were many thouÅ¿ands added by the preaching and miracles of <hi>Philip:</hi> for it is Å¿aid of them <hi>Acts</hi> the 8. verÅ¿. 6. 10. 12. 14. that all thoÅ¿e that had bin Å¿educed by that Jugler <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> which were in no Å¿mall numbers, every one of them being

undeceived by the preaching and wonders of <hi>Philip,</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and were baptized, Å¿o that there was a mighty company: for it is related that the people of the City with one accorde from the greateÅ¿t to the leaÅ¿t, both men and women believed and were baptized. Now if any man Å¿hall duly conÅ¿ider and weigh things, this City was no contemptible one, as appears from that I Å¿aid before; and yet it is aÅ¿Å¿erted by the holy GhoÅ¿t who is worthy to be believed and credited that all the people of that City from the greateÅ¿t to the leaÅ¿t both men and women believed and were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: and therfore they could not all meet in any one place or a few, neither was any one PaÅ¿tor able to Teach them all, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> at firÅ¿t Å¿ent two of the chiefeÅ¿t ApoÅ¿tles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> Å¿o that all this Å¿hews there was an innumerable company of believers in that City, all which could not meete in any one or a few places as all reaÅ¿on will eaÅ¿ily perÅ¿wade. BeÅ¿ides, the ApoÅ¿tles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿ts and the MiniÅ¿ters of thoÅ¿e times had an other manner of converting faculty, then the Independents in our dayes, who I never yet heard converted any, though they have perverted and Å¿educed many. For the ApoÅ¿tles and EvangeliÅ¿ts and the primitive MiniÅ¿ters there, were immediatly Å¿ent of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pired with the holy GhoÅ¿t and Å¿pake in all Languages, and did Miracles Å¿uch as none could doe but thoÅ¿e that came from God, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> Å¿aid unto ChriÅ¿t, that none could doe Å¿uch works and miracles as he did <hi>except God were with him, Iohn</hi> 3. 2. for they cured all manner of diÅ¿eaÅ¿es with their word and Å¿haddow, they raiÅ¿ed the dead, made the lame to walke, and caÅ¿t out Devils, and did whatÅ¿oever was wonderfull. Withall they Preached unto them the glad tidings of joy and peace and of everlaÅ¿ting happineÅ¿Å¿e after a miÅ¿erable life here; and did alÅ¿o inÅ¿truct them how to order their wayes and converÅ¿ations here, Å¿o that they might live with honour and dye with comfort, and be uÅ¿efull to all men both in life and death and after death. And the ApoÅ¿tles, EvangeliÅ¿ts and MiniÅ¿ters of thoÅ¿e times, as they did good wherever they came, Å¿o they lived Å¿o holily and unblameably in all manner of converÅ¿ation, and were men of Å¿uch integrity, Å¿incerity and of Å¿uch plaine upright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as the people that beheld their converÅ¿ation, and Å¿aw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their workes of wonder that they did, Å¿aid of them, that

gods were come downe amongÅ¿t them in the likeneÅ¿Å¿e of men, Å¿o that they converted whole cities and countries whereÅ¿oever they came; yea, it was an ordinary thing with them to bring whole Nations in a Å¿hort time, and with a few Miracles to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the faith, as wee may Å¿ee through the whole Storie of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and from that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> the 15. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 18. 19. where the ApoÅ¿tle abundantly declareth the effect of the GoÅ¿pel and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of thoÅ¿e times, who wrought Å¿o powerfully whereÅ¿oever they came, even to the converting of whole countries and cities, and Å¿o they prevailed in this citie of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that the people of the Å¿ame were Å¿peedily converted from the greateÅ¿t to the leaÅ¿t, both men and women, who all beleeved and were baptized; and what rationall man will thinke, or can beleeve, that all the people men and women of a mighty and royall citie, could meet in any place or a few to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip, but muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be diÅ¿tributed into divers congregations and churches, if they would partake in all ordinances? and yet all theÅ¿e made up but one Church, as being under one government, that of the Presbyterie; for there were Presbyters ordained in every Church, and in every citie, as is apparent from <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 23. and <hi>Titus</hi> the 1. And now I have proved that the two Mother cities of <hi>PaleÅ¿tine, IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many congregations, were Presbyterially and claÅ¿Å¿ically governed: I will goe on to the other cities of the Gentiles enumerated by my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and prove that they alÅ¿o conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many congregations, and aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and were all Å¿ubordinate to their Å¿everall Presbyteries and ClaÅ¿Å¿es.</p>
               <p>And firÅ¿t I will begin with the citie of <hi>Corinth,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was a famous citie, and in the which there was an illuÅ¿trious church, and therfore in it alÅ¿o there was conÅ¿tituted a Presbytery, that was many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to governe and rule that Church and thoÅ¿e congregations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: for it is Å¿aid, <hi>Acts</hi> the 14. that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained them Presbyters in every church, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> were MiniÅ¿ters in the church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> yea, <hi>Paul</hi> planted this church, and <hi>Apollo</hi> with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and the Presbyters wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it; and therefore there muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be many congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aÅ¿Å¿emblies in that church: For one PaÅ¿tor or MiniÅ¿ter would have beene Å¿ufficient for owne flocke, at leaÅ¿t a PaÅ¿tor and a Teacher, or a Doctor would have beene Å¿ufficient to have fed one

congregation: now in that they had many ordinary PaÅ¿tors, and many extraordinary Teachers in it, with all good reaÅ¿on it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there were many aÅ¿Å¿emblies and many congregations in that church, which will yet more abundantly appeare from its firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution or planting: for wee reade of multitudes, both of Jewes and Gentiles in that Citie that beleeved, <hi>Acts</hi> the 18. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 5. 7, 8. &amp;c. <hi>and that beÅ¿ides IuÅ¿tus, CriÅ¿pus</hi> alÅ¿o and all his houÅ¿hold, and many Corinthians beleeved, and were baptized, <hi>and the Lord</hi> alÅ¿o Å¿aid <hi>that hee had many people in that Citie, ver.</hi> 10. which by the diligent preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> for eighteene moneths together were converted, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 11. for whoÅ¿e further building up in their moÅ¿t holy faith, <hi>Paul, Apollos, Timothy, Cephas,</hi> and many other extraordinary, &amp; famous MiniÅ¿ters and Teachers, beÅ¿ides their owne Presbyters, were all conÅ¿tantly imployed in Å¿eaÅ¿on &amp; out of Å¿eaÅ¿on in preaching the GoÅ¿pel, and adminiÅ¿tring the holy Sacraments, and labouring in word and doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 &amp; 4. all the which imports many congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in that Citie.</p>
               <p>BeÅ¿ides, both the EpiÅ¿tles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians Å¿hew that there were multitudes of deceitfull Teachers, Seducers, and falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles, which urged the ceremoniall Law, and the obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, and they alÅ¿o had their congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies: there were alÅ¿o many vaine InÅ¿tructers and idle Teachers, who though they kept the foundation, yet built upon it wood, hay and Å¿tubble: Now all reaÅ¿on will Å¿uggeÅ¿t, that PaÅ¿tors of Å¿uch Å¿everall minds, and teaching Å¿uch Å¿everall &amp; diÅ¿crepant doctrines had all of them Å¿chollers, &amp; followers of the Å¿ame opinion wherof their Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral PaÅ¿tors were, as now we Å¿ee in the Å¿everal Sects in our times; &amp; therefore <hi>they did not all meet in one or a few places,</hi> except we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand their meetings for the convention of their Officers with a part of the more choyce people for diÅ¿cipline; beÅ¿ides, as wee have expreÅ¿Å¿e mention of a Church in <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>PriÅ¿cylla's</hi> houÅ¿e, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. Å¿o there were many other meeting places in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> where the ChriÅ¿tians aÅ¿Å¿embled themÅ¿elves together: for in expreÅ¿Å¿e words there is mention made in that EpiÅ¿tle of churches in the plurall number, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 34. <hi>Let the women Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle keepe Å¿ilence in the Churches:</hi> by which it followeth, that in Gods dialect congregation and church are Å¿ynonima's, and not that onely, but that there were many churches in this church

of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that they were all but one church, as being Å¿o many branches, and depending all upon that Å¿tocke, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were all claÅ¿Å¿ically governed, and Å¿ubordinate to one PreÅ¿by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</p>
               <p>The Å¿ame may be concluded of the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> where <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> the 1. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> Å¿alutes all the BiÅ¿hops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Å¿o that in the firÅ¿t entrance of that EpiÅ¿tle wee meet with a colledge of BiÅ¿hops and Presbyters, for they were all one, and wee meete alÅ¿o with many Deacons; all which proves to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding man that there were many congregations and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for one Deacon would have Å¿erved for one congrgeation or aÅ¿Å¿embly; and yet they all made but one church, as being Å¿ubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to one Presbyterie, and governed by their joynt conÅ¿ent and common CounÅ¿ell; and that there were multitudes of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there, it is evident from the variety of Teachers, beÅ¿ides their good and godly BiÅ¿hops; for <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith, there were dogs amongÅ¿t them, evill workers, and thoÅ¿e of the conciÅ¿ion, and he bids the Philippians to beware of thoÅ¿e, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 2. and there were many other of their Teachers which were worldly men, that minded earthly things, whom hee proclames enemies of the CroÅ¿Å¿e of ChriÅ¿t, who made their belly their God, as too many of the Independent MiniÅ¿ters now adayes doe, <hi>chapter</hi> 4. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 18, 19. and gives them in command to Å¿hun their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and only to follow his, and Å¿uch as walked as hee did, whoÅ¿e converÅ¿ation was in Heaven; and many Å¿uch Teachers there were in the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and Å¿uch as taught the GoÅ¿pel out of good will and Å¿incerely; all which Å¿ufficiently prove there were many congregations of Beleevers in this Church; and that it was yet but one Church, and governed by a claÅ¿Å¿is and colledge of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hops and Presbyters. And the Å¿ame may be Å¿aid of the church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> complaines <hi>that there were many falÅ¿e teachers amongÅ¿t them, which hee wiÅ¿ht were rooted out, and cut off or deÅ¿troyed:</hi> Å¿o that it followeth, that in that church alÅ¿o, there were many congregations, and they were all governed by the joynt conÅ¿ent &amp; common counÅ¿el of a Presbyterie there; for there were Presbyters ordained in every church, and in every Citie.

But as our Saviour Å¿aid to the Seducers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Yee erre not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> Å¿o I may truly Å¿ay of all the Å¿everall Sectaries of this time, they erre not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the power of God to puniÅ¿h them for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e; For would they but take the word Church in that Å¿enÅ¿e the holy Scripture delivereth it unto us and relateth it, the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie would Å¿oone be at an end. Now the word Church in all the places above quoted, and through the whole Scripture of the New TeÅ¿tament for the moÅ¿t part, is taken collectively, either for all the catholike inviÅ¿ible or viÅ¿ible Church, or for the repreÅ¿entative body of the church, or for many congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies of Beleevers, all combined together under one government, either in a citie or countrie partaking in all the Ordinances, as in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praying, and the adminiÅ¿tration of the holy Sacraments, and in the exerciÅ¿ing of godly diÅ¿cipline; not onely within the wals of thoÅ¿e Å¿everall cities, but through all the townes and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as farre as the bounds and limits of their Å¿everall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, precincts, and juriÅ¿dictions did extend, as <hi>Acts the</hi> 15. 23. <hi>The ApoÅ¿tles and Elders Å¿end greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, that is, to the Church in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, and in Syria, and in Cilicia.</hi> So that church is moÅ¿t often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken collectively, as the church of <hi>Geneva</hi> at this day, and of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿il,</hi> and the other reformed Cantons, as it was in the Å¿even churches of <hi>AÅ¿ia.</hi> Now when the word church for the moÅ¿t part in holy Scripture is taken in this Å¿enÅ¿e, as the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> the church of <hi>Samaria, Antioch, Philippi, Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. and where there were many congregations and churches combined together, and all collectively taken, in this the Independents and all Sectaries erre, that they alwayes take the word church for no more then can meete together in one of their pipkin congregations, to partake and communicate in their Ordinances; whereas the Scripture as I have
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48122:203"/>
in all the forgoing diÅ¿courÅ¿e Å¿ufficiently proved, taketh the word collectively for many congregations under one government, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every one of thoÅ¿e Å¿everall congregations conÅ¿idered apart and by it Å¿elfe may truly and properly be called a church, as being a Branch and Member of Å¿ome particular church, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in all eÅ¿Å¿entiall Ordinances with it, as hath abundantly bin proved; yet Å¿till it is conÅ¿idered but as a Member, and a Branch or part depending upon the whole particular church under which it is, and therefore claÅ¿Å¿ically governed.</p>
               <p>From all which I may conclude, that when all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Churches, as that at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem, Samaria, Corinth, Philippi, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us,</hi> which my brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿aith muÅ¿t be brought in to make up a compleate paterne of Church government, were all colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively taken, and claÅ¿Å¿ically and collegiatly governed, as conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting of many congregations, and yet but under one Presbyterie in their Å¿everall precincts and juriÅ¿dictions, my Arguments will everÅ¿tand good; yea, they are all Å¿trengthned from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> ConceÅ¿Å¿ion and his expreÅ¿Å¿e words. For if when there were but three thouÅ¿and Beleevers in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> as it appeares, <hi>Acts</hi> the 2. they were then forced to Å¿ever themÅ¿elves into divers companies, becauÅ¿e they wanted a convenient place Å¿o Å¿pacious as wherein to breake bread, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿aith, how impoÅ¿Å¿ible a thing was it for them all after that time to meet together in any one place or a few, when the church at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem</hi> multiplyed daily, and that by many thouÅ¿ands, and at laÅ¿t grew Å¿o numerous as they amounted to many Myriads, or innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable companies, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> the 21. all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding my brother <hi>Burton</hi> paÅ¿Å¿eth by and taketh no notice of, wilfully deceiving the poore people, in concealing from them Å¿o apparent a truth: But Å¿hould I take notice of the error of his words and diÅ¿cover all his juglings, my diÅ¿courÅ¿e would Å¿well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mighty volume: for to Å¿peake the truth, his expreÅ¿Å¿ions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in them a heape of fraud and confuÅ¿ion, all which hee muÅ¿t one day give a Å¿evere account for. But not to take notice I Å¿ay of his Å¿everall faylings: what he grants, is to be taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> that when the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was in its infancy they wanted a convenient place Å¿pacious enough to communicate in all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and therefore they were conÅ¿trained to Å¿ever themÅ¿elves into divers companies in Å¿everall private houÅ¿es to communicate<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:48122:204"/>
Then of neceÅ¿Å¿ity when that Church was multiplyed into many ten thouÅ¿ands, they muÅ¿t needs be diÅ¿tributed into many and many congregations and churches to partake in all the Ordinances, and all theÅ¿e were but one church, and under one Presbytery, as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> acknowledgeth.</p>
               <p>So that now I am moÅ¿t confident every judicious Reader will eaÅ¿ily perceive, that my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and all thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way meerly trifle, and delude the poore and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, whiles with their Å¿criblings they trouble the world, in making rents and Å¿chiÅ¿mes in church and Å¿tate.</p>
               <p>But heare yet how hee cavilleth: the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> Å¿aith hee, cannot bee a paterne to all churches, <hi>for then all Churches muÅ¿t have Å¿even Deacons, and muÅ¿t bee all Å¿ubject to Å¿ome one Church; becauÅ¿e things in queÅ¿tion, were there debated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and Å¿ent to other Churches to be obÅ¿erved; and in regard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o that that Church was infallibly guided by the Holy GhoÅ¿t; in which reÅ¿pect, the reÅ¿olution of that Church was with authority; it pleaÅ¿ed the Holy GhoÅ¿t and us, which no particular Church Å¿ince can ever Å¿ay. In theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>it followes then that the Church of IeruÅ¿alem remaines not in all things a patterne for other Churches; for a paterne muÅ¿t bee in all things imitable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Thus my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> makes a noyÅ¿e to little purpoÅ¿e, contradicting all thoÅ¿e of his owne party that I ever yet read or talked with, who all acknowledge that the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was a paterne to all churches; and from the example of that church, (as they pretend) they forme and governe all their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and labour to reduce all to that paterne, and ground all their proceedings upon the Plat-forme of that church, and doe all as they affirme, in imitation of that, holding Synods to bee one of Gods ordinances, and ground it upon the meeting of the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders in the 15. of the <hi>Acts:</hi> and yet my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> here maintaineth the contrary, as his words Å¿ufficiently declare: for which his grollery, I beleeve all thoÅ¿e of his Fraternity will give him little thankes, and blame him for his Å¿o great haÅ¿te in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wering mee: who in his wiÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tle to the Reader Å¿aith, <hi>I haÅ¿ted at laÅ¿t as faÅ¿t, as before I was Å¿low, if poÅ¿Å¿ible to recover our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Å¿o that it Å¿eemes hee made more haÅ¿te then good Å¿peed (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverbe) <hi>Canis feÅ¿tinans caecos parit catulos,</hi> and will have cauÅ¿e at leiÅ¿ure to repent; for hee hath by this his jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48122:204"/>
and conjuring quite raÅ¿ed the foundation, and overthrowne the whole Fabrick of the new Bable of Independency, which his brethren had beene Å¿o buÅ¿ie and diligent to lay, erect, maintaine, and uphold, and that from the example of the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e to examine his trifling reaÅ¿ons of this his gain-Å¿aying, and denyall that the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> cannot be a paterne to other churches: for then Å¿aith he, <hi>every Church muÅ¿t have Å¿even Deacons, and all Churches muÅ¿t be Å¿ubject to one Church, and to the Decrees of that Church, which they cannot be, there being none now infallibly guided.</hi> Thus my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> out of the acumen of his wit diÅ¿putes at randoun: after the very Å¿ame manner did the Prelates in their generation diÅ¿pute againÅ¿t the godly people they termed Puritans, when they alleaged the example of ChriÅ¿t and the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles in receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, as that they all received it either Å¿itting or uÅ¿ing a Table-geÅ¿ture: and therefore that all ChriÅ¿tians, and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples were bound to imitate and to follow his and the ApoÅ¿tles examples rather then AntichriÅ¿ts, as a paterne Å¿et downe to them of receiving the Holy Communion to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>To which the Prelates, and thoÅ¿e of that faction replyed, that if the Puritans would make ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles in receiving the Lords Supper a paterne for their imitation; then they muÅ¿t always celebrate it in an evening, and that after Å¿upper, and in an upper roome, and in a private houÅ¿e, and not in publick, and then they muÅ¿t never exceed twelve or thirteene communicants, and they muÅ¿t be all men and no women: and an hundred Å¿uch other toyes they brought to prove, that the example of our bleÅ¿Å¿ed Saviour and his holy ApoÅ¿tles was not to be a paterne of imitation for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Lords Supper to all ChriÅ¿tians in Å¿ucceeding ages: and after the Å¿ame manner doth my brother <hi>Burton</hi> now trifle to no purpoÅ¿e. For as the example of ChriÅ¿t and the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles was a paterne in reÅ¿pect of Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and not in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tance, which was never required; Å¿o was the church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem,</hi> in reÅ¿pect of Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and not in every circumÅ¿tance to be a paterne to all churches for their imitating to the end of the world; As for inÅ¿tance.</p>
               <p>The church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> had liberty given them by the ApoÅ¿tles
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48122:205"/>
to nominate and make choyce of Deacons, when there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿sitie of Å¿uch Officers &amp; to nominate and make choyce of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they thought Å¿ufficient for their occaÅ¿ions. And in this it was a paterne to all churches in Å¿ucceeding ages, that they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e if they had need of Deacons, might make choyce of holy and godly men, and of approved integrity, and of as many as they had need of, whether fewer or more, and as often as their occaÅ¿ions required, no church being limited for the number; and as the ApoÅ¿tles onely in that church ordained the Deacons, and not the people, Å¿o the MiniÅ¿ters and Presbyters only, in all churches Å¿hould doe the Å¿ame. And as upon any difference amongÅ¿t the brethren that are joyned together in church FellowÅ¿hip (as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then betweene the <hi>Grecians</hi> and the <hi>Hebrewes, Acts</hi> 6. about their widowes, who they thought <hi>were neglected in the daily Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration)</hi> they made their appeales to the ApoÅ¿tles for redreÅ¿Å¿e; Å¿o in this the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> is a patern to all other churches upon any occaÅ¿ions of Å¿uch or the like difference, to appeale unto their Å¿everall Presbyteries: and as they willingly Å¿ubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to their determination, Å¿o when the Presbyters command or appoint any thing in the Lord, and according to his word, the people are to yeeld willing Å¿ubjection &amp; obedience to their order; and in their Å¿o doing to make the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne: and as in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem there were many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and churches, and all theÅ¿e were combined together, and Å¿ubordinate to one Presbyterie</hi> in this alÅ¿o the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> is to be a paterne to all churches in Å¿ucceeding ages, that they may doe the like in imitation of that church, which is for ever to be a paterne to them; and as upon occaÅ¿ion then <hi>certaine men went downe from Iudaea to Antioch, Acts</hi> 15. 1. and troubled the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there and in other churches, with <hi>words Å¿ubverting their Å¿oules, Å¿aying that they muÅ¿t be circumciÅ¿ed and keepe the Law verÅ¿.</hi> 24. pretending they came from the ApoÅ¿tles and had a command from them of their Å¿o doing, Å¿o that upon this the churches Å¿ent unto the ApoÅ¿tles and the Elders at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> for the determination of this buÅ¿ines in debate, &amp; waited patiently for their reÅ¿olution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any rents or Å¿chiÅ¿mes in the church: and as the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders of that church and of other churches called a councell and Synode and there diÅ¿puted and debated the matter with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and reaÅ¿ons Å¿earching the holy Scriptures <hi>What was the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After the very Å¿ame manner in this their Å¿o doing, the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> is a paterne to all other churches upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ions, it any difference of opinion riÅ¿e amongÅ¿t the churches, or if any new hereÅ¿ies Å¿pring up tending to the Å¿ubverÅ¿ion of the Å¿oules of the people, how holy and godly Å¿o ever they Å¿eeme to be that broach them, and what pretence Å¿o ever they make that they have them from divine Authority; I Å¿ay upon the like occaÅ¿ions in Imitation of the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders in the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> Kings and Princes, and ChriÅ¿tian MagiÅ¿trates and thoÅ¿e that are in Authority, may call a councell or Synod of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines together; and as the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders there debated things by diÅ¿pute and reaÅ¿on, and by Å¿earching the holy Scripture found out the truth, and determined the queÅ¿tion and Å¿ent their Decrees which were binding, to all other churches: Å¿o I affirme alÅ¿o in this their Å¿o doing that church is a paterne of imitation to all churches in all Nations and Countries and ChriÅ¿tian churches in them, that MiniÅ¿ters out of Å¿everall Presbyteries in a repreÅ¿enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body may meet together by the appointment of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿trates, and diÅ¿pute thoÅ¿e queÅ¿tions by reaÅ¿oning and diÅ¿courÅ¿e, and finding by Å¿earching of the Word of God, what his good will and pleaÅ¿ure is, may determine the queÅ¿tion accordingly, and give out their decrees grouned upon the written Word, with authority to be obÅ¿erved by all thoÅ¿e churches under their Å¿everall JuriÅ¿dictions; and as the people then did patiently wait till the determining of that difference without making of any rents, Å¿chiÅ¿mes, or Å¿eparations, one from another, and did then yeild obedience to thoÅ¿e decrees without any reluctation, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved them all willingly after the debate; Å¿o ought all people in imitation of them and following their example, with patience to wait, without making any rents and diviÅ¿ions, till things are fully diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed and determined in any Å¿uch Synode or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and then willingly and cheerfully Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves and yeild obedience to them, and in their Å¿o doing they have the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> for a paterne and the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders of that church and the other churches for an example of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48122:206"/>
Å¿o long as they injoyne nothing contrary to the Word of God. For this way of governing the church by Synods and Councells, upon differing and diÅ¿Å¿enting opinions betweene church and church, and upon occaÅ¿ion of any new HereÅ¿ies Å¿prung up in ChriÅ¿tian Countries or any old ones revived, as it hath its paterne from the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and that of <hi>Antioch</hi> which is left for our imitation that all churches upon the like occaÅ¿ion Å¿hould follow it; So this way of ruling is grounded upon moÅ¿t excellent reaÅ¿on: as moÅ¿t agreeable both to the Law of God and nature and the practiÅ¿e of all Nations and Kingdomes of which we have many preÅ¿idents in the holy Scriptures beÅ¿ides this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and Å¿ome others. For as all Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have been ever governed by generall councells and have ever had their Å¿everall appeales, from inferior Courts and councells to Superior upon either publicke grievances, or upon any differences betweene Province and Province, and County and County, or betweene Corporation and Corporation, or City and City, or upon any PreÅ¿Å¿ures or oppreÅ¿Å¿ions, or impeachments or incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of each on the others liberties or through injuÅ¿tice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to each of them, from Å¿ome that are in power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; So the church of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t which is his Kingdome, is inferior to no other Kingdome upon earth; but in that alÅ¿o the Å¿everall Corporations that are under it, which are Å¿o many Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian churches, have in like manner the liberty of their appeales upon any of the aforeÅ¿aid or above named occaÅ¿ions.

is ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome: although in it, the Å¿everall Presbyteries and churches conÅ¿idered by themÅ¿elves and as having equall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, cannot give Lawes to each other, Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and by themÅ¿elves conÅ¿idered, as the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> and the other could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe to each other a rule or Law to walke by with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but only in an examplary way by well doing: yet all theÅ¿e Å¿everall churches ioyning together in a generall councell, as they did at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem Acts</hi> the 15. and having from each of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligated and Å¿ent their Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters as Å¿o many BurgeÅ¿Å¿es, of their Å¿everall cities and Corporations, and they being all met together upon any grievances and having by debating of the matters and differences in queÅ¿tion by diÅ¿pute and by diÅ¿qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition found, <hi>What is the good will of God, and what is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure in his good Word and in the holy Scriptures which are the Fundamentall Lawes of his Kingdom</hi> may in any ChriÅ¿tian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Å¿o called, and ordering their buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e as the councell and Synod of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> did, give out their Decrees and thoÅ¿e binding ones to all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall churches that are under their juriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and all theÅ¿e Å¿everall churches ought to yeild obedience to them. And in this their Å¿o doing they have the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and the other churches a preÅ¿ident and a paterne. For (I Å¿ay) in all theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> is a paterne to all other churches. And as in the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem, Corinth, Philippi, Samaria, EpheÅ¿us,</hi> &amp;c. the ApoÅ¿tles, EvangeliÅ¿ts, and the Presbyters in every one of thoÅ¿e churches had the charge of each of thoÅ¿e churches committed to them in common, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿t from all the places above quoted, and through the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and as they fed them all and governed them all in common: Å¿o in that alÅ¿o both the church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and all the other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (according to my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> doctrine who Å¿aith <hi>they muÅ¿t all come in for the making up of a compleat platforme)</hi> I Å¿ay as all the Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters fed thoÅ¿e Å¿everall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in common, Å¿o they are a paterne to all churches in all Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages to the end of the world, that they may do the Å¿ame in their Å¿everall and reÅ¿pective Presbyteries. Neither is there any preÅ¿ident or example in all the holy Scriptures of the new-TeÅ¿tament, that any church had its peculiar PaÅ¿tor and Teacher, or Doctor alloted to it, with but two or three Elders and a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con

with a Å¿lender congregation of people of the which they only had the cure and care for the feeding and ruling of it, and the which had abÅ¿olute Authority within it Å¿elf, and from which there was no appeale, the which notwithÅ¿tanding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents aÅ¿Å¿ert is a true formed church after the new teÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forme; Å¿uch a modell of a church I affirme can never be Å¿hewed or proved in all the new teÅ¿tament. God (Å¿aith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 12. verÅ¿. 28.) <hi>hath Å¿et Å¿ome in the church; firÅ¿t Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles, Secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after Miracles, then Gifts of healing, helps in government, diverÅ¿ities of Tongues; are all ApoÅ¿tles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> &amp;c. and in the 4. of the <hi>EpheÅ¿ians</hi> verÅ¿. 11. <hi>When ChriÅ¿t aÅ¿cended on high, he gave gifts unto Men, &amp;c. and he gave Å¿ome ApoÅ¿tles and Å¿ome Prophets: and Å¿ome EvangeliÅ¿ts: and Å¿ome PaÅ¿tors and Teachers: for the perfecting of the Saints</hi> &amp;c. all the which places are to be underÅ¿tood concerning the Catholicke viÅ¿ible church. So that to appropriate theÅ¿e places of Scripture to any particular church, as thoÅ¿e of the Congregationall way do, is to abuÅ¿e and pervert the holy Scriptures for the upholding of their unwarrantable proceedings: for if theÅ¿e Scriptures are to be applyed unto every particular congregationall church, then there muÅ¿t not only be a PaÅ¿tor and a Teacher, but many PaÅ¿tors and many Teachers in each of them beÅ¿ides other church officers; and then the PaÅ¿tors and Teachers would be more in number many times then the flocke; and if we looke upon all particular Churches founded by the ApoÅ¿tles which muÅ¿t be a paterne indeed to all churches, then we Å¿hall finde that in all of them, Å¿everally, they had many Presbyters, as in the 14. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and in the 20. of the Å¿ame, and in all the above cited Scriptures doth abundantly appeare. So that there is no ground in all the holy Scripture of the new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of the Congregationall way: <hi>for following the expreÅ¿Å¿e Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> (to uÅ¿e my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> owne words) the firÅ¿t formed church we finde is in the <hi>Acts</hi> the Å¿econd, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many thouÅ¿ands, and in that church there were no diÅ¿tinct officers and members united into one church body reÅ¿pectively: for all the ApoÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters of that church fed and ruled that church in common: and therefore after the very Å¿ame example and paterne may all ChriÅ¿tian churches to the end of the world do the Å¿ame and be well formed churches, &amp; yet have neither a particular PaÅ¿tor nor

               <p>And as in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and in all the other churches all thoÅ¿e that were converted and added to them were none of them forced to walke either Dayes, or Moneths, or years with them before their admiÅ¿Å¿ion, that they might either know the Saints and Members of that Church, or be known of them, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and all the other Primitive Churches never made any rents and Å¿chiÅ¿mes from the publike aÅ¿Å¿emblies for Å¿ome faylings, but alwayes conÅ¿tantly frequented their publike meeting places, notwithÅ¿tanding the many corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Teachers, both in Doctrine, DiÅ¿cipline and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and had not only the example of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles, but of ChriÅ¿t alÅ¿o in Å¿o doing, who when he was queÅ¿tioned concerning his doctrine, Å¿aid, <hi>I taught publickely in the Temple, and in the Synagogue,</hi> and not in corners and by places, and <hi>he inioyned the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alÅ¿o to doe the Å¿ame,</hi> Matth. 23, <hi>Å¿aying, the Scribes and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ees Å¿it in</hi> MoÅ¿es <hi>his Å¿eat: all therefore whatÅ¿oever they bid you obÅ¿erve that obÅ¿erve and doe, but doe not yee after their workes,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>TheÅ¿e words deÅ¿erve due conÅ¿ideration. AmongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe was one, the Lord of life, who Å¿anctified that ordinance in his owne perÅ¿on, and that in a Å¿peciall manner, as being done by his Å¿peciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>and that for the fulfilling of all righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> both in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe and in the BaptiÅ¿t, as it is at large Å¿et downe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and it was ratified by all the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Trinity, as by the immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cenÅ¿ion of the Spirit of God upon ChriÅ¿t, in the likeneÅ¿Å¿e of a Dove who was the perÅ¿on baptized, with a voice from God the Father out of Heaven, Å¿aying, <hi>this is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaÅ¿ed.</hi> So that ChriÅ¿t, God the Father, and God the Holy GhoÅ¿t did Å¿anctifie and confirme this ordinance, not only to all thoÅ¿e that had beene baptiÅ¿ed by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples, who were alÅ¿o baptized by <hi>Iohn:</hi> but to all thoÅ¿e in all future ages that Å¿hould be baptized by ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples, and all his faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters, which hee Å¿ent <hi>into all nations to preach and baptize them, Matth.</hi> 28. to all which hee promiÅ¿ed his preÅ¿ence to the end of the world. So that I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, all good ChriÅ¿tians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that ChriÅ¿t was well baptized; and if he was well bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, it cannot be denyed but that all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> and ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples, were all likewiÅ¿e well baptized, and were all good ChriÅ¿tians: for both <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the DiÅ¿ciples had their commiÅ¿Å¿ion from God and ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe for their Å¿o doing; and therefore if any authority from Heaven, and a Å¿peciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, and a miÅ¿sion from him, be of any force to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, and aÅ¿certaine any ordinance, then the baptiÅ¿me of <hi>Iohn</hi> and ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples was authenticke; and all thoÅ¿e that were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed

               <p>Surely that Subject that Å¿hould paÅ¿Å¿e by his King and Soveraign, and all his retinue and Courtiers, and take no notice of him and them, and Å¿hould yeild him no reverence, would be thought craÅ¿ed in his brain; eÅ¿pecially if he Å¿hould in a Å¿lighting manner Å¿ay, <hi>He tooke no notice of them.</hi> And all men that Å¿hould hear Å¿uch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion from him, would not onely judge Å¿uch an one a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred man and an uncivill fellow, but that deÅ¿ervedly he ought to be taught better manners.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48122:212"/>
leaÅ¿t of all, that they were all Members of one ChriÅ¿tian church at JeruÅ¿alem: <hi>TheÅ¿e are his expreÅ¿Å¿ions;</hi> For which he hath been much applauded by all of that fraternity, who uÅ¿ually Å¿ay of him when he rideth through the Å¿treets, there goeth he that beat up Doctor <hi>BaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks</hi> quarters; approving of this good worke of his in unchriÅ¿tia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all thoÅ¿e that beleeved in mee and were baptized by the MiniÅ¿try of my Å¿ervant <hi>John</hi> the greateÅ¿t Prophet that ever was borne of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Å¿ent by me and my father to baptize them: And of Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> they never speak but in high praiÅ¿es, bleÅ¿Å¿ing God that he hath anÅ¿wered <hi>BaÅ¿twicks</hi> Book, which he writ in defence and maintenace of my honour, and for the reputation of all that beleeved in me, and were baptized in my name; So that all thoÅ¿e books that were Å¿et forth by thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way to my diÅ¿honour and the diÅ¿repute of my followers are approved of by you all, and in them you Å¿ay you take no notice of thoÅ¿e multitudes that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a church or churches.</p>
               <p>Now amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> I was one, and my DiÅ¿ciples and my Mother and my Brethren, &amp;c. So that you Å¿light us all, and take no notice of us, as formed into a Church or churches; that is in plain words, you are aÅ¿hamed of us and deny us; Now thoÅ¿e that are aÅ¿hamed of me and deny me before men, and take no notice of me and my DiÅ¿ciples, and of my Brethren and SiÅ¿ters and Mother, and of thoÅ¿e that beleeved in me and followed me whiles I was upon the earth, to be formed into a church or churches, I will be aÅ¿hamed of them and deny them, and take no notice of them before my Father in Heaven to be formed into a church or churches: For he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piÅ¿eth my DiÅ¿ciples and my Followers, despiÅ¿eth me, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piÅ¿eth me, despiÅ¿eth him that Å¿ent me; <hi>Yea,</hi> whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall deÅ¿piÅ¿e one of theÅ¿e little ones that beleeve in me, it were better that a milÅ¿tone were hanged about his neck and that he were caÅ¿t into the midÅ¿t of the Å¿ea. This was one of my Å¿tatute laws, will ChriÅ¿t the King of his Church Å¿ay. Now you of the congregationall way take no notice of me, nor of them that beleeved in me and were baptized in my name by <hi>John</hi> and my DiÅ¿ciples, as formed into a church or churches; for theÅ¿e are your own expreÅ¿Å¿ions; I therefore will take no notice of you of the oongregationall by-path, as formed into a church or churches; not onely for theÅ¿e your hard Å¿peeches againÅ¿t me and thoÅ¿e that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in me, but becauÅ¿e in all my holy word I never appointed Å¿uch a modell and forme of churches as you have erected amongst you, I

therefore in all theÅ¿e respects, take no notice of you as formed into a church or churches; I know you not; depart from me; <hi>this I preÅ¿ume any rationall man will be ready to gather will be the doome of thoÅ¿e that take no notice of ChriÅ¿t and his Followers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theÅ¿e their words and of this their dealing therefore, except my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his aÅ¿Å¿ociates, Å¿eriouÅ¿ly, unfainedly and Å¿peedily repent, they muÅ¿t give a dreadfull accompt at the laÅ¿t day. For if we muÅ¿t give an accompt of every idle word, what an accompt then muÅ¿t be given of Å¿uch expreÅ¿Å¿ions as theÅ¿e are, which deÅ¿piÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe and his bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles and all his Followers and all that beleeved in him when he was upon the earth, and take no notice of them <hi>as formed into a church or chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi> And what a dreadfull reckoning muÅ¿t he and his abetters give for all thoÅ¿e erroneous, impious and uncharitable opinions they have of late hatched and brought into the world? the very naming of the which would be unpleaÅ¿ant to a true Å¿anctified Å¿oule, as this amongÅ¿t the other, that they take no notice of ChriÅ¿t and his DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Followers and all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>John</hi> to be formed into a church or churches? Yea what a fearfull accompt muÅ¿t they at that day give for all their bitter and reviling Å¿peeches and malitious practiÅ¿es againÅ¿t all their ChriÅ¿tian brethren through the Reformed churches who they have all unchurched?</p>
               <p>Yea my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices muÅ¿t alÅ¿o give a great accompt of this, that whereas they Å¿hould have taught the people the way of God truly and plainly and have delivered unto them the whole counÅ¿ell of God, they not onely profeÅ¿Å¿e they will keep a reÅ¿erve <hi>Donec ad triarios redierit res,</hi> contrary to the command of God who hath injoyned all his Å¿ervants <hi>to be ready to give an accompt of their hope to whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall demand it</hi> 1 Pet. 3. and preach it publickly and upon the houÅ¿e topp whatÅ¿oever he taught his DiÅ¿ciples in Å¿ecret and privately, but blame all churches but their own of the congregationall way, as not rightly formed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and yet would never Å¿et down to their brethren the modell of that forme and Å¿hew it unto the people and Saints of God that they might all be undeceived if in an error, although they have bin often &amp; again Å¿ollicited thereunto, and although alÅ¿o they by promiÅ¿e had ingaged themÅ¿elves to deliver in their modell by Å¿uch a time, and by this their unjuÅ¿t and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing have kept the people of God and many pretious Å¿ouls
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48122:213"/>
in ignorance of many principall truths if their doctrine be true, and cauÅ¿ed the people by that means exceedingly to erre and to remain Å¿till in darkneÅ¿Å¿e; when notwithÅ¿tanding they glory that they Å¿et up every day many New Lights, which is in them all a moÅ¿t fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and abominable Å¿inne, and of the which as of all their hard words againÅ¿t their brethren, and of all their calumnies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and bringing up an evill name and report againÅ¿t the Presbyterian government as the wicked Spies did againÅ¿t the good Land, of all theÅ¿e things I Å¿ay as of all their errors, Å¿ciÅ¿mes and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ies, and eÅ¿pecially of <hi>their taking no notice of thoÅ¿e multitudes baptized by</hi> John <hi>and ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples to be formed into a church or churches,</hi> they except they Å¿peedily repent, muÅ¿t give a dreadfull accompt at the great day, and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> eÅ¿pecially; for he is one of the principall Leaders and Captains in this Militia and new Modell of Ill-dependency.</p>
               <p>If Å¿ome yong <hi>Sprigge</hi> that had been turn'd about with every Å¿tream of opinion, and carryed about this way and that way with every wind of doctrine, had Å¿pake Å¿uch words only, and had bin the author of Å¿uch novell opinions and of Å¿uch double dealing and jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I Å¿hould never have wondred at it, knowing how unÅ¿table youth is; but for an old <hi>Tree,</hi> in which the Å¿ap of youth Å¿hould now be well dryed up, and which Å¿hould be Å¿tiffe and unmoveable and for ever to be Å¿ettled; for Å¿uch a one I Å¿ay as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> was expected to be, to be unÅ¿table, thus toÅ¿Å¿ing and tumbling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with every Å¿tream of new doctrine or every novell blaÅ¿t of any windy opinion, it Å¿heweth that it is either founded upon a Å¿andy ground or a brittle foundation or rotten at the very root, and that if it be not Å¿peedily looked unto and underpropped that it will Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fall, and that the fall thereof will be very great; which that it may not happen to my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and that the Lord would give him and his aÅ¿Å¿ociates repentance for all their unthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e to God and for all their evill dealings and uncharitableneÅ¿Å¿e to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their brethren, and eÅ¿pecially towards my Å¿elfe, it Å¿hall be my earneÅ¿t prayer for them all who they have Å¿o much deÅ¿piÅ¿ed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this I thought fit to Å¿peak concerning my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> reply, to whatÅ¿oever he had to Å¿ay in way of anÅ¿wer concerning my firÅ¿t four propoÅ¿itions and the whole firÅ¿t part of my booke. What he hath to reply to my arguments about the Å¿econd queÅ¿tion,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48122:213"/>
touching the gathering of churches, Å¿hall be anÅ¿wered in their due place, after I have Å¿pake alittle, according to my promiÅ¿e, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Independents definition of their Church,</hi> which occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally I met with, when from their owne Principles I confirmed my arguments, that if any thing, <hi>it</hi> might make them more Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the Independents eyes, or at leaÅ¿t that they might not be Å¿o inraged againÅ¿t me hereafter, when they Å¿hall take notice that I Å¿pake nothing, but what I ratified and made good from their own grounds: Their definition of their church is this.</p>
               <p>A viÅ¿ible Church is <hi>(Å¿ay they)</hi> a myÅ¿ticall body, whereof ChriÅ¿t is the head, the Members Saints, called out of the world, and united together into one Congregation by an holy Covenant, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip the Lord, and to edifie one an other in all his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>Before I diÅ¿cover all the errors of this definition, and come to Å¿hew that according to this their deÅ¿cription of a Church, there has never as yet beene a true formed church, and that none of the congregationall churches themÅ¿elves (if this their definition bee good) be true formed churches; and which is more, <hi>that they muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, be all dependent,</hi> I Å¿hall Å¿et downe the chiefe things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervable in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> they define a viÅ¿ible church, to bee a myÅ¿ticall body, of which ChriÅ¿t is the head, the Members Saints, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, they aÅ¿Å¿ert, that this church is but one congregation,</hi> or as many as can conveniently meet together in any one place to partake in all Gods holy Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they affirme, <hi>that the forme of this church, is a holy explicite covenant,</hi> which falÅ¿ely they make one of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: or they Å¿ay, <hi>they are united together into one congregation by an holy covenant.</hi> Now it cannot be holy, except it be one of Gods Ordinances, and have his command and authority for it, which is that that ingraves holineÅ¿Å¿e upon it: otherwiÅ¿e it is either diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, or at leaÅ¿t but humane. So that in the Independents learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereÅ¿oever any of theÅ¿e things are wanting, in any congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of chriÅ¿tians, it is not a formed church: for this is their definition of a church, within the bounds and limits of which whatÅ¿oever church doth not come, and within the which it is not terminated, it is no true church; and Å¿o by this, all particular churches that are and have beene in the world, neither were nor
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48122:214"/>
are true formed churches, no not the very Independent congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations themÅ¿elves, as I hope by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance I Å¿hall illuÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly make appeare, after I have Å¿aid Å¿omething in order of the particular branches of this their definition, and have Å¿hewed the abÅ¿urdities of it, and the impoÅ¿Å¿ibilities of attaining Å¿uch a church as they have Å¿et out, and the great inconveniences, and indeed the unÅ¿upportable bondage that would redound unto thouÅ¿ands of Gods people, if theÅ¿e men might have their mind, and all things according to their definition: For from Å¿uch a church as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe and deÅ¿ire, though it conÅ¿iÅ¿t but of ten or twelve, <hi>bee they never Å¿o erroneous in their doctrine, and never Å¿o corrupt in their manners, and never Å¿o perverÅ¿e, malicious and unplacable in their minds and wils, and let their unjuÅ¿tice done againÅ¿t any poore oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed Member, by them, be never Å¿o great or exorbitant, there is no appeale from it, or helpe or redreÅ¿Å¿e to be expected by any appeale to any other court, church, or EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Tribunall; which is a yoake of one of the moÅ¿t horrid tyrannies and Å¿laveries that ever the world yet Å¿aw, and which neither wee nor our Fore-fathers could ever beare, a greater then the which never any men voluntarily put themÅ¿elves under, before theÅ¿e our unhappy times.</hi> All the which I Å¿hall, God aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting mee, in the examination of the Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of this definition, make evident.</p>
               <p>And firÅ¿t, whereas they define a <hi>viÅ¿ible church,</hi> to be a myÅ¿ticall body. If any Presbyterian Å¿hould have Å¿o Å¿pake, the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents would have Å¿aid, <hi>it had beene a bull.</hi> For viÅ¿ible and myÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cannot be predicated of one and the Å¿ame body, at one and the Å¿ame time: for if it be myÅ¿ticall, then not viÅ¿ible, and if vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible then not myÅ¿ticall: and therefore their definition belongs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the inviÅ¿ible church, then to any viÅ¿ible congregation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the matter of it is the myÅ¿ticall body of ChriÅ¿t, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of Saints, and Å¿uch as are truly holy and godly, which none know but God himÅ¿elfe; for no man can certainly and poÅ¿itively Å¿ay, <hi>that this or that man is a Saint,</hi> but in the judgement of charity, which is often miÅ¿taken, as the Independents themÅ¿elves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they have beene: for the time was, that they thought Å¿ome men Saints (who are the Å¿ame Å¿till, they then were) and yet now they not only thinke, but Å¿ay, though falÅ¿ely, they are Devils, and repent that ever they prayed for them. But moÅ¿t true it is, that God only knowes who are his: yea, the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48122:214"/>
though of more diÅ¿cerning Å¿pirits then any in our age, yet could not diÅ¿cover <hi>Iudas;</hi> ChriÅ¿t onely knew hee was a Devill; it was hidden and a myÅ¿terie to the ApoÅ¿tles, and the Å¿ame to this day lies hid from all men, who are Saints indeed; that belongs onely to God, it is his Prerogative, who is the Å¿earcher of all hearts: and therefore their definition is abÅ¿urd, groundleÅ¿Å¿e, and vaine in this branch of it, when they Å¿ay <hi>a viÅ¿ible church is a myÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of none but Saints.</hi> And then it would follow, <hi>that none of the ApoÅ¿tolicall churches were true formed churches, according to this their modell;</hi> for wee reade not onely <hi>of many Å¿candalous walkers amongÅ¿t them, but of Å¿ome hereticks,</hi> and yet they ceaÅ¿ed not to be true churches, what ever the Independents thinke now of Å¿uch congregations as are mixt, though in none or in very few of them, they can diÅ¿cover any Å¿uch offenders as were in the church in <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Philippi,</hi> and in Å¿ome of the Å¿even churches of <hi>AÅ¿ia;</hi> and therefore if their definition bee good, none of the Primitive churches were true churches; yea, I hope to make it evident in the Å¿equell, that none of the churches of the congregationall way are then true churches, as not conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of all Saints.</p>
               <p>But now I come to the Å¿econd branch or part, <hi>viz. that the Church they deÅ¿ire, muÅ¿t be but one congregation injoying all Gods Ordinances in it:</hi> which if it be true and good in this branch alÅ¿o, then the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was not a well formed church; for there were many congregations; and then alÅ¿o never a Church in the world to this day was a true church; much leÅ¿Å¿e can any of our new congregations challenge that title and be true churches, it being impoÅ¿Å¿ible, though they conÅ¿iÅ¿t but of one congregation apeece, for them Å¿everally to injoy all Gods Ordinances in any one of them: for amongÅ¿t Gods Ordinances the Independents both in <hi>New-England,</hi> and here amongÅ¿t us, hold, <hi>that Synods and Councels are one of Gods Ordinances, and yet they are not chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches properly Å¿o called in their dialect, though as they are repreÅ¿enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive bodies of many churches,</hi> they may have that name given them, and are churches in my notion and according to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding; but I Å¿ay, <hi>not properly according to their language:</hi> for their congregations conÅ¿iÅ¿t of particular PaÅ¿tors and Teachers, and of two or three Elders apeice and Deacons, and of a few men and women, and have many other pretty things required for the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48122:215"/>

               <p>For a Synod and Councell conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of Presbyters onely, and that of many, not onely out of any one particular church though never Å¿o large and great, but out of many, Å¿ent and delegated from each of them reÅ¿pectively and Å¿everally; yea, many times not only out of many Å¿everall Presbyteries adjacent, but out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries and Provinces; as that at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councels, and that lately at <hi>Dort,</hi> and this our Synod now preÅ¿ent; and their imployments likewiÅ¿e are of an other nature, then that of ordinary PaÅ¿tors in their Å¿everall congregations, as all men know: and therefore not a church properly Å¿o called, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their language; for a Synod and church, are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct things, and both of them together were never yet found in any one congregation in the world; and Å¿o by conÅ¿equence, <hi>there was never any congregation or particular church that yet injoyed all Gods Ordinances,</hi> and therefore if their definition be good, they were no true churches, for they had no Synod or Councell in them: neither can any of our new congregations at this day have a Synod in them, and therefore they injoy not all Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in them Å¿everally, and Å¿o come not within the compaÅ¿Å¿e, bounds and limits of their owne definition, <hi>and therefore remaine not true formed churches, as not injoying that Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BeÅ¿ides, there are other Ordinances that the congregationall churches cannot injoy: for there is an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility of it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning and firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution of them, but many times after in regard of mortality, and the death of their Elders and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tors, and other Officers, or when there remaines but one alive, as it often happens in our new congregations; and therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t bee Dependent, if they will injoy all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elÅ¿e be no churches, as not injoying all Ordinances: As for inÅ¿tance, there are Ordinances that neerly concerne every particular congregation, which cannot be performed by that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; for how can a particular congregation, which for the moÅ¿t part conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of ignorant men and women, try the Å¿ufficiency of the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48122:215"/>
Presbyters, that are to be elected or put over them, when they have no knowledge in thoÅ¿e Sciences, Arts, Faculties and HiÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and of the tongues and languages, as Latine, Greeke, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and are ignorant in many other things, that in Å¿ome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency are required in all Å¿uch as are to be made Presbyters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters over them; when I Å¿ay not any one in thoÅ¿e congregations, many times, have any knowledge in any one of thoÅ¿e arts and Å¿ciences, in all which a MiniÅ¿ter ought in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure to bee verÅ¿ed in, if hee will take upon him that high calling, and charge of the MiniÅ¿try, and duly and rightly performe it unto them: and were it Å¿o, that in all theÅ¿e new gathered churches they had Å¿uch intelligible Members, who when they have made choyce of them, Å¿hall give them impoÅ¿ition of hands which belongs onely to the Presbyterie and Elders to perform, &amp; cannot be done by the people, who never were appointed by God to ordaine Officers in his church, as all the learnedÅ¿t of the Independents hold and teach: Å¿o that when any Elders and Presbyters, and other church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are to be ordained in their new gathered churches, they permit not the common people to impoÅ¿e hands upon them, but alwayes deÅ¿ire Elders and Presbyters of other congregations to doe it, without whoÅ¿e helpe they cannot injoy this Ordinance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves; and therefore if they will have it, they muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be Dependent. The Å¿ame may be Å¿aid of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Excommunication; but I will firÅ¿t Å¿peake of impoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, and ordination of Elders and Officers, the which howÅ¿oever in Å¿ome of the more unlearned Independents eÅ¿teeme it to be of Å¿mall weight, and but a complement; yet it is one of Gods holy Ordinances, which the Author of the EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> accounts and reckons amongÅ¿t the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a part of the Foundation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, which place of Scripture, one of the Fathers of the congregationall way, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter <hi>Henry Iacob</hi> by name, who firÅ¿t baptized their new gathered churches, with that compellation of Independent churches, for his owne advantage exceedingly urged to overthrow the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of the MiniÅ¿ters of the church of <hi>England,</hi> becauÅ¿e as hee Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, the church of <hi>England</hi> erred in the Foundation, not having the due and right impoÅ¿ition of the hands of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, though in this as in many of his other opinions hee was very much miÅ¿taken: for thoÅ¿e that impoÅ¿ed hands upon the MiniÅ¿ters
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48122:216"/>
at their Ordination, were Presbyters. Yet I Å¿ay, they can urge this place for their advantage againÅ¿t us, and therefore I Å¿ee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on why wee alÅ¿o may not much more make uÅ¿e of it againÅ¿t them, it being Gods owne inÅ¿titution, and to be perpetuated to the worlds end in all churches; Å¿o that whereÅ¿oever this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and ImpoÅ¿ition of hands by the Presbyterie is wanting in any church, that church cannot be truly Å¿aid to injoy al Ordinances within it Å¿elfe; for there is an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility of obtaining or injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Ordinance of Ordination of Officers, by the ImpoÅ¿ition of the hands of the Presbyterie, and that often in their new ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered churches, not onely in the beginning of them, and in their firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution (as I Å¿aid before) but at many other times alÅ¿o, and that by reaÅ¿on of the death and mortality of their Elders, or when but one of them remaines alive, which frequently happens amongÅ¿t them, as daily experience teacheth us, Å¿o that of neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itie <hi>they muÅ¿t crave the helpe of other churches, and therefore in all theÅ¿e respects are Dependent;</hi> for not any one Elder alone, and by himÅ¿elfe can ordaine an other, there muÅ¿t be more together for that imployment; for it muÅ¿t bee done by the impoÅ¿ition of the hands of the Presbyterie if it be juÅ¿tly done and according to Gods appointment; that is, of many Presbyters as the word imports.</p>
               <p>And if wee take a Å¿urvey and view of all the Primitive and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tolicall churches, as that at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> of <hi>Philippi, EpheÅ¿us,</hi> and the other AÅ¿ian Churches, wee Å¿hall find in them all, an eÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliÅ¿hed Presbyterie (as I have abundantly proved) many Elders and PaÅ¿tors in each of them, appointed over them to govern and rule them in common, and all thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Presbyteries had in each of them the power of Order and JuriÅ¿diction, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of impoÅ¿ing of hands, and ordination of Elders and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers within themÅ¿elves in their reÅ¿pective Presbyteries, Å¿o that they were as Å¿o many Corporations or Committees, having their PreÅ¿idents and Chaire-men, with all other Officers amongÅ¿t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and that in abundance, as the Scripture relateth, as in all well ordered Corporations at this day it is to bee Å¿eene; Å¿o that if any one or more of their Presbyters or Officers dyed within their Å¿everall preeincts, they did by vertue of their Å¿everall Charters preÅ¿ently goe to the Ordination of new ones, and of as many as they had need of, of which they had Å¿tore and choyce for the moÅ¿t part, as all well ordered Corporations at this day have, who if their

PreÅ¿idents dye or any of their Aldermen, or any of their Common Councell, or any of their other Officers, they forthwith make election of others, out of Å¿ome of their Free-men, or of men well knowne to them for Å¿ufficiencie, wiÅ¿edome and diÅ¿cretion, and all other abilities, without having recourÅ¿e to any other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations; for they are armed with authority within themÅ¿elves for this purpoÅ¿e, and they have uÅ¿ually choyce enough of men fit for their imployments; and Å¿o it was in the ApoÅ¿tolicall and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches, who collectively taken, were all collegiatly and claÅ¿Å¿ically governed, and depended upon their Å¿everall PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries in their Å¿everall juriÅ¿dictions, which if they had beene Å¿ingle congregations only, as the Independents would perÅ¿wade the deluded people, they could never have done, for the many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons both now and in the foregoing DiÅ¿courÅ¿e Å¿pecified.

they hold, and they will become your Å¿ecret, if not your open enemies, and upon the leaÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion be ready to Å¿ide with any to do their MiniÅ¿ter a diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure, which when their MiniÅ¿ters well know, they are very fearfull of offending any, eÅ¿pecially their more weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and abler Members; beÅ¿ides we know upon what Å¿lender oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ions differences many times do ariÅ¿e amongÅ¿t neareÅ¿t friends, when it concernes their profit or reputation, or their judgement in things of their eÅ¿tates or religion; for if you jumpe not with them in their opinion in all things, they Å¿tand at a diÅ¿tance; or hinder them in the leaÅ¿t thing but in their gain and profit, and they will beare a Å¿ecret grudge unto a man and wait an opportunity to do him a diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿ure and to be even with him; and this every man knowes is the practice of moÅ¿t men; Å¿o that for any of theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons men will be ready to harbour a diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure againÅ¿t any Member, and if hee be called in queÅ¿tion for any conceived miÅ¿carryage or Å¿candall or for any different opinion, and this come once to banding and debate in the Church or Congregation, and there be Å¿iding on both Å¿ides, and parties made on each Å¿ide, Å¿o that they grow into a heat, the MiniÅ¿ters and Presbyters in their Å¿everall Congregations are by this meanes brought into many Å¿traights, not knowing what many times to do, as not daring to diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e either Å¿ide, which way Å¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their private judgment leads them; but ordinarily it is obÅ¿erved, <hi>That the MiniÅ¿ters will go with the Å¿trongeÅ¿t party and will gratifie that, and that for their own emolument and private intereÅ¿t;</hi> neither is this all, but the Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters themÅ¿elvs in their Churches many times are Å¿ubject to the Å¿ame paÅ¿Å¿ions and affections as I Å¿aid before, that other men are, and for Å¿ome Å¿ecret and private grudg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the perÅ¿on in queÅ¿tion they may uÅ¿e the extremity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Å¿entence of excommunication againÅ¿t him, which when it is once paÅ¿t, there is now no remedy of appeal left unto him, be the unjuÅ¿tice or wrong never Å¿o great; and preÅ¿idents of this nature there are many to be met with in the congregationall Churches, as I Å¿hall if occaÅ¿ion Å¿erve be able to prove.

Their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular explicite holy Covenant,</hi> which they not onely call <hi>the form of a Church,</hi> but make it an <hi>holy Ordinance,</hi> which it cannot be for the reaÅ¿ons above Å¿pecified, as having no warrant from God our father, nor no example in any of the primitive Churches, who had no other but the generall Covenant, which all the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians allow, as it is authorized by God himÅ¿elfe, though they reject that particular explicite Covenant brought in by the Independents, as being an humane Ordinance, which all ChriÅ¿tians in Gods Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ought to abhor, as not commanded and injoyned unto them by the King of his Church ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, <hi>whoÅ¿e voyce onely they are bound to hear, and who alone they are to Å¿et up as King upon his Throne, who is their Lawgiver and mighty Councellor, and the Å¿ole governour of his Church and Kingdome.</hi> And Å¿hould it be accorded and granted to the Independents, That this their particular expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Covenant were indeed the forme of a Church, as they would perÅ¿wade the people, then all the primitive and ApoÅ¿tolicall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as well as all the reformed Churches at this day in the world beÅ¿ides their own congregations, were not true formed Churches, which were a great wickedneÅ¿Å¿e and impiety to aver and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>But beÅ¿ides this their unwarrantable Covenant which they make <hi>the forme of a Church,</hi> they require of all Å¿uch as will enter into Church fellowÅ¿hip with them, many other pretty things, which they hold not onely requiÅ¿ite, but Gods Ordinance alÅ¿o; as,</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, That they Å¿hould walk Å¿ome weeks, moneths, and perhaps years, with them for a proof of their converÅ¿ation, and for the tryall of their behaviour and manners, and except they can pleaÅ¿e the whole church, there can be no admittance at laÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after their good liking of their carriage, they injoyn them to make a publike confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith; and if that diÅ¿likes them, they cannot be admitted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, after this, they require of them to bring in the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their true converÅ¿ion, as the time when, the place where, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48122:220"/>
the manner how, all which if the congregation approve not of as Å¿ufficient, they cannot be yet admitted.</p>
               <p>LaÅ¿tly, they that are to be admitted, muÅ¿t have the conÅ¿ent and approbation of the whole congregation both of men and women, or elÅ¿e by their Charter they cannot be admitted into Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them. All theÅ¿e things as I am able to prove, they require in Å¿ome of their Congregations, before any can be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as joynt members amongÅ¿t them; never a one of the which conditions or injunctions not withÅ¿tanding hath either precept or preÅ¿ident for it in all Gods holy Word. And therefore it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ufferable flavery that they impoÅ¿e upon the people, beÅ¿ides this their particular explicet covenant, which they make the form of the Church, which Å¿hould they onely require, without any of their o'her grolleries, were a bondage too unÅ¿ufferable; for in that their Covenant, as I have been informed by Å¿ome of them, when in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar manner, and in the time of our friendÅ¿hip, I deÅ¿ired to know the method of admitting of their joynt members, and eÅ¿pecially what the Covenant imported, and what they promiÅ¿ed in it, and what by it they were tyed unto, and for anÅ¿wer they replyed, <hi>that three things were contained in this their holy explicite Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That they promiÅ¿e and by this Covenant binde themÅ¿elves to each other in all Church fellowÅ¿hip, as to be helpefull one to another in all things, and eÅ¿pecially to their Pastors, and to Å¿tand one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without deÅ¿ertion of each other, and that in the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and difficulties, and to yeeld obedience and willing Å¿ubjection and conformity not onely to thoÅ¿e truths that are now imbraced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained amongÅ¿t them, but alÅ¿o willingly to Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves to all Å¿uch New Light for the future, that God Å¿hall by his Word and by the Ministry of their PaÅ¿tors diÅ¿cover unto the Church. <hi>This as I have been informed by the Independents, is the firÅ¿t thing they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thoÅ¿e that are to be admitted as members, and which they promiÅ¿e and Covenant to performe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd thing contained in the Covenant, is,</hi> That if they be Å¿ingle perÅ¿ons either batchelors or maidens, widdows, or widdowers, they may not marry without the conÅ¿ent of the Church.</p>
               <p>The third thing contained in this their holy Covenant, is, <hi>That they may not remove their habitations and dwellings, though never Å¿o advantagious unto them for their traffick and tradings, into any remote place from them, without the conÅ¿ent of the Congregation,</hi> and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48122:220"/>
Å¿ome other things there are compriÅ¿ed under this Covenant, which they keep among themÅ¿elves as <hi>arcana regni</hi> as Å¿ecrets of their Kingdome, all the which if they be Å¿eriouÅ¿ly looked into, contain in them Å¿o many myÅ¿teries of Iniquity; yet all of them exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantageous unto themÅ¿elves, they all tending to the Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their partie, and the more corroborating their combination, as thoÅ¿e that are judicious have well obÅ¿erved.</p>
               <p>But were there no other Å¿lavery and bondage, in their whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but this of their covenant and of the appertinances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, as amongÅ¿t others, their blind obedience, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet a greater yoak of Å¿ervitude put upon poor people under AntichriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf; and the truth is, as the PapiÅ¿ts oft times, Å¿cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over old holy dayes with new ceremonies and Å¿olemnities, and put them upon the people to be obÅ¿erved as new ones; even Å¿o the Independents furbuÅ¿h over old errors with new varniÅ¿h, to make them more Å¿pecious to the deluded people, and bring them in as new truths, and Å¿et them up as new Lights, when they are nothing elÅ¿e but ancient errours, and very Popery it Å¿elfe in a new attire, as is apparent to any that will not wilfully put out their eyes. In the time of the Prelates raign, every ceremony they brought in was excepted againÅ¿t as a human tradition, and that worthily: and every invention and tradition of man was rejected as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and will-worÅ¿hip was abhorred as AntichriÅ¿tian; and to Å¿erve God by the precepts of men, and by a Å¿ervice eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed onely by humane authority, was rejected as a thing diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and thought unÅ¿ufferable; and to have Prelates Å¿et over them to Lord it over Gods heritage was thought the higheÅ¿t point of tyranny; and for the removall of them root and branch with all their trumpery and appertinances, all the Independents themÅ¿elves, with the whole city and the greateÅ¿t part of the Kingdome, petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the great Councell of the Kingdome; and not onely Å¿o, but many of them have ventured their lives in the juÅ¿t defence of their ChriÅ¿tian libertie, and have offered their eÅ¿tates and expoÅ¿ed themÅ¿elves and theirs to greateÅ¿t dangers in this good quarrell, which will ever be to the immortall honour of them all to all Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, and they will be an example to other Nations to do the like. Yet behold every one of theÅ¿e things revived now and brought in amongÅ¿t the ignorant people, and contended for with all Å¿everity and eagerneÅ¿Å¿e, as for the Oracles of God, notwithÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48122:221"/>
ding they are but the inventions of men, there being neither precept nor preÅ¿ident for them in the whole Word of God, nor any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e of them in any of the ApoÅ¿tolicall and Primitive Churches: and therefore it doth neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow, That their whole Å¿ervice and DiÅ¿cipline with all their concomitants are but their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, for which there is no warrant or pattern in the whole Word of truth; and as for their MiniÅ¿ters and PaÅ¿tors, both in New <hi>England</hi> &amp; in their new Congregations here they Lord it over the poor people, in as high a manner (as can be proved) as ever the lordly Prelates did, in reÅ¿pect of their Å¿upercilious behaviour; and yet the people Å¿wallow all theÅ¿e things as Gods Ordinances, and bind themÅ¿elves by their unholy Covenant to obÅ¿erve them, which in any underÅ¿tanding mans judgement, that knows what his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus having briefly diÅ¿covered Å¿ome of the errors of their definition and Å¿hewed the abÅ¿urdities of it, and the inconveniences of Å¿uch a Church as they would have, and evinced alÅ¿o, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, there has never yet bin a true formed Church on earth, and that all the congregationall Churches, if they will be included within the compaÅ¿Å¿e of that diÅ¿cription, they muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be Dependent; I will now come to my laÅ¿t and main concluÅ¿ion, which is to prove that none of the Churches of the Congregationall way are true Churches, as not conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of all viÅ¿ible Saints, and therefore not to be communicated with in holy things: which I Å¿hall do from their own argument. For thus they diÅ¿pute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t us.</p>
               <p>ThoÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿emblies <hi>(Å¿ay they)</hi> or Churches, in which the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not viÅ¿ible Saints, called out of the world and united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into their Å¿everall Congregations by an holy Covenant to worÅ¿hip the Lord and to edifie one another in all his holy Ordinances, they are no true formed Churches according to the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and ought not to be communicated with in holy things, but are to be Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from, unleÅ¿Å¿e they will be made companions with Å¿uch kinde of Saints as <hi>Job</hi> would not Å¿et with the doggs of his flocke, being tagg ragg, with whom godly Å¿oules can no more converÅ¿e then with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, the Parochiall Congregations through the whole Kingdome</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:48122:221"/>
                  <hi>are Å¿uch.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they are not true formed Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and ought not to be communicated with, unleÅ¿Å¿e &amp;c. This is the Il-dependents doctrine they teach their DiÅ¿ciples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Churches, as appeareth in all their Pamphlets, as in that of</hi> I. S. <hi>and my brother</hi> Burtons <hi>eÅ¿pecially, and this is one of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital arguments which they uÅ¿e, to maintain their Å¿eparation from us; and upon which they ground the gathering of their new Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the futility and vanity of the which every one that Å¿hall but vouchÅ¿afe to read this book Å¿hall finde in many places diÅ¿covered. I will therefore in this place, make uÅ¿e of the Å¿ame againÅ¿t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elvs to prove that their Churches and new gathered congregations are not true formed Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, as not conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of all viÅ¿ible Saints, and therefore not to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with in holy things as the Å¿everall inÅ¿uing arguments will declare: which I deÅ¿ire the Independents themÅ¿elves would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice Å¿eriouÅ¿ly conÅ¿ider and ponder, that they may the better diÅ¿cern into the errors of their wayes, and in time repent of all their unrighteous and uncharitable dealing towards their brethren. I thus argue.</p>
               <p>ThoÅ¿e Churches and Congregations, the Members of the which are not viÅ¿ible Saints, called out of the world and united together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies by an holy Covenant to Å¿erve the Lord in all his holy Ordinances, but are joyned together in a wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piracy and combination againÅ¿t the people of God and his Ordinances and to hinder the reformation of the Church: they are no true formed Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and the Members of them are not true viÅ¿ible Saints and therefore ought not to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with in holy things, but to be Å¿eparated from. But all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Congregationall way are Å¿uch: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not true formed Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament forme; and therefore by their own doctrine, not to be communicated with in holy things, but to be Å¿eparate from, and that for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿ons the Il-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents falÅ¿ly pretend they Å¿ever themÅ¿elves from our publique AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>The Major of this SyllogiÅ¿me is their own, and therefore they cannot gainÅ¿ay it; the Minor therefore being proved, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion will neceÅ¿Å¿arily inÅ¿ue. And as for the Minor, I thus evince it.</p>

                  </gap>Å¿t Argument.</p>
               <p>My Å¿econd Argument is this:</p>
               <p>ThoÅ¿e Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies whoÅ¿e Members contrary to the example of all the holy Prophets and Servants of God, who were ever humble in their own eyes, continually, falÅ¿ly, and phariÅ¿aically and upon all occaÅ¿ions boaÅ¿t themÅ¿elves of their owne righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e (Å¿o much condemned in holy writ) calling themÅ¿elves the pretious and holy Å¿ervants of God, the godly party, the praying people, the onely men of Gods right hand, the Saints, the generation of the JuÅ¿t, hating and deÅ¿piÅ¿ing their poor brethren, and are ever plotting againÅ¿t them, accounting them as Heathens and Infidels, and departing from them as more holy then they; all Å¿uch, <hi>I Å¿ay,</hi> are neither viÅ¿ible Saints nor good Daemons, as being by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe and the holy Scripture condemned and therefore are not true Churches after the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>orm<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> whoÅ¿e Members ought to be all viÅ¿ible Saints; but are mixt Congregations with whom truly godly Å¿ouls ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in holy things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:48122:227"/>
But all the Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies of the Il-dependents are Å¿uch as conÅ¿iÅ¿t of Å¿uch Members: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are neither viÅ¿ible Saints nor good Daemons, and therefore ought not to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with in holy things, but to be Å¿eparated from, by all the truly godly Å¿ouls.</p>
               <p>For the Major propoÅ¿ition no man can deny it, now if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor be confirmed, then there is no man that will doubt of the truth of the concluÅ¿ion; for that will neceÅ¿Å¿arily inÅ¿ue from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The parts of the Minor are theÅ¿e: The firÅ¿t,</hi> That it was ever the practice of all the holy Å¿ervants of God, to be humble in their owne eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd,</hi> That God did ever condemne Å¿uch as juÅ¿tified them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Å¿elves and boaÅ¿ted of their own righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third,</hi> That the Il-dependents do both falÅ¿ly and phariÅ¿aically boaÅ¿t themÅ¿elves when they call themÅ¿elves the pretious and holy Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, the godly party, the praying people, the onely men of Gods right hand, the Saints and the Generation of the juÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>The fourth, <hi>That they do despiÅ¿e their ChriÅ¿tian brethren and Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from them as being more holy then they;</hi> By all which they declare themÅ¿elves to be neither Saints indeed nor good Daemons, nor a Church or Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, and therefore ought to be Å¿eparated from.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall now prove all theÅ¿e parts in order beginning with the firÅ¿t, by which the concluÅ¿ion will be the more obvious to every judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader, and I hope, to many of the Il-dependents themÅ¿elves if they will Å¿eriouÅ¿ly and without partiality weigh all things: And for the evincing of that, I will begin with <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of all the faithfull, who Å¿aith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Behold now I have taken upon me to Å¿peake unto the Lord, which am but duÅ¿t and aÅ¿hes.</hi> Here we Å¿ee <hi>Abraham</hi> had no high though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that they falÅ¿ly glory and boaÅ¿t of their own righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, holineÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿anctity, is my taske now to prove, which by the grace of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48122:229"/>
God I will do running through all and every Å¿everall branch of their gloriations.

               <p>Again the truly praying people are taught to pray <hi>lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evill;</hi> therefore they pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the toleration of all Religions, which is not onely a great temptation and an occaÅ¿ion of evill, but the very Å¿ourÅ¿e and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all errours, Å¿chiÅ¿mes, hereÅ¿ies, and of all abominations, and of all the evills both of Å¿in and puniÅ¿hment, that can light upon any Church, Nation or Kingdome, as we may Å¿ee by the example of the Churches of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> to the which the Lord Å¿aith, <hi>Repent, or elÅ¿e I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t thee with the Å¿word of my mouth. And I will caÅ¿t her into a bed of great tribulation, and will kill her with death, and all the Churches Å¿hall know, that I am he which Å¿earcheth the reines and hearts, and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</hi> I Å¿ay therefore from very good ground, that a Toleration of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions is not onely a great temptation, but the greateÅ¿t evill in the world, and would be a meanes of bringing plagues and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the three Kingdomes, and a diÅ¿traction and diÅ¿order amongÅ¿t all the people and a confuÅ¿ion of all things; againÅ¿t all the which as Å¿o many temptations and capitall evills, all truly godly praying people if they will pray according to Gods will, ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿antly to put up their dayly Å¿upplications, as they deÅ¿ire the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God and the removeall of his judgements, and in their Å¿o praying they do but their duty and according to the will of God:
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48122:234"/>
Therefore when the Il-dependents pray for a Toleration of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions under the name of liberty of conÅ¿cience, and labour for it, and hinder with all their power the Å¿etting up of the onely true Religion and worke of Reformation, and the Å¿etting up of Å¿uch a Government in ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome, which is his Church as he hath revealed in his bleÅ¿Å¿ed will, and they have alÅ¿o covenanted to bring in, in their Å¿o doing they neither pray that Gods name may be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, nor that his Kingdome may come, nor that his will may be done, nor that they may not be led into temptation, and be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from evill; and therefore they pray not aright, and are not as they falÅ¿ly boaÅ¿t themÅ¿elves the only true praying people; for they pray not according to Gods will.</p>
               <p>Now when thoÅ¿e Churches of the Congregationall way conÅ¿iÅ¿t of Å¿uch kinde of praying Members, it is apparently manifeÅ¿t they are a mixt Generation of men, and not the Generation of the juÅ¿t, nor the men of Gods right hand, which is another title they falÅ¿ly and phariÅ¿aically alÅ¿o claime and challeng unto themÅ¿elves, as they did the former, as will by and by appear upon due examination and diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of the true Å¿enÅ¿e of that expreÅ¿Å¿ion. For <hi>thoÅ¿e that are the men and people of Gods right hand properly Å¿o called,</hi> are Å¿uch, <hi>as with all their might Å¿tand up in defence of Gods true Religion, and earnestly contend for the faith once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> Jude 2, 3. and are not onely ever ready to lay down their lives for that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient faith, but with all their power to fight for it to the laÅ¿t drop of their blood, in oppoÅ¿ition to all errours, Å¿uperÅ¿tition, hereÅ¿ies, and all manner of falÅ¿e worÅ¿hip, and in oppoÅ¿ing whatÅ¿oever is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the power of godlineÅ¿Å¿e as a Toleration of all Religions is, which tends only to the bringing in of all prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Now the Il-independents deny, that they did ever fight for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Yea, I my Å¿elfe have heard many of them Å¿ay, <hi>That it is unlawful to fight for Religion, and they profeÅ¿Å¿ed that when they went out with the Å¿word in their hands, they fought onely for the liberty of their conÅ¿ciences, and for a Toleration of Religion which is a part and branch</hi> (as they Å¿aid) <hi>of the Subjects birth-right:</hi> All this I can with many more depoÅ¿e, and therefore they falÅ¿ly arrogate unto themÅ¿elves that title <hi>of being the men of Gods right hand,</hi> which no more belongs unto them then the other enÅ¿ignes and titles did: And as little right have they to the title of Saints and the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

For anÅ¿wer, the Holy GhoÅ¿t, that beÅ¿t knew who were Saints indeed, Å¿ets down the characters of true Saints.

So <hi>to walk uprightly,</hi> in Scripture language, is, <hi>to walk after the Å¿pirit, to be regenerate, to be a holy and heavenly minded man, who doth all the actions of one borne again of the water and of the spirit, he makes the Law of God his delight, and Å¿quares his life and actions according to that rule and the direction of his bleÅ¿Å¿ed word, and he orders his life by that rule in all integrity, Å¿incerity and without hypocriÅ¿ie, or any baÅ¿e or by-ends or wordly respects.

               </p>
               <p>Now I Å¿ay, if it can be proved that the Independents make it their ordinary and daily practiÅ¿e, not only to traduce, back-bite, and doe evill, and receive a reproach againÅ¿t their fellow brethren, but doe all theÅ¿e evils alÅ¿o againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that are in dignity and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and are made Rulers and Governours of the people, and over themÅ¿elves, it follows that they that doe all theÅ¿e evils, and all thoÅ¿e that aÅ¿Å¿ent unto them in their Å¿o doing, are not Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in Gods eÅ¿teeme; now that the Il-dependents are guilty of all theÅ¿e crimes, the many Pamphlets lately Å¿et forth by them, as thoÅ¿e publiÅ¿hed by <hi>Iohn Lilburne,</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and all the other Å¿currilous and libellous Bookes Å¿et forth by thoÅ¿e of that party, and countenanced by them doe Å¿ufficiently witneÅ¿Å¿e.

               </p>
               <p>Now that it is the generall practiÅ¿e of all the Il-dependents to do this, I refer my Å¿elfe to thoÅ¿e Pamphlets above Å¿pecified and to their dayly Proceedings, their combinings and confederatings of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves together for this very purpoÅ¿e; all which do Å¿ufficiently teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and declare unto the world as well as their dayly publiÅ¿hing through City and Country Å¿uch words and books as tend altogether for the defaming of the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the traducing of all their brethren; that it is one of their maÅ¿ter pieces boldly to calumniate all men that Å¿omething may cleave and Å¿tick.</p>
               <p>Again, I demande of any man what it is to do evill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if plotting againÅ¿t the life and blood of their neighbours be not to do evil unto them, if making rents, Å¿chiÅ¿mes and factions in Church and State, and to vent and publiÅ¿h deÅ¿perate and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinions and open hereÅ¿ies, all which are works of the fleÅ¿h leading men to perdition <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. I ask I Å¿ay, of any man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the acting of all theÅ¿e things be not to do evill to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? And whether or no to violate all the laws of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon needleÅ¿Å¿e and unwarrantable pretences, as to divide the husband from the wife, the parents from the children, the Å¿ervants from their maÅ¿ters, the Å¿ubjects from their governours and them in authority over them, the people and Å¿heep from their MiniÅ¿ters and faithfull PaÅ¿tors, and to labour for a toleration of all Religions in a State and Kingdome, yea in many Kingdomes, and by this means to bring confuÅ¿ion upon them all: I demand I Å¿ay, of any mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, whether the acting of all theÅ¿e things be not to do evill to their neighbours? And whether to ride and run from one end of the Kindom to another to Å¿educe the people, and to do their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours a miÅ¿chiefe, and by tongue and pen and all manner of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48122:240"/>
language to wrong them to the taking away of their good name which is better then their life, be not to do evill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Again I demand of any Å¿olid ChriÅ¿tian whether the indeavouring the taking away all means of livelyhood from the MiniÅ¿ters, as their tythes the onely Å¿upport of their families, and the making of them odious by their railing Pamphlets, and the hindring Reformation in the Church, and the breaking of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es and covenants with their brethren to the prejudice of the whole Kingdom, be not to do evill to their neighbours? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raiÅ¿e up falÅ¿e and infamous reports againÅ¿t their brethren the Scots and them in authority, and to publiÅ¿h them in word and print be not to do evill to their neighbours? And whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of their brethren their very prayers, aide, help and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance at any time, yea to pray againÅ¿t them and for their confuÅ¿ion, be not to do evill to their neighbours? I Å¿hall here deÅ¿ire of any Å¿ober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded ChriÅ¿tian to tell me whether the acting or doing of all theÅ¿e things or any of them or the conÅ¿enting unto them and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of them, be not to do evill to their neighbours? And I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿uredly confident, that he will candidly acknowledge that the acting of all this is to do evill to their neighbour.</p>
               <p>Now that the Il-dependents dayly practice all theÅ¿e things, can be proved by a cloud of witneÅ¿Å¿es, yea all their Actions and Pamphlets can teÅ¿tifie it, eÅ¿pecially the late conÅ¿piracy of many of them againÅ¿t the life of that Honourable Gentleman Mr <hi>Speaker</hi> of the HouÅ¿e of Commons and many more of the High Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and their running and riding about to preach up their new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and hereticall opinions to the diÅ¿turbing of all order in Church and State for the Å¿educing of the people; and their running riding and going from place to place to defame and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their neighbors, for the hindring of them from coming to any imployment by which they might have been uÅ¿eful in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the land of their nativity; all theÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ages I Å¿ay can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t them; and innumerable preÅ¿idents more of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriÅ¿tian proceedings againÅ¿t their breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>n might be produced and may be proved by numberleÅ¿Å¿e witneÅ¿Å¿es, beÅ¿ides their owne writings, that all of them do evill to their neighbours, and that this is the generall practice of the Il-dependents. Yea it is notoriouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that there is Å¿carce a meeting of them, whether in their feÅ¿tivities or in any of their Å¿olemn aÅ¿Å¿emblings of themÅ¿elves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48122:241"/>
gether, that they do any other great thing amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, but that that tends to the evill of their neighbours in word and deed, there Å¿carce iÅ¿Å¿uing any thing out of their mouths but injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words againÅ¿t them: Yea they cannot contain themÅ¿elves in the very open Å¿treets and in the Churches from railing againÅ¿t their ChriÅ¿tian brethren, as can Å¿ufficiently be proved; Yea let any PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian accidentally but come into their houÅ¿es, and they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and raile at him. And if all this be not to do evill to their neighbours, I know not what is to do evill unto them.</p>
               <p>Now in Gods dialect all Å¿uch as perpetrate any of theÅ¿e actions, are not Saints indeed: for the true Saints do no evill to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>The Il-dependents may not here pretend, that their MiniÅ¿ters can preach and pray well, and that thoÅ¿e of their fraternity have many of them excellent gifts; for gifts are not Å¿ufficient to make Saints, but grace is that that makes Saints; For Saint <hi>James</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> have Å¿ufficiently proved That unto all the true Saints; for Å¿o in the firÅ¿t of the <hi>Corinthians ch.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Though I Å¿peak</hi> (Å¿aith Paul) <hi>with the tongues of men and Angels, and have no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I am become as Å¿ounding braÅ¿Å¿e and a tinckling Å¿ymball. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and underÅ¿tand all myÅ¿teries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, Å¿o that I could remove mountaines, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burnt, and have not charity, it profiteth nothing.</hi> So that by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> all gifts are nothing without that grace of love. And Saint <hi>James</hi> in the Å¿econd <hi>chap.</hi> ver. 17. Å¿aith, <hi>That faith without works is dead,</hi> and that Å¿uch as Å¿hall not relieve and helpe their ChriÅ¿tian brethren in their neceÅ¿Å¿ities, their Religion is not Å¿o good as that of the devills, for they beleeve and tremble; for pure Religion and undefiled is <hi>to viÅ¿it the fatherleÅ¿Å¿e and the widdow, and to releeve them in their neceÅ¿Å¿ities,</hi> J am. 1. therefore they that are Å¿o far from relieving their brethren and doing good to them and loving of them, as they do them all the evill they can, pretend they what they will, they are no Saints. Yea, Saint <hi>John</hi> alÅ¿o in his firÅ¿t <hi>EpiÅ¿tle</hi> Å¿aith <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifes;t and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the devill, whoÅ¿oever doth not righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother;</hi> For <hi>this is the meÅ¿Å¿age that ye heard from the beginning, that we Å¿hould love one another, not as Cain</hi>

               <p>And here I Å¿hall take an occaÅ¿ion to bring to the memory of the Il dependents Å¿ome paÅ¿Å¿ages of their uncharitable dealing towards my Å¿elfe lately, that all men may Å¿ee how unjuÅ¿t and partiall jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they are, and how they upon all opportunities will condemne any Presbyterian for that which they count a pleaÅ¿antery and an elegancy or matter of mirth in their own mouthes. The Å¿tory brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this.</p>
               <p>When the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> was in queÅ¿tion before the great Councell of the Kingdome, the high Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as if that Å¿upream tribunall had wanted either judgement or prudence and Å¿ufficient underÅ¿tanding and knowledge for the tryall of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, or had wanted courage or reÅ¿olution or a minde to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute juÅ¿tice againÅ¿t Å¿o eminent an offender as he was, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding carryed on the whole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e with Å¿uch wiÅ¿dome and moderation and in Å¿o fair a way, as by which the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath gained an immortall fame to the worlds end; yet at that time thoÅ¿e of the Il-dependent party were the chiefe agents of all thoÅ¿e tumults at <hi>WestminÅ¿ter,</hi> who made it their imployment day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to run thither to cry for juÅ¿tice againÅ¿t the Earle, abuÅ¿ing him though then in the hands of authority, with all the reproachfull words that with the tongues of men could be uttered, as all the Å¿tanders by can witneÅ¿Å¿e, deÅ¿cribing him from all the parts of his body, and from every one of them gathering Å¿ome preÅ¿age of evill that Å¿hould firÅ¿t be acted by him, &amp; that Å¿hould finally bring him to an evill and untimely end, and this for the moÅ¿t part was the theam of all their Å¿pitefull diÅ¿courÅ¿e concerning him as he was carryed both to and from the <hi>Parliament:</hi> AmongÅ¿t other of their expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, they Å¿aid, he looked like the belly of a toad and that his teeth Å¿tood in his head like a pot-fiÅ¿h, and that he was Å¿o rotten with the poxe, that if they could not by their clamours procure juÅ¿tice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t him, yet they comforted themÅ¿elves in this, that he could
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48122:242"/>
not continue long; for Å¿aid they he will fall apeeces he is Å¿o rotten with that noyÅ¿ome diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e and many other expreÅ¿Å¿ions they dayly and openly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>uttered againÅ¿t the Earle, ever affirming that he was the uglieÅ¿t man that ever they beheld.</p>
               <p>This language I can depoÅ¿e I learned amongÅ¿t them as never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard it in all my life from any man before that time; and they took no Å¿mall pleaÅ¿ure in venting theÅ¿e words upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, and they uÅ¿ed them as the flowers of their rhetorick, and it was thought neither blaÅ¿phemy in them nor a lie nor any Å¿currility, neither were there any then of that fraternity Å¿o Å¿evere, as to think that any that uÅ¿ed Å¿uch words could not have the leaÅ¿t dram of grace in them. But upon their clamours and through their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant inÅ¿olencies againÅ¿t him, I being one day at <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter</hi> waited for his paÅ¿Å¿ing by that I might Å¿ee what a hideous creature he was, that I might at another time Å¿ay I had Å¿een him, and in beholding of him I heard their uncivill and reviling Å¿peeches againÅ¿t him, but obÅ¿erved nothing in his looks and perÅ¿on, but had his actions been as Å¿erviceable to the Kingdome as they were deÅ¿tructive to all the Kings Dominions and to himÅ¿elfe, there was nothing wanting in the man, either for perÅ¿on or courtÅ¿hip, or any other accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that might not have made him lovely and venerable in any part of the world. And I may truly Å¿ay this of him, that he had more generoÅ¿ity in his look then halfe the Il-dependents that ever I Å¿aw, were they put all together: but thus they did aÅ¿perÅ¿e him for his very looks and complexion. And in the Å¿ame manner they Å¿pake of thoÅ¿e Cavaliers that accompanyed the <hi>king</hi> when he came to the HouÅ¿e of Commons to demand the five Members, of all the which they Å¿aid they looked like Å¿o many devills, furies and feinds from <hi>Orco</hi> and Hell it Å¿efe, and uÅ¿ed all the odious expreÅ¿Å¿ions peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could imagine to Å¿et them forth: And of all the miniÅ¿ters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> they Å¿ay they are belly-gods and Å¿uch as run from one end of the Kingdome to another to get preferment and to do miÅ¿chiefe.</p>
               <p>Now upon an occaÅ¿ion not long Å¿ince of a mutinous company of Il-dependents that Å¿ought the life and blood of many honourable Members in the HouÅ¿e of Commons; and had entred into a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conÅ¿piracy to that end, whoÅ¿e immaculate reputation notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding they could not with all the breath of their calumnies in

The conÅ¿ideration of theÅ¿e things, and with what diÅ¿guiÅ¿ed aÅ¿pects, and hideous lookes, and odde complexions they appeared in all the roomes about the Committee, and how they grinned at mee with their teeth, made mee in the deÅ¿cription of them uÅ¿e the Å¿ame expreÅ¿Å¿ions that they had formerly done of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the Cavaliers, and the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when both in their countenance and actions they paralleld them, and Å¿ay they looked like Å¿o many furies, and like the belly of a Toad, and as if they had got a blow with a French CoulÅ¿taffe, and that one might picke Å¿ome of their teeth with a BedÅ¿taffe, all which were their owne expreÅ¿Å¿ions; and as they accuÅ¿ed the Presbyters for belly gods, Å¿o they alÅ¿o were very Å¿enÅ¿ible of good cheere, and that as the Presbyters had with their Å¿uperÅ¿titions polluted the Church, Å¿o they did pollute them with their Å¿cummering and piÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing in them; and that as they Å¿ought to inÅ¿lave the Gentry and Nobility, and the whole Kingdome; Å¿o the Independets if they could but once attaine the maÅ¿tery would doe no leÅ¿Å¿e; and for this my Å¿o Å¿peaking I had very good reaÅ¿on, being well acquainted with their language and dialect, having often heard Å¿ome of them
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48122:244"/>
Å¿ay, that the Gentry and Nobility had beene the cauÅ¿e of all the miÅ¿eries of the Kingdome, and that if they continued in their greatneÅ¿Å¿e, wee might never looke for happy dayes; nay, it can be proved that Å¿ome of the Independent MiniÅ¿ters have made it part of their imployment, to run from one place to an other to preach their errors, and in their Sermons to bring the Gentry and Nobility into the hatred of the people, accuÅ¿ing them as the cauÅ¿e of all our calamities, publickly declaming againÅ¿t them, as the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿t Gentry and Nobility in the world, Å¿aying in expreÅ¿Å¿e words, that howÅ¿oever Noble-mens Mothers were knowne, yet their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were Grooms, or Å¿ome baÅ¿e fellows, &amp; that they were nothing but droÅ¿Å¿e, dreÅ¿Å¿e, droÅ¿Å¿e; and this they have Å¿pake in great and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded AÅ¿Å¿emblies; all the which Å¿peeches, if they tend not to make the Nobility hatefull to the people, and Å¿o by conÅ¿equence to the ruine and overthrow of them in time, I know not what can; and whether all this bee not to doe evill to their neighbours, I leave it to the judgement of others; and how many of the Independents have vilified the great Councell, let their bookes be examined and they will Å¿ay I wrong them not in any thing, when I affirm they labour to bring in a confuÅ¿ion of all things; yea, their words daily at the very Parliament dore can witneÅ¿Å¿e that howÅ¿oever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to honour the Parliament, yet they do accuÅ¿e them of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and tyrannicall Government, and aÅ¿Å¿ert that the Lawyers in the Parliament have betrayed the Liberties of the Å¿ubject, and this is their daily language, and that it may bee the better knowne, it is all extant in their printed Books, by all which they do evill to their neighbours. Now then if I, in my juÅ¿t defence made uÅ¿e of their owne expreÅ¿Å¿ions to Å¿et downe the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of their wayes, and to diÅ¿cover their bad intentions, there was no juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e why any rationall man Å¿hould condemne mee for it, for <hi>ridentem dicere verum quid vetat?</hi> Now that the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents have Å¿o Å¿everely cenÅ¿ured mee cauÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿ely for this, they Å¿hew they are altogether partiall and very unjuÅ¿t Judges; and whiles they doe the greateÅ¿t evill unto men, that can poÅ¿Å¿ibly by the malice of men be done unto them which no true Saints doe, <hi>for they doe no evill to their neighbours,</hi> as the Spirit of God Å¿aith; yet they will condemne others, for but making uÅ¿e truly of Å¿uch expreÅ¿Å¿ions (as they themÅ¿elves have falÅ¿ely and cauÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿ely uÅ¿ed againÅ¿t others); for I in diÅ¿cribing of them and their proceedings

expreÅ¿t my Å¿elfe but in their owne dialect, and yet they fill the whole Kingdom with clamours againÅ¿t mee, for being but their Å¿choller. The time was, when I writ my Letany for to make my Å¿elf and my fellow PriÅ¿oners merry in our bands, that when many grave men liked it in private, yet diÅ¿Å¿waded mee from making of it publick, that thoÅ¿e that are now the great Sticklers of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent party, againÅ¿t all the counÅ¿ell of my grave friends, perÅ¿wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to print it, proteÅ¿ting, <hi>that they thought it would doe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates more miÅ¿chiefe then any booke that was Å¿eriouÅ¿ly penned againÅ¿t them, and therefore intreated mee by all meanes, that I would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h it; yea, they offered mee to Å¿et it forth upon their owne charges and coÅ¿ts; and through their importunity they prevayled with mee to give them the copie, and it was printed, and liked Å¿o wel of by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they commended mee with all the prayÅ¿es men could extoll and magnifie a man with, as can be proved, and they have often profeÅ¿t unto mee, that they thought it was the beÅ¿t way of dealing with any enemies of the Church, and therefore I conceive that</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>uÅ¿eth Å¿o much of this method in his books.</hi> But indeed there have bin many, and grave Divines that have writ many merry and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant books againÅ¿t the Prelates in all ages &amp; nations, which have diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their vanities more then any thing that was Å¿eriouÅ¿ly writ, by which meanes many perÅ¿onages of eminent quality, as well as thoÅ¿e of low degree, have come to the knowledge of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneÅ¿Å¿e of the Papall Hierarchy, which had they beene Å¿eriouÅ¿ly penned no man would have regarded; yea, the holy Prophets and divine Pen-men have made themÅ¿elves merry with the vanity of the falÅ¿e Prophets, and great men of their time, many preÅ¿idents of the which might be produced out of Å¿acred writ, <hi>Å¿o that there is no Å¿inne in writing pleaÅ¿antly againÅ¿t any Å¿uch as goe about to Å¿educe and miÅ¿lead the people, and alienate them from their duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and their obedience to thoÅ¿e that are in authority, and from their duty and love to their brethren,</hi> all which are capitall evils, and which no true Saints will perpetrate.</p>
               <p>Now I Å¿ay, in this that the Independents did Å¿o well like of my Letany, and the merry paÅ¿Å¿ages in that booke, and are Å¿o highly offended at my mirth in my juÅ¿t defence againÅ¿t them, that are equally guilty with thoÅ¿e they moÅ¿t mortally hate, and in that they Å¿o harÅ¿hly accuÅ¿e thoÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions in my booke, which I have but borrowed from them, Å¿aying, <hi>that none that uÅ¿eth Å¿uch,</hi>

                  <hi>can have a dramme of grace in them,</hi> in all this they are very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and unjuÅ¿t Judges, and give unrighteous judgement againÅ¿t their neighbour, which is to doe evill to their neighbour, which all true Saints will not doe; and they may remember that the Lord in the 29. of of <hi>IÅ¿aiah,</hi> condemned <hi>Å¿uch as made a man an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a word:</hi> But of all theÅ¿e things in their due place, When I upon an other occaÅ¿ion Å¿hall anÅ¿wer to the <hi>moderate checks,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I Å¿hall make it appeare, <hi>had thoÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions beene mine owne, there had beene no blaÅ¿phemy in them,</hi> without it be eÅ¿teemed blaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy with them, to compare a company of rude and rebellious wicked people to a good creature of God, when as the Holy GhoÅ¿t compareth Å¿uch to a Dog <hi>returning to his vomit, and to a Sow wallowing in the mire;</hi> withall I Å¿hall then make it evident, that the conÅ¿piracy of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> was not greater againÅ¿t <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> then this confederacy of the Ill-dependents at that time againÅ¿t Å¿ome of the honourable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Parliament. But letting paÅ¿Å¿e their partiality in many other things towards their owne party, in whom they can Å¿ee no Å¿inne, I will goe on to the other characters of true Saints indeed, as they are Å¿et downe by the Spirit of God: the third of which, in this verÅ¿e, is <hi>that they receive not a reproach againÅ¿t their neighbors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The true Saints,</hi> Å¿aith the Holy GhoÅ¿t, <hi>take not up a reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t their neighbours,</hi> they will neither heare much leÅ¿Å¿e entertain or receive an evill reproach or calumny againÅ¿t their neighbours, for they have learned better things out of Gods holy word, as in <hi>Exodus</hi> 23. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 1. where the Lord Å¿peaking to his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all true Saints, Å¿aith, <hi>Thou Å¿halt not receive or rayÅ¿e a falÅ¿e report; put not thou thy hand with the wicked, to be an unrighteous wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> Neither is there any thing more forbidden through the whole Scripture, then whiÅ¿pering, and tale-bearing, as all the <hi>Proverbes,</hi> &amp; indeed all the Propheticall &amp; apoÅ¿tolicall writings can witneÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>Å¿o that all Å¿uch as either raiÅ¿e, or receive falÅ¿e reports, or reproaches againÅ¿t their neighbours, in Gods eÅ¿teeme, are no true Saints, but wicked men and unrighteous wretches;</hi> for Å¿o the Lord proclameth all Å¿uch; and a greater unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿inne towards men, there cannot be then to rob them of their good name, which is to them <hi>as a pretious oyntment, and better then gold or Å¿ilver, or great riches, Proverbs</hi> 22. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 1. <hi>EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿t.</hi> the 7. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 1. and hence it was that <hi>David</hi> compares the tongues of reproachfull

men to Speares, Arrows, and Swords, and all inÅ¿truments of death; for by their calumnies they wounded and murthered the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their innocent neighbours, and killed them whiles they were alive<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which is the worÅ¿t of all mortall deaths: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Prophet though otherwiÅ¿e a valiant man, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, yet often profeÅ¿Å¿eth, <hi>that they had brake his heart with their reproaches;</hi> and truly a Å¿orer affliction in this life cannot lite upon any men, then to bee wounded in their good name, and to have their due honours and prayÅ¿es taken from them, &amp; to be made vile amongÅ¿t the people, which is the greateÅ¿t of worldly evils, as all judicious and impartiall men will eaÅ¿ily judge; for there is no fence or ward againÅ¿t calumnies in the Å¿chooles either of wit or art; and all Å¿uch as either rayÅ¿e Å¿uch reports againÅ¿t their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or receive a reproach, and harbour any evill thoughts againÅ¿t them, and Å¿uch as tend to the wounding of their good names and fames, are all in Gods Dialect reputed no Saints; for the true Saints Å¿aith the Holy GhoÅ¿t, <hi>take not up a reproach againÅ¿t their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;</hi> for thus the Lord hath declared himÅ¿elfe in his holy word concerning all Å¿uch men as either <hi>raiÅ¿e or receive a reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t their brethren,</hi> aÅ¿Å¿erting <hi>that they are no Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the Il-dependents make it their dayly practice, not onely to receive reproaches againÅ¿t their ordinary neighbours and brethren, but againÅ¿t both the MagiÅ¿trates, MiniÅ¿ters and all their Presbyterian brethren both <hi>ScottiÅ¿h and EngliÅ¿h,</hi> as all the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets of <hi>John Lilburne</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and all the other writings and words and the very Sermons of thoÅ¿e of the Il-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent party and all their proceedings do daily witneÅ¿Å¿e, it is Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evident that they are no Saints: For the true Saints and all Å¿uch as are Saints indeed, receive not a reproach againÅ¿t their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Yea it is well known and can be proved that they hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproaches againÅ¿t their innocent neighbours, and will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertain into their companies, but even into their new gathered Churches Å¿uch infamous perÅ¿ons as have been a Å¿hame and diÅ¿ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to all their kindred, and Å¿uch as continue Å¿till in their wicked and ungodly practices; and
onely for this, that they can impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly reproach their neighbours and raiÅ¿e an evill report againÅ¿t them; all this I Å¿ay can Å¿ufficiently be proved. Nay Å¿ome of them have been heard Å¿ay, when they have railed at and reviled Å¿ome godly Presbyterian MiniÅ¿ters that oppoÅ¿ed the errors and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48122:246"/>
of the times, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they were demanded what evil they knew by them, and what they could blame in their lives and converÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I Å¿ay when this queÅ¿tion has been propounded unto them, they have replyed, this is the miÅ¿chief and Å¿pite of it that they are unblameable in their lives: then the which there could not be a more wicked, malitious and unchriÅ¿tian expreÅ¿Å¿ion, by which they declare unto all men that it troubled and perplexed them that there was no evill in their lives by which they might juÅ¿tly defame them; Å¿o that it is evident to all men that it is matter of rejoycing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the Il-dependents when they hear of any failings in their Presbyterian brethren contrary unto the cuÅ¿tome and practice of the people of God and the true Saints in all ages; <hi>for they receive not a reproach againÅ¿t their neighbour;</hi> innumerable inÅ¿tances of this nature might be produced againÅ¿t the Il-dependents, but that their practices are Å¿o obvious to all thoÅ¿e that are acquainted with them, or but come in their companies; for a man Å¿hall not be half an hour in any of their Å¿ocieties but he Å¿hall hear them either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the <hi>Parliament</hi> or their Proceedings, or inveigh againÅ¿t Å¿ome of the Generalls of our Armyes, or Å¿peak againÅ¿t the reverend AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿embly of Divines and againÅ¿t all the Presbyterians their brethren, or againÅ¿t the Scots; and all that they Å¿peak of them or any of them, tendeth to their reproach or infamy, Å¿o that they do not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive reproaches againÅ¿t their innocent neighbours that live harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿ly by them, but they raiÅ¿e up reproaches againÅ¿t them and print them, yea againÅ¿t the whole city that has deÅ¿erved Å¿o well from Church and State, and only <hi>for that they deÅ¿ire to keep their Covenant with their God, and which they have Å¿olemnly taken, lifting up their hands and hearts to the moÅ¿t high, and vowed to perform,</hi> which will be for their immortall praiÅ¿e; and yet <hi>for this cauÅ¿e onely and no wrong done or attempted againÅ¿t them,</hi> they can in the Great Court of the Kingdom &amp; in print alÅ¿o reproach them all and accuÅ¿e them of black choler, yea blackcoat choler, as if they were the moÅ¿t ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, rancorous and envyous wicked men in the world, which is Å¿o unÅ¿ufferable a reproach againÅ¿t the great city of the Kingdome as yet before theÅ¿e our times never Å¿aw the light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now if theÅ¿e men at their pleaÅ¿ure will cauÅ¿leÅ¿Å¿ely traduce and that publickly and in print, men in authority and men that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved Å¿o well from the Church of God and the whole Kindome,</hi> What may any man imagine will not theÅ¿e men do and plot in private
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48122:246"/>
to reproach their harmleÅ¿Å¿e neighbours when they thus daringly and prodigiouÅ¿ly reproach them in publick and that in print? <hi>So that I may conclude and that truly of them,</hi> Except they Å¿eriouÅ¿ly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dailly repent of this their wicked dealing towards their brethren, this character of the Saints alÅ¿o will not belong unto the Independents; for the true Saints, neither raiÅ¿e nor receive a falÅ¿e report or reproach against their neighbours, nor aÅ¿Å¿ent to any that do either.</p>
               <p>And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿poke of the three Characters of all true Saints indeed contained in the third <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> of this 15. <hi>PÅ¿alme.</hi> There are yet other four in the inÅ¿uing verÅ¿es, three of which I will run over briefly, they being all things of practice and well known to all men: And they are theÅ¿e; <hi>In whoÅ¿e eyes a vile perÅ¿on is contemned: and he honoureth them that fear the Lord: and he that Å¿weareth to his own hurt and changeth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e Characters, is, <hi>to contemn a vile perÅ¿on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd is,</hi> to honour Å¿uch as fear the Lord.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Now that this is the dayly practice of the Independents, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take upon my life to prove it by a cloud of witneÅ¿Å¿es, and that there is not the vileÅ¿t perÅ¿on nor the wickedeÅ¿t wretch that they will not joyn with to do any of their Presbyterian brethren a miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, &amp; that they will not give credit to in falÅ¿ly belying their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; yea it can be proved, <hi>that when the Independents have been demanded by Å¿ome godly and orthodox Ministers why they have left the publick AÅ¿Å¿emblies Å¿eeing there was now no ceremonies nor any thing in their doctrine that they could finde fault with,</hi> and they have replyed, <hi>That it was in regard that their Congregations were mixt,</hi>

                  <hi>that tagg ragg and all Å¿orts of men were admitted to the Sacrament, with whom they could not joyne.</hi> Whereupon the MiniÅ¿ters, that they might remove this Å¿candall and offence, laboured by all means to perÅ¿wade the people Å¿o to behave themÅ¿elves as they might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿t unto all men they were worthy communicants, otherwiÅ¿e profeÅ¿Å¿ing unto them that they durÅ¿t not adminiÅ¿ter the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them; and therefore for Å¿ome moneths abÅ¿tained from the publick adminiÅ¿tration of the Sacrament and uÅ¿ed all their beÅ¿t en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in that interim by their faithfull and painfull preaching and exhortations, to fit all men for the better receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that by this means they might gratifie their tender conÅ¿ciences; I Å¿ay in this interim of time it Å¿hall be proved, <hi>that theÅ¿e Independents, who thoÅ¿e godly MiniÅ¿ters had Å¿uch a deÅ¿ire to pleaÅ¿e, went unto theÅ¿e wicked and ungodly men that the MiniÅ¿ters excepted againÅ¿t for their converÅ¿ation as ungodly and prophane, and joyned with them againÅ¿t their MiniÅ¿ters,</hi> Å¿aying unto them, <hi>What will you give tythes and maintenance to Å¿uch MiniÅ¿ters as Å¿hall thus deal with you as to deny you the Sacrament of the Lords Å¿upper? Å¿urely were I in your condition, &amp; were I a Member of your Congregations, I would never own Å¿uch a man for my Minister, nor never give any allowance to any Å¿uch as would not adminiÅ¿ter the Sacrament unto me:</hi> By which practices of theirs they have made thoÅ¿e painful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters Å¿o odious to the people by joyning with thoÅ¿e wicked var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots as they have not only deprived them of their livelyhoods and maintenance, but Å¿o perÅ¿ecuted them with all manner of reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and evill language, as they have forced them to leave their places and to wander about the world to get themÅ¿elves a poor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the Å¿upportation of themÅ¿elves and their diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; by all which proceedings if the Independents do not declare themÅ¿elves to be Å¿uch as countenance a vile perÅ¿on, and to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of thoÅ¿e that fear the Lord, I know not what ever any men did to deÅ¿erve thoÅ¿e Characters, by all which they proclaim them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to be no true Saints, if the Lord himÅ¿elf knoweth how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe Saints indeed: This that I have here related I Å¿hall by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance be able to prove by Å¿uch witneÅ¿Å¿es as againÅ¿t whom there can be brought no juÅ¿t exception.</p>
               <p>And that all the Independents are notorious covenant-breakers, or aÅ¿Å¿enters unto Å¿uch as violate their oathes and promiÅ¿es both to God and men, all the Kingdome can witneÅ¿Å¿e for me, eÅ¿pecially
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48122:248"/>
thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters of the Reverend AÅ¿Å¿embly, with whom the diÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting brethren have brake all promiÅ¿es and Å¿olemne agreements not once but many times; Å¿o that it would be a needleÅ¿Å¿e work to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate any further, in proving them to be <hi>no Saints indeed,</hi> when they manifeÅ¿t by all their practices that they neither <hi>walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor work righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, nor Å¿peak the truth in their heart, and when they backbite their neighbours with their tongue and do evill unto them and receive a reproach againÅ¿t their neighbours and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vile perÅ¿ons, and honour not Å¿uch as fear the Lord, and keep not their promiÅ¿es either with God or men;</hi> by all which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the world <hi>that they are not Saints indeed,</hi> when all theÅ¿e Characters are the badges onely of wicked men, to do contrary to that deÅ¿cription of true Saints.</p>
               <p>Now when all the Churches of the Congregationall way conÅ¿iÅ¿t of Å¿uch Members as theÅ¿e are, it followes that they are mixt AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblies as not conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of viÅ¿ible Saints, &amp; therefore ought juÅ¿tly <hi>to be Å¿eparated from and not to be communicated with in holy things;</hi> and that from their own principles: For they pretend they Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from our aÅ¿Å¿emblies onely becauÅ¿e they are mixt of tagg ragg <hi>and Å¿uch Saints as Job would not Å¿et with the dogs of his flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many other Arguments alÅ¿o might I here bring againÅ¿t both the MiniÅ¿ters and people of the congregational way to prove them no viÅ¿ible Saints, and that not from any private information or clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿tine practices, but for open delinquency and Å¿candalous walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and that in the veiw of all men, and Å¿uch as can be proved by Å¿uch perÅ¿onages, as againÅ¿t whom there can be no juÅ¿t excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But before I conclude this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e let me Å¿ay that which a learned man once uttered reading ChriÅ¿ts Sermon upon the mount and the holy EvangeliÅ¿ts, <hi>either this is not the GoÅ¿pel</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t, or if it be the men now living are no ChriÅ¿tians:</hi> After the Å¿ame manner I may truly Å¿ay of thoÅ¿e of the Congregational way, that either this diÅ¿cription of the true Saints is not the word of God, or if it be, thoÅ¿e of the Independent AÅ¿Å¿emblies are no Saints: for there is no agreement between them and the deÅ¿cription of thoÅ¿e Saints there Å¿pecified, as all their practices Å¿ufficiently and apparently declare.</p>
               <p>And now the fourth and laÅ¿t part of my Minor PropoÅ¿ition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth only to be proved: <hi>viz. That the Independents and all thoÅ¿e of the Congregationall way despiÅ¿e their ChriÅ¿tian Brethren</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:48122:249"/>
                  <hi>and Å¿eparate from them as being more holy then they;</hi> which is Å¿o apparently true, as beÅ¿ides their words and Pamphlets in all which they proteÅ¿t againÅ¿t us, <hi>as enemies of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t &amp; his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and as an AntichriÅ¿tian brood,</hi> their dayly practice declareth it, who have moulded themÅ¿elves into innumerable Å¿ucking Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which they terme the onely true Churches, and have Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from our AÅ¿lemblies as from Å¿o many Synagogues of Sathan, for this is their language. So that it may be thought a needleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿pending of time, to uÅ¿e any Arguments to evince that which is in the view of all men, &amp; which the Independents themÅ¿elvs avouch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having therefore thus proved all the parts and branches of my</hi> minor <hi>propoÅ¿ition, the</hi> major <hi>being undeniable, the concluÅ¿ion will neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow,</hi> That the Churches of the Congregationall way, are not true Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament forme, as not conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting of all viÅ¿ible Saints, but are mixt Congregations, and therefore by truly godly people ought not to be communicated with in holy things, and that from their own principles.</p>
               <p>So that now, it is apparently evident to the judicious Reader from that I have formerly Å¿pake &amp; from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> words and from their own definition of a Church, <hi>That neither the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, nor any of the Primitive and ApoÅ¿tolical Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, were true formed Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament form, if my brother</hi> Burtons <hi>and</hi> I. S. <hi>his words and their definition of a Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> be true, and that the very Churches of the Congregationall way, as not coming within the bounds of that definition, are no right conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches, as not conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of all viÅ¿ible Saints &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municating in all Ordinances,</hi> and which is more, <hi>That if they will be right formed churches they muÅ¿t al be dependent.</hi> All this I Å¿ay is Å¿ufficiently proved f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> all the foregoing diÅ¿courÅ¿e to any intelligible &amp; impartiall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the which I have been the more large, that if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible, I might undeceive the poor deluded people, and perÅ¿wade them to take no notice of them (as the Independents do not of thoÅ¿e multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples) as formed into a church or Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament form: for the firÅ¿t formed Church we read of is <hi>Acts</hi> the Å¿econd, that conÅ¿iÅ¿ted onely of viÅ¿ible Saints, and yet had neither Deacons nor Presbyters at that time, nor diÅ¿tinct Officers and Members united into one Church body reÅ¿pectively, and wanted that part of DiÅ¿cipline alÅ¿o of caÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out corrupt Members (as my brother <hi>Burton</hi> aÅ¿Å¿erteth <hi>pag.</hi> 10.)
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48122:249"/>
So that by this it evidently followeth, <hi>That thoÅ¿e Congregations that conÅ¿iÅ¿t of viÅ¿ible Saints, though they have not diÅ¿tinct Officers within themÅ¿elves and want DiÅ¿cipline, may be true formed Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament form,</hi> as the Church here of <hi>JoruÅ¿alem</hi> was, which at that time it was a true formed Church (by my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿ion) had no Deacons, nor Elders nor dictinÅ¿tion of officers &amp; members, nor that part of DiÅ¿cipline for caÅ¿ting out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Members, and yet I Å¿ay notwithÅ¿tanding it wanted all theÅ¿e things (by their own conceÅ¿Å¿ion) it was at that time <hi>a true formed church,</hi> &amp; that becauÅ¿e the Members of that Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible Saints:</hi> from all which I may draw theÅ¿e two infalliblecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The FirÅ¿t,</hi> that all Å¿uch congregations as conÅ¿iÅ¿t of viÅ¿ible Saints, Å¿uch as beleeve the GoÅ¿pel, and make profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian Faith, and are baptized, and continue Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ApoÅ¿tles, in breaking of bread, and in prayer, are true formed Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament forme; although they want both diÅ¿tinct Officers, and Members united into one Church body respectively, and although they want that part of diÅ¿cipline for caÅ¿ting out of corrupt Members. <hi>This firÅ¿t concluÅ¿ion, I Å¿ay, I infallibly gather from the Independents doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd is this,</hi> That whatÅ¿oever Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies they be, that have both diÅ¿tinction of Officers and Members, and Church diÅ¿cipline, and all other outward performances, if the Members of them bee not viÅ¿ible Saints, they are not true formed Churches after the New Testament forme; for all true formed Churches after the New TeÅ¿tament form, are Å¿uch as conÅ¿iÅ¿t of viÅ¿ible Saints, without which they are but Å¿hadows of Churches, and no true churches for Å¿ubÅ¿tance; but all the Independent congregations are Å¿uch as only glory in outward performances &amp; conÅ¿iÅ¿t not of viÅ¿ible Saints. Ergo. <hi>And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿pake to all that Mr</hi> Knollys I. S. &amp; <hi>my Brother had to reply againÅ¿t all my Arguments, for the proof of my firÅ¿t PropoÅ¿ition,</hi> viz. that there were many Congregations and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies of beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, in the which they injoyed all acts of worÅ¿hip, and all the Å¿aving and Å¿ealing Ordinances amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, and that before the perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and under the perÅ¿ecution, and after the perÅ¿ecution.</p>
               <p>And now I come to what MaÅ¿ter <hi>HanÅ¿erdo, I. S.</hi> and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> have to anÅ¿wer to my Å¿econd, third and fourth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions

inÅ¿uing; and after I have diÅ¿patched that worke, I will then in like manner reply to whatÅ¿oever either MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys, I.

               <p>My Å¿econd PropoÅ¿ition now followeth, <hi>viz.

This is all MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> hath to Å¿ay to this PropoÅ¿ition. I will firÅ¿t therefore reply to him, and in doing that, inÅ¿ert my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> anÅ¿wer to it, with what <hi>I.

S.</hi> have written, will conclude, <hi>That MaÅ¿ter</hi> HanÅ¿erdo <hi>is a man of very Å¿hallow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and of as little honeÅ¿ty, and no way to be credited in what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee Å¿aith or writeth.</hi> Neither ought MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> in this controverÅ¿ie (eÅ¿pecially when the debate is yet <hi>Å¿ub Iudice)</hi> to bee both <hi>party, witneÅ¿Å¿e, Iury and Iudge,</hi> in his owne cauÅ¿e, as all wiÅ¿e men will gather: and therefore I leave it to the judgement of the learned, whether or no I have not by Scripture Å¿ufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>there were many congregations, and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in that one Church; and whether I have not by expreÅ¿Å¿e words of Scripture, and from my brother</hi> Burtons <hi>and MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>his owne words abundantly evinced it;</hi> all this, I Å¿ay, I leave to the judgement of all impartiall and underÅ¿tanding ChriÅ¿tians, who I am confident will grant that I have Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved <hi>there were many congregations of beleevers in the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem; and therefore I challenge MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his promiÅ¿e, and expect that hee Å¿hould acknowledge his error; and Å¿o relinquiÅ¿h his fond opinion of Independency, which if he doe not, hee cannot be an honeÅ¿t man, and a true Saint, as not keeping his word; for <hi>David</hi> deÅ¿cribing a true Saint, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 15. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 4. Å¿aith of Å¿uch an one, <hi>that hee Å¿weareth to his owne hurt, and changeth not.</hi> Now if hee bee in the number of thoÅ¿e Saints, and will keepe his promiÅ¿e, hee will abandon his tenent of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way.</p>
               <p>But becauÅ¿e MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿o peremptorily aÅ¿Å¿erts, <hi>that the brethren have not acknowledged that there were many congregations and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Beleevers in the Church at IeruÅ¿alem;</hi> I Å¿hall deÅ¿irehim and all thoÅ¿e of his fellowÅ¿hip to hear my brother <hi>Burton</hi> who eÅ¿teems of himÅ¿elfe as none of the weakeÅ¿t brethren, but accounteth himÅ¿elfe a Champion, and therefore cometh out to

dare all the world of Presbyterians; and yet hee in the name of all that Fraternity acknowledgeth, <hi>that there were many aÅ¿Å¿emblies of Beleevers and Saints in the Church of JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and this his book is allowed of and highly approved of by many of them: And if I have not been miÅ¿-informed, it was licenÅ¿ed by their Batcheler of the black-art of Il-dependency that Å¿hotten hering in divinity, who alloweth of all their other Pamphlets and Å¿ets his <hi>Imprimatur</hi> to them; So that what he licenÅ¿eth is approved of by them all.</p>
               <p>Now I deÅ¿ire Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I.

               <p>The first formed Church <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> we finde is in the Å¿econd of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which though conÅ¿isting of five thouÅ¿and, yet it was one entire particular Church and not Churches; and they continued dayly <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>TheÅ¿e are my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> words in the name of all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and therefore they may abundantly Å¿atisfie Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and all men that the brethren have acknowledged there were many Congregations of beleevers in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem.</hi> But for the farther confirmation of this truth, <hi>that the brethren have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged there were Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿emblies of beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> I will unto the teÅ¿timony of my brother <hi>Burton</hi> add the teÅ¿timony likewiÅ¿e of another faithfull brother againÅ¿t whom I preÅ¿ume Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> can have no juÅ¿t exception; Å¿o that this truth being confirmed by the mouth of two approved and Å¿eraphicall witneÅ¿Å¿es, the brethren can never doubt of it any more: and this witneÅ¿Å¿e is one Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdo</hi> one of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> for <hi>England</hi> his Chaplaines, a man worthy of eÅ¿teeme who uÅ¿ually preacheth on

horÅ¿eback to the Country Courtiers <hi>all the the truth</hi> (as he Å¿aid) <hi>of the GoÅ¿pel;</hi> And therefore I know Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> will give great heed to Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdo's</hi> teÅ¿timony concerning this matter, and he touching this point in the tenth page of his learned book Å¿aith <hi>that the Apostles and all the Beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem met together with one accord in one place, to wit, the Temple, and in</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons <hi>Porch, and brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e</hi> domatim, <hi>and thus they did</hi> quotidie <hi>day by day</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the which two teÅ¿timonies the one of my brother</hi> Burton <hi>the other of Saint</hi> HanÅ¿erdo, <hi>all intelligible men may eaÅ¿ily gather,</hi> that there is very little credit at any time to be given to what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> or thoÅ¿e of his party Å¿hall affirme either concerning the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their brethren or what they Å¿hall relate concerning other men: <hi>For he in the name of them all aÅ¿Å¿erteth theÅ¿e two things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firÅ¿t touching themÅ¿elves:</hi> viz. that the brethren <hi>(meaning all the Illdependents)</hi> have not acknowledged that there were many congregations in that one Church at IeruÅ¿alem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd concerning my Å¿elfe, of whom he Å¿aith,</hi> that the Doctor hath not by Scripture proved that there were Å¿everall aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Beleevers in that one Church.</p>
               <p>Now for the latter of his aÅ¿Å¿ertions, I have not only from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proved it, but from my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and MaÅ¿ter <hi>HanÅ¿erdos</hi> their owne conceÅ¿Å¿ions made it good: <hi>viz. that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do to all the world accuÅ¿e MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> of calumny and diÅ¿honeÅ¿ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the firÅ¿t of his aÅ¿Å¿ertions:</hi> viz. That the brethren have not acknowledged it, <hi>for the conviction of him of an apparent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in this, my brother</hi> Burton <hi>and Saint</hi> HanÅ¿erdoes <hi>teÅ¿timonies do it for me; for in their above mentioned words, and that in the name of all the Independents, and that in books approved of by many of that way, in thoÅ¿e I Å¿ay my brother</hi> Burton conceptis ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis <hi>Å¿aith,</hi> that though it was but one entire Church, yet for want of a convenient place Å¿o Å¿pacious as where to break bread, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trained to Å¿ever themÅ¿elves into divers companies in Å¿everal private houÅ¿es to communicate. <hi>And Saint</hi> HanÅ¿erdos <hi>his teÅ¿timony is as full as my brother</hi> Burtons, <hi>for he Å¿aith</hi> the ApoÅ¿tles and beleevers met day by day in the Temple and in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch and brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, <hi>that is they did communicate from houÅ¿e to</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:48122:252"/>
                  <hi>houÅ¿e or in every houÅ¿e; So that Saint</hi> HanÅ¿erdos <hi>witneÅ¿Å¿e to prove many aÅ¿Å¿emblies is moÅ¿t evident. So that both theÅ¿e brethren in the name of all their fraternity acknowledge,</hi> there were may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, and that in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall private houÅ¿es, <hi>and my brother</hi> Burton <hi>Å¿aith moreover,</hi> that they were Å¿o many branches of one and the Å¿ame particular Church.</p>
               <p>Now I refer my Å¿elfe to all the world, whether there be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard at any time to be given either to MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> or any of his faction, when he and they at pleaÅ¿ure dare publiÅ¿h Å¿uch noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious untruths as theÅ¿e, for he in the name of all the Independents affirmeth, <hi>that the brethren have not acknowledged that there were many congregations of Beleevers in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> when my brother <hi>Burton</hi> notwithÅ¿tanding and Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdo</hi> have in expreÅ¿Å¿e words, and that in the name of all their fraternity aÅ¿Å¿erted, <hi>That when there were but five thouÅ¿and yea but three thouÅ¿and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, for the largneÅ¿Å¿e of the Church at that time and for want of Å¿o spacious a room as could contain them all to injoy all acts of worÅ¿hip, they were then forced to Å¿ever themÅ¿elves into divers companies and that in Å¿everal private houÅ¿es and to break bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e.</hi> So that for Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and thoÅ¿e of his way they are not to be regarded: for all they of that fraternity are generally Å¿o given to tell untruths, that for my part, I never believe them; neither when they Å¿ay true, nor when they ly; for they wil ly by the day &amp; by the night.</p>
               <p>But out of my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> words and that in the name of all their brethren, I deÅ¿ire the Reader to obÅ¿erve what they both grant. And firÅ¿t to conÅ¿ider my brother <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿ions, for he in them accordeth to theÅ¿e three things: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That the Church of IeruÅ¿alem was but one particular Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He acknowledgeth that there were divers companies of Beleevers and that in Å¿everall private houÅ¿es in that Church, which did dayly communicate in Gods Ordinances Å¿everally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He aÅ¿Å¿erteth that all thoÅ¿e companies in thoÅ¿e Å¿everall private houÅ¿es were but Å¿o many branches in that one and the Å¿ame particular Church.</p>
               <p>Now in the Å¿econd place I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire all men duly to weigh Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> words in his reply to my Å¿econd propoÅ¿ition, and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48122:252"/>
there he aaknowledgeth <hi>that the Church of IeruÅ¿alem was but one Church,</hi> notwithÅ¿tanding in the Å¿ame page he granteth <hi>that that Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of diverÅ¿e Congregations;</hi> for he acknowledgeth, <hi>that they had a congregation in the Temple, that is one place;</hi> and he grants alÅ¿o, <hi>they had an AÅ¿Å¿embly in</hi> Solomons <hi>Porch,</hi> that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, and he acknowledgeth moreover, <hi>that they brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>na fidelia duos parietes,</hi> hath done both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For firÅ¿t, he acknowledgeth</hi> there were many Congregations there.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he proveth it by Scripture as out of the firÅ¿t 5 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Acts:</hi> So that MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> I hope will not hereafter Å¿ay <hi>that the brethren have not acknowledged that there were many Congregations in IeruÅ¿alem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I do verily beleeve that MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>and all the brethren of the Congregationall way, when they Å¿hall duly and maturely conÅ¿ider what my brother</hi> Burton <hi>and Saint</hi> HanÅ¿erdo <hi>have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, will give them little thanks for their paines;</hi> for their doctrine is not onely contrary to all the Independents principles, but totally Å¿ubverteth and overthroweth the tenent of the Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall way: <hi>For all the Independent MiniÅ¿ters through the World preach up and publiÅ¿h in all their Pamphlets,</hi> that in all the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches there were no more beleevers in any one of them, no not in the very Church of IeruÅ¿alem it Å¿elfe, then could all meet together
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48122:253"/>
at one time and in one place to communicate in all Acts of WorÅ¿hip: <hi>And this doctrine they have broached to all people whereÅ¿oever they come, perÅ¿wading them that this is Gods way, and the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell way, and the right way of gathering Churches, and therefore they call it</hi> the Congregationall way, <hi>affirming,</hi> that all the ApoÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Churches we read of in the holy Scriptures, each of them in their Å¿everall Cityes and Precincts conÅ¿iÅ¿ted but of as many as did all meet in one Congregation, and this they call Gods Ordinance. <hi>And many of the brethren both aÅ¿Å¿embled and not aÅ¿Å¿embled, have been heard Å¿ay and promiÅ¿e,</hi> that if it could evidently be made appear unto them, that there were many Congregations and diverÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Beleevers either in the Church at IeruÅ¿alem or in any other of the ApoÅ¿tolicall Churches, that then they would relinquiÅ¿h their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Independency, and acknowledge that the Congregationall way had not any warrant and footing in Gods word, and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the PreÅ¿byterians concerning the combining of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under one PreÅ¿bytery and their Dependency upon it, and their making of a Å¿ubordination of many AÅ¿Å¿emblies under one Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tocracy to be governed by the Common Councell and joynt conÅ¿ent of many Elders, was Gods Ordinance.</p>
               <p>This I Å¿ay, all the Independents that I have ever talked with or or by relation heard of, have promiÅ¿ed and by proteÅ¿tation engaged themÅ¿elves, that if it could be made appear unto them by the word of God, <hi>that there were many Congregations of Beleevers either in IeruÅ¿alem or in any of the Primtive churches that then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverÅ¿y amongÅ¿t the brethren would be at an end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although I have in the foregoing treatiÅ¿e Å¿ufficiently evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and made it evident, that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that they were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon that one Presbytery; yet becauÅ¿e it is the chief point of controverÅ¿ie between us, and the which being Å¿ufficiently clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is that, that will put an end to the whole debate; and becauÅ¿e alÅ¿o Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath Å¿o peremptorily affirmed, That the brethren have not acknowledged that there were divers AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers there, for his farther Å¿atisfaction and for the Å¿atisfaction of all thoÅ¿e of his party, and for the Å¿atisfaction of all men, and that at laÅ¿t the brethren may be the more fully convinced of the error of their wayes, and that the Å¿imple people alÅ¿o may be undeceived, I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire them all Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to weigh and conÅ¿ider what both my
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48122:253"/>
brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdo</hi> are forced to confeÅ¿Å¿e (though I muÅ¿t needs Å¿ay thus much of them both, That they withhold much of the truth in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, as I Å¿hall by and by make appear) but this (I Å¿ay) I deÅ¿ire all men adviÅ¿edly to weigh, what they are both conÅ¿trained to acknowledge.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t therefore I will again Å¿et down my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> words, and in the Å¿econd place I will repeat Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿ions: For my brother <hi>Burton</hi> his words are theÅ¿e, <hi>They were</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>constrained to Å¿ever themÅ¿elves into diverÅ¿e companies, in Å¿everall private houÅ¿es to communicate;</hi> and which is more, he granteth, <hi>That thoÅ¿e Å¿everall companies were but Å¿o many branches of that one and the Å¿ame particular Church,</hi> &amp;c. thus he. MaÅ¿ter <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> words are theÅ¿e, <hi>All the beleevers</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, met together with one accord in one place; to wit, the Temple, and in Solomons Porch, and brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e, and that day by day:</hi> theÅ¿e are Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> own words. Now I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire all judicious ChriÅ¿tians duly to conÅ¿ider both their expreÅ¿Å¿ions; for all men know, that branches either of a vine or tree, as we Å¿ee it in the fifteenth of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and in the eleventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they are all dependent upon the Vine and root, as drawing life and Å¿ap from them; for being Å¿evered and cut off they do forthwith dye and wither. Now then, if according to my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and learning, and if his Å¿imilie be good, <hi>That there is the Å¿ame relation between the Å¿everall companies in thoÅ¿e Å¿everall private houÅ¿es and the whole particular Church in JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> that is <hi>between either the branches of the Vine or Tree,</hi> which ever depend upon their Å¿tock or root for Å¿ap and life, and for the compleating of them: then I Å¿ay, by my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> own conceÅ¿Å¿ion, There were not onely many Congregations of beleevers in that Church, but they all of them were dependent of that one particular Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Church, and were all Å¿ubordinate unto it, and were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and governed <hi>Communi conÅ¿ilio Presbyterorum.</hi> And the Å¿ame may be concluded out of the words of Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whether this be not true or no, I refer it to the judgement of all Å¿uch ChriÅ¿tians, as have not either morgaged their reaÅ¿on; and put it out of their own poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, or abÅ¿olutely Å¿old the fee Å¿imple of their underÅ¿tanding; and to all Å¿uch I Å¿ay, as have not been prodigall in eyther of theÅ¿e kindes, or have not forfeited all their wit and knowledge, and Å¿o are to be begged for punies and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48122:254"/>
fools, I refer my Å¿elfe as moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured they will all Å¿ay and affirme, That my brother <hi>Burton</hi> with one Å¿troke of this his Phocions hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet hath cut in two the long thred of all the alribiadian fluent, and luxuriant rhetorications (to uÅ¿urpe his own words) of all his brethren of the Congregationall way, by which they bound and tyed up their ill-Å¿hrouded Ill-dependency, and by this hath given a fatall Å¿troak to that their <hi>Hydra,</hi> and indeed utterly overthrown their whole Congregationall Fabrick, and the Å¿ame they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude concerning Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdo.</hi>

               <p>Yea, I dare in this controverÅ¿ie between us, make my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> their greateÅ¿t friends, and my greateÅ¿t enemies arbiters and judges, eÅ¿pecially if they be not Å¿o wedded to their own reÅ¿olves and opinions, that be they never Å¿o adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are yet reÅ¿olved never to give them a bill of divorce; except I Å¿ay, they be men deÅ¿perately beÅ¿otted and doting upon their filthy and deformed novelties: were they I Å¿ay, much their friends, and very much my enemies, I dare leave the deciding of this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e and difference between us unto their judgement and determination. And I Å¿hall reÅ¿t moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, and be ever confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent if my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> words be true, and to be credited, and if they both Å¿tand to what they have Å¿aid, to wit, That there were many companies of beleevers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that in Å¿everall houÅ¿es, where they did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and that all theÅ¿e congregations were but Å¿o many branches of that one particular Church, which brake bread from houÅ¿e to houÅ¿e or in every houÅ¿e, (as they both affirme) that they will all accord, judge, and conclude, That they both of them have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the Doctrine of Independency and that of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall way, and delucidately proved, That the Church of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem</hi> was Dependent, and Presbyterianly and ClaÅ¿Å¿ically gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And withall, by that I have now Å¿aid, I hope that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> himÅ¿elfe will in time be convinced of his errour, and will not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after Å¿o boldly affirme, That the brethren have not acknowledged it; eÅ¿pecially when he Å¿hall deliberately read what my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdo</hi> that faithfull brother and witneÅ¿Å¿e hath written.</p>
               <p>But as I accuÅ¿ed my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> before of jugling and of indirect dealing in this Å¿o Å¿erious and weighty a matter: Å¿o here I will make it good; for,</p>

                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:48122:254"/>
FirÅ¿t, <hi>They make all the beleevers of IeruÅ¿alem, till the receiving of the gifts of the holy GhoÅ¿t</hi> (which we read of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. ver. 1.) <hi>to amount to no more then an hundred and twenty names,</hi> and Å¿o would perÅ¿wade the poor ignorant people, <hi>that there were no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then in IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which I affirm is a great wickedneÅ¿Å¿e in them both, Å¿o to betray the truth and to give the Å¿pirit of God the lye, when it is manifeÅ¿t out of all the EvangeliÅ¿ts, that there were infinite multitudes of beleevers then in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> all inhabitants there; and when in expreÅ¿Å¿e words, in the Å¿econd of the <hi>Acts</hi> it is Å¿aid, <hi>That there were devout men and true worÅ¿hippers from out of all the Nations under heaven, at that time in that City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas it is related in the Å¿econd chapter, That there were three thouÅ¿and Å¿ouls at the firÅ¿t miracle and Å¿ermon of <hi>Peter</hi> converted, beÅ¿ides many others <hi>that the Lord added dayly to the Church, ver.</hi> 47.

               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas it is farther related in the Å¿ixt chapter ver. 7.</hi> that the word of God increaÅ¿ed and the number of the DiÅ¿ciples multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in IeruÅ¿alem greatly, and a great company of the Priests were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the faith. <hi>And whereas in divers other places of the</hi> Acts <hi>it is witneÅ¿Å¿ed that there was increaÅ¿e upon increaÅ¿e of beleevers in that Church: And whereas in the 21. of the</hi> Acts <hi>it is recorded</hi> that there were many ten thouÅ¿and beleevers there &amp; all Inhabitants; <hi>my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>and Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>in their enumeration of the Beleevers in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem <hi>at firÅ¿t and laÅ¿t make them but five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and in all.

So that in the reckoning of my brother</hi> Burton <hi>and MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys, <hi>the whole number of beleevers in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem <hi>at firÅ¿t and laÅ¿t was but five thouÅ¿and in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I refer my Å¿elfe unto the judicious and godly Reader whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theÅ¿e men have not made falÅ¿e MuÅ¿ters or no to uÅ¿e Å¿ome of <hi>I.

And whether they have not done moÅ¿t Å¿acrilegiouÅ¿ly, unjuÅ¿tly and wickedly in thus robbing the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> of Å¿o many thouÅ¿and Members?</p>
               <p>For firÅ¿t they Å¿ubduct and cut off all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t and ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples, and all thoÅ¿e devout men, and true worÅ¿hippers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> Å¿pake of in the Å¿econd chapter, and take no notice of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas it is related in the Å¿econd chapter, verÅ¿e 47. that beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e three thouÅ¿and Å¿oules that were converted by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>that the Lord added daily unto the Church Å¿uch as Å¿hould be Å¿aved,</hi> they Å¿ubduct and cut off thoÅ¿e likewiÅ¿e, and make no mention of them. And whereas in the fourth chapter the number of thoÅ¿e that were converted by the Å¿econd miracle, and Å¿ermon, is related to be about five thouÅ¿and men, they cut off three thouÅ¿and of theÅ¿e alÅ¿o; and whereas in the fifth chapter it is Å¿aid, that <hi>Beleevers were more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,</hi> that is to Å¿ay many more great AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations then were before, all thoÅ¿e in like manner they Å¿ubduct and pare off: and whereas in the Å¿ixth chapter it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48122:255"/>
                  <hi>that the word of God increaÅ¿ed, and the number of the diÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples multiplyed in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>greatly, and a great company of the PrieÅ¿ts were obedient to the faith,</hi> all thoÅ¿e likewiÅ¿e they defalcate with all the other increaÅ¿es of multitudes the Scripture Å¿peaks of, with the many ten thouÅ¿ands recorded in the 21. chapter, neither doe they make any mention of them, or take any notice of them, but caÅ¿ting up the whole Å¿umme, they bring in the totall recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and number of all the Beleevers in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> at firÅ¿t and laÅ¿t to be but five thouÅ¿and in all; and all this they have done out of their perverÅ¿e wilfull and obÅ¿tinate wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>to the end they may deceive the ignorant and Å¿imple people,</hi> (which is a moÅ¿t horrid Å¿inne and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e in them thus to juggle) who they could not delude, if they were indeed truly informed, and did not they and their complices <hi>with-hold the truth from them in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e;</hi> for were the people truly informed, <hi>that in the Church of</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>there were many ten thouÅ¿ands; al intelligible, yea, but ordinary underÅ¿tanding men and women, yea very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would conclude, That they could not then all poÅ¿Å¿ibly meet in one congregation or a few to partake in all acts of worÅ¿hip, and therefore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t be diÅ¿tributed into divers congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, all which notwithÅ¿tanding made Å¿till but one Church,</hi> and therefore they would gather that they muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be combined under one Presbyterie, and be dependent upon it. This I affirme every rationall creature would from grounded reaÅ¿on be able to gather, if they were rightly inÅ¿tructed; whether therefore it be not the higheÅ¿t point of diÅ¿honeÅ¿ty, both in my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> and all thoÅ¿e Teachers of the congregationall way, thus to abuÅ¿e the people, and whether this be not in them all <hi>to with-hold the truth in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> I leave it to the judgement of all the truly godly, and Å¿uch as make conÅ¿cience of their wayes and dealings.</p>
               <p>And now I come to what <hi>I. S.</hi> that Groll hath to Å¿ay to my Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond PropoÅ¿ition; for hee muÅ¿t be anÅ¿wered alÅ¿o, or elÅ¿e he will exceedingly triumph.

FirÅ¿t (Å¿aith he) <hi>you Å¿ay the brethren themÅ¿elves acknowledge, that all the Beleevers in</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem <hi>were all Members of that Church. If you meane that Church spake of</hi> Acts <hi>the</hi> 15. 4. <hi>J deny, and Å¿ay it is a groÅ¿Å¿e pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umption, and begging of the queÅ¿tion, to Å¿ay that wee acknowledge all the Beleevers in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>to be Members of that one mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tring Church, eÅ¿pecially if you reckon all</hi> Iohns <hi>DiÅ¿ciples and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to thoÅ¿e Beleevers: for as there was a good Å¿pace of time after there were multitudes of Beleevers, ere there was Å¿uch a Church; Å¿o for any thing hath yet beene brought to the contrary, it is probable<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> enough, that the true Beleevers, which were not Å¿o many, after you have cut off</hi> Iohns <hi>converts, I meane thoÅ¿e that did Å¿ticke in</hi> Iohns <hi>BaptiÅ¿me, which were multitudes and temporary Beleevers, which ceaÅ¿ed to walke with ChriÅ¿t, which were not a few and Å¿trangers, which did afterwards diÅ¿perÅ¿e themÅ¿elves into Å¿everall countries, thoÅ¿e that did remaine at</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>did gradually gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It may not be denied that the word Church, is often Å¿o uÅ¿ed in the New TeÅ¿tament, and it is Å¿uÅ¿picious that the three thouÅ¿and converted at once, were not Å¿o Å¿oone inÅ¿tructed in church fellowÅ¿hip as converted,</hi> &amp;c.

and to be thruÅ¿t out of the Å¿ociety of all orthodox and conÅ¿cientious honeÅ¿t ChriÅ¿tians, and indeed if he were dealt with according to his merits, hee deÅ¿erves to be Å¿pewed out of the Å¿even new chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of whom, before I come to my reply, I will take liberty to Å¿ay yet a little more, and as of him, Å¿o of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys,</hi> that as they are <hi>fratres in malo,</hi> Å¿o they are equally guilty of the Å¿ame Å¿acriledge &amp; unrighteous dealing, foras <hi>I.

               <p>But yet notwithÅ¿tanding <hi>I.

               <p>And it is no wonder that there is at this day Å¿uch a brood of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world; for there has ever been a generation of Å¿uch men in all ages, that will never be Å¿atisfied.

And in the Å¿ame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is related, <hi>that there were devout men true beleevers out of every Nation under Heaven all Inhabitants and Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers there, and that the Lord added dayly to thoÅ¿e, Å¿uch as Å¿hould be Å¿aved;</hi> and theÅ¿e were without doubt great numbers they being indefinitely Å¿et down. And in the fourth chapter we finde a new addition of five thouÅ¿and men more converted; and withall <hi>I</hi> may tell <hi>I. S.</hi> that <hi>it is Å¿uÅ¿picious</hi> (to uÅ¿e his own language) that the three thouÅ¿and firÅ¿t converts were all men likewiÅ¿e, for Å¿o many learned men conceive of thoÅ¿e converts: but for the five thouÅ¿and it is out of doubt: for the holy Word of God Å¿aith in <hi>terminis</hi> that they were <hi>all men:</hi> And by the law of charity we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that all thoÅ¿e converts were as zealous for the publiÅ¿hing and Å¿preading abroad of the truth of this their ChriÅ¿tian Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as any other people ever were; and therefore that they did make known the wonderfull things of God and what he had done for them to all their acquaintance and neighbours, eÅ¿pecially we are obliged to beleeve that they did teach and inÅ¿truct their wives, children and Å¿ervants and their whole families in the nurtrature and fear of the Lord, and in the knowledge of the GoÅ¿pell. And it is alÅ¿o to be believed that the women and all Å¿orts of people were then as docible and intelligible, and as ready to give attendance unto wholeÅ¿ome and Å¿ound words and to imbrace any truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pell, as our giddy-headed people and women are now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to imbrace and follow novelties: eÅ¿pecially we may with all
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48122:259"/>
reaÅ¿on be induced to beleeve this that they would then be the Å¿oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perÅ¿waded to receive the doctrine of the GoÅ¿pell, in regard it came ratified and confirmed unto them with Å¿uch mighty Å¿ignes and wonders; for the Iewes had often before deÅ¿ired Å¿igns and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Å¿aying unto ChriÅ¿t, <hi>What Å¿igne Å¿he west thou that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in thee?</hi> intimating that if he could Å¿hew unto them any Å¿ign that then they would beleeve in him, and Å¿o they Å¿aid unto him when he was upon the croÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>If thou wouldeÅ¿t have us beleeve in thee</hi> (Å¿aid they) <hi>come down from the croÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿ave thy Å¿elfe,</hi> and then thou Å¿halt perÅ¿wade us that thou art indeed the Å¿onne of God.</p>
               <p>Now then when the Lord by his ApoÅ¿tles and DiÅ¿ciples did day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratifie them with Å¿uch Å¿ignes and wonders as that the very high PrieÅ¿ts and Rulers themÅ¿elves were forced to confeÅ¿Å¿e upon the cure of the criple, that no body could deny but it was a wonderfull miracle; I Å¿ay therefore, when the preaching of the GoÅ¿pell was concomitated upon all occaÅ¿ions with Å¿uch mighty wonders, it cannot be doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now then if we beleeve, which we ought in charity to do, that there were but as many belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving women converted as men (as we may for ought any thing can be Å¿aid to the contrary) then we have already Å¿ixteen thouÅ¿and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> according to the new Å¿tile of the Church. Neither did the Church Å¿tand then at a Å¿tay: For in the fifth chapter upon the dreadfull death of <hi>Ananias and Saphira</hi> and by reaÅ¿on of Å¿ome other miracles, <hi>Beleevers,</hi> Å¿aith the text, <hi>were more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.</hi>

Church, beÅ¿ides all thoÅ¿e before Å¿pecified; and in the 6. chapter v. 7. it is recorded, <hi>that the word of God increaÅ¿ed, and the number of the DiÅ¿ciples multiplyed in IeruÅ¿alem greatly, and a great company of the PrieÅ¿ts were obedient to the faith.</hi> In the which words there is theÅ¿e four things obÅ¿ervable.</p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t, <hi>that the word of God increaÅ¿ed,</hi> that is brought forth many children which were begotten to the Faith by the preaching of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in expreÅ¿Å¿e words it is Å¿aid, <hi>that the number of the DiÅ¿ciples multiplyed in IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> the place it Å¿elfe <hi>where</hi> being Å¿pecified, that is to Å¿ay they were increaÅ¿ed and that in no Å¿mall companies in that very Church and City of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is Å¿aid, <hi>that they multiplyed greatly,</hi> both the words having a great emphaÅ¿is in them, <hi>the number of DiÅ¿ciples multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Å¿aith the Scripture, <hi>and that greatly,</hi> to Å¿hew the miraculous and wonderful<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> increaÅ¿e of them, as if the Scripture Å¿hould have Å¿aid that the number could not be Å¿et down.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is Å¿aid alÅ¿o for the Å¿etting forth of the efficacy of the GoÅ¿pell, <hi>that a great company of the PrieÅ¿ts were obedient to the faith,</hi> not a few but a great company alÅ¿o of the PrieÅ¿ts, thoÅ¿e inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t; every one of theÅ¿e words hath weight in it, and being but a little pondered, will create belief from any ordinary underÅ¿tanding man that there were by this means and after their converÅ¿ion infinites of people dayly added unto the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> not onely by the powerfull preaching and miracles of the ApoÅ¿tles, but by the helpe and preaching of theÅ¿e PrieÅ¿ts alÅ¿o, of whom we ought to harbour this opinion, that now they were as diligent (conÅ¿idering the great love of ChriÅ¿t towards themÅ¿elves) to convert and bring men unto him, as ever they were before to diÅ¿Å¿wade the people from following him; this I conceive the law of charity binds all men to beleeve, that they being now converted would Å¿tudy to convert others. For we Å¿ee that as Å¿oon as <hi>Andrew</hi> had found <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> John 1. he brought his brother <hi>Simon</hi> to him. And after ChriÅ¿t had called <hi>Philip</hi> unto him, he finding <hi>Nathaniel</hi> bringeth him alÅ¿o unto ChriÅ¿t. And if we obÅ¿erve it, it is the nature of true grace that it is ever operative and fruitfull and will looÅ¿e no opportunity of doing good and gaining friends unto it: So that all thoÅ¿e that are really and truly converted, they will ever Å¿tudy and indeavour to convert others, yea they are bound

unto it, according to that of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>who when he related unto</hi> Peter <hi>that the devill Å¿oughts to winnow him as wheat, and told him farther that he had prayed for him that his faith might not faile,</hi> added with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all this leÅ¿Å¿on unto <hi>Simon Peter</hi> Å¿aying, <hi>When thou art converted, Å¿trengthen thy brethren.</hi> This duty lay not only upon <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> but it lies to this day upon all MiniÅ¿ters and people; and all thoÅ¿e PrieÅ¿ts knew very well that this duty lay alÅ¿o upon them, and that by a Å¿peciall command from God long before given them, who had Å¿aid <hi>that the PrieÅ¿ts lips Å¿hould preÅ¿erve knowledge,</hi> and that the people Å¿hould Å¿eek the law, will and good pleaÅ¿ure of God from their mouth.</p>
               <p>Now then if all ChriÅ¿tians and all the Servants of the Lord in all ages Å¿tudied to teach their friends and families <hi>the knowledge and fear of the Lord,</hi> as we Å¿ee in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>JoÅ¿hua</hi> and all the Patriarks, and they had a Å¿peciall command alÅ¿o to do it as we Å¿ee <hi>Deut.</hi> the Å¿ixt and <hi>Deut.</hi> the eleventh, and when it was the practiÅ¿e of all people truly converted to do the Å¿ame, as I Å¿aid before, and we Å¿ee it likewiÅ¿e in the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> how quickly Å¿he brought her neighbours and fellow citizens unto ChriÅ¿t after Å¿hee was converted; then I Å¿ay we ought to think, yea we ought much more to beleeve <hi>that theÅ¿e PrieÅ¿ts being thus wonderfully converted spent their Å¿trength and might now to gain DiÅ¿ciples unto ChriÅ¿t and that by how much the more they had been his enemies and perÅ¿ecutors.</hi> And the people without all controverÅ¿ie would be the readier by far to give heed unto what they taught them <hi>becauÅ¿e they knew that they were learned and in that they had a command from God himÅ¿elf, to Å¿eek the law of God from their mouths,</hi> who Å¿aid, <hi>that the PrieÅ¿ts lips Å¿hould preÅ¿erve knowledge and wiÅ¿dome.</hi> Yea ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe Å¿ent the lepers at any time when he had cured them to the PreiÅ¿ts, and the Scriptures Å¿ufficiently declare, <hi>that the PrieÅ¿ts were in great eÅ¿teem among all the people and that they did mightily prevaile with them, Å¿o that they could perÅ¿wade them to do any thing they would have them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the people Å¿aw that their PrieÅ¿ts in great companies were converted, without doubt they Å¿till followed their PaÅ¿tors and waited upon their MiniÅ¿try; and the law of love binds us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>that abundance of the people alÅ¿o were dayly converted and added to the Church by their MiniÅ¿try and Preaching,</hi> and this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reaÅ¿on and dayly experience will perÅ¿wade every man to

                  <hi>the beleevers in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>when there were but three thouÅ¿and of them, and five thouÅ¿and at moÅ¿t were conÅ¿trained to Å¿ever themÅ¿elves into divers companies in Å¿everall private hou es to communicate.

               <p>But if Sir <hi>I.

               <p>Having for the gratifying Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and Sir <hi>I.

                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:48122:264"/>
My third PropoÅ¿ition is this, <hi>viz. That the ApoÅ¿tles and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Governed, Ordered, and Ruled this Church, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, by a common Councell and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi> This is my third PropoÅ¿ition, which is evident out of many places of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and Å¿undry other places of holy Writ, Å¿ome of which with my Arguments, I Å¿hall here relate in order as they were firÅ¿t Å¿et down in my book called <hi>Independency not Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> the which Mr <hi>Knollys, I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to AnÅ¿wer unto. And after I have faithfully related the Arguments I deduced from thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Scriptures, by which I then made good my third AÅ¿Å¿ertion, I Å¿hall alÅ¿o truely Å¿et down the AnÅ¿wer of <hi>HanÅ¿erdo Knollys,</hi> and <hi>I.

               <p>
                  <hi>The places therefore of Scripture, with my Arguments gathered from thence, are theÅ¿e following,</hi> Acts <hi>11. 27.</hi> And in thoÅ¿e dayes there came Prophets from IeruÅ¿alem to Antioch, and there Å¿tood up one of them named Agabus, and Å¿ignified by the Spirit, that there Å¿hould be great dearth through all the world, which came to paÅ¿Å¿e in the dayes of Claudius CaeÅ¿ar; then the DiÅ¿ciples every man according to his ability, determined to Å¿end reliefe unto the brethren that dwelt in Iudaea, which alÅ¿o they did and Å¿ent it to the Presbyters by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. <hi>Here in theÅ¿e laÅ¿t words we Å¿ee that the Presbyters, and none but the Presbyters received the Almes; for it is Å¿aid,</hi> They Å¿ent it to the Presbyters by the hands of Barnabas and Saul, <hi>which Å¿ufficiently proveth,</hi> That the Presbyters in all Churches were the men in government, as who had the Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and authority of appointing unto the Deacons, how they Å¿hould diÅ¿tribute thoÅ¿e monyes, that they might be beÅ¿t improved and diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed of, which is an act of government, as all men (that know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto government) will acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Now Å¿hould it be granted that theÅ¿e Presbyters here Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>were the Presbyters of Iudaea,</hi> which notwithÅ¿tanding is not Å¿pecified, <hi>but onely the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed brethren in Iudaea;</hi> yet had it been in expreÅ¿Å¿e words Å¿et down, <hi>That the Almes had been Å¿ent to the Presbytery of Judaea, the Presbytery of IeruÅ¿alem muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily have been included in it, as being the Metropolis of Iudea;</hi> and it was an ordinary thing for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that were abroad, and particularly that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to Å¿end to the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> as we may

Å¿ee <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And by all probability <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> brought theÅ¿e Almes to the Presbyters of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem;</hi> for he in the fifteenth chapter of his EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> maketh mention of <hi>a contribution that was made in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia <hi>for the poor Saints in</hi> JeruÅ¿alem; <hi>Whether the ApoÅ¿tle,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>was going to MiniÅ¿ter unto them, and deÅ¿ired the</hi> Romans <hi>to pray for him, that he may be delivered from the unbeleeving</hi> Jews, <hi>and that his Å¿ervice for</hi> JeruÅ¿alem <hi>might be accepted of the Saints,</hi> which by the learned Interpreters is generally taken that <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaketh of this time, and that they were then Å¿ent to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi> But howÅ¿oever, it Å¿hould be underÅ¿tood, that theÅ¿e almes were Å¿ent to the Presbyters in <hi>Iudea,</hi> yet theÅ¿e two concluÅ¿ions neceÅ¿Å¿arily reÅ¿ult from it.</p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t, that this expreÅ¿Å¿ion comprehends alÅ¿o the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> as being the chiefe City of <hi>Iudea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Å¿econd, that the Presbyters in all Churches were the men to whom the government and ordering of buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in whoÅ¿e hands the power and authority lay of diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of the very charity and bounty of the brethren to all the neceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated DiÅ¿ciples within their juriÅ¿dictions, and who gave directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Deacons how they Å¿hould be diÅ¿tributed to the beÅ¿t emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument and benefit of the poor, and according to the intention of theÅ¿e benefactors, which, as it is an act of Government, and that a principall one, Å¿o of neceÅ¿Å¿ity the Presbyters muÅ¿t then meet together, that by their joynt and common conÅ¿ent and councell, all things may be rightly ordered.</p>

               <p>Out of all which places, before I forme my arguments to prove <hi>That the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, was governed by a PreÅ¿bytery,</hi> that is, <hi>by the joynt conÅ¿ent and common Councel of the ApoÅ¿tles and PreÅ¿byters, which made but a grand PreÅ¿bytery: I</hi> Å¿hall deÅ¿ire all men to conÅ¿ider, that howÅ¿oever the ApoÅ¿tles in the places above Å¿pecified, are differenced by that title from the Presbyters, yet in all acts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment performed by them in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> they were for the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of them ordinary acts, Å¿uch as Presbyters dayly performe, and therefore anÅ¿werably the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves are in them to be conÅ¿idered as Presbyters, that is, men governing in an ordinary way, as Å¿uch as had received the keyes, which is the power of juriÅ¿diction, and therefore were in their ordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (though at other times in their Å¿everall miniÅ¿tries, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Nation to Nation to preach, as ChriÅ¿ts extraordinary AmbaÅ¿Å¿adours; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. they uÅ¿ed Å¿uperlative authority, which God had inveÅ¿ted them with and graciouÅ¿ly beÅ¿towed upon them for the benefit of the Church and the good of his people) and I am induced Å¿o to beleeve, becauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles in holy Scripture are called Presbyters, that is, the ordinary Governours and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trates of the Church, though the more principall and primary ones, and therefore did act as Presbyters in ordinary acts of Church Government, and for a pattern to all Churches in like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration: Neither may any Å¿uppoÅ¿e, for all this, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles did fall lower in their power, in that they acted as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for our brethren do acknowledge, <hi>that at IeruÅ¿alem the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles acted as PreÅ¿byters of a particular Congregation;</hi> Now then if they did not fall lower in their power by acting as Presbyters in a particular Congregation, what reaÅ¿on will dictate to any man, <hi>that they Å¿hould fall lower in their power by acting as Presbyters in a joynt Presbytery?</hi> The truth is, to govern and to rule the Church was the ordinary imployment of the ApoÅ¿tles, and therefore they

are Å¿tiled Presbyters, which is to Å¿ay, the Rulers, Councellours, MagiÅ¿trates, and Governours of the Church; neither, for all this, did their PresbyterÅ¿hips exclude their ApoÅ¿tleÅ¿hips, nor did their acting as Presbyters, deprive them of their ApoÅ¿tolique power, nor of that ApoÅ¿tolique Å¿pirit which guided them, even in theÅ¿e things wherein they acted as Presbyters; for although under one notion we looke upon the ApoÅ¿tles as extraordinary men, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another, as in all thoÅ¿e affaires of publique concernment, and in matter of government, and for that end the aÅ¿Å¿embling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves together, we do not conÅ¿ider them as ApoÅ¿tles, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did not act as ApoÅ¿tles, with a tranÅ¿cendent and infallible authority, and in an extraordinary way, but as Presbyters, and ordinary Governours and Councellours, and in Å¿uch a way <hi>as makes their meetings and actions a patterne and preÅ¿ident to Å¿ucceeding ages, and of the Presbyters congregating of themÅ¿elves together for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acts of Government, whether in a Presbyterian or Synodicall way.</hi>

               <p>We read that <hi>HuÅ¿hy</hi> when he was by <hi>AbÅ¿alon</hi> called into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell, had his voice and gave his vote as well as <hi>Achitophel</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of that time; and as in the Common-Councels and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Kingdomes, whatÅ¿oever honour, dignity, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary imployments any of them were taken up in before their Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion and meeting, or whatÅ¿oever dignity or titles of honour they have extraordinarily above others, and take their places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly before they come together into the Parliament, yet they all Å¿itting as Judges and Peeres in the Kingdome, <hi>the meaneÅ¿t Lord in the Kingdome hath as much authority there as the greateÅ¿t,</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:48122:266"/>
and Å¿o in the HouÅ¿e of Commons: as they are Judges, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en by the people for that purpoÅ¿e, have all of them, <hi>even the meaneÅ¿t, as much voice and authority in way of conÅ¿ultation as the greateÅ¿t:</hi> And Å¿o likewiÅ¿e in the Synod or AÅ¿Å¿embly now of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, the meaneÅ¿t Presbyter hath as much voice and liberty in way of debate and voting, as the greateÅ¿t Prelate there.</p>
               <p>And even Å¿o it was in the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> when the ApoÅ¿tles thoÅ¿e extraordinary gifted men, and the Ordinary Presbyters met together in counÅ¿el, they all acted there as counÅ¿ellors and ordinary presbyters; and therefore in all thoÅ¿e particular actions of the ApoÅ¿tles, wee have mention of in their Å¿everall meetings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee conÅ¿ider them by themÅ¿elves alone, and not joyned with the Presbyters, or in common councell with them, thoÅ¿e actions, I Å¿ay, were done and acted by men which were ApoÅ¿tles, but not as they were ApoÅ¿tles excluÅ¿ively, Å¿o as they might not act them under another notion, neither will our brethren affirme it; for if the ApoÅ¿tles did preach, take the truÅ¿t of the goods of the Church, ordaine Officers, as ApoÅ¿tles excluÅ¿ively and in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, and as by a priviledge peculiar to themÅ¿elves, it would follow from thence, <hi>that none may doe any of thoÅ¿e things but ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> which the Brethren will not aÅ¿Å¿ent unto: as for Å¿ome inÅ¿tances.</p>
               <p>In that ordination of Deacons in the Å¿ixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles there acted partly as ApoÅ¿tles, and partly as Presbyters; for in conÅ¿tituting an Office in the Church, which was not before they acted their ApoÅ¿tolicall authority: but in ordaining men to that office which the Church had choÅ¿en, they did act as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and there is no doubt but the Brethren will yeeld to this; for if they will not grant <hi>that the ApoÅ¿tles did herein act partly as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles, &amp; partly as Presbyters, they muÅ¿t then accord, that they acted either onely as Presbyters, or onely as ApoÅ¿tles:</hi> If onely as PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, thence it will follow, <hi>that all Presbyters have power, not onely to ordaine men, but to erect a new office in the Church:</hi> If onely as ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>then hence is no warrant for Presbyters, Å¿o much as to ordaine men into any office, nor for Å¿o much as to meet together to conÅ¿ult about acts of government, either in a Presbyterian or in a Synodicall way:</hi> and by this meanes all Church government would Å¿peedily be overthrowne.</p>
               <p>Neither is it a difficult thing in our Brethren, or any other man

to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h betweene theÅ¿e two: for looke by what infallible rule they make Å¿ome thing in the practiÅ¿e of the ApoÅ¿tles, to bee not onely a patterne and preÅ¿ident for imitation, but even a proofe of inÅ¿titution, yet decline other things practiÅ¿ed by the Å¿ame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles as things not onely by inÅ¿titution, not commanded to us, but not permitted to bee imitated by us: By the Å¿ame rule, they may infallibly diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h betweene what they acted as ApoÅ¿tles, and what they acted as Presbyters, and as ordinary CounÅ¿ellors, Iudges and Governours; and withall they may infer and conclude, <hi>that what they acted as Presbyters, and by joynt and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, it was to give a patterne and preÅ¿ident to all Presbyters and Synods in all Å¿ucceeding ages;</hi> and as the taking in of the conÅ¿ent of the Church in the choice of Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. was to give a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for the Å¿ufferage and voice of the people in all Churches to the end of the world, in choÅ¿ing of their Deacons; Å¿o for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inÅ¿tance, <hi>as there were many Congregations in the Church of</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>and divers, AÅ¿Å¿emblies, and all theÅ¿e congregations made but one Church, and the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters who were Officers governed that joyntly and by a common Councell, (as our Brethren acknowledge:) Here likewiÅ¿e they left a patterne and preÅ¿ident to all ages, for Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies in a Citie, or vicinity, to unite into one Church; and for the Officers and Presbyters of theÅ¿e Congregations to governe that Church joyntly in a Colledge and Presbytery,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for a third inÅ¿tance, as the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters meet together in a Synodicall way, and the ApoÅ¿tles in that AÅ¿Å¿embly acted not by an ApoÅ¿tolicall and infallible Å¿pirit, no more then the Presbyters did, (as when they were writing of Scripture) but Å¿tating the QueÅ¿tion, and debating it from Scripture in an ordinary way, as it is at large diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. (which wee never reade they did when they writ the Scripture,) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by diÅ¿puting, arguing and Å¿earching the Scripture, found what was <hi>the good and acceptable will of God;</hi> thereupon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the queÅ¿tion, Å¿aying, <hi>it Å¿eemed good to the Holy GhoÅ¿t and us,</hi> as the AÅ¿Å¿embly now of Divines, or any other, for ought I know, upon like aÅ¿Å¿urance of Scripture warrant, may doe. In this action alÅ¿o, and their Å¿o doing, the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters left an example and preÅ¿ident to all the Presbyters in all Å¿ucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages, what they Å¿hould doe upon the like occaÅ¿ions, for the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48122:267"/>
deciding of controverÅ¿ies and differences of opinions in Religion. viz. <hi>To congregate and meet together in Å¿ome one place, to Å¿tate the queÅ¿tions, and to debate from Scripture, and to follow the written Word, as their rule in all things; and whatÅ¿oever they doe, to doe it by joynt conÅ¿ent, and the the Common-councell of them all, or by the moÅ¿t voices;</hi> but in all theÅ¿e their proceedings they muÅ¿t ever cleave to the rule of the Word of God, or warrantable authority and evidence of reaÅ¿on deduced from thence, as then the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters did; yea, the very name of the Presbyters in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem,</hi> Å¿ignifieth the Iudges, CounÅ¿ellors, MagiÅ¿trates and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of that Church, who had the Keyes committed unto them as well as the ApoÅ¿tles: <hi>and by their place were more peculiarly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eers of that Church, as they were tyed unto it, then the ApoÅ¿tles;</hi> as the Presbyters of <hi>EpheÅ¿us</hi> were in that Church, and were aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned in their Å¿everall places to execute their office, and to looke to their particular charges in the government; Å¿o that whether the ApoÅ¿tles were preÅ¿ent or abÅ¿ent, the Presbyters had the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment laid upon their Å¿houlders; <hi>and if the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves had taught contrary to this ConÅ¿titution, or an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Gal.</hi> 1. I am confident the Presbyters would not have obeyed them, nor have relinquiÅ¿hed their authority, neither ought they, but would Å¿till have kept that rule, power and authority which God had put in their hands: Å¿o that for my owne particular, I looke upon the ApoÅ¿tles in all theÅ¿e Å¿everall actions, and in all thoÅ¿e acts of government, joyned and met together with the Presbyters, as I looke upon CounÅ¿ellors and Iudges in the great Councell of both Kingdoms, where all the Iudges have equall power and authority in deciÅ¿ive voting, and doe verily beleeve, that the Presbyters Å¿itting at any time in councel with any one or more of the ApoÅ¿tles, did act as authoritatively as the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves, and I am ever able to prove it and make it good againÅ¿t any man, that the Presbyters might as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>It Å¿eemed good to the Holy GhoÅ¿t and to us,</hi> as well as the ApoÅ¿tles: and may Å¿ay, <hi>we have written and concluded,</hi> as well as the ApoÅ¿tles: As any two or three of the Parliament, whether of the Lords or Commons, may as well Å¿ay, wee have made Å¿uch an Ordinance, as any twenty of them, or the whole Councell, and that without diÅ¿paragement or impeaching the dignity of any, when they joyned with them in that worke, and aÅ¿Å¿ented to it;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48122:267"/>
and in this very notion I looke upon the Presbyters in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> joyned with the ApoÅ¿tles, and conÅ¿ider them, as in my contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations I looke upon the Lords and Commons now Å¿itting in the great Councell, as the grand civill Presbytery of the Kingdome, where all binding Ordinances are to bee paÅ¿Å¿ed by the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent and Common-counÅ¿ell of them all, and whoÅ¿e place and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to command and rule, and the peoples office and place to obey and yeeld Å¿ubjection to whatÅ¿oever they command and injoyne, <hi>according to the will of God and for the common good and preÅ¿ervation of themÅ¿elves and the whole Kingdome;</hi> and that whoÅ¿oever Å¿hould reÅ¿iÅ¿t this their juÅ¿t authority, are guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy and are high offenders and delinquents; <hi>for God hath laid the government upon them, and left the duty of obedience to the Å¿ubjects who may not without a publicke call intermeddle with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of government.</hi>

               <p>And Å¿o in the matters of Church-government, I look upon the Presbyters as Gods <hi>peculiar Å¿ervants,</hi> and as upon the <hi>Stewards, Councellours</hi> and <hi>MagiÅ¿trates</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> in the Church, <hi>as men Å¿et apart by God himÅ¿elfe for this purpoÅ¿e to be the Teachers and Rulers of their flockes committed unto them in the Lord;</hi> to whom in the matters of their Å¿oules all people under their Å¿everall PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, <hi>Å¿o farre as they command in the Lord, and according to the written word, are to yeeld obedience, and much to reverence and honour them, and this according to Gods command, for it is his Ordinance.</hi> And they are not to be looked on and Å¿lighted as the fagge end of the Clergy, as many black mouthes and prophane lips Å¿peake of them: for the Presbyters, they have their authority as well grounded in the word of God, as Kings and States have theirs; and therefore as they are imployed in a more Å¿upreame orbe, and in matters of eternall concernment, Å¿o they Å¿hould bee venerated as men watching over our Å¿oules; and all contumelious Å¿peeches againÅ¿t them deÅ¿erve Å¿evere puniÅ¿hment and ought not to be tolerated: and Å¿o much the more the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of this Kingdome in theÅ¿e our dayes, have deÅ¿erved better from the Church, the Parliament and the whole<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Kingdome, then any of their PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors, not onely in their <hi>deÅ¿iring a perfect and through Reformation in both Doctrine and DiÅ¿cipline, but in that they have Å¿tood now Å¿o cordially to the common cauÅ¿e, and more for the liberty of the Subject then any before them, and have</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> of this SyllogiÅ¿me being proved, the concluÅ¿ion will neceÅ¿Å¿arily inÅ¿ue. And for proofe of the <hi>Major</hi> the Scripture is cleare, as 1 <hi>Tim. chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. where <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto <hi>Timothy</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee to preach, with the laying on of the hands of the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery:</hi> in the which Presbytery <hi>Paul</hi> was one that laid his hands on him, and ordained him, as is evident in the Å¿econd EpiÅ¿tle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, ch.</hi> the firÅ¿t, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 6, where putting <hi>Timothy</hi> in mind of his duty, hee Å¿aith, <hi>Å¿tirre up the gift of God which is in thee, by the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of my hands:</hi> Å¿o that <hi>Paul</hi> joyning in this publicke action of ordination, though an ApoÅ¿tle, yet acted as a Presbyter, and counts himÅ¿elfe in the number of them, as any of the Presbyters
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48122:268"/>
that now ordaine the MiniÅ¿ters, may Å¿ay as well as all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to any new ordained MiniÅ¿ter, <hi>neglect not the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.</hi> As men ordinarily in a Iury, may aÅ¿Å¿ume that unto themÅ¿elves that all may doe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Actors in common.

The Presbyter unto the well beloved</hi> Gajus, &amp;c. So that his PresbyterÅ¿hip did not exclude his ApoÅ¿tleÅ¿hip, nor the acting at any time of a Presbyter, deprive him of his ApoÅ¿tolicall power; for at that very time hee cals himÅ¿elfe a Presbyter, hee wrore Scripture by an ApoÅ¿tolicall and infallible Å¿pirit, and yet continued Å¿till a presbyter.

               <p>For anÅ¿wer, firÅ¿t I Å¿ay, that the Brethren, in my opinion, take more upon them then beÅ¿eemeth them, and uÅ¿urpe a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited authority to themÅ¿elves, that they can make what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth them exemplary only, and reject whatÅ¿oever agreeth not with their opinion and humour, though they were all the acts of all the ApoÅ¿tles, and tranÅ¿acted by joynt conÅ¿ent, and common agreement and accord, and left in the church of ChriÅ¿t, as well for a patterne and preÅ¿ident for the Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters to follow in al Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages to the end of the world, as any of their other acts; and Å¿o they pick and chooÅ¿e at pleaÅ¿ure, and in Å¿o doing (under refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be it Å¿poke) I Å¿ay they aÅ¿Å¿ume unto themÅ¿elves a greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then beÅ¿eems them; for they can make the ApoÅ¿tles joynt

               <p>But for a further anÅ¿wer I aÅ¿Å¿ert, <hi>that the ApoÅ¿tles power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over many aÅ¿Å¿emblies, as one Church, to rule and governe them all as one Church, joyntly and in common, was not grownded upon their power over all Churches, but upon the union of thoÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Congregations into one Church, which union layeth a foundation for the power of preÅ¿byters ruling and governing many Congregations;</hi> and the ApoÅ¿tles practice in governing many AÅ¿Å¿emblies joyntly as one Church, is the patterne and example of that government to all Å¿ucceeding ages; and this preÅ¿ident of the ApoÅ¿tles, the presbyters in all churches ought to Å¿et before their eyes in all reformation; for what the ApoÅ¿tles did in the publicke affaires of government, <hi>they did as preÅ¿byters, and for imitation.</hi> Neither doe our Brethren onely grant the act of miniÅ¿teriall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be the Å¿ame in the ApoÅ¿tles and presbyters, Å¿aving in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but they acknowledge alÅ¿o, <hi>that they were called preÅ¿byters vertually</hi> as I Å¿aid before; and that the ApoÅ¿tles acted in a joynt body and by common conÅ¿ent, and affirme <hi>that it was fit that they Å¿hould Å¿o doe,</hi> and Å¿ay withall, <hi>that the ApoÅ¿tles wherever they came, left the preÅ¿byters and people to the exerciÅ¿e of that right which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, although they joyned with them:</hi> TheÅ¿e are their formall expreÅ¿Å¿ions, out of which their conceÅ¿Å¿ion my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, the whole SyllogiÅ¿me, is not onely confirmed and Å¿trengthened, but the truth doth more evidently Å¿hine forth; for if the ApoÅ¿tles left the presbyters and people to the exerciÅ¿e of that right which belonged unto them, in all churches, and the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters right be to rule as EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall MagiÅ¿trates, as to whom the <hi>power of the Keyes peculiarly belongeth by Gods inÅ¿titution: and the right of the people in all churches, bee to obey, as they are every where commanded;</hi> then it followeth neceÅ¿Å¿arily, that it doth not belong unto the people to ordaine either Deacons or Presbyters, whatÅ¿oever they may doe in the chooÅ¿ing of them:
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48122:269"/>
                  <hi>nor to excommunicate or cast out any out of the Church, or to make Members whom they pleaÅ¿e, nor to rule and governe the Church,</hi> which is the peculiar right of the Presbyters, left unto them by ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles; for none of all theÅ¿e things were ever left unto the people, neither is there any PreÅ¿ident of it in holy Scripture; Å¿o that while the brethren Å¿eeme to contend for the liberty of the people, they plainly overthrow it; for they grant, <hi>That the Apostles left the Presbyters and people to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿e of that right that belonged unto them in all Churches;</hi> the right therefore of the keyes of Government and JuriÅ¿diction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth properly unto the Presbyters in every Church, who are the Officers and MagiÅ¿trates appointed by God himÅ¿elfe for that purpoÅ¿e, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. and therefore when the ApoÅ¿tles writ to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to excommunicate that inceÅ¿tuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, although his EpiÅ¿tle be not directed to the whole Church, yet the Presbyters in that Church onely executed that act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which of right belonged unto them, though the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o aÅ¿Å¿ented unto it, even as we Å¿ee dayly, and experience teacheth us in all well ordered Corporations, when the King or CounÅ¿ell writes unto any City or Corporation, though their mandates be directed to the whole City or Corporation, for the raiÅ¿ing either of men or moneyes, or about any other imployment of publike concernment, the Mayors, Aldermen, and Common Councell, and the Officers under them onely manage the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e; for that is their right and place; and the people under them do yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elvesto what they order and command, and intermeddle not in that imployment, as knowing very well it is their right and place onely to obey. And even Å¿o it was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Presbyters onely exerciÅ¿ed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ordered all according to the ApoÅ¿tles injunction, and the people aÅ¿Å¿ented unto it, and Å¿ubmitted themÅ¿elves to their order; and the miÅ¿taking of that place and many more hath<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> been the cauÅ¿e of Å¿o much confuÅ¿ion in the Church at this time, when not onely the men in every AÅ¿Å¿embly, but the very women in many of the new Congregations, as Members, challenge a power and right both in the electing of Church Officers, and of admitting of Members, and of caÅ¿ting out and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which before theÅ¿e our times was never heard of in the world, <hi>when as the right of JuriÅ¿diction and of the Keyes,</hi> (as I
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48122:270"/>
have often proved) <hi>peculiarly belongeth unto the Presbyters; and that the people neither men nor women, ought to intermeddle with it; for if they Å¿hould, in Å¿hort time it would overthrow all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Church and State, and bring confuÅ¿ion into the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I conceive the cauÅ¿e of Å¿o groÅ¿Å¿e a miÅ¿take of that place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the excommunicating of the inceÅ¿tuous perÅ¿on, aroÅ¿e from this, <hi>that they look upon the Church of Corinth and the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Å¿poken of in the New TeÅ¿tament, not as Corporations,</hi> as they were indeed, <hi>but as on their now Å¿ucking Independent new Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of twenty or thirty Members,</hi> Å¿uch as many of thoÅ¿e be, whereas thoÅ¿e Å¿everall Churches are to be conÅ¿idered under another notion, as conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, (as that of the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem)</hi> united into one Church or body in the Å¿everall Corporations, and each of them governed by a Common Councell of Presbyters, and by the joynt conÅ¿ent of their Å¿everall Presbyteries, all theÅ¿e Å¿everall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations making but one Church, though never Å¿o much dayly increaÅ¿ed, and keeping Å¿till the name and denomination of Å¿uch a Church, either from the place, City, Country, or Nation, or Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall language, as the Church of the Jewes, the Greeke Church; the Latine Church: or from the Cities, as the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> of <hi>EpheÅ¿us, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. All the <hi>which</hi> though they conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of never Å¿o many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, yet they ever kept the name of unity, &amp; were accounted but one Church, in their Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places and Precincts, as at this day the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> though it conÅ¿iÅ¿t of many Congregations, is counted but one Church, as it is: Å¿o that I Å¿ay, <hi>the conceiving of the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>and thoÅ¿e Å¿even Churches in</hi> AÅ¿ia, <hi>under the notion of one of their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> cauÅ¿ed through this miÅ¿take, that great confuÅ¿ion that is now in the Church, and was the originall cauÅ¿e of the opinion of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, when notwithÅ¿tanding it is manifeÅ¿t, that thoÅ¿e very churches were not Independent, but made their appeale to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles and Presbyters at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> upon all occaÅ¿ions, as that of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and it is Å¿aid, that <hi>the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conÅ¿ider of that matter;</hi> which meeting of the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters, for Synodicall acts of Government is no weake proofe of their meeting for Presbyteriall acts of Government, unleÅ¿Å¿e men will Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that they who were carefull to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48122:270"/>
did neglect their owne Churches committed to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar charge, and took no courÅ¿e or care for the governing of them.</p>
               <p>Yea <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. it doth moÅ¿t certainly prove a Presbyteriall government in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> out of the which place I thus argue; <hi>Where the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters did governe, and many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations were by them ordered and governed, yet Å¿o, that all theÅ¿e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were one Church, there was a PreÅ¿byteriall Government; but in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem the ApoÅ¿tles and PreÅ¿byters did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, and many Congregations were by them governed, yet Å¿o that all theÅ¿e Congregations were one Church;</hi> Ergo, <hi>in the Church of IeruÅ¿alem there was a Presbyterian Government; all which is Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeÅ¿t out of the places above specified, and from all the former diÅ¿courÅ¿e.</hi> For in the 21. chapter it is aÅ¿Å¿erted, that there were many ten thouÅ¿ands of beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which could not all be contained in a few places, but muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be diÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into many and Å¿everall congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies, all which notwithÅ¿tanding made but one Church, as is evident, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 1. and many other places, the which congregations could not be one politique miniÅ¿teriall Church, except onely becauÅ¿e they were united under one Presbyteriall Government, and therefore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> muÅ¿t be AriÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratically and Presbyterially governed, yea, the very mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Å¿o often of the Preebyters meeting together, proves <hi>that they met together about acts of Government,</hi> from which I thus argue.</p>
               <p>That Scripture which proves a Presbytery in JeruÅ¿alem, or an AÅ¿Å¿ociation of Presbyters in that Church, proves that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church of IeruÅ¿alem did meet together for acts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and did really governe that Church. But, the places above quoted prove a Presbytery in IeruÅ¿alem, or an AÅ¿Å¿ociation of PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in that Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they prove that they did meet together for acts of Government, and did really governe that Church, and that the Church of IeruÅ¿alem, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many Congregations, <hi>was</hi> Presbyterially governed.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Major,</hi> the Brethren cannot deny it; for the very name of Presbytery, Å¿ignifieth a company or common-councell of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, governours, and magiÅ¿trates; now all men know, that gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in common cannot do their duty, but muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48122:271"/>
the work committed to them, <hi>if they do not meet together for acts of Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither can they deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> unleÅ¿Å¿e they will deny the Scripture; for that expreÅ¿ly declareth, that <hi>Iames</hi> and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters met together, and our brethren take their warrant from that place, for their Presbyters meeting apart from the multitude to conÅ¿ult, and to prepare matters: Yea, it is not onely Å¿et downe, that <hi>Iames</hi> and the Presbyters met together, which had it onely been for the entertainment of <hi>Paul,</hi> it is an argument Å¿ufficient to convince any rationall man, that if the Presbyters would meet together for a Å¿alutation, they did much more meet for acts of government: But I Å¿ay it is not onely Å¿pecified, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters met together, but what they did in conÅ¿ultation in that their meeting, and what they acted upon deliberation, and that <hi>was to adviÅ¿e</hi> Paul, <hi>and to direct him what he Å¿hould do,</hi> which councell of theirs was not <hi>lax,</hi> but reÅ¿trictive and binding, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 23. <hi>Do therefore that which we Å¿ay unto thee.</hi> By all which it is evident that they met about acts of Government, when they gave an order and rule to <hi>Paul</hi> himÅ¿elfe, how he Å¿hould behave himÅ¿elfe at that time; and we reade <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>followed their councell, and Å¿ubmitted himÅ¿elfe to their order;</hi> by all which it is moÅ¿t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, <hi>that the Church of IeruÅ¿alem was ordered and governed by the joynt conÅ¿ent and Common Councell of PreÅ¿byters, though conÅ¿isting of many Congregations, and was PreÅ¿byterially go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I further thus argue,</hi> Where there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblies in <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and many Presbyters, and theÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿emblies were all one Church, and theÅ¿e Presbyters all of them Presbyters of that one Church, there of neceÅ¿Å¿ity there were many Congregations under one Presbytery, and that Church was preÅ¿byterially governed; but in the church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> there were many aÅ¿Å¿emblies, and many preÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and thoÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿emblies were all one Church, and thoÅ¿e PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters all of them Presbyters of that one Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> in the church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> there were many congregations under one preÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and that church was preÅ¿byterially governed.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Major,</hi> no man of Å¿ound reaÅ¿on or judgement will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</p>
               <p>And for the firÅ¿t part of the <hi>Minor, that there were many AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in that Church,</hi> it hath Å¿ufficiently been proved in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48122:271"/>
diÅ¿courÅ¿e, and is evident out of the 21. chapter, where it is Å¿aid there were many ten thouÅ¿ands.</p>
               <p>And for the other parts of it, that the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was but one Church, and that all the Presbyters there were PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that one Church, the Brethren themÅ¿elves do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it; and they do alÅ¿o accord and grant that the Church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem</hi> was governed by a Presbytery, and that it was Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianly ruled; but withall they conceive the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> to conÅ¿iÅ¿t of no more beleevers than might all meet together in one place and congregation; Å¿o that the difference between us and the brethren is not whether the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terianly governed or no, for that they do acknowledge, and would have their churches governed after that manner; but this is the debate between us and them, whether there were no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> then could all meet in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which is their opinion; but whether or no it hath not by the foregoing diÅ¿courÅ¿e been Å¿ufficiently proved that there were more congregations and aÅ¿Å¿emblies in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and a greater number of beleevers then could all meet in any one place or congregation, and that all theÅ¿e were under one Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: that I refer to the underÅ¿tanding Reader to judge of. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿poken of the third concluÅ¿ion or propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition.</p>
               <p>

(Å¿aith he)</hi> which the Doctor maketh uÅ¿e of to prove his aÅ¿Å¿ertion, are theÅ¿e, <hi>ver. 30.</hi> and Å¿ent it, <hi>viz.</hi> the reliefe to the Elders by the hands of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> Here in theÅ¿e laÅ¿t words Å¿aith the Doctor, we Å¿ee that the PreÅ¿byters and none but the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters received the Almes, which Å¿ufficiently proveth that the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in all Churches were the men in government. <hi>To the which argument of mine, MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>page 11. replyeth as followeth.</hi> It is not denyed by the brethren <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> that the Presbyters in all churches were the men in the government of the Churches in which they are Elders. But this I conceive (by the Doctors favour) doth not prove it; to wit, becauÅ¿e the almes were Å¿ent unto the Elders. Much leÅ¿Å¿e doth that Scripture prove that the Apostles and PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48122:272"/>
governed and ruled the Church in IeruÅ¿alem by a common Councell and PreÅ¿bytery. But in the <hi>15.</hi> chap. ver. <hi>2. 4. 6. 22.</hi> and and chap. <hi>16. 4.</hi> and chap. <hi>21. 17, 18.</hi> The PreÅ¿byters of IeruÅ¿alem by name (Å¿aith the Doctor) are expreÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e are MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his own words with his reply and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer to my firÅ¿t argument by which I proved my third aÅ¿Å¿ertion, in the which I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire the Reader to conÅ¿ider, what he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and what he granteth. <hi>It is not denyed (Å¿aith he) by the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (meaning the Independents) <hi>that the PreÅ¿byters in all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were the men in the government of the churches in which they are Elders.</hi> Take I pray his own expreÅ¿Å¿ion. He acknowledgeth, <hi>that the government in all churches was committed to the PreÅ¿byters, and that it lay only in their hands as to whom it was Å¿olely delegated,</hi> Å¿o that he granteth as much as I contended for by that argument, by which all judicious and underÅ¿tanding men may now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and the brethren do accord unto this truth; <hi>viz. that the people have nothing to do with the government of the churches in which they are Members;</hi> Å¿o that I have as much aÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto by him and all the brethren as I deÅ¿ire, by the which (if I am not miÅ¿taken) he hath utterly excluded the people in all their Å¿even new churches, and in all their new gathered aÅ¿Å¿emblies of the congregational way, from any hand in the government of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: <hi>For</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>it is not denyed by the brethren that the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in all churches were the men in the government of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in which they are Elders.</hi> So that hereafter I hope the brethren will not be Å¿o inraged againÅ¿t me, if I beleeve as the Å¿even new Churches beleeve and as all the brethren of the congregationall way beleeve thoÅ¿e confiding men: when MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>that it is not denyed by them that the government in all Churches is laid upon the Presbyters Å¿houlders; and therefore not upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> So that now there is little need of farther conteÅ¿ting between us about this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e; Å¿eeing he granteth, <hi>that the PreÅ¿byters in all churches ought to have the government of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e a little to take notice of the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of the mans Å¿pirit who grants the thing, and yet wrangles about words, and that wretchedly and poorly; and therefore I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire the Reader to conÅ¿ider what he denyeth in my argument with the reaÅ¿on of it: <hi>viz.</hi> theÅ¿e two things.

<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48122:272"/>
                  <hi>that that Scripture proveth that the ApoÅ¿tles and PreÅ¿byters governed and ruled the church in IeruÅ¿alem by a common Councell and PreÅ¿bytery:</hi> TheÅ¿e two things MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> affirmes will not inÅ¿ue from that portion of Scripture upon which I grounded my argument.</p>
               <p>Now before I come to reply to both theÅ¿e cavills of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erdo,</hi> I Å¿hall take this liberty to Å¿ay unto him that as he is a meere novice in Divinity and a foreiner to all good learning, Å¿o he is but a Å¿ucking polititian, not knowing either his Primer in that art, or his CatechiÅ¿me in Theology, or any thing in the government either of Church or State, which is one of the grand errors and hereÅ¿ies of all his fraternity, who while they pretend to learning and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wade the world they are excellent StateÅ¿men and Grandees in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they will in time prove themÅ¿elves (as they are indeed) a company of grolls and ninnyes; and I hope yet to Å¿ee that day that they wil be as much exploded &amp; bafled out of their fond whimÅ¿ies, as ever the Prelates were or any diÅ¿tempered Sect in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that all men may the better Å¿ee the truth and diÅ¿cerne MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>his errors and the groundleÅ¿Å¿eneÅ¿Å¿e of his denyall of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, who Å¿aith,</hi> it doth not prove that the preÅ¿byters were the men in government, becauÅ¿e the almes were Å¿ent unto the Elders; and that the Apostles and PreÅ¿byters governed and ruled that church by a common councell and preÅ¿bytery, becauÅ¿e the relief was Å¿ent unto the PreÅ¿byters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Å¿hall now upon this occaÅ¿ion Å¿peak Å¿omething concerning po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, and Å¿hew wherein the Å¿overaign power and authority in all governments conÅ¿iÅ¿ts, and in whoÅ¿e hands it reÅ¿ides; and what are the eÅ¿Å¿entiall properties or rather parts of Government in either of them:</hi> So that whereÅ¿oever they are exerciÅ¿ed in any country or common wealth, thoÅ¿e men only who are inveÅ¿ted with them or to whom they are betruÅ¿ted either immediately by God himÅ¿elf or by the election or choice of the people, the Å¿overaign authority in thoÅ¿e Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall governments lies and is depoÅ¿ited in their hands that mannage them, and in no bodies elÅ¿e but Å¿uch as are allowed of by their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or good liking and love.</p>
               <p>And if men will then Å¿eriouÅ¿ly conÅ¿ider and weigh the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Å¿ecular in all States and Countries, and compare the EccleÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aÅ¿ticall with them; which (without any offence) they may do, the truth will more gloriouÅ¿ly Å¿hine forth, and the Å¿trength and force

               <p>Now if wee will compare things together, wee Å¿hall find, that whatÅ¿oever can prove the Å¿overaigne power in all Å¿ecular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be in thoÅ¿e mens hands which exerciÅ¿e it; the Å¿ame may be Å¿aid concerning the EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall Government in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and of the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters of that Church, who were the chiefe Officers, and men in authority in it, that the government and Å¿overaigne power in that Church lay in their hands onely.

neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow. The Å¿econd truth, that will reÅ¿ult out of the words, is this, <hi>that the ApoÅ¿tles and PreÅ¿byters governed and ruled that Church by a common-councell and PreÅ¿byterie,</hi> both which MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> vainely denyeth, will follow from my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But for the farther elucidation of this truth, and that it may the better appeare unto all men, I will briefly run over the eÅ¿Å¿entiall properties, and parts of Å¿upreme and Å¿overaigne power that were exerciÅ¿ed in that church, and Å¿hew that they reÅ¿ided onely and Å¿ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ApoÅ¿tles and PreÅ¿byters hands, who were the Governours of that church, and that the people had nothing to doe with them; and for the firÅ¿t, to wit, the <hi>legiÅ¿lative power</hi> it was in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and committed onely into the hands of the ApoÅ¿tles and PreÅ¿bytery of that church, as who had received the Keyes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. For Å¿o Å¿aith the Prophet, <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi> chapter the 2. verÅ¿e 2. <hi>out of Zion Å¿hall goe forth the Law; and the Word of the Lord from</hi> JeruÅ¿alem; and <hi>Acts</hi> the 1. verÅ¿. 2. 3. it is Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t, for the time that hee remained upon the earth after his ReÅ¿urrection, <hi>through the Holy GhoÅ¿t gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements unto the ApoÅ¿tles whom hee had choÅ¿en, Å¿peaking to them of the things pertaining to the Kingdome of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them that they Å¿hould not depart from</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>but waite for the promiÅ¿e of the Father, which was that hee would Å¿end them the Holy GhoÅ¿t the comforter which Å¿hould teach them all things, and bring all things unto their remembrance</hi> whatÅ¿oever ChriÅ¿t had Å¿aid unto them, <hi>and that hee Å¿hould abide with them for ever, Iohn</hi> 14. verÅ¿e 26. <hi>and leade them into all truth,</hi> and in the fifteenth Chapter hee cals his ApoÅ¿tles his <hi>friends, telling them that hee had made knowne unto them all things that hee had heard from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, verÅ¿e</hi> 15. and hee promiÅ¿ed, that the Holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿hould bring all thoÅ¿e things to their memories, and in the Å¿ame Chapter in the 26. verÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, <hi>when the comforter is come, whom I will Å¿end unto you from the Father, even the spirit of truth, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Father hee Å¿hall teÅ¿tifie of me.</hi> From all which places, and from the 28. of <hi>Matth.</hi> verÅ¿e 18, 19, 20. <hi>Mark.</hi> the 16. verÅ¿e 15, 16, 17, 18. and <hi>Iohn</hi> the 20. verÅ¿e 21, 22, 23. and many more that might be alleaged, it is apparently evident that the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veÅ¿ted with a legiÅ¿lative power, Å¿o that whatÅ¿oever they preached

or writ that wee find recorded in the Holy Word of God, they are all the Statutes and Lawes of the King of his Church ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, and by the which all ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ubjects to the end of the world are to be regulated and governed. The ApoÅ¿tles and PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> had power alÅ¿o to abrogate old Lawes, and to enact and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h new ones, as wee may Å¿ee <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16. yea, they had power of life and death, of which wee have one example in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Act.</hi> 5. yea, they rayÅ¿ed the dead, cured the lame, and healed the Å¿icke with their very Å¿hadowes, and all this power was given unto them for the ratifying of their authority, and to Å¿hew they were Å¿ent of God; withall they had the power of erecting new offices and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting new Officers, not onely in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> but in all the Churches, as that office of Deacons in the Å¿ixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the office of Elders or Presbyters in the 14. chapter, where it is Å¿aid that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas ordained them PreÅ¿byters in every Church,</hi> and therefore they appointed them firÅ¿t in the Mother-church <hi>JeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, for out of Zion,</hi> (Å¿aith the Prophet) <hi>Å¿hall goe forth the Law and the Word of the Lord from JeruÅ¿alem;</hi> yea, they gave thoÅ¿e Officers their names, and inveÅ¿ted them all with power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Å¿everall Offices, as is manifeÅ¿t, <hi>Acts</hi> the 6. and in the 20. of the Å¿ame booke, and in the EpiÅ¿tles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> They alÅ¿o had the power of making warre and peace with the Nations, and all the Inhabitants of the earth; for they preached and publiÅ¿hed the glad tydings of peace to all Å¿uch as received the GoÅ¿pel, and denounced warre and death with all manner of judgements to thoÅ¿e that obeyed not the GoÅ¿pel of our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, 2 <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 1. verÅ¿e 8. and to the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> likewiÅ¿e, as to their ultimate and extreme refuge, and reliefe and helpe, all appeales were made (as we may Å¿ee in the fifteenth of the Acts, and in the 6. and in the 9. and in the 15. of the Å¿ame booke) as to the Å¿upreme Tribunall upon earth in Gods matters, in whoÅ¿e hands all the higheÅ¿t power and Å¿overaigne authority for EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall matters then reÅ¿ided, and whoÅ¿e place it was not only to hear the controverÅ¿ies and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of greateÅ¿t concernment in ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome his Church, but alÅ¿o to decide and determine them, and put a finall period unto them, the which example of theirs was left as a preÅ¿i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now for the deciding and determining of this controverÅ¿ie, the ChriÅ¿tians of <hi>Antioch</hi> appeale to the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> as knowing that all power was given unto them both <hi>Dogmaticall, Diatacticall and Criticall,</hi> yea, authoritative and commanding, who entring into a Councell and Synod, and there debating the buÅ¿ines, <hi>by ReaÅ¿on, Arguments and DiÅ¿putation,</hi> and finding by diÅ¿quiÅ¿ition of the whole matter, what was the good will and pleaÅ¿ure of God, what hee had revealed concerning the Gentiles, and the New Covenant under the GoÅ¿pel, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whole matter according to the written Word of God, not pretending any new Revelation or new light or any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or Å¿uperlative aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance in the deciding that debate, but only exerciÅ¿ed that ordinary Å¿overaigne power in the church of God, which God had inveÅ¿ted them with, and given unto them in his holy Word the rule and Å¿quare of all Doctrines, and not onely unto them, but to all his faithfull MiniÅ¿ters his Å¿ervants to the end of the world; and in the deciding of this controverÅ¿ie, they firÅ¿t Å¿hewed and put forth their <hi>dogmaticall power confuting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the hereÅ¿ie, and vindicating the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, they declared their</hi> diatacticall authority, making a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall Canon or Law for avoyding of Å¿candall, and abÅ¿taining from Å¿uch things as gave occaÅ¿ion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, they exerciÅ¿ed</hi> their criticall power and judiciary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, verÅ¿e <hi>24.</hi> condemning and branding thoÅ¿e Teachers with that infamous and blacke marke of Lyers, Å¿ubverters of Å¿oules and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the Church.</p>
               <p>Fourth. and laÅ¿tly, <hi>they Å¿ufficiently manifeÅ¿ted their imparative and authoritative power in Å¿ending thoÅ¿e Decrees unto the Churches of the Gentiles with doe this and live, v.</hi> 29. <hi>for Å¿o much the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,</hi> all which are acts of Å¿overaigne power and authority in all

governments whatÅ¿oever, as the learned know which when they reÅ¿ided in the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters of the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and were exerciÅ¿ed by them there; it is Å¿ufficiently manifeÅ¿t that all the power of government likewiÅ¿e remained, and reÅ¿ided wholly and Å¿olely in the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters hands, and that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿ed it by joynt conÅ¿ent, and the Common-councell of them all, for all acts of government ever run <hi>in the name of all the ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> or in the name of the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters.</p>
               <p>LaÅ¿tly, they had the diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of the treaÅ¿ury of that Church in their hands, as all the Presbyters of all the other Churches had, for they brought the monies alwayes to the ApoÅ¿tles, and laid them downe at their feet, as it appeareth, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. and afterwards all the monies and almes were Å¿ent to the Presbyters through all Churches, as in whoÅ¿e hands the Å¿overaigne authority lay, which they never gave out of their hands or relinquiÅ¿hed, but upon all occaÅ¿ions gave directions to their Å¿everall Deacons how to diÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them for the good of the church, and for the common emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument of the poore Saints: for otherwiÅ¿e to what end Å¿hould the almes and benevolences of the Gentiles be Å¿ent unto the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the churches in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> if they had not beene the men in authority in thoÅ¿e churches, and to whom the government of them belonged, and who only and wholly had the diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of them. Now then when the contribution and releefe was Å¿ent unto the Presbyters of the church in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> as wel as the other churches; it followeth that they and they only had the power and authority in that church which they ever exerciÅ¿ed by the joynt conÅ¿ent and common councell and agreement of them all, for it was Å¿ent unto all the Presbyters in every church, and therefore they were in common to diÅ¿poÅ¿e of them. Now before this reliefe was Å¿ent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and long after that, as the Å¿tory of the <hi>Acts</hi> declareth, moÅ¿t of the ApoÅ¿tles reÅ¿ided there, and all the ApoÅ¿tles were Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (as the Independents themÅ¿elves doe acknowledge) and the Å¿ame Scripture that relateth that the <hi>almes and reliefe</hi> were Å¿ent Å¿peaking in the plurall number, Å¿aith, <hi>they were Å¿ent unto the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> now they were all Presbyters, and therefore they were Å¿ent unto them in common; and if wee obÅ¿erve the Dialect of holy, writ through the whole Å¿tory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> wee Å¿hall find for the moÅ¿t part, if there be any mention made of any act of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that either all the ApoÅ¿tles, or Å¿ome more of them are ever made</hi>

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48122:276"/>
at that time, as well as at others, and therefore I Å¿ay when the diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of the treaÅ¿ury of the Church or State, is an Act of Å¿overaigne power, and belongs only to thoÅ¿e that are in authority in either, and when all the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned that Church by a Common-councell and joynt conÅ¿ent, and when the almes were Å¿ent unto all, it neceÅ¿Å¿arily followeth, notwithÅ¿tanding all MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his garrulity, that my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of that Scripture will ever Å¿tand good to prove <hi>that the Å¿ending of the reliefe to the Elders, makes good theÅ¿e two things;</hi> the firÅ¿t, <hi>that the PreÅ¿byters were the onely men in authority there:</hi> and Å¿econdly, <hi>that the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters of that Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and ruled it by a Common-councell and PreÅ¿bytery:</hi> yea, MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his owne words confirmes mee in my opinion, who Å¿aith, <hi>it is not denyed by the brethren, that the Presbyters in all Churches were the men in the government of the Churches in which they are Elders;</hi> Å¿o that all buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es of publicke concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were to bee tranÅ¿acted and managed by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent and agreement of them all, and not by the determination of any one particular Presbyter in either of thoÅ¿e Churches; much leÅ¿Å¿e by any other perÅ¿ons or people in them but the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿pake concerning the confirmation of my firÅ¿t Argument grounded upon that Scripture, <hi>that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and almes were Å¿ent unto the Presbyters of</hi> IeruÅ¿alem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now I come to what he hath to Å¿ay againÅ¿t my Å¿econd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by which I proved my third propoÅ¿ition, which is this, as he himÅ¿elfe Å¿et it down in the 12. Page of his book.</hi> They that in the holy Scripture are called PreÅ¿byters, and acted and ordered things in a joynt body and common Councell with the PreÅ¿byters, and exerciÅ¿ed that ordinary power committed to them in the <hi>18.</hi> of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> they acted as PreÅ¿byters: But the ApoÅ¿tles in governing the Church of IeruÅ¿alem conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, acted and ordered things in a joynt body and common Councell with the PreÅ¿bytery of that Church as PreÅ¿byters. <hi>Ergo:</hi> the church of IeruÅ¿alem was PreÅ¿byterially governed, and by a common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of PreÅ¿byters. The Major and Minor of this SyllogiÅ¿me being proved (Å¿aith the Doctor) the concluÅ¿ion will neceÅ¿Å¿arily inÅ¿ue.</p>
               <p>Thus MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> relates this Argument, wholly paÅ¿Å¿ing by all the reÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>And to this argument he firÅ¿t thus replies.</hi> I know not <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> that the brethren ever deny ed that the Church of IeruÅ¿alem was preÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterianly governed. <hi>So that he aÅ¿Å¿enteth unto the concluÅ¿ion, which is all I contended for by that argument; So that by this it followeth that the people had no hand in the government for they are not Presbyters by office. And yet Å¿uch is his ambition to be thought Å¿ome body in the art of diÅ¿putation, that he quarrels the forme of my SyllogiÅ¿me, and takes upon him to Å¿hew me how I Å¿hould have framed it aright; but all thoÅ¿e that know indeed what really belongs to learning will eaÅ¿ily perceive the man doth but babble, and if I Å¿hould Å¿pend time in trifling with him</hi> about forms, moodes, and figures in SyllogiÅ¿ms, <hi>who knows no more in Logick then the horÅ¿e he preaches on, I might be thought as vain as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe; therefore intreating him hereafter to learn his Grand-dame to Å¿uck and not mee to make SyllogiÅ¿ms, paÅ¿Å¿ing by all thoÅ¿e his grolleries I will Å¿et down what he hath farther to reply to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the 13. page, and then anÅ¿wer to that, and after I have done with him, I will come to</hi> I. S. <hi>that learned Gentleman and profound Clerk. MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>to this argument thus farther anÅ¿wereth,</hi> Though the ApoÅ¿tles <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> were called PreÅ¿byters in the Scripture, yet it followeth not, that they acted as PreÅ¿byters, but as ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>Act. 15.</hi> And they cannot therein be a pattern and preÅ¿ident for PreÅ¿byters; FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles had the care and charge of and over all Churches <hi>2 Cor. 11. 28.</hi> But the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters had the care and overÅ¿ight of Å¿ome one Church onely as <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us</hi> Act. <hi>20. 28.</hi> or <hi>Philippi</hi> Phil. <hi>1. 1.</hi> and this the Doctor often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erts in his book. That all the Churches we read of in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament (though they were preÅ¿byterially governed) were Dependent upon their Å¿everall PreÅ¿byters <hi>page 12.</hi> And Å¿econdly, becauÅ¿e this would make the PreÅ¿byters Independent indeed; for Å¿o the ApoÅ¿tles were in the government of all the Churches; the PreÅ¿byters of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> and of all the Churches were Dependent upon the ApoÅ¿tles, and the ApoÅ¿tles only Dependent on Christ; by whoÅ¿e holy spirit they were alwaies guided in the government of their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and therefore they Å¿aid <hi>Acts 15. 28.</hi> It Å¿eemed good to the holy GhoÅ¿t and us. And though the Doctor Å¿ay the PreÅ¿byters might Å¿ay Å¿o, as well as the ApoÅ¿tles becauÅ¿e the Elders and PreÅ¿byters are mentioned there. The Doctor might have alÅ¿o conÅ¿idered that the brethren, even the whole Church, the multitude (how many Å¿oever
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48122:277"/>
the Doctor can make of them) were preÅ¿ent as well as the PreÅ¿byters <hi>Acts 15. 4. 12. 22. 23, 25, 27, 28.</hi> and Å¿o have made the brethren, the multitude, even the whole Church Independent alÅ¿o; and the Doctor might as well have affirmed, that the brethren even the whole Church might Å¿ay, it Å¿eemed good to the holy GhoÅ¿t and to us.</p>
               <p>Thus MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> pleaÅ¿eth his own humour in heaping up a Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e and confuÅ¿ed multitude of words and that onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the people.</p>
               <p>But Å¿hould I make a full diÅ¿covery of all the errours of this his babble and nonÅ¿enÅ¿e and give a full anÅ¿wer to them, truly I might make a very large diÅ¿courÅ¿e, I will therefore Å¿tudy brevity and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer him in a few words, though I will omit nothing worthy to be taken notice of. But by the way I may Å¿ay thus much <hi>that this his anÅ¿wer is nothing to the purpoÅ¿e and his reaÅ¿ons are as vain, frivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and fond as by the Å¿equell will appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas he denyeth, that <hi>the ApoÅ¿tles though they be called PreÅ¿byters acted as PreÅ¿byters and that they cannot therein be a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and preÅ¿ident for PreÅ¿byters,</hi> it is a meer begging the queÅ¿tion and a fond trifling in a Å¿erious and weighty matter, when it was Å¿ufficiently proved and that out of the holy Scripture that the bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles were not onely called Presbyters but that they were Presbyters really as well as virtually (which the Independents themÅ¿elves deny not) and that they acted alÅ¿o as Presbyters at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem,</hi> that is, as ordinary rulers and officers in all acts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as alÅ¿o in that Councell in the 15. of the <hi>Acts;</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e their example could not indeed have been a pattern of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to all MiniÅ¿ters and Presbytes in all Å¿ucceeding ages, if in either of them they had acted as extraordinary men, by a tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent and Å¿uperlative power and by an inimitable authority and as men immediately aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted by the holy GhoÅ¿t as when they wrought Miracles and when they writ the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now that the ApoÅ¿tles in all thoÅ¿e acts of government were and are to be a pattern to all MiniÅ¿ters in the ages to come, all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedÅ¿t of the Independent tribe and all their brethren of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do acknowledge it, and take the ordination of Deacons and Elders in their new Churches from the example of the ApoÅ¿tles in the Å¿ixth of the <hi>Acts</hi> and the fourteenth chapter of the Å¿ame book, and they acknowledge and accord that Synods and Councells in like manner are one of Gods Ordinances and ground it upon the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48122:278"/>
ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters meeting in the 15. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and take their example for a pattern and preÅ¿ident of gathering into Synods and Councells upon the like occaÅ¿ions, all which they could not do if the ApoÅ¿tles in all thoÅ¿e acts of Government had acted and managed them onely as ApoÅ¿tles and in an extraordinary way with a tranÅ¿cendent and infallible authority and by a Å¿peciall diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ation from heaven and as only peculiar unto themÅ¿elves as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and extraordinary governours. So that whiles MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> fights againÅ¿t the truth and againÅ¿t mee, he with the Å¿ame weapon wounds his own cauÅ¿e and overthrows the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents doctrine, who from the examples of the ApoÅ¿tles though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary men take their ordination of Deacons and Elders and of calling Synods. And therefore in the firÅ¿t place this may Å¿erve for the diÅ¿covering of his ignorance and futility.</p>
               <p>As for his reaÅ¿ons of his denyall that the ApoÅ¿tles cannot be a paterne and preÅ¿ident for Presbyters, becauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles (as he Å¿aith) had the care of all churches, and the Presbyters were limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and confined to their particular charges, they are fooliÅ¿h and vain, and make nothing for the enervating or weakning of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: for it doth not follow as the learned well know, that becauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles in Å¿ome reÅ¿pects were extraordinary men and rulers, therefore in all acts of Government they did nothing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or for the imitation of other Church governours; I Å¿ay this can never follow with any good reaÅ¿on, neither will any judicious man thus argue becauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles were extraordinary men and officers, therefore they did not the acts of ordinary governours; whereas when they aÅ¿Å¿embled themÅ¿elves about the affaires of the Church and for the good of it, it was for this very end and purpoÅ¿e that they might leave an example and preÅ¿ident to the ages to come and to all MiniÅ¿ters that Å¿hould Å¿ucceed them of doing the like; and therefore we are ever to conÅ¿ider the ApoÅ¿tles in all acts of government to have acted as ordinary governours and rulers, and for a preÅ¿ident and pattern to all MiniÅ¿ters to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But whereas MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>grolliÅ¿hly Å¿aith,</hi> that the ApoÅ¿tles were Independent in the Government of all the Churches, and that the PreÅ¿byters of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> and <hi>EpheÅ¿us</hi> and all the Churches were Dependent upon the ApoÅ¿tles, and the ApoÅ¿tles onely Dependent upon ChriÅ¿t by whoÅ¿e spirit they were alwayes guided in the government
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48122:278"/>
of their Churches, and therefore they Å¿aid <hi>Acts 15. 28.</hi> It Å¿eemed good to the holy GhoÅ¿t and to us. <hi>In every Å¿entence, I might Å¿ay word, there is an error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For firÅ¿t, the ApoÅ¿tles were not Independent at all no more then the Presbyters, but they were ever tyed unto the word of God and his revealed will and that by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf who Å¿aid <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>Å¿earch the Scriptures;</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 14. <hi>They have MoÅ¿es and the Prophets, let them hear them;</hi> Yea Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 2 <hi>EpiÅ¿t. chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19. teacheth us, <hi>That we have a more Å¿ure word of prophecy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we do well to take heed,</hi> &amp;c. So that the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves were tyed to the Scriptures. And <hi>Paul</hi> the great ApoÅ¿tle of the Gentiles in the 24. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and in many other places makes the Law and the Prophets the rule of his faith, profeÅ¿Å¿ing that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved all things according to them. So that when <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿warved from that rule &amp; began amongÅ¿t the <hi>Galatians</hi> to halt &amp; temporize <hi>Paul</hi> reÅ¿iÅ¿ted him to his face and accuÅ¿ed him openly of prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nay which is more Å¿o far they were from being indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that they were alwayes to follow the guidance of the Å¿pirit; they were not to move but as he directed <hi>Act.</hi> 16. Yea the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves were Å¿ubject to the Presbytery at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and were to give an account of their actions to them at any time, as we may Å¿ee <hi>Acts</hi> 11. where <hi>Peter</hi> was queÅ¿tioned, and was forced to give in his anÅ¿wer for Å¿atisfaction; the other ApoÅ¿tles alÅ¿o were Å¿ubject unto that Presbyterie, and gave an account how they had Å¿pent their time amongÅ¿t the Gentiles; yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himÅ¿elfe received orders from the Presbyterie in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem, Acts</hi> 21. and was ruled by them: yea, they were not onely Å¿ubject to the Church in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem,</hi> but to all other Churches alÅ¿o, and were Å¿ent on their meÅ¿Å¿age at any time. For <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were Å¿ent to <hi>Samaria</hi> by the ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>Act.</hi> the 8. and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Å¿ent from <hi>Antioch</hi> by that Church there to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem</hi> they were Å¿ent againe to <hi>Antioch, Syria, &amp; Galatia,</hi> Å¿o that they were as much dependent as any other MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel; and therefore M. <hi>Knollys</hi> is altogether in error in aÅ¿Å¿erting that the ApoÅ¿tles were independent; neither is that true alÅ¿o that the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were dependent upon the ApoÅ¿tles any farther then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Lord; for there was a Å¿peciall caution &amp; caveat made to the contrary, not only by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, who Å¿aid to all his Followers and DiÅ¿ciples <hi>beware of falÅ¿e Prophets and falÅ¿e</hi>

erroneous and never Å¿o lyable to exception and juÅ¿t controule as that other of his expreÅ¿Å¿ions is, where he Å¿aith <hi>that the ApoÅ¿tles were alwayes guided by the Å¿pirit in the Government of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> in the which words there is a twofold error; for <hi>Peter</hi> was not guided by the Å¿pirit, neither when ChriÅ¿t called him Sathan, neither when he denyed his MaÅ¿ter, nor when he temporized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the <hi>Galatians;</hi> beÅ¿ides the Churches were not the ApoÅ¿tles Churches, as he erroneouÅ¿ly and ignorantly Å¿peaketh, <hi>but they were ChriÅ¿ts golden CandleÅ¿ticks</hi> Revel. 1. ver. 20. <hi>who walked amongÅ¿t them:</hi> And the ApoÅ¿tles profeÅ¿Å¿e 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. ver. 5. <hi>that they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not themÅ¿elves, but JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the Lord and themÅ¿elves the Å¿ervants of the Church for JeÅ¿us his Å¿ake,</hi> and in the firÅ¿t of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> chap. 3. ver. 21<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 22, 23. <hi>Therefore let no man glory in men</hi> (Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle) <hi>for all things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollo or Cephas, or the World, or Life, or Death, or things preÅ¿ent, or things to come, all are yours, and ye are ChriÅ¿ts, and ChriÅ¿t is Gods.</hi> If the Churches therefore be ChriÅ¿ts golden CandleÅ¿ticks, and his Churches and his houÅ¿es, as <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 of <hi>Timothy</hi> averreth ch. 3. ver. 14, 15. where he Å¿aith, <hi>TheÅ¿e things I write unto thee, that thou mayest know how thou oughteÅ¿t to behave thy Å¿elf in the houÅ¿e of God which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth:</hi> if therefore, I Å¿ay, Churches be the houÅ¿es of God and the Churches of the living God, and the golden CandleÅ¿ticks of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and he be the Lord of them, and there be alÅ¿o a Å¿peciall prohibition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe to all his ApoÅ¿tles and to all miniÅ¿ters that they Å¿hould not Lord it over his people as the Princes of the <hi>Gentils</hi> did over them that were their Å¿ubjects; how then can Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿ay <hi>that the Churches were the ApoÅ¿tles Churches?</hi> Every man I conceive that hath any ordinary underÅ¿tanding, that with delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration Å¿hall read Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿criblings, will conclude of him, <hi>That he is altogether ignorant in Å¿acred things, and if he had not been a frontleÅ¿Å¿e man and without all Å¿hame, he would never have publiÅ¿hed Å¿o many errors and Å¿o much ignorance as he hath done to the view of the world,</hi> neither would he ever have Å¿aid <hi>that though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles were called PreÅ¿byters in the Scripture, yet they acted not as PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> eÅ¿pecially when it was proved unto him and all thoÅ¿e of his fraternity in my firÅ¿t book <hi>that they acted in all acts of Government and in that Synod at JeruÅ¿alem</hi> Acts 15. <hi>as ordinary PreÅ¿byters.</hi> But becauÅ¿e Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> is not yet Å¿atisfied about that point nor perhaps
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48122:280"/>
never will be, for the more ample Å¿atisfaction if not to him, at leaÅ¿t to others, I will here prove that point a little more fully; <hi>viz. that the ApoÅ¿tles acted as PreÅ¿byters in an ordinary way as the other did,</hi> and after I have done that, <hi>I will briefly alÅ¿o anÅ¿wer Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>his grolleries concerning the fufferage and votes of the Church and people in that Synod in IeruÅ¿alem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But firÅ¿t I will prove,</hi> that the ApoÅ¿tles in the debate and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ie in the Synod and in that whole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e did not act as Apostles with a tranÅ¿cendent and infallible authority, but as PreÅ¿byters in Å¿uch a way as makes their meeting a preÅ¿ident and pattern to ordinary Councels and Synods.</p>
               <p>For firÅ¿t <hi>Paul</hi> an ApoÅ¿tle and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> though both extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men and indued with an infallible Å¿pirit, yet were at that time Å¿ent to <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> by the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ver. 2. as Å¿ervants of that Presbytery, who willingly and in obedience to the order of that Church Å¿ubjected themÅ¿elves to their determination, which they would not have done had they acted as ApoÅ¿tles and not as Members (for that preÅ¿ent) of the Presbytery of <hi>Antioch;</hi> now all men know <hi>that they that are Å¿ent as MeÅ¿Å¿engers by command and appointment, as they were, were not greater then thoÅ¿e that Å¿ent them,</hi> which is one of the reaÅ¿ons all orthodox Divines uÅ¿e againÅ¿t <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy, in that the ApoÅ¿tles which were in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> (Acts 8. 14.) Å¿ent him and <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and therefore they conclude <hi>that the Colledge of ApoÅ¿tles had authority over him and that they were not Å¿ubject to him:</hi> And the Å¿ame may be concluded concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Paul and Barnabas</hi> that they were Å¿ubject to the command of the Church: And it is yet more evident out of the Å¿econd <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> of the 15, <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>Acts, Where</hi> it is Å¿aid, <hi>that when Paul and Barnabas had no Å¿mall diÅ¿Å¿ention &amp; diÅ¿putation with them, that then they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them Å¿hould go up to IeruÅ¿alem unto the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders about this queÅ¿tion,</hi> out of the which words every one may obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e concluÅ¿ions following: FirÅ¿t, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> uÅ¿ed not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranÅ¿cendent extraordinary and ApoÅ¿tolicall authority in that Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> neither did they challenge unto themÅ¿elves an infallible authority for the deciding of that difference, which they might have done if they had then and there acted as ApoÅ¿tles and put forth their ApoÅ¿tolicall power; yea which is more, it is in <hi>terminis</hi> Å¿aid, <hi>that Paul and Barnabas had no Å¿mall diÅ¿Å¿ention and diÅ¿putation with</hi>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:48122:280"/>
                  <hi>them,</hi> intimating by thoÅ¿e words <hi>that they argued and debated the matter by ReaÅ¿ons and Arguments, as the other ordinary PreÅ¿byters of that Church did, which they would never have Å¿uffered if they had acted there as ApoÅ¿tles and with an infallible authority;</hi> and this is the firÅ¿t concluÅ¿ion may be gathered out of thoÅ¿e words to prove that <hi>Paul &amp; Barnabas</hi> acted there as ordinary Presbyters, and were not onely at that time Å¿ubject to that Church, but Members of the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd concluÅ¿ion that may be gathered out of thoÅ¿e words is this, <hi>That they were Å¿ent as the other ordinary officers, and the Å¿ame commands laid upon them that were laid upon the other:</hi> Now if they of <hi>Antioch</hi> had looked upon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary MeÅ¿Å¿engers indued with ApoÅ¿tolicall authority, they would have made Å¿ome difference between them and the certain others Å¿pake of in that place; but Å¿ending them all with equall authority and with one and the Å¿ame MeÅ¿Å¿age and making no diÅ¿tinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, it Å¿ufficiently proveth <hi>that they of</hi> Antioch <hi>in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment lookt upon them but as ordinary PreÅ¿byters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third thing obÅ¿ervable is this,</hi> that Paul and Barnabas with thoÅ¿e certain others were Å¿ent as well to the Elders or PreÅ¿byters at IeruÅ¿alem about the queÅ¿tion, as to the ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>for Å¿o runs the text,</hi> they were all Å¿ent unto as having equal authority and as the ordinary Governours and Councellours of the Church and as to Å¿uch as Å¿at by one and the Å¿ame CommiÅ¿Å¿ion, Writ, or Charter, and governed with a joynt conÅ¿ent and by a Common Councel and Agreement: <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are all to be conÅ¿idered as ordinary Presbyters in that Councel and Synod; and all this I Å¿ay may be gathered out of that text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are many other Arguments to prove it, becauÅ¿e the Presbyters all of them and that all along through the whole debate acted as authoritatively as the ApoÅ¿tles: For <hi>as the PreÅ¿byters were Å¿ent unto as well as the ApoÅ¿tles and aÅ¿Å¿embled themÅ¿elves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly</hi> v. 6. <hi>So they did decree and write the EpiÅ¿tle as well as the ApoÅ¿tles</hi> ver. 22. 23. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>they are called alÅ¿o the decrees of the ApoÅ¿tles and Elders,</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 21. the Presbyters Å¿ay, <hi>Wee have written and concluded,</hi> manifeÅ¿ting unto all the World that they in that Synod Å¿at and acted by the Å¿ame authority and were aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted and guided by the Å¿ame Å¿pirit the ApoÅ¿tles were as Å¿itting by the Å¿ame CommiÅ¿Å¿ion or Writ: And therefore when the holy

               <p>
                  <hi>Many Arguments more might be produced to prove</hi> that the ApoÅ¿tles acted as Presbyters, and were no more then guided by an ApoÅ¿tolicall and infallible Å¿pirit then the other Presbyters; <hi>but for brevity Å¿ake I Å¿hall only name one more, which is this, in that</hi> they stated the question, and debated it from the holy Scripture in the ordinary way diÅ¿puting <hi>Con and Pro,</hi> arguing and reaÅ¿oning what they Å¿hould write, and what they Å¿hould judge of that buÅ¿ines, as it is apparent in the <hi>7.</hi> verÅ¿e, and many more places in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by their deliberate Å¿uffrages and diÅ¿courÅ¿es in that Councell, and having by Å¿earching the Scripture <hi>(Å¿aith the Holy GhoÅ¿t)</hi> found what was the good and acceptable will of God, thereupon they Å¿ay it Å¿eemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us; <hi>as any Synod or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Divines upon the like aÅ¿Å¿urance of Scripture warrant may doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I affirme, had the ApoÅ¿tles at that time acted by an apoÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and infallible Spirit, a when they writ the holy Scripture, and not as Presbyters, <hi>they would never have admitted any dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor entred into a Å¿erious debate and conÅ¿ultation what they Å¿hould write and judge of that matter, but would speedily have diÅ¿patched the buÅ¿ines, and by their Apostolicall authority, and that infallible Spirit they were led with, they would have decided the matter,</hi> and either have Å¿aid, <hi>thus Å¿aith the Lord as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old did, or take notice that what wee write are the commands of the Lord, dictated unto us by the Spirit of God, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have</hi> gone to conÅ¿ult with others about it, or debated the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Arguments and reaÅ¿ons; which when they did, it is a Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument to prove <hi>that the Apostles acted as Presbyters in that Councel;</hi> and therfore from all that I have now Å¿aid it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently evident that all the ApoÅ¿tles at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> acted as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that the other Presbyters had equall authority and power with them, notwithÅ¿tanding all MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> his bable.

               <p>But before I come to my anÅ¿wer, I muÅ¿t tell <hi>I.

And therefore it Å¿tands all men upon <hi>to prove and examine all things</hi> according to the ApoÅ¿tles rule 1 <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, <hi>and hold faÅ¿t that which is good.</hi>

Now in Divine matters and in the matters of our God we muÅ¿t be eÅ¿pecially careful that we Å¿ee a ground &amp; warrant out of his word, or from excellent reaÅ¿on or good conÅ¿equences deduced from thence; for whatÅ¿oever opinion or diÅ¿tinction in Å¿acred things Å¿hall be brought and propounded unto us, and if it have not its authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ground from thence or Å¿ome example or preÅ¿ident or Å¿ollid reaÅ¿on or good conÅ¿equence out of the Å¿ame word to warrant and confirm it, it is to be rejected by all good ChriÅ¿tians, eÅ¿pecially if it conÅ¿iÅ¿t of captious, doubtful and ambiguous expreÅ¿Å¿ions, and which will admit of various and different interpretations, and to all the reÅ¿t be found contrary to the word of God, as this grolliÅ¿h diÅ¿tincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought by <hi>I. S.</hi> doth: for he makes a diÅ¿tinction <hi>between au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and juriÅ¿diction on the one hand, and power and interest on the other,</hi> as if there were Å¿ome vaÅ¿t difference between them when all learned men know, <hi>that authority, juriÅ¿diction and power are all one,</hi> as when a MagiÅ¿trate making uÅ¿e of either of theÅ¿e words Å¿ays Å¿uch an one is under my authority or juriÅ¿diction or power, all men know that either of thoÅ¿e words Å¿ignifies his authority over him and thoÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions intimate one &amp; the Å¿ame thing. But as for the word <hi>intereÅ¿t</hi> which he makes a Synonima with power, it is a meer grollery, for that is a word of ambiguity and of various Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, and admits of divers interpretations, and therefore cannot be the Å¿ame with power, the meaning of the which I am confident that <hi>I.

                  <hi>and writing by his holy spirit, Å¿o that whatÅ¿oever they taught or writ as his MiniÅ¿ters, were the dictates of his Å¿pirit, and the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and were for ever to be the rule of his Church to all Å¿ucceeding ages to the end of the World; and if we conÅ¿ider alÅ¿o what he promiÅ¿ed to his bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles and all his Servants and MiniÅ¿ters that Å¿hould Å¿ucceed them:</hi> viz. <hi>that he would be with them to the end of the World; to all which MiniÅ¿ters likewiÅ¿e he had given the keys and made them Å¿tewards and overÅ¿eers of his houÅ¿e which is his Church; I Å¿ay if we but duly weigh all theÅ¿e things we Å¿hall finde them all inveÅ¿ted with plenary authority, and by the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion of God for ever inabled to exerciÅ¿e all acts of Government in the Church, and that by themÅ¿elves without the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the people who were never joyned with them in commiÅ¿Å¿ion, but received commands from heaven to obey thoÅ¿e that God had made guides over them and made Rulers in his Church;</hi> I Å¿ay if we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely conÅ¿ider all theÅ¿e immunities and priviledges and the power that the ApoÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters of <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> were indued with and that from <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> the King of his church: And on the other Å¿ide Å¿hall but conÅ¿ider what learned <hi>I.

S.</hi> who places all the power in the people, robbing both the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters of their authority; and on the other Å¿ide his brethren, they place all authority upon the ApoÅ¿tles, and deprive the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of it, and count them but ordinary men, and not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly there aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted by the Holy GhoÅ¿t; both which opinions as they are contrary unto the word of God, Å¿o they Å¿ufficiently prove that theÅ¿e men are but <hi>Babel</hi> Builders, whoÅ¿e tongues and language are divided, and tend to confuÅ¿ion; for they are diametrically fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one againÅ¿t ano ther; Å¿o that all the world may Å¿ee that thoÅ¿e men that begin once to fight againÅ¿t the truth, like the <hi>Midianit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I come now to my fourth, which I will firÅ¿t Å¿et down with their AnÅ¿wers to it, and then make my reply as I have done to all their former cavills; and I will go on in the Å¿ame order, firÅ¿t anÅ¿we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>HanÅ¿erdo</hi> and then to <hi>I. S.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My fourth PropoÅ¿ition is this,</hi> viz. That the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> and the government of the Å¿ame, is to be a pattern for all Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies in any City or Vicinity, to unite into one Church; and for the Officers and PreÅ¿byters of thoÅ¿e congregations to govern that Church joyntly, in a Colledge or PreÅ¿bytery.</p>
               <p>And for the proofe of this there needs no great diÅ¿pute; for all men acknowledge that the mother Church muÅ¿t give an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of government to all the daughter Churches; now then when it doth evidently appear, that this mother Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> in her moÅ¿t flouriÅ¿hing condition, and by her firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution, was conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many Congregations and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies, and that they were all governed by a Presbytery, or a joynt and common Councell of Presbyters: then it followeth, that all other Churches Å¿hould be governed after the Å¿ame manner as the mother Church was, to the end of the World; neither doe the brethren deny, but the government of the church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> muÅ¿t be the patterne of government to all churches; and therefore out of that miÅ¿priÅ¿ion and miÅ¿take, that Å¿he was conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of but as many as could meet in one congregation, they take the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> for imitation, and teach all their Å¿everall congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to do the Å¿ame, and to exerciÅ¿e the Å¿ame power among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves Independent, and to govern with as abÅ¿olute an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Å¿everall Congregations, as the whole Colledge of the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters did in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and from the which they allow of no appeale, as all that know their tenents can witneÅ¿Å¿e: So that this laÅ¿t PropoÅ¿ition being Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both by reaÅ¿on and the conÅ¿ent of the brethren, needs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now to this my fourth PropoÅ¿ition and the Arguments contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Å¿ame, MaÅ¿ter</hi> Knollys <hi>thus replyeth Page 14.</hi> Neither do the Brethren deny, but the Government of the Church of IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem muÅ¿t be the pattern of Government to all Churches. But the Doctor knows, that the brethren deny that the Church of IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of divers Congregations and Å¿everall AÅ¿Å¿emblies under a common Councell, ConÅ¿iÅ¿tory, Colledge, or Court of PreÅ¿byters.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48122:297"/>
And this they have not granted, neither hath the Doctor proved. And this may be Å¿ufficient to be Å¿aid in AnÅ¿wer to the four PropoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the firÅ¿t Question.</p>
               <p>This is all Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> hath to Å¿ay by way of AnÅ¿wer to this my laÅ¿t PropoÅ¿ition; in the which AnÅ¿wer of his, I deÅ¿ire the Reader to obÅ¿erve what he in the name of all the brethren granteth and aÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth unto, and what both he and they all deny (at leaÅ¿t as he Å¿aith); for he perÅ¿onateth them all. He grants in behalfe of them all, <hi>that the Church of IeruÅ¿alem muÅ¿t be the pattern of Government to all churches:</hi> And this is as much as I deÅ¿ire.</p>
               <p>But by the way take notice that MaÅ¿ter <hi>HanÅ¿erdo</hi> reckons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his hoÅ¿t; for <hi>I. S.</hi> is one of the brethren, and yet he Page 13. aÅ¿Å¿erteth that the example of that Church is not <hi>bindingly preÅ¿iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.</hi> Now what he and all the brethren deny, if Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> be worthy of credit, are theÅ¿e two things, viz. The firÅ¿t, <hi>That the Church of IeruÅ¿alem conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of divers congregations.</hi> Secondly, <hi>they deny that the Doctor hath proved it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all the brethren deny (as Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> Å¿aith) that the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many congregations, is not altogether to be believed: For my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> none of tne meaneÅ¿t of the Brethren, doth not deny it: yea he not onely grants it, but by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments proves that there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Believers in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> and therefore Mr <hi>HanÅ¿erdo</hi> in this alÅ¿o his aÅ¿Å¿ertion reckons before his hoÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>But whereas in the Å¿econd place he Å¿aith that the brethren deny that I have proved there were many congregations of Believers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> he being better acquainted with their denyalls then I am, may Å¿peak according to his information, and Å¿o is not Å¿o blame worthy as in the former of his concluÅ¿ions; but if it were any thing materiall, or to the purpoÅ¿e, I could name Å¿ome of the Brethren of the congregationall way, that told me diÅ¿courÅ¿ing with them, that by reading of my book they were convinced that there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblies of beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> and therefore to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all the Brethren do not deny that I have proved it: But whether or no I have not abundantly evinced there were many AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblies of Beleevers in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that not onely out of the holy Scripture, but from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> own words, I leave it to the judgement of all Å¿uch men as have any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding and without prejudice Å¿hall read the foregoing diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:48122:298"/>
courÅ¿e, whither I Å¿end them, intreating them likewiÅ¿e with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to peruÅ¿e it: and then I doubt not, but whatÅ¿oever they have beleeved concerning that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, or whatÅ¿oever they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly denyed, they will be convinced that I have Å¿ufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both from Scripture and from my brother <hi>Burton</hi> and Saint <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> own conceÅ¿Å¿ions that there were many Congregations of Beleevers in the Church at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and withall I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured they will alÅ¿o for time to come take heed how they beleeve Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and thoÅ¿e of his fraternity upon their bare words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other Å¿ufficient and approved witneÅ¿Å¿es.</p>
               <p>And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice for AnÅ¿wer to MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I deÅ¿ire the Reader to hear what learned <hi>I. S.</hi> hath to Å¿ay; He in the 13. Page anÅ¿wers thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FirÅ¿t, Å¿aith he,</hi> They are not (meaning the Congregations and Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall AÅ¿Å¿emblies) an example of uniting or aggregation, except it be found that there were many Churches aggregated, which a very facile and Å¿waÅ¿ible Reader may well doubt of, for any thing that hath yet been Å¿aid to make it good.</p>
               <p>For AnÅ¿wer to <hi>I. S.</hi> I Å¿ay that he that is but a very facile and Å¿waÅ¿ible reader, that will vouchÅ¿afe to peruÅ¿e and conÅ¿ider but what I have wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t in way of AnÅ¿wer both to himÅ¿elfe, <hi>HanÅ¿erdo Knollys</hi> and my learned brother <hi>Burton,</hi> will never doubt but that I have Å¿ufficiently made it good that there were many AÅ¿Å¿emblies and Churches aggregated in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> and therefore I Å¿hall Å¿end all Å¿uch as are Å¿tudious to finde out the truth, and to Å¿hun error and to decline all trivall and fond Å¿educers, to what I have written in the foregoing TreatiÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>And this Å¿hall Å¿erve for AnÅ¿wer to his firÅ¿t Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Å¿aith he,</hi> If this were granted that many Churches did aggregate and unite in the beginning, yet would not this example be bindingly PreÅ¿identiall, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire the Reader to take notice of the vanity of this Novice, and worthleÅ¿Å¿e man who is Å¿o farr from all learning and knowledge, as he is not acquainted with the very principles of any Å¿ound reaÅ¿on or with the Independents doctrine; for he hath the whole Army of the Independents againÅ¿t him in this point as well as the Presbyterians, who all acknowledge that the church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruÅ¿alem</hi> is for its Government to be the patterne of Government to all churches to the end of the World; and that hath been all the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48122:298"/>
controverÅ¿ie between the Presbyterians and the Illdependents, whether that Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which if it could be proved they profeÅ¿t that then the cauÅ¿e was loÅ¿t and the day was the Presbyterians; for they all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> muÅ¿t be a pattern of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and this MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> in the name of all the brethren aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented unto in the foregoing words, Å¿o that theÅ¿e brethren are not Å¿o well acquainted with one anothers minde and principles as they perÅ¿wade others they are.</p>
               <p>Now profound <hi>I. S.</hi> denyeth that were it Å¿o that the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of many AÅ¿Å¿emblies, yet for all this that it could not be <hi>bindingly PreÅ¿identiall,</hi> theÅ¿e are his words by the which he beats up all the Independents Quarters, to uÅ¿e his own rhetorick, and utterly overthroweth that cauÅ¿e he as a Champion came out to maintain. Neither hath he onely beat up the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents Quarters, but indeed all the ApoÅ¿tles Quarters: For that Government they eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> and in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Primitive Churches, was left for a patterne of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Churches in all Å¿ucceeding Ages, as not onely the Independents but all orthodox Divines doe accord, yea the Scripture it Å¿elfe hath commanded it, <hi>IÅ¿aih</hi> 2. Å¿aying, out of <hi>Zion Å¿hall come the Law, and the word of the Lord from IeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: IeruÅ¿alem</hi> therefore muÅ¿t be a paterne, both for doctrine and government, and this al the Independents themÅ¿elves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the Scripture in many places Å¿aith, whatÅ¿oever was written was written for our inÅ¿truction; therefore the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Primitive Churches, eÅ¿pecially that of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and the example of all the ApoÅ¿tles, are left for our imitation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. Now when the ApoÅ¿tles conÅ¿tituted all churches after one way, and aggregated many Churches or Congregations all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Presbyterie, in each of them Å¿everally, as in that at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem,</hi> that Church principally, and all the reÅ¿t are left for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of imitation of Church government to the end of the world, and this is confirmed by the Holy word of God, and aÅ¿Å¿ented unto by all the Learned, from all which when <hi>J. S.</hi> moÅ¿t raÅ¿hly and wickedly diÅ¿Å¿enteth, I leave him to the cenÅ¿ure of the Å¿even new Churches, who I hope will whip him out of their AÅ¿Å¿emblies, with his fooliÅ¿h <hi>Flagello flagelli,</hi> for thus Å¿ottiÅ¿hly beating up of all their quarters, and renouncing all the Independents Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

whiles hee laboured to maintaine them; and this Å¿hall Å¿uffice for anÅ¿wer to <hi>I. S.</hi> his grolleries to the former PropoÅ¿itions concerning the firÅ¿t QueÅ¿tion.</p>
               <p>Now before I come to my Å¿econd queÅ¿tion, concerning the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Churches, I will Å¿ay thus much by way of Preface concerning <hi>HanÅ¿erdo, I. S.</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> that as they are very confuÅ¿ed in their replyes, jumbling things together, that are heterogenious, leaping backward and forwards, picking and chooÅ¿ing, Å¿natching and carping, yea, and trifling about words, as the cuÅ¿tome of all the Ill<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>defendents is, Å¿o they deale not fairly with mee, nor ingenuouÅ¿ly, nor Saint-like with the people, whom they deÅ¿ire to delude, and therefore they paÅ¿Å¿e over the moÅ¿t ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Arguments, never Å¿o much as making mention of them, and Å¿lighting all as not worthy the anÅ¿wering to, and by Å¿uch arts as theÅ¿e are, they moÅ¿t prodigiouÅ¿ly abuÅ¿e the well minded people, and by theÅ¿e their unchriÅ¿tian, unbrotherly, and wicked dealings, they every day broach their errors with more facility, and abuÅ¿e all their ignorant and credulous followers, to the utter deÅ¿troying of many of their poore Å¿oules, Å¿ome of the which as I am able to prove, were men eÅ¿teemed of to be godly, as walking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably, being alÅ¿o diligent hearers of the word before they knew them, yet after their acquaintance with them, being firÅ¿t by their meanes Å¿educed from our Churches, after Å¿ome time they fell from their congregations alÅ¿o, into wicked and deÅ¿perate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in a Å¿hort time after, became Å¿o prophane and beaÅ¿tly; yea, Å¿o atheiÅ¿ticall, as it would exceed ordinary beliefe to relate, and truly if I had not very good witneÅ¿Å¿e to prove what I Å¿ay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides my owne knowledge and experience, I would not have mentioned it; but becauÅ¿e if occaÅ¿ion Å¿erves I Å¿hall be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many PreÅ¿idents of fearefull ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ies, even amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that were their Schollers, and the DiÅ¿ciples of the Independent way, I am the willinger to Å¿peake of it, that I might arme all men with Å¿ome caution in reading their Pamphlets,
which they write againÅ¿t the Presbyterians; for they never deale candidly, neither with them, nor with their own brethren: for firÅ¿t they either wholly diÅ¿Å¿wade them from reading our bookes, or elÅ¿e by their emiÅ¿Å¿aries, and rayling Libels they moÅ¿t Å¿hamefully vilifie and belye them Å¿o, that they come prejudicated to them, and then they Å¿end their owne putrid and corrupt Å¿criblings amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:48122:299"/>
of their Fraternity, whom they miÅ¿erably cozen and abuÅ¿e with their fraudulent jugglings, and that againÅ¿t all the Lawes of piety and common honeÅ¿ty, to the diÅ¿turbance, both of Church and State. This I thought fit (I Å¿ay) to Å¿peake before I come to my Å¿econd queÅ¿tion and Å¿everall Queries ariÅ¿ing from it, concerning the gathering of Churches, and their anÅ¿wers unto them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they rather trifle then diÅ¿pute, as will by and by appeare; I Å¿hall therefore in my replying unto them, firÅ¿t Å¿et downe the queÅ¿tion fully with all my queries, and then anÅ¿wer to all the materials of their fond cavils and evaÅ¿ions, with their Å¿illy reÅ¿ponÅ¿als to them, and after I have done that, I will Å¿et downe Gods method, and the ApoÅ¿tles practiÅ¿e in the gathering of Churches, with the manner of their admitting of Members, and then reply to whatÅ¿oever they have to Å¿ay againÅ¿t my Arguments and ReaÅ¿ons deduced from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and for further confirmation of the truth, I will adde many more PreÅ¿idents, and them undeniable ones of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles receiving of Members, and that into Churches formed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the New-TeÅ¿tament forme, according to their owne deÅ¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; beÅ¿ides, thoÅ¿e that were received into the Catholike viÅ¿ible Church, and all without any of thoÅ¿e conditions they now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of their Members, and I Å¿hall by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance evidently make it appeare, that God by his holy ApoÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters uÅ¿es but one way of admitting of members into the church, whether it be the catholike viÅ¿ible church, or any particular presbyterian church, whether they be admitted in an ordinary or an extraordinary way, I Å¿ay by thegrace of God I Å¿hal clearly elucidate this truth, that God uÅ¿eth one and the Å¿ame method in gathering his people out of all nations into Church fellowÅ¿hip, and the communion of the Saints, which ought to all MiniÅ¿ters to be a rule to walke by in the receiving in of Members into their Congregations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus Å¿et downe what order I will proceed in, I come now to the Å¿econd queÅ¿tion betweene us and the Brethren, which is, concerning the manner of gathering of Churches and admitting of Members and Officers,</hi> viz. Whether MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel may out of already congregated AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of `Beleevers, Å¿elect and chooÅ¿e the moÅ¿t principall of them, into a Church-fellowÅ¿hip peculiar unto themÅ¿elves, and admit of none into their Å¿ociety, but Å¿uch as Å¿hall enter in by a private co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and are allowed of by the conÅ¿ent and approbation of all

the Congregation. And this queÅ¿tion brancheth it Å¿elfe into theÅ¿e Å¿everall Queries: The firÅ¿t, whether for the gathering of Churches there bee either Precept or PreÅ¿ident in the Holy Word of God, that the Preachers and MiniÅ¿ters of the Gospel did ever leave their owne ordinary charges, to which they are called, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are fixed, with a command not to leave them, and under pretence of a new way, or a new borne truth, or a new light, did runne about and alienate the minds of the people, well affected formerly to their Å¿everall MiniÅ¿ters, as of duty they were bound, as who had converted them to ChriÅ¿t by their MiniÅ¿tery, and fed them Å¿till with the Å¿incere milke of the Word, and built them up in their moÅ¿t holy Faith: I Å¿ay, the firÅ¿t <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether there be precept or example in the Word of God of any true Ministers Å¿o doing? and whether it was ever heard of in the ApoÅ¿tles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, that any beleeving ChriÅ¿tians were in great numbers congregated from among other beleeving ChriÅ¿tians, and moulded into Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, as Å¿eparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct bodies and Churches from them, and who had no Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowÅ¿hip with the other Congregations, nor communicated with them in the Ordinances, but were independent from them, and abÅ¿olute among themÅ¿elves? and whether this way of gathering of Churches was ever heard of before theÅ¿e dayes? and whether this be to Å¿et ChriÅ¿t upon his Throne, to make diviÅ¿ions and Å¿chiÅ¿mes in Churches, and among Beleevers and brethren, and that upon groundleÅ¿Å¿e pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether for the making of any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a Member of the Church, it be requiÅ¿ite or neceÅ¿Å¿ary, to the beleeving and being baptized, that they Å¿hould walke Å¿ome dayes, weeks, moneths, perhaps yeares with them, that they may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their converÅ¿ation before they can be admitted, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, a confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith Å¿hould be publikely made before the Congregation, and the evidences of their converÅ¿ion, as, the time when, the place where, the occaÅ¿ion how they were converted, Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e openly be produced for Å¿atisfaction to the Church before they can be admitted to be Members, and if any, either men or women Å¿hall except againÅ¿t their evidence, that then they are not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; this is the Å¿econd <hi>Quere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is, whether for making any man or woman a Member, or an Officer of a Church, the conÅ¿ent of the whole Congregation
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:48122:300"/>
or the greater part of them beÅ¿ides the Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters be requiÅ¿ite?</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether for the admiÅ¿Å¿ion of any one into Church-fellowÅ¿hip and Communion, a private Å¿olemne Covenant be requiÅ¿ite or neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the making of any one a Member, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or refuÅ¿all of the which, makes them incapable of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Å¿hip and admiÅ¿Å¿ion? There is no queÅ¿tion betweene us and the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, about a publike covenant, for we have PreÅ¿idents of that in holy Scripture, in all publike reformations.</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether the women and people, as well as the Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters have the power of the Keyes, and whether the women have all their voices in the Church, both for election and reprobation of Members and officers, as well as the men, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conÅ¿ent of all the women, or the greateÅ¿t part of them, bee requiÅ¿ite for the making of any one a Member or Officer, Å¿o that if they gain<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>Å¿ay it, being the greater number, or allow of it, the moÅ¿t voices carry the buÅ¿ines? this is the fifth <hi>Querie,</hi> the practiÅ¿e of the which, as of all the former, the brethren in Å¿ome of their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations hold for orthodox, and thinke all theÅ¿e things required of any that offer themÅ¿elves to be a Member.</p>
               <p>The laÅ¿t <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether the practice and preaching of all theÅ¿e things, and the gathering of Churches after this manner, be to Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t as King upon his Throne? and whether Churches and AÅ¿Å¿emblies thus congregated be the onely true Churches, and in the which onely ChriÅ¿t rules aud reignes as King, and all other that are not moulded up after this faÅ¿hion, bee no true congregated Churches, and in the which ChriÅ¿t is not Å¿et up as King upon his Throne, which is the opinion of the brethren, as wil afterward appear.</p>
               <p>If I have failed in any thing in Å¿tating the queÅ¿tion, or in any of theÅ¿e <hi>Quaeries,</hi> the brethren muÅ¿t pardon me; for I Å¿peak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practice of Å¿ome of their Congregations, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine many of them teach, not onely in their owne AÅ¿Å¿emblies, but in every Pulpit through the Kingdome where they come, as I Å¿hall be able to prove: And therefore if I have been miÅ¿taken in any thing, they may blame their own practice and teachers, and thank themÅ¿elves alÅ¿o, that in the Å¿pace of almoÅ¿t three yeares (though it has been again and again deÅ¿ired at their hands) they have not Å¿o much as Å¿et down the modell of their government, and what they would have, with all the appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:48122:301"/>
belonging unto it, that all the world might be out of doubt. What therefore I find practiÅ¿ed amongÅ¿t Å¿ome of the moÅ¿t zealous of them, and the moÅ¿t approved for integrity, and what I Å¿hall be able to prove, that I have without any Å¿pirit of bitterneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿pecified.</p>
               <p>And now according to my method propounded I will Å¿et down their AnÅ¿wers to what all of them have to Å¿ay to the Å¿everall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and parcells of the inÅ¿uing diÅ¿courÅ¿e concerning the gathering of Churches; onely in this I Å¿hall refer every cavill they make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t my Å¿everall quaeries and arguments to their right place; whereas I Å¿aid before, they had in a confuÅ¿ed and diÅ¿orderly way by Å¿natches anÅ¿wered to what they thought themÅ¿elves beÅ¿t able to deal with, eitherwholy paÅ¿Å¿ing by the main arguments with Å¿ilence, or Å¿lighting of them with contempt, wherein I Å¿hall in their due places diÅ¿cover their diÅ¿honeÅ¿t dealing.</p>
               <p>But before I come to my anÅ¿wer, I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire the Reader to hear, firÅ¿t what Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> Å¿ay concerning me about this Å¿econd queÅ¿tion.</p>
               <p>HanÅ¿erdoes <hi>words are theÅ¿e Page 14.</hi> And this queÅ¿tion <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> the Doctor brancheth into Å¿ix Quaries, wherein the judicious Reader may perceive the Doctor (through miÅ¿-information I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) hath miÅ¿taken the Å¿tating of the queÅ¿tion, which he partly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth. <hi>Thus Mr</hi> Knollys <hi>Å¿peaks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. S.</hi> his words are theÅ¿e Page 15, 16.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd queÅ¿tion, Å¿aith he, is of the manner of gathering of Churches and of admitting of Members and Officers propoÅ¿ed by him: <hi>1.</hi> in the Chaos it Å¿eemes. <hi>2.</hi> orderly, (as he Å¿uppoÅ¿es) drawn forth into Å¿ix Quaeries, though I dare not Å¿ay there is not interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, tautologie and great confuÅ¿ion. The nature in which the things are: <hi>viz.</hi> of Quarie, incourages me rather to do Å¿ome thing in them, for that I hope the Doctor will not be great of his own Å¿enÅ¿e, but take an AnÅ¿wer of theÅ¿e things from thoÅ¿e that know the way better then himÅ¿elfe, who it Å¿eems is but a Catechumenos therein. I Å¿hall here therefore indeavour to inÅ¿truct him inÅ¿tead of refuting him, for as much as to me it Å¿eems unmeet, that a man Å¿hould be polemically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿ed before he be poÅ¿itively principled. <hi>Thus Å¿peakes learned</hi> I. S.</p>
               <p>For my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> good opinion of me and his kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ions of his love towards me I Å¿hall in their places record them with my due thanks to him for the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:48122:301"/>
But whereas MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> accuÅ¿eth me of ignorance in the Å¿tating of the queÅ¿tion, and Å¿aith that <hi>I</hi> have partly acknowledged it, and conceives that this miÅ¿take in me aroÅ¿e from a miÅ¿-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: In all he Å¿aith he playes the vain man; for I am able to prove from their dayly practice all that I there Å¿et down, and know the queÅ¿tion as well as any Independent living, and can at any time make it appear that MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> knows not the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents principles. And Å¿o far as their New Lights have illuminated the world, Å¿o far I know of their wayes; and that I acknowledged and no other thing: But why did not Mr <hi>Knollys</hi> in this place, if <hi>I</hi> were miÅ¿taken, honeÅ¿tly Å¿hew me my error? And why did he not as beÅ¿eemed a ChriÅ¿tian and a man truly fearing God, now Å¿et down fully and plainly what their Way is that all men may know where to finde them? TheÅ¿e ungodly men are not Å¿o honeÅ¿t as to Å¿et down their way, and yet they pretend others are ignorant of it: when notwithÅ¿tanding they know it better then themÅ¿elves. In the Å¿ame Å¿teps of <hi>HanÅ¿erdo</hi> doth <hi>I. S</hi> tread <hi>in accuÅ¿ing me of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, tautologies and great confuÅ¿ion, and that I am great in mine own Å¿enÅ¿e, and that I am but a Cateshumenos, and that he knows the way better then my Å¿elfe, and that he will endeavour to instruct me instead of refuting me, for as much as to him it Å¿eems unmeet that a man Å¿hould be polemically exerciÅ¿ed before he be poÅ¿itively prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this wretched man tramples upon me for my ignorance, and vapours at no allowance of his own knowledge, and yet keeps not his promiÅ¿e with me, to inÅ¿truct mee, or to Å¿hew me my error, wherein he proclames himÅ¿elfe to be a very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy creature, that <hi>I</hi> Å¿ay no more: for it had been his duty to have ingenuouÅ¿ly here Å¿hewn unto me my failings if <hi>I</hi> were in ignorance, and to have truly and uprightly Å¿et down what their Way is (Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he affirmeth he knoweth it Å¿o well) that all men might at laÅ¿t be undeceived if in error. This <hi>I</hi> Å¿ay had been the part of a Å¿incere ChriÅ¿tian and one truly fearing God, in the number of the which <hi>I</hi> cannot think or beleeve <hi>I. S.</hi> to be Å¿o long as he fondly boaÅ¿teth of himÅ¿elfe and keepeth not his promiÅ¿e: and it is moÅ¿t apparently evident to all that have read his wicked Pamphlet that he is in the gall of bitterneÅ¿Å¿e and band of iniquity where they find nothing but brutiÅ¿h impiety and apparent ignorance: <hi>For he himÅ¿elfe, though a great teacher, knoweth not neither what he Å¿aith nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>
                  <pb n="470" facs="tcp:48122:302"/>
                  <hi>he affirmeth; who is as apparently neÅ¿cient as</hi> HanÅ¿erdo <hi>of the Independents Doctrine, and had need himÅ¿elfe to be poÅ¿itively prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled before he be polemically exerciÅ¿ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas <hi>J. S.</hi> accuÅ¿es me to be a <hi>Catechumenos</hi> in their principles. I will undertake this upon my life before the whole Kingdome to make it good, that I know the Independent way as well as any Independent in <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> farther undertake if the great Councel of the Kingdome Å¿hall call me and all the diÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Brethren before them, that <hi>I</hi> Å¿hall be better able in halfe a dayes Å¿pace to deliver in, what modell they would Å¿et up (if they will deal ingenuouÅ¿ly before God and the world and Å¿peak their conÅ¿cience) then they all put together Å¿hall be able to do; I may perhaps be thought Å¿omething preÅ¿umptuous; But <hi>J. S.</hi> his fond expreÅ¿Å¿ions makes me Å¿peak that I do, which notwithÅ¿tanding <hi>I</hi> Å¿till undertake to make good.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>I</hi> have not been miÅ¿-informed, there was one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way, and none of the meaneÅ¿t of them, hearing my brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿peaking very trivially of me, after he was gone out of his preÅ¿ence and paÅ¿Å¿ing a long with a friend of his and of the Å¿ame fraternity, much blamed my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> Å¿aying, that he had heard him Å¿peak as hyperbolically of me both for my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and honeÅ¿ty as ever he heard man Å¿peak of another, and added moreover, that though <hi>I</hi> differed from them in opinion, yet he conceived that <hi>I</hi> was the Å¿ame man Å¿till in all reÅ¿pects that <hi>I</hi> was when my brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿pake Å¿o well of me, and Å¿aid withall that he did verily beleeve, whatÅ¿oever MaÅ¿ter <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿pake in a vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner of me, that I was better acquainted with their Way then he himÅ¿elfe. And there will be no great difficulty if occaÅ¿ion Å¿erve to prove all that I now Å¿ay. And therefore <hi>J. S.</hi> playes the child to babble thus to me, who by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his might Å¿hall be able to confound ten thouÅ¿and Å¿uch as he is, and to teach both him and all his complices whether aÅ¿Å¿embled or not aÅ¿Å¿embled, that their tenents are moÅ¿t wicked and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And <hi>I</hi> hope that Å¿ucceeding ages will Å¿ay that God ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to be as good as my undertaking, for in his might <hi>I</hi> Å¿hall ever come out againÅ¿t all the Independents and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries.</p>
               <p>And now I come to anÅ¿wer to all their Replies to my <hi>Quaeries.</hi>

                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:48122:302"/>
And firÅ¿t whereas they babble about the generall Å¿tating of the queÅ¿tion and divide thoÅ¿e things that I had joyned together and made but one generall queÅ¿tion of, they Å¿hew themÅ¿elves but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers and not Å¿erious ChriÅ¿tians. For I never made any; doubt but that the MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pell may gather Churches for God in all ages Å¿ent his Prophets and MiniÅ¿ters for this very end to gather in the loÅ¿t Å¿heep of the houÅ¿e of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> and all Å¿uch as belong unto his election into his houÅ¿e; for <hi>I</hi> know that the ordinary way to bring men to the knowledge of God and of ChriÅ¿t, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿ts life eternall, is by the miniÅ¿terie of the GoÅ¿pel, this I Å¿ay is the ordinary meanes God uÅ¿es <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and this I have learned from the holy Scripture, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28.</p>
               <p>And therefore all the pudder that <hi>I. S.</hi> and my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> make with their grolliÅ¿h Interrogations about that buÅ¿ines is but to beate the ayre, and nothing to the purpoÅ¿e, and no anÅ¿wer to my <hi>Quere,</hi> as the Reader may well perceive, if hee lookes but backe to the <hi>question</hi> and firÅ¿t <hi>quere,</hi> neither can my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> or <hi>I. S.</hi> make it good by any one example out of the holy word of God, that the ordinary MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel, did ever leave their owne ordinary charges, to which they are called, and whereto they are fixed, with a command not to leave them, and that under a pretence of a new way, or new light did run about to gather converted men, from among converted men, and Å¿o picke out of other mens folds and flocks the beÅ¿t and fatteÅ¿t Å¿heepe, and molded them into Å¿everall Congregations and AÅ¿Å¿emblies, as Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diÅ¿tinct bodies and Churches from them, and who had no Church-fellowÅ¿hip with other Congregations, but were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent from them, and abÅ¿olute amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves: I Å¿ay and affirme, that neither my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> nor <hi>I. S.</hi> nor any predicant of the congregationall way can Å¿hew me any one PreÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this kind, either in the Old or New TeÅ¿tament; and this was the queÅ¿tion, whether there were any Å¿uch thing to be found in the Scripture; and not whether the MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel may gather Churches, as both <hi>J. S.</hi> and my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully make it. Now whereas in the 12. page hee compareth our Churches and Congregations with the PopiÅ¿h AÅ¿Å¿emblies, and Å¿aith, that they profeÅ¿Å¿e themÅ¿elves to be ChriÅ¿tians as well as the ProteÅ¿tants, and that their gathering of people out of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48122:303"/>
flocks is as tolerable as gathering them out of PopiÅ¿h Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hes and AÅ¿Å¿emblies; for this is the drift of his reaÅ¿on; hee dealeth moÅ¿t uncharitably, and unchriÅ¿tianly with his brethren; for hee himÅ¿elfe in his booke called <hi>Babell no Bethell,</hi> hath there by the helpe of learned <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Chemnicius,</hi> and other Orthodox Writers, proved that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is both Idolatricall and hereticall, and errs in the foundation, and that all the PapiÅ¿ts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dying in that their Faith and beleefe, are in the Å¿tate of damnation. So that they being conÅ¿idered in his notion, are as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and aliens from the common wealth of <hi>IÅ¿rael;</hi> and the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of churches out from amongÅ¿t the PapiÅ¿ts is to open their eyes and to turn them from darkneÅ¿Å¿e to light &amp; from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God, and as bringing men out of heatheniÅ¿h idolatry or from JewiÅ¿h obÅ¿tinacy, from the companies and congregations of the which all ChriÅ¿tians have an injunction to come out, they being commanded to come out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I Å¿ay in that my brother <hi>Burton</hi> compares all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian brethren in our congregations to the idolatrous PapiÅ¿ts, he Å¿heweth the uncharitable opinion he hath of us all, Å¿o that now it is no wonder that upon all occaÅ¿ions he proclames us all the enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdome. But bleÅ¿Å¿ed be God, <hi>We beleeve that through the grace of our Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t we Å¿hall be Å¿aved</hi> as well as any Independents think they Å¿hall be Å¿aved <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Seeing God hath put no difference between us &amp; them puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our hearts by Faith.</hi> And therefore he deals very unchriÅ¿tianly &amp; unbrotherly with us to compare us to the PapiÅ¿ts, eÅ¿pecially when according to our Covenant our PariÅ¿hes and Churches are purged both of the Service Book &amp; Hierarchy and all PopiÅ¿h SuperÅ¿tition, as he himÅ¿elf acknowledgeth in the 13. <hi>page</hi> of his uncharitable Pamphles: and therefore this his inÅ¿tance of gathering Churches out of our congregations who beleeve in God as well as they<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wers not to the queÅ¿tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for his other inÅ¿tance in the 13. Page,</hi> Where he asks me if I know not that the ancient Church of the Jews was then a Church when the ApoÅ¿tles by their preaching gathered a Church out of it? a Christian Church out of the IewiÅ¿h Synagogues?</p>
               <p>For AnÅ¿wer, I Å¿ay firÅ¿t, that I well Å¿ee (and that without Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles) that by theÅ¿e Å¿tones he hurls at all his brethren, and caÅ¿ts up duÅ¿t yea dirt thus in their faces (to uÅ¿urp his own expreÅ¿Å¿ion) <hi>pa.</hi> 13.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48122:303"/>
that he Å¿hews his want of love and charity to us, comparing our congregations and Churches at every turn to the PopiÅ¿h and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿h Synagogues, and eÅ¿teeming of the gathering out of people from amongÅ¿t us, to be the Å¿ame with gathering men and women from out of their Idolatricall and JewiÅ¿h AÅ¿Å¿emblies: for why otherwiÅ¿e if this be not his meaning, doth he bring his inÅ¿tances from both the PapiÅ¿ts and the Jews at every turn? and therefore for his Å¿o dealing, in the firÅ¿t place I anÅ¿wer, that he is very injurious to his Brethren and muÅ¿t Å¿eriouÅ¿ly repent for this uncharitable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>But Å¿econdly, I anÅ¿wer that my brother <hi>Burton</hi> is much miÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: for the ApoÅ¿tles did not gather ChriÅ¿tian Churches out of the JewiÅ¿h Synagogues, as we may Å¿ee in the Å¿econd of <hi>Iames</hi> and through the whole Å¿tory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where we finde that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles in all their peregrinations ever frequented the Synagogues and preached unto them there, and our Saviour himÅ¿elfe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding all the Å¿candalls in that Church and all their traditions, preached daily in the Temple and in their Synagogues, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture relates; yea and the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves after ChriÅ¿ts reÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection preached dayly in the Temple and in all Synagogues wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever they journyed; yea ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe commanded all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, the whole multitude with his own DiÅ¿ciples and ApoÅ¿tles to hear the PhariÅ¿ees <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2.

               <p>But Å¿econdly, I anÅ¿wer that God hath no where injoyned or required that thoÅ¿e that either are to be made ChriÅ¿tians, or to be admitted into Church fellowÅ¿hip Å¿hould either know the faces of all the Members of the congregation, or Å¿hould be particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the whole church that he is to be admitted a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

of: For we have no warrant for Å¿uch practice in the whole Scripture, neither is there any example of it from one end of the Bible to the other; and therefore it is meer Will-WorÅ¿hip and a Å¿erving of God after the commandments of men, which is Å¿o often condemned in holy Scripture, as <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi> 29. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. <hi>ColoÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 2. and therfore ought to be abhorred as an intolerable yoke of bondage, <hi>which neither we nor our forefathers could bear</hi> Acts 15. <hi>Whereas ChriÅ¿ts yoke is eaÅ¿ie and light, and they that take his yoke vpon them finde reÅ¿t unto their Å¿oules</hi> Matth. 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29, 30. who Å¿aith unto his people, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you reÅ¿t.</hi> He doth not Å¿ay, <hi>If you will come to me and be admitted into church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> fellowÅ¿hip, you must firÅ¿t walk Å¿ometime with my people and be acquainted with them;</hi> I Å¿ay ChriÅ¿t the King of his church hath given no Å¿uch command either to thoÅ¿e that are to be admitted or to his MiniÅ¿ters and Å¿tewards of his houÅ¿e which is his church of any Å¿uch practice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I anÅ¿wer that as there is an impoÅ¿Å¿ibility almoÅ¿t for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man or woman to be acquainted with a whole Church, Å¿o it is neither neceÅ¿Å¿ary nor uÅ¿efull: For that knowledge that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿alvation and for the making of any fit to be church Members, conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in theÅ¿e things, <hi>that they repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and be baptized, and that they Å¿hould know the onely true God and whom he hath Å¿ent, JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> John 17. And this is the firÅ¿t thing abÅ¿olutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿alvation which is required of all Å¿uch as will be ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd thing is, <hi>the knowledge of our Å¿elves, which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in Å¿elf-denyall and regeneration,</hi> For <hi>if any will be ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they muÅ¿t deny themÅ¿elves and take up his croÅ¿Å¿e dayly;</hi> For Å¿o Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t our King <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. And again <hi>John</hi> 3. ver. 3. ChriÅ¿t Å¿peaking unto <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Å¿aith to him and in him to all men, <hi>Except a man be born again he cannot Å¿ee the Kingdome of God</hi> ver. 5. <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Å¿pirit he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdome of God: He muÅ¿t be a new creature,</hi> Å¿aith he. And this is the knowledge that ChriÅ¿t the King of his church requires as neceÅ¿Å¿ary for their Å¿alvation, Å¿o for their admiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion into church fellowÅ¿hip, and he that has theÅ¿e qualifications has as much as ChriÅ¿t requires; and there is no need of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or familiar acquaintance with all thoÅ¿e of the congregation or with the whole church or that they Å¿hould walk Å¿ome time with
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:48122:308"/>
them, therefore it is wickedly done in all thoÅ¿e of the congregational way to impoÅ¿e laws of their own making upon the people of God their brethren who are a free people: and therefore they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire to Å¿erve their King <hi>ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us</hi> and to hear and obey his voice only, ought to deteÅ¿t all theÅ¿e falÅ¿e teachers that would Å¿o inthrall them, eÅ¿pecially they ought to abominate their practices becauÅ¿e they make theÅ¿e their traditions <hi>Gods Ordinances.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But whereas my brother</hi> Burton <hi>Å¿aith that</hi> abundans cautela non nocet, <hi>and</hi> that they look not Å¿o much at circumÅ¿tances in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, as the Å¿ubÅ¿tance.</p>
               <p>I affirme it is a moÅ¿t arrogant expreÅ¿Å¿ion in any Å¿o to Å¿peak; for in his thus Å¿peaking, <hi>he makes as if it were in the power of poor mortall creatures to Å¿earch mens hearts and judge of the Å¿ecrets of the Å¿ame which is onely Gods peculiar:</hi> but that is not all, but in this his expreÅ¿Å¿ion there is a high Å¿train of confidence in the man that he will Å¿eem to be wiÅ¿er then <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> himÅ¿elfe that was <hi>the King and Lawgiver of his Church and the mighty Councellour;</hi> and yet he gave no precept for this <hi>abundans cautela:</hi> and yet it is moÅ¿t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>that he revealed the whole will of his Father, and his DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alÅ¿o delivered unto the church the whole counÅ¿ell of God</hi> Act. 21. And yet neither <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> nor his ApoÅ¿tles did ever deliver this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of walking with the church Å¿ometime, nor never Å¿pake of this <hi>abundans cautela;</hi> therefore I gather it is neither part of the will or councell of God that they injoyn this walking upon his people: therefore all the true Å¿ubjects of JeÅ¿us <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> and all his leige people ought to abominate and abhorre all Å¿uch uÅ¿urpers as my<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and his complices are, <hi>that trample down the Laws of ChriÅ¿t our King and impoÅ¿e their own inventions and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon his people for Christs Ordinances and Statutes.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here the Lord the King of his Church gives free admittance to all his Å¿ubjects and Å¿ervants to come into his Kingdom and houÅ¿e; but here is my Lord <hi>Taps</hi> his Chaplaine and his aÅ¿Å¿ociats, and they all take upon them this power and authority, that except it be by their good leave &amp; liking, they Å¿hall not be admitted into the houÅ¿e of God; for they have a charge over that houÅ¿e, and an intereÅ¿t alÅ¿o; theÅ¿e are <hi>I.

               <p>Now I do here againe appeale to any that have but any ordinary underÅ¿tanding, whether there was ever Å¿uch a Å¿upercilious brood of creatures in the world before theÅ¿e Ill-dependents were hatcht that can thus trample all the Lawes of ChriÅ¿t under their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted feet, and yet pretend they onely Å¿et him up upon his Throne, when notwithÅ¿tanding it is apparently evident, they practiÅ¿e the contrary, and violate all his moÅ¿t holy Statutes, and preferre their owne traditions before his commandements, as this is one of judging their Brethren, and not admitting of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ChriÅ¿ts Church and houÅ¿e, without the conÅ¿ent of the whole Church, when ChriÅ¿t nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e hath enacted Å¿o many Lawes to the contrary.</p>

                  <hi>of Church-communion; and this is to thoÅ¿e onely, that having uÅ¿od to walke without a yoake, as the Scripture cals Å¿onnes of</hi> Beliall, <hi>love not to come under the yoake of ChriÅ¿t, then which to a willing bearer nothing is more eaÅ¿ie and Å¿weet.</hi> I expected from my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> eÅ¿pecially, who talkes Å¿o much of Å¿etting up <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> upon his Throne, as hee counts all men enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, <hi>and Converts but in part, when they come not up cloÅ¿e to the rule of Reformation, Gods Word;</hi> for thus my brother Å¿peaks, page 18. I Å¿ay I expected from him, that hee Å¿hould have ratified their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in admitting of their Members by a particular explicite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant from the Word of God, and from either Å¿ome command, or Å¿ome example, both which when this their practice wanteth, it can not be of faith, and therefore is Å¿infull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I deÅ¿ire the Reader to obÅ¿erve Å¿ome particulars in my brother</hi> Burtons <hi>expreÅ¿Å¿ions, not to Å¿hew the vanity, Å¿inne and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneÅ¿Å¿e of them all, for that would require a tractate by it Å¿elfe. But firÅ¿t; I pray obÅ¿erve,</hi> the very name <hi>(Å¿aith hee)</hi> of a covenant is become a Bug-beare to many, <hi>that is to Å¿ay</hi> a terrour againe a few lines, <hi>after he Å¿aith,</hi> that it is not the name of a covenant that is Å¿o ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, but the order of Church-communion. <hi>Here I leave my Brother</hi> Burton <hi>to reconcile his owne contradiction,</hi> the very name of a Covenant <hi>(Å¿aith hee)</hi> is a Bug-beare, and it is not the name of a covenant that is Å¿o terrible.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee acknowledges that this covenant is a yoake, and Å¿o it is indeed; but withall it is worthy of obÅ¿ervation, hee cals it ChriÅ¿ts yoake, and yet it was never impoÅ¿ed upon the people of God by ChriÅ¿ts command, nor was it appointed by him: Å¿o that whatÅ¿oever they bring into the church upon their owne braines they impoÅ¿e it upon the people as one of Gods Ordinances, which is an inÅ¿ufferable inÅ¿olencie in theÅ¿e men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> accounteth of all Å¿uch as will not Å¿ubmit it themÅ¿elves to their government, and goe in their church way to receive or take their covenant, <hi>to be the Å¿onnes of</hi> Belial, <hi>and not under ChriÅ¿ts yoake;</hi> theÅ¿e are his words, page 14.

                  <hi>is not of faith is Å¿inne,</hi> and whatÅ¿oever is not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Word, all men know is not of faith, which when their Church practiÅ¿eth without it, it is moÅ¿t apparent that they are in a Å¿infull way, and therefore are rather the Å¿onnes of <hi>Belial</hi> then wee.

               <p>

               <p>AnÅ¿w. <hi>I know not</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>why it Å¿hould be more incove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient then a publicke nationall Covenant.

But as I Å¿aid before, Å¿o I Å¿ay now again, that ChriÅ¿tians are to Å¿wear fealty onely to their King and Lord ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, who is their husband, and who is the onely MaÅ¿ter of his own HouÅ¿e and Church, and whoÅ¿e voice is onely to be heard, and whoÅ¿e Laws are onely to be obeyed and liÅ¿tned unto; &amp; we Å¿wear no allegiance or fealty to the Church, for we are all his Å¿ervants &amp; domeÅ¿ticks, and have no authority one over another, to impoÅ¿e Laws upon each other, or to enter in to any covenants amongÅ¿t our Å¿elves, without a Å¿pecial command from ChriÅ¿t: And as when Stewards of Princes or Noblemen, take any in to their maÅ¿ters families, they Å¿wear them onely to their lords
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:48122:312"/>
and maÅ¿ters; we never hear that the Å¿ervants enter into any cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant among themÅ¿elves, or joyn or unite themÅ¿elves in covenant one to cleave unto another: Such proceedings amongÅ¿t Å¿ervants would never be allowed or tolerated amongÅ¿t men, it would be thought rather a conÅ¿piracy or a confederation to do miÅ¿cheif, if they Å¿hould attempt Å¿uch a thing. As when thoÅ¿e men enterd in to a covenant amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed <hi>Paul;</hi> yea, it hath ever been obÅ¿erved in all countreys, That when Å¿ervants began once to combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to joyn themÅ¿elves by Å¿ecret covenants, they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes plotted miÅ¿cheif, and therefore there hath been Å¿pecial care uÅ¿ed to prevent Å¿uch conÅ¿piracies. And all men may well perceive by this their covenanting in their new gathered Churches, what it tends to, if God of his infinite goodneÅ¿Å¿e prevents not their deÅ¿igne: Therefore, I Å¿ay, we being ChriÅ¿ts domeÅ¿ticks and his Church, and being his houÅ¿e, and he being the onely Lord of it, and our King, we are to Å¿mite our covenant onely with him, and to Å¿wear fealty and obedience to him onely, and his Laws, and we are not to be the Å¿ervants of men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. And therefore the Lord Å¿aith in <hi>Malachi</hi> the firÅ¿t, <hi>If I be a father, where is my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; if I be a Lord, where is my honor?</hi> How is it that ye obey me not? We are onely therefore to obey his voice, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the traditions of men, or to Å¿erve God after the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men: Now then, when the Independents impoÅ¿e this their covenant upon the people as a part of Gods worÅ¿hip, and will not admit of any into their new Churches, without entering in to this conÅ¿piracy; I Å¿ay, by all their proceedings in as much as in them lies, they diÅ¿-throne ChriÅ¿t in preferring their own laws before his; wherein they commit a deteÅ¿table wickedneÅ¿Å¿e.

choiceÅ¿t ones, to my knowledge the women had their voices both for the receiving in of members, and for the caÅ¿ting of them out upon any Å¿candal; Å¿o that there were none admitted, either men or women, though of never Å¿o great rank and quality, without the leave and good liking of the women; Å¿o that if at any time they oppoÅ¿ed the entrance of any, though it were but upon meer jealouÅ¿ies that they were not godly, they could not be admitted members of thoÅ¿e Congregations: But it Å¿eems they are now aÅ¿hamed of this their practice, and therefore plead ignorance in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e. But that the world may Å¿ee I write nothing in my firÅ¿t Book concerning womens voting of it in Churches, I Å¿hall recite Å¿ome two or three Å¿tories, omitting many to prove their practices in thoÅ¿e dayes. And what I Å¿hall relate, and much more I undertake to prove by Å¿ufficient witneÅ¿Å¿es whenÅ¿oever the Independents Å¿hall put me upon it. And withall I Å¿hall make it appear, there was never greater juggling then hath been amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e of the Congregational-way, in admitting of members.</p>
               <p>The Å¿tories briefly are theÅ¿e: A Gentlewoman of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance coming up to <hi>London,</hi> Å¿ince theÅ¿e <hi>New Lights</hi> broke out, was Å¿o infatuated with them, that Å¿hee had a great deÅ¿ire to joyne her Å¿elfe to one of the prime Churches of the congregationall way, concerning the which Gentlewoman I can Å¿ay thus much upon my owne experience, and it can be proved by many, that whatÅ¿oever Å¿hee is now, before Å¿hee became an Independent, Å¿he was a woman not onely of an emaculate life and converÅ¿ation, but a woman of Å¿ingular piety and charity towards all to her ability, and who ordinarily twice or thrice a week was wont to Å¿et dayes apart in private to Å¿eeke God, and to humble her Å¿elfe by faÅ¿ting and prayer, and this was her conÅ¿tant courÅ¿e of life. Yet this woman aÅ¿Å¿aying to joyne her Å¿elfe unto theÅ¿e new diÅ¿ciples, and being to make the confeÅ¿Å¿ion of her faith before the congregation, and to bring in the evidences of her converÅ¿ion, Å¿hee not having had many moneths acquaintance with them, and having not wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with them above halfe a yeare, or there-abouts, was forced the better to make the Church underÅ¿tand the worke of grace wrought in her heart, to recite unto them her courÅ¿e of life, how Å¿hee had conÅ¿tantly walked with God, and what communion Å¿he had with him, Å¿ignifying with all that Å¿hee had ever loved the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48122:313"/>
Saints and brethren, a Å¿ufficient token of converÅ¿ion, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of ChriÅ¿ts diÅ¿ciples, if either ChriÅ¿ts owne teÅ¿timonie or Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> may be beleeved. Yet when Å¿hee had made an end of her confeÅ¿Å¿ion of her faith, and produced her evidences, a Wench roÅ¿e up in the Congregation, and profeÅ¿t before them all that Å¿hee was not Å¿atisfied with her evidences that Å¿hee was a beleever, for as much as the PhariÅ¿ees for all outward performances could Å¿ay as much as Å¿hee did, or uÅ¿ed words to this effect. Vpon which the Church could not admit her, for the Å¿iÅ¿ter was not Å¿atisfied: So that the Gentlewoman Å¿ince joyned her Å¿elfe to another Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>An other preÅ¿ident is of a young man, reputed amongÅ¿t his neighbours very godly, who being much inamoured with the new way of Church-fellowÅ¿hip, aÅ¿Å¿ayed to joyne himÅ¿elfe to one of their congregations, not that I Å¿pake of before, and being to make his confeÅ¿Å¿ion, and to bring in his evidences, and having to Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Church, done as much as they injoyned him to doe, two of the women in that AÅ¿Å¿embly oppoÅ¿ed his admiÅ¿Å¿ion; Å¿o that without their good liking hee could not be admitted a Member, and hee applying himÅ¿elfe unto their PaÅ¿tor, and to the Elders gave many Å¿ignes of his true converÅ¿ion, Å¿o that they related unto him that for their parts they had nothing to Å¿ay to him in way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition, but wiÅ¿ht him to apply himÅ¿elfe to thoÅ¿e Å¿iÅ¿ters, telling him, that without their conÅ¿ent they could not admit him into Church-fellowÅ¿hip, whereupon hee makes his addreÅ¿Å¿es to them, and Å¿ometimes hee courted them for their favour, Å¿ometime hee expoÅ¿tulated with them, deÅ¿iring to know their reaÅ¿ons why they were Å¿o adverÅ¿e to him, and would not grant their conÅ¿ents, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of them if they knew any thing by his converÅ¿ation, and they replyed, no, but they could not beleeve he was godly and Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and fit for Church fellowÅ¿hip; and whether or no hee was ever admitted in that Congregation, I know not; but at that time hee could not be admitted, and for no other reaÅ¿on that can be given, but that the Å¿iÅ¿ters did not give their conÅ¿ents, and they could alleage no other ground of their not agreeing to his admiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, but that they conceived he was not godly.</p>
               <p>The third Storie is of one that was reputed a very honeÅ¿t and godly man amongÅ¿t all his acquaintance, and who had alÅ¿o wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Å¿ometime amongÅ¿t them in one of their new congregations,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:48122:314"/>
and earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ired to be admitted a joyned Member, and hee bringing in his evidences, and making the confeÅ¿Å¿ion of his faith, Å¿atisfactory enough to many of the Church, for the proving of himÅ¿elfe fit for Member-Å¿hip, a married woman roÅ¿e up in the congregation, and profeÅ¿t before them all Å¿he could not beleeve he was fit tobe admitted as a Member of that church, and uÅ¿ed Å¿ome triviall reaÅ¿ons, for her not aÅ¿Å¿enting to his admÅ¿Å¿ion, and for that time hee could not be received into the congregation, having not given the good Å¿iÅ¿ter plenary Å¿atisfaction; and whether hee be yet received into church-fellowÅ¿hip, I know not, but that he was by the woman at that time put off, that I Å¿hall be able to prove, with the other two Stories, and be able likewiÅ¿e to produce many Å¿uch PreÅ¿idents more. Now I referre this to any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding mans judgement, whether the Keyes in many of the new gathered churches be not tyed unto the womens Girdles, and whether my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> are alwayes to be credited, either in their denials or affirmations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿pake of the fifth</hi> querie. <hi>And now I come to the Å¿ixth and laÅ¿t</hi> querie, viz. Whether the practiÅ¿ing and preaching of all theÅ¿e things, &amp;c. be to Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t as King upon his Throne? <hi>to the which</hi> querie <hi>my Brother</hi> Burton, <hi>and</hi> I. S. <hi>anÅ¿wer as two Jugglers, nothing to the purpoÅ¿e. My Brother</hi> Burtons <hi>words are theÅ¿e, page 19</hi> ThoÅ¿e Churches <hi>(Å¿aith hee)</hi> that are for matter and forme true Churches, and are governed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ChriÅ¿ts Word, doe Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t as King upon his Throne: and for Å¿uch as are otherwiÅ¿e, let them conÅ¿ider whether they doe as they ought, Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t as King upon his Throne.</p>
               <p>This is my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> anÅ¿wer to my Å¿ixt <hi>querie.</hi> Now whether this be a direct anÅ¿wer to my <hi>querie,</hi> I leave it to the judgement of the Learned. But from this his anÅ¿wer I may boldly conclude, that their new congregations doe not Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t as King upon his Throne, they fayling both for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forme of true churches, and being not governed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God; all which I have Å¿ufficiently proved in my foregoing DiÅ¿courÅ¿e. As for <hi>J. S.</hi> hee anÅ¿wers nothing to the queÅ¿tion, as all that Å¿hall reade his words may well perceive, which are theÅ¿e. <hi>I anÅ¿wer,</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>no queÅ¿tion but the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and purifying of Church Ordinances and FellowÅ¿hip, which Å¿ome contend for, is to Å¿et ChriÅ¿t upon a higher Throne viÅ¿ible to the</hi>

                  <hi>world, then by Å¿ome other wayes hee is,</hi> &amp;c. Now w hether this be a Å¿atisfactory anÅ¿wer to the <hi>querie,</hi> I leave it to others to judge of, but from his words I thus argue; Where ChriÅ¿ts Ordinances and Church-fellowÅ¿hip are polluted, there ChriÅ¿t is not Å¿et up upon his Throne; but in all the new congregations ChriÅ¿ts Ordinances are polluted, and Church-fellowÅ¿hip contaminated, as I have Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ChriÅ¿t is not Å¿et up there on his Throne. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿pake by way of anÅ¿wer to all they had to Å¿ay to my <hi>queries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now I Å¿hall Å¿et down Gods method, and the ApoÅ¿tles practice in gathering of churches, and the manner they uÅ¿ed in making Members in every Church, and compare it with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod our brethren the Independents uÅ¿e in gathering of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, that all men may the better diÅ¿cerne truth from error, and may all be undeceived in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿o great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I will firÅ¿t begin with ChriÅ¿ts CommiÅ¿Å¿ion given to his ApoÅ¿tles, and in them to all MiniÅ¿ters, and then conÅ¿ider the practice of <hi>Iohn</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, and of all the ApoÅ¿tles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters in the Primitive Church and the order that God himÅ¿elfe uÅ¿ed for the gathering of thoÅ¿e that belong unto his election, and for the congregating of the loÅ¿t Å¿heep of the houÅ¿e of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fold of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, who is that great Shepherd and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hop of our Å¿oules; and I conceive that Gods order and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles practice is rather to be followed then any other new found way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to begin with ChriÅ¿ts CommiÅ¿Å¿ion to his ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> Matth. <hi>21.</hi> verÅ¿e <hi>19, 20.</hi> Go ye therefore, <hi>Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them, In the Name of the Father, Sonne and holy GhoÅ¿t; teaching them to obÅ¿erve all things whatÅ¿oever I command you; and lo! I am with you even to the end of the World, Amen. <hi>And in the 16. of</hi> Marke verÅ¿e <hi>15, 16.

               <p>Out of theÅ¿e Å¿everall places, from the CommiÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿t given to his bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles, and to all MiniÅ¿ters and Preachers of the GoÅ¿pell to the end of the World: here obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e things.</p>

               <p>Now before I come to my third obÅ¿ervation out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion given to the ApoÅ¿tles, I muÅ¿t wait here a little upon the motions of my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> pen which as it marches along, makes now and then Å¿ome whibling incurÅ¿ions into my quarters; and therefore that all men may Å¿ee my forces are ever in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and that I am alwayes willing to fight him whereÅ¿oever I meet him, and that my brother <hi>Burton</hi> alÅ¿o may Å¿ee how ready I am to gratifie his deÅ¿ire, who Page 7. Å¿aith, <hi>Come on brother, let you and I try it out by the dint of this Sword.</hi> I will here skirmiÅ¿h a little with him to breath him, and then go after him; in the 15. Page of his book he puts me upon the reconciling of a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he conceives I made: For Å¿aith he, Page 101. of your book, <hi>you Å¿ay, The ApoÅ¿tles and other MiniÅ¿ters of the Gospel were to receive all Å¿uch as beleeved and were baptized, and that upon the pr ofeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith and repentance without any further teÅ¿timony of others, unleÅ¿Å¿e they had been formerly known to be open enemies, and then they were juÅ¿tly to be Å¿uÅ¿pected, till they had given publique evidence by witneÅ¿Å¿e to the ApoÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters of their true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ion as concerning</hi> Paul. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Now here <hi>(Å¿aith my brother</hi> Burton) I obÅ¿erve.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, a notable contradiction to what you Å¿ay <hi>Page 115.</hi> As Gods command to all MiniÅ¿ters was that they Å¿hould admit all Å¿uch into the Church, as beleeved and were baptized upon their deÅ¿iring it, without any confeÅ¿Å¿ion either private or publike. Here <hi>(Å¿aith my brother</hi> Burton) I leave you to reconcile your own contradiction, upon their profeÅ¿Å¿ion and without any confeÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
               <p>For AnÅ¿wer, I aÅ¿Å¿ert that my words are Å¿o far from <hi>a notable contradiction</hi> to any men that know what a contradiction is, that there is not at all Å¿o much as a very Å¿imilitude of a contradiction in them: For what contradiction I pray is there in theÅ¿e expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions? <hi>The MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pell are to receive all Å¿uch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and are baptized, and that upon the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith and repentance, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods command to all MiniÅ¿ters, is, that they Å¿hall admit all Å¿uch into the Church as beleeve and are baptized upon their deÅ¿iring it without any confeÅ¿Å¿ion &amp;c. <hi>Here as all the world may Å¿ee is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:48122:316"/>
                  <hi>But if I had in thoÅ¿e places expreÅ¿Å¿ed my Å¿elfe thus:</hi> viz. the MiniÅ¿ters of the Gospell are to admit none into the Church but upon their publike confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith.</p>
               <p>And in the Å¿econd place if I had Å¿aid, <hi>God commands all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters to admit all Å¿uch into the Church as beleeve and are baptized, without any confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith.</hi> Then my brother <hi>Burton</hi> might have had a poor occaÅ¿ion of making obÅ¿ervations; but if upon a conceipt of Å¿o Å¿mall a thing as a contradiction, he will call for the attention of the whole world, and cry out a <hi>notable contradiction!</hi> how would this man vapor if he could get Å¿ome great advantage againÅ¿t me? without doubt he would cry <hi>Victoria Victoria.</hi> I do beleeve that Saint <hi>CretenÅ¿is</hi> would not more radomontadoe it over even to be honoured MaÅ¿ter <hi>Edwards</hi> then he would over me: But as I Å¿aid before and as all the judicious wil obÅ¿erve, there is no contradiction in thoÅ¿e two expreÅ¿Å¿ions; for to deÅ¿cribe one and the Å¿ame thing in a various manner, is no contradiction, which as the learned know<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in denying and affirming of one and the Å¿ame thing, which the Å¿aying, <hi>upon their profeÅ¿Å¿ion, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confeÅ¿Å¿ion,</hi> does not; <hi>for profeÅ¿Å¿ion is one thing, and confeÅ¿Å¿ion is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> they are two diÅ¿tinct things; and therefore there was no denying and affirming of one and the Å¿ame thing; and therefore no contradiction. But by Å¿uch triflings as theÅ¿e are, my brother <hi>Burton, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

S.</hi> and <hi>HanÅ¿erdo Knollys,</hi> like thoÅ¿e <hi>evill workers</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaks of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. whom he commands all ChriÅ¿tians <hi>to beware of,</hi> they Å¿quander away their pretious time to delude and deceive the ignorant people, whereas they might better by far imploy themÅ¿elves if they were all now this hot weather in the Butchers Å¿hambles a killing of flyes. And this Å¿hall Å¿erve in way of AnÅ¿wer to his firÅ¿t obÅ¿ervation of <hi>a notable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I come to his other obÅ¿ervation in the Å¿ame page, but to what it hath relation I know not<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor how he brings it in to be an anÅ¿wer nor what he intends by it: for the man is very rambling, but thus he Å¿peaketh there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly Å¿aith he,</hi> I anÅ¿wer, that in theÅ¿e dayes of profeÅ¿Å¿ed and covenanted for Reformation, there is required the profeÅ¿Å¿ion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿sion of one Å¿peciall point of faith (which in words none dare, but in practice moÅ¿t do deny) touching ChriÅ¿ts Kingly office and his abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Å¿ole Å¿overaignty, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:48122:316"/>
Thus he there expatiates, but againÅ¿t whom or what he makes that anÅ¿wer I know not: For thus much I can Å¿ay in the behalfe of all the godly and learned Presbyterians there are no men upon the earth that more endeavour both in word and deed to profeÅ¿Å¿e and confeÅ¿Å¿e that Å¿peciall point of faith <hi>touching ChriÅ¿ts Kingly office and his abÅ¿olute Å¿overaignty</hi> (as by all their practices they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare) then they, as all their learned Sermons and Writings can witneÅ¿Å¿e: and on the other Å¿ide concerning all the Illdependents and Sectaries I can truly Å¿ay thus much, that never any people made a greater noiÅ¿e in words of advanceing ChriÅ¿t and Å¿etting him up naked upon his Throne (for Å¿o they Å¿peak) then they do, and yet never did any people more diÅ¿honour him or diÅ¿throne him then they, as in the foregoing diÅ¿courÅ¿e I have Å¿ufficiently proved. And therefore if this his Å¿econd AnÅ¿wer concerns any, it belongs to the Independents, and it highly indeed concerns them all, to conÅ¿ider their erroneous wayes and now at laÅ¿t to Å¿eek after the wayes of <hi>Truth, Peace</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and not thus with their tongues and penns to Å¿et the whole world on fire and then to warm and heat themÅ¿elvs by the light of it, like thoÅ¿e that danced about their calfe, <hi>who did eat and drink and roÅ¿e up to play.</hi> And this Å¿hall Å¿erve for anÅ¿wer to that.</p>
               <p>And Å¿o now I go on to my third obÅ¿ervation out of the ApoÅ¿tles CommiÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
               <p>The third thing we may obÅ¿erve, is, that this commiÅ¿sion was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only to the ApoÅ¿tles and Ministers of the Gospel, and that it was their place only, who had the Keys delivered unto them to open and Å¿hut the doors of the Church, to admit Å¿uch as they thought for their faith, knowledge and repentance were Å¿ufficiently qualified and fitted to be made Members; and to refuÅ¿e Å¿uch as they conceived not fit to be received into the fellowÅ¿hip of the Church, either for their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or other Å¿ins and offences, and to caÅ¿t Å¿uch out of the Church, as through their malverÅ¿ation declared themÅ¿elvs to be no beleevers: for the commiÅ¿sion was only delivered unto the ApoÅ¿tles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters, <hi>that they Å¿hould admit whoÅ¿oever beleeved and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;</hi> and they that beleeved not and would not be baptized, were not to be admitted. This CommiÅ¿sion I affirme, was only given to the ApoÅ¿tles and Ministers, and it was and is that office that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly belongeth unto them.</p>
               <p>And if we looke into the method of Gods dealing with his
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:48122:317"/>
Church in all ages, under the Law and under the GoÅ¿pell, both for the admitting of any into the Church as Members and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or the caÅ¿ting out of any; and to all the practice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and PrieÅ¿ts of the Old TeÅ¿tament, or the practice of <hi>John</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t and the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles in the time of the New TeÅ¿tament; we Å¿hall finde, that they that were admitted into the Å¿ociety and fellowÅ¿hip of the Church, were by the MiniÅ¿ters onely under both the TeÅ¿taments received, and to them the people by God himÅ¿elfe were Å¿ent, and they Å¿ent unto the people for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="500-610" type="pages">
               <p>And for proofe of this I now Å¿ay, I will firÅ¿t begin with the Old TeÅ¿tament, a few teÅ¿timonies of the which may Å¿erve for the confirmation of that truth, as that of <hi>Malachi</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>And ye Å¿hall know that I have Å¿ent this my commandement unto you, that my covenant might be with</hi> Levy, <hi>Å¿aith the Lord of hoÅ¿ts. My covenant was with him of life and peace, and I gave them to him, for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my Name. The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips, he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity; for the PrieÅ¿ts lips Å¿hall keep know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and they Å¿hall Å¿eek the Law at his mouth; for he is the MeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿enger or Angel of the Lord of hoÅ¿ts.</hi> A Å¿ufficient teÅ¿timony to prove, that the MiniÅ¿ters onely under the Old TeÅ¿tament had the power given them of admitting of any into the fellowÅ¿hip and communion of the Church, and that all the people were directed to them as the MeÅ¿Å¿engers and Angels of the Lord of hoÅ¿ts, if they deÅ¿ired to be admitted into the Church. And Å¿o <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel,</hi> as we read in the firÅ¿t chapters of both their PropheÅ¿ies, and the Å¿ame may be Å¿aid of all the Prophets, they were Å¿ent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people. The people were to be directed by them, and the Prophets and PrieÅ¿ts onely had that power delegated unto them, of proclaming both mercies and judgements, and of receiving into the Church Å¿uch as Å¿hould come unto them. And under the New TeÅ¿tament, in the third of <hi>Matthew,</hi> we finde <hi>IeruÅ¿alem and all Iudea, and all the regions round about IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> going out to <hi>Iohn the Baptist, and were baptized of him,</hi> and admitted into the Church by him alone, without the people; and the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of his Preaching, with his manner of admitting of members into the Church, and the conditions upon which he received them, and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:48122:317"/>
what the people did before their admiÅ¿Å¿ion, is all fully Å¿et down in the third of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the Å¿eventh. And for the Å¿um of his Preaching, it is Å¿aid, verÅ¿e the third, That it was <hi>the baptiÅ¿m of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the remiÅ¿sion of Å¿ins.</hi> And for thoÅ¿e that came unto him, as the common people, the Publicans and the Souldiers, they all ask <hi>Iohn</hi> what they Å¿hould do? And after he had inÅ¿truct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Å¿everally their duties, and told them upon what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they might be admitted, it is Å¿aid in the Å¿eventh of <hi>Luke</hi> VerÅ¿e 29. <hi>That all the people that heard him, and the Publicans juÅ¿tified God, being baptized with the BaptiÅ¿m of</hi> John: <hi>But the PhariÅ¿ees and the Lawyers rejected the counÅ¿el of God againÅ¿t them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, being not baptized of him,</hi> VerÅ¿e 30. So that by ChriÅ¿ts own teÅ¿timony (the PhariÅ¿ees and Lawyers onely excepted) all that came to him were baptized and admitted into the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conÅ¿ent of the people. And Å¿o we finde in the GoÅ¿pel of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> chap. 3. 4. yea, through the whole Book, That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple every where made their addreÅ¿Å¿es to <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> and to ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles onely; and that as many as came to ChriÅ¿t unfainedly, were received by him, and his ApoÅ¿tles; and none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the offer of themÅ¿elves, if they accepted of the conditions and were baptized, were ever refuÅ¿ed. And we finde further, that when our Saviour had at any time clenÅ¿ed and cured the Lepers, he Å¿ent them to the PrieÅ¿ts, for to be admitted by them into the communion of the Church, from which their noiÅ¿ome diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, as a type of Å¿in, had for the time excluded them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for</hi> Iohn BaptiÅ¿t <hi>(Å¿aith my Brother</hi> Burton, <hi>Page 16.)</hi> (about whoÅ¿e gathering you have Å¿o beÅ¿tirred your Å¿elf before, and to as little purpoÅ¿e.) You may obÅ¿erve, that thoÅ¿e beleevers in ChriÅ¿t then to come, according to the PapiÅ¿ts doctrine, were not formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ChriÅ¿tian Church, or Churches, as after ChriÅ¿ts reÅ¿urrection the beleevers were. And when you come to viÅ¿it thoÅ¿e ChriÅ¿tian Churches once conÅ¿tituted in their GoÅ¿pel form by the ApoÅ¿tles, you Å¿hall finde, that the power of admitting, and rejecting or caÅ¿ting out of members, was not in the ApoÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters alone, but in the Churches. For this, read <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>5.</hi> where the whole Church of the Saints in Corinth, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, were to caÅ¿t out the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perÅ¿on; as alÅ¿o, afterward upon his repentance, to re-admit him, <hi>2</hi> Cor. <hi>2. 6, 7.</hi> This one inÅ¿tance <hi>(Å¿aith my Brother</hi> Burton) is a Å¿ufficiens preÅ¿ident for all Churches. <hi>Thus he.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:48122:318"/>
And this is all he hath to Å¿ay there, concerning <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> Now although I have formerly anÅ¿wered, and that in many places in the foregoing TreatiÅ¿e, to every Å¿everal branch of this my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> cavil; and although it be nothing to the enervating of my Argument, as all underÅ¿tanding men will well preceive, if they duly conÅ¿ider it; yet becauÅ¿e I perceive by his whole diÅ¿courÅ¿e, the main deÅ¿igne both of himÅ¿elf, and all thoÅ¿e of his faction (that now trouble the world with their Å¿cribbling) is to deceive, and delude Å¿illy Å¿ouls, that they may the better bring all the Presbyters into the hatred of the people, as men Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian, and more then Prelatical, and as affecting a more lordly power over the people, then ever the BiÅ¿hops exerciÅ¿ed over them; (for this is the language all their Pulpits and Pamphlets Å¿peak:) I Å¿ay, in this regard, though I have often formerly fully anÅ¿wered to every branch of this cavil, I will here Å¿ay Å¿omething to it, for the better diÅ¿covery of the vanity and triviality of the man: And that I may declare unto all men how little his aÅ¿Å¿everations are to be regarded.</p>
               <p>But I deÅ¿ire the Reader to take notice of his grolleries (waving that Å¿lighting paÅ¿Å¿age of his, where he Å¿aith, <hi>That I have Å¿o beÅ¿tirred my Å¿elf, and to Å¿o little purpoÅ¿e about</hi> John BaptiÅ¿ts <hi>gathering,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>And firÅ¿t, That he joyns here with the PapiÅ¿ts in unchriÅ¿tianing and unchurching all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t:</hi> And Å¿o in this point he is a PapiÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he makes the form of a Church, which he calls the <hi>Gospel form,</hi> to confiÅ¿t in excommunication.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Take notice of his peremptory aÅ¿Å¿ertion, and in it, of an other notable error, where he Å¿aith, <hi>You Å¿hall finde, that the power of admitting and rejecting of members, was not in the ApoÅ¿tles and Ministers alone, but in the Churches.</hi> And for proof of theÅ¿e his grolleries he quotes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7. and makes the example of that Church to be <hi>bindingly preÅ¿idential</hi> (to uÅ¿e <hi>I. S.</hi> his Rhetorick) to all ChriÅ¿tian Churches: Whereas in his tenth page he tells me, <hi>We are neceÅ¿Å¿arily to take all the Churches in the New TeÅ¿tament together, to make up one entire and perfect Church patern.</hi> TheÅ¿e are his words there; and yet here he makes the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to be a Å¿ufficient preÅ¿ident for all Churches. So that every one of their InÅ¿tances muÅ¿t be a Å¿ufficient patern to
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:48122:318"/>
all other Churches; and yet when I produced the example of the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> the Mother Church, for a patern of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for all other Churches, he rejected it, affirming, that it was not a perfect patern. And in that his expreÅ¿Å¿ion alÅ¿o, we may take notice of a parcel of good Divinity, where he makes the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> a more perfect Church then that at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿alem;</hi> which not withÅ¿tanding he Å¿ayes, was the firÅ¿t formed Church. Now if excommunication and diÅ¿cipline, as my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿ayes, be the <hi>GoÅ¿pel form of a Church,</hi> and the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> wanted that part of diÅ¿cipline, then it was not a formed Church; but Å¿o he Å¿peaketh of it in the tenth page, where <hi>I obÅ¿erve a notable contradiction</hi> (to uÅ¿urpe his one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:) And here I leave him a while to reconcile it. But now to Å¿peak breifly by way of anÅ¿wer to theÅ¿e my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> grolleries.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, Whereas he joyning with the PapiÅ¿ts, unchriÅ¿tians and unchurches all thoÅ¿e that were baptized by the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> he is very erroneous in Å¿o doing, and dealeth moÅ¿t wickedly and unchriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly with all thoÅ¿e glorious Saints; for they were as good ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and beleevers; as he or any Independents in the world: As who all of them have ChriÅ¿ts own teÅ¿timony for their true faith in him, and their unfained repentance towards God, which are Å¿ufficient characters ever to make any people good ChriÅ¿tians; and of all them our Saviour Å¿aith, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30. <hi>That they juÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God; and rejected not his counÅ¿el againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, as the PhariÅ¿ees and the Lawyers did;</hi> that is; all thoÅ¿e that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> repented, and beleeved in ChriÅ¿t, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the PromiÅ¿es; and therefore, by our Saviours own wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, they were all good ChriÅ¿tians as any in the new gathered Churches. And therefore, my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> as a notorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿t, and a calumniator, ought to be reproved, eÅ¿pecially by the Å¿even new Churches which hold, That all that were baptized by <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> were beleevers and good ChriÅ¿tians. And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have Å¿pake to his firÅ¿t grollery.</p>
               <p>His Å¿econd is, That he makes excommunication the form of a Church, as we may Å¿ee page the twentieth of his Book, where anÅ¿wering unto my Argument<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> by which I proved our Churches to be true Churches<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>viz. BecauÅ¿e the Å¿aving Truth of the GoÅ¿pel of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was preached, received, and profeÅ¿t in our Churches.</hi>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:48122:319"/>
To the which Argument of mine, he there thus replyes. <hi>If you</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>mean the whole truth of ChriÅ¿t, it is well. But do not you know</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that there dre three Å¿pecial viÅ¿ible marks of a true viÅ¿ible Church, The Gospel purely Preached, the Sacraments duly administred, and DiÅ¿cipline rightly practiÅ¿ed? All which marks to gather the Church of</hi> England <hi>(for ought I know) is yet to Å¿eek.</hi> So that by theÅ¿e words of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t, That in his opinion the GoÅ¿pel-Form of a Church is to have <hi>DiÅ¿cipline rightly PractiÅ¿ed.</hi> So that where DiÅ¿cipline is wanting, by his learning, there is no true GoÅ¿pel formed Church.</p>
               <p>But before I anÅ¿wer to this his grollery, I will Å¿ay thus much to my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> That <hi>DiÅ¿cipline rightly practiÅ¿ed,</hi> is not one of the Å¿pecial viÅ¿ible marks of a true viÅ¿ible Church; and that for theÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, BecauÅ¿e the Holy GhoÅ¿t who better knew the eÅ¿Å¿ential marks of a true viÅ¿ible Church, then my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> yet he in Å¿etting them all down, omitting that of DiÅ¿cipline, Å¿aith, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. <hi>That they continued Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly in the ApoÅ¿tles Doctrine, and FellowÅ¿hip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers:</hi> So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this unerring diÅ¿cription of the eÅ¿Å¿ential marks of a true viÅ¿ible Church; WhereÅ¿oever the <hi>Gospel is truly Preached, and where the Sacraments are rightly administred, and where there is the true Invocation of God</hi> (which is the third eÅ¿Å¿ential mark in Gods Dialect of a true viÅ¿ible Church) there, there is a true Church, although there be no DiÅ¿cipline; and therefore I gather, that DiÅ¿cipline though a moÅ¿t excellent Ordinance, and much to be deÅ¿ired, and had long Å¿ince been obtained, had not the Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents hindred it, makes not for the <hi>eÅ¿Å¿e</hi> but the <hi>bene eÅ¿Å¿e</hi> of a Church. And I will ever beleeve the Holy GhoÅ¿t in this point, rather then my Brother <hi>Burton.</hi> And withal, I will live and die in this opinion, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a true Church (notwithÅ¿tanding, whatÅ¿oever all the Sectaries can Å¿ay to the contrary) becauÅ¿e in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the GoÅ¿pel is truly Preached, and the Sacraments are rightly AdminiÅ¿tred, and the Name of God is truly called upon; all which, if they were Å¿ufficient to make the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> a true formed Church, yea, and the firÅ¿t true formed Church, according to my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> own learning, then they are Å¿ufficient to make the Church of <hi>England</hi> a true formed Church.</p>

But a Å¿econd ReaÅ¿on to prove that DiÅ¿cipline rightly practiÅ¿ed is not the forme of a church, is from my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> owne words; for hee everywhere Å¿aith, that the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> was a true formed church, and yet Å¿hee wanted that part of <hi>DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, of caÅ¿ting out corrupt Members;</hi> Å¿o that DiÅ¿cipline there could not then be rightly practiÅ¿ed, if that church wanted that part of DiÅ¿cipline, and if it were not there at all as hee Å¿aith; and therefore for that marke it does not make for the <hi>eÅ¿Å¿e</hi> of a church, and for the <hi>bringing in of a Gospel forme</hi> (as is Å¿aid before:) and which is yet more, if excommunication be the GoÅ¿pel forme <hi>of a true viÅ¿ible church</hi> then all the Synagogues in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> in Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿ts</hi> time were true formed churches after the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel forme; for Synagogue and Church in the holy Scriptures are all one; and in all the Synagogues they had excommunication, as in many places it is evident; and for inÅ¿tance theÅ¿e, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 22. <hi>For the Iewes had argued already, that if any man did confeÅ¿Å¿e hee was ChriÅ¿t hee Å¿hould be put out of the Synagogue;</hi> and in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth verÅ¿e, <hi>in terminis</hi> it is Å¿aid, <hi>that they caÅ¿t out the young man,</hi> and in the twelfth chapter, verÅ¿e 35. it is Å¿aid there, <hi>that amongst the chiefe Rulers many beleeved in him, but becauÅ¿e of the PhariÅ¿ees they did not confeÅ¿Å¿e him, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould bee put out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</hi>

               <p>But now to goe on, after the ReÅ¿urrection and AÅ¿cention of ChriÅ¿t, and that the ApoÅ¿tles had received the gifts of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, and at their firÅ¿t entring upon their MiniÅ¿try, had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the people, and that the people were pricked in their hearts when they heard them, it is Å¿aid that the people addreÅ¿Å¿ed themÅ¿elves onely unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿aying, <hi>Men and Brethren what Å¿hall wee do?</hi> Then <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿aid unto them, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t for the remiÅ¿sion of Å¿ins, and ye Å¿hall receive the gifts of the holy GhoÅ¿t,</hi> &amp;c.

Fortifications in their braine, and laid a foundation in their phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie, upon which they built an Independent Church, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of no more then could all meet in one place, to enjoy all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip in Gods Å¿ervice, and pretended that this Church being the Mother-church, was to bee an example and paterne to all the Daughter-churches, and that all Churches through the world muÅ¿t be governed after that modell; and being by the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of many <hi>Sanballats</hi> and <hi>TobieÅ¿Å¿es</hi> much Å¿trengthened, as I Å¿aid before, they began to inÅ¿ult, and to give Lawes of government to all Churches, and to gather and Å¿et up churches after their owne modell, and being much aÅ¿Å¿ured of their owne Å¿trength, they bad defiance to the whole world, flinging and caÅ¿ting their Gloves to all their enemies aÅ¿Å¿embled and not aÅ¿Å¿embled; whereupon I being a Commander in the Presbyterian Army, and taking up the Glove came out againÅ¿t them, and by divine aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance reduced this place, and tooke it from them which they had Å¿ometime unjuÅ¿tly detayned from the Presbyterians, to whom indeed it belonged by the right of inheritance and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion: I Å¿ay I having by conqueÅ¿t taken this Å¿trong citie from the Independent VÅ¿urpers, that now labour to mannage all government by Å¿ea and land, in church and Å¿tate, pretending they are Saints, and that the Saints muÅ¿t governe the world; and being in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of it, I expected that thoÅ¿e two confiding Commanders, <hi>Saint HanÅ¿erdo,</hi> valiant and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old <hi>Henry</hi> being Å¿o compleatly armed as he was, with his Å¿word, and <hi>Phocions</hi> Hatchet, and with his great white basket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilted beard, that both of them aÅ¿siÅ¿ted alÅ¿o with <hi>I.

much for all their honours now to have Å¿hewen their valour: and therefore, they all of them not Å¿triking a Å¿troke, proclaime unto all the world their want, both of animoÅ¿ity, and all heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and their want alÅ¿o of honeÅ¿ty, in that they pretend a right unto that they have no juÅ¿t title or clayme to, and for which they dare not fight, in that they amuÅ¿e the people, and Å¿tirre up facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on every Å¿ide, and all to Å¿trengthen their owne party, for the making of a groundleÅ¿s combuÅ¿tion in Church &amp; State, telling the people that they have <hi>power and intereÅ¿t in the government of the Church,</hi> and that <hi>authority and jurisdiction only</hi> belongeth unto the Presbyters, which they ought alwayes to exerciÅ¿e in the name of the Church, and thereupon they perÅ¿wade them, that if they relinquiÅ¿h this their right unto the Presbyters, they will more Lord it over them then ever the Prelates did; and they teach them farther, that this right is derived unto them from the example of the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and the other Primitive Churches, who when they were caÅ¿t into a GoÅ¿pel forme, as they Å¿ay, the ApoÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters had not the Å¿ole power of governing them, but the people alÅ¿o were joyned with them, and that they are all of them to have their voices, both in electing of officers, and in receiving in of Members, and caÅ¿ting out of any offenders as well as the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and MiniÅ¿ters, and wiÅ¿h all the people to Å¿tand and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that liberty wherein ChriÅ¿t hath made them free; theÅ¿e and Å¿uch like unÅ¿ound Principles they Å¿eaÅ¿on the people with, for the inraging of them againÅ¿t the Presbyters, and take all occaÅ¿ions to pervert the holy Scripture, for the maintenance of their new-found way of Independency, and labour continually by Å¿hifts and jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to evade the dint of any Arguments that are brought againÅ¿t them, for the proving that the power of government in the church reÅ¿ideth in the Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters hands, both for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion of Members, and the caÅ¿ting of them out, as it did in the hands of <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t</hi> and the ApoÅ¿tles, and DiÅ¿ciples, who onely had the authority with the Keyes committed unto them by God himÅ¿elfe, and who onely exerciÅ¿ed it in their dayes, as by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable examples may be proved, as by that of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> and the ApoÅ¿tles in the church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which latter example, both my brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>J.

But becauÅ¿e

my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> not onely carps at the example of <hi>Iohn the BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> but likewiÅ¿e at thoÅ¿e I brought of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and of the <hi>Goaler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> alÅ¿o joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him in this good Å¿ervice and skirmiÅ¿h; the which after that both himÅ¿elf and <hi>AbÅ¿urdo Know-leÅ¿Å¿e</hi> (for Å¿o he may truly be called) had Å¿pent their breath and Å¿trength to evade, and yet perceiving evidence of truth in them Å¿o apparently perÅ¿picuous, as it dazzled their eyes, they cry out, that thoÅ¿e were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary examples, and not binding, becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e being baptized, were not admitted or received members into any particular Church, but into the Catholike viÅ¿ible Church; and therefore, Å¿ay they, thoÅ¿e examples are not for our imitation, we look onely for the example of Å¿uch Churches as were caÅ¿t into a GoÅ¿pel-Form, and into the mould of the New TeÅ¿tament-Form.</p>
               <p>Now, what a heighth of wickedneÅ¿Å¿e is it in theÅ¿e men, thus to trifle for the deluding of the Å¿imple people, and to pretend unto them, that there are divers wayes of admitting of members into ChriÅ¿ts Church? one way of admitting members into the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viÅ¿ible Church, and another of admitting members into a particular Church, when in truth there is no difference; for he that is a member of any particular Church, is a member of the Catholike, and Å¿o on the contrary, as by the examples both ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and extraordinary by me produced, is Å¿ufficiently apparent; for they were all admitted after one and the Å¿ame way; and I had two examples of receiving in members into Churches conÅ¿tituted after the New TeÅ¿tament Form; as that of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maÅ¿eus,</hi> both Churches according to the GoÅ¿pel-Form; and there were there three thouÅ¿and received members at one time in the church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> without any of thoÅ¿e conditions they require at their members hands; and <hi>Paul</hi> alÅ¿o was received a member of the Church of <hi>DamaÅ¿cus,</hi> upon the Å¿ame terms that all the reÅ¿t were; and therefore the example is bindingly preÅ¿idential: And theÅ¿e two examples are taken no notice of, but are paÅ¿Å¿ed by; and all the other counted extraordinary by them: And the people by this means are deluded and miÅ¿erably abuÅ¿ed.</p>
               <p>Now can there be a greater impoÅ¿ture or deceit in any that pretend unto Religion and honeÅ¿ty, then that in theÅ¿e men? When they Å¿ay in their writings upon all occaÅ¿ions, produce us Å¿ome examples of Churches according to the New TeÅ¿tament

Can there, I Å¿ay, be a greater deceit in any men, then this of theirs, to make the people beleeve that there hath never been any Å¿uch example produced; when notwithÅ¿tanding I had Å¿et that example of the Church of <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that of <hi>DamaÅ¿cus,</hi> both conÅ¿tituted after the GoÅ¿pel-Form before their eyes? in both of which, their members were admitted by the Å¿ole and alone authority of the MiniÅ¿ters of thoÅ¿e Churches, without the conÅ¿ent of the people, or without any of thoÅ¿e requiÅ¿ites they now demand of their members in all their new gathered Churches; By which their proceedings, they make themÅ¿elves guilty before God, and all men of indirect dealing, and of withholding the Truth from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; and manifeÅ¿tly declare unto the world, that they are reÅ¿olved againÅ¿t all the Light of the Truth, obÅ¿tinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perÅ¿iÅ¿t in their erroneous wayes, which is the greateÅ¿t height of impiety and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e in the world, and no leÅ¿Å¿e then to reÅ¿iÅ¿t the Spirit of God: For if there had been but the leaÅ¿t dram of candor and fair dealing in them, they would never have uttered Å¿uch words; and had there been but any ChriÅ¿tian honeÅ¿ty, and love to the peace of the Church in them, they would not have paÅ¿Å¿ed by the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and that of <hi>DamaÅ¿cus</hi> unÅ¿aluted, and without taking any notice of them, and fell upon the examples of the <hi>Eunuch Cornelius, Lydia, and the Goaler,</hi> and then pretend that they were extraordinary.</p>
               <p>But that all men may Å¿ee my fair dealing with them, and (if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible) that I may undeceive the deluded people, I will in this place to gratifie my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>AbÅ¿urdo Know-leÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> Å¿et before their eyes the examples of the two Mother Churches in their <hi>GoÅ¿pel-Form:</hi> viz. that of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem &amp; Samaria,</hi> that Å¿o by the mouth of two witneÅ¿Å¿es, the Truth may the better be confirmed.</p>
               <p>Now, becauÅ¿e they took no notice of the Church of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> in my former Book, but paÅ¿Å¿e it by as not worth the regarding, I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire them at this time, and all thoÅ¿e that read this Book, duly to conÅ¿ider how members were admitted there, not onely at one time, but always: And I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire them likewiÅ¿e, Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to weigh the practice of that Church in the admitting of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:48122:324"/>
the example of which, according to their doctrine, muÅ¿t ever be followed and imitated.</p>
               <p>And becauÅ¿e my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿ays, That the other Churches alÅ¿o are to be taken in for the making up of a compleat patern, I will produce two other formed churches after the New TeÅ¿tament Form among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and them eminent ones, that there may be no want of witneÅ¿Å¿es; for the confirming us in the right way of gathering Churches, and for the receiving in of members.</p>

But by the way let me tell the Illdependents that the ApoÅ¿tles and DiÅ¿ciples had then a juÅ¿t ground of making Å¿uch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, if ever any had; for they might with great reaÅ¿on have Å¿aid, howÅ¿oever theÅ¿e Å¿ouls be not miracle proof, but that they are wounded to the heart by them, and by the Sermon of <hi>Peter;</hi> yet we are not by and by to confide in them and to admit them into church fellowÅ¿hip, unleÅ¿Å¿e they will walk Å¿ome time with us that we may have experience of the truth of their converÅ¿ion; and unleÅ¿Å¿e alÅ¿o they will make all and every one of them a publike and particular confeÅ¿Å¿ion of his faith, and bring in the evidences of their converÅ¿ion, and enter alÅ¿o into a particular explicite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

for obÅ¿erving all the Laws of memberÅ¿hip, and that they come in by the generall conÅ¿ent and approbation of the church. I Å¿ay if ever there was a time that theÅ¿e conditions might have been required by any, it might then eÅ¿pecially have been, becauÅ¿e all thoÅ¿e had had their hand in crucifying of the Lord of life, as <hi>Peter</hi> told them; and therefore they might all be well Å¿uÅ¿pected that howÅ¿oever for the preÅ¿ent they were all Å¿truck into a trembling condition, yet that they could not judge upon Å¿o Å¿hort a time of the Å¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e of their converÅ¿ion, and therefore they might well have urged all the former conditions, and chiefly becauÅ¿e they had our Saviours own example freÅ¿hly before their eyes in the Å¿econd of <hi>John</hi> where it is related <hi>that he would not commit himÅ¿elfe unto men</hi> which had been convinced by his miracles, although <hi>they beleeved in him;</hi> Å¿o that I Å¿ay in that regard, <hi>when ChriÅ¿t would not commit himÅ¿elfe unto them,</hi> the ApoÅ¿tles and DiÅ¿ciples might much more have pretended in all theÅ¿e regards that they had no reaÅ¿on to confide in theÅ¿e men until they had had better experience of them for the truth of their converÅ¿ion. But when neither the ApoÅ¿tles nor none of all the DiÅ¿ciples Å¿o much as urged any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon them beyond the commiÅ¿Å¿ion given them by <hi>ChriÅ¿t;</hi> to wit, <hi>Repentance, Faith and BaptiÅ¿m:</hi> the example of this church is for ever binding to all churches, that they in the admiÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Members Å¿hould do the Å¿ame, and they that propound other conditions do no leÅ¿Å¿e then accuÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles of injuÅ¿tice and imprudency, as of taking that authority into their own hands from the people, and of Å¿o Å¿uddenly and without any deliberation admitting of Members into church-fellowÅ¿hip which ought, according to my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> doctrine, ever to be done with great caution, who Å¿aith in his 14.

And were all admitted unto Church-fellowÅ¿hip, and that by <hi>Philips</hi> Å¿ole authority; and this his method of gathering of Churches, was ratified by the authority of the ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the whole Colledge of the ApoÅ¿tles at <hi>IeruÅ¿alem.</hi> And this was a true formed Church after the New TeÅ¿tament Form: For in this ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf had planted a Church, and converted many, as it is at large Å¿et down in the fourth Chapter of the GoÅ¿pel of Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> and here it is Å¿aid, <hi>That the people with one accord, gave heed unto thoÅ¿e things that</hi> Philip <hi>Å¿pake, and that there was great joy in that City,</hi> VerÅ¿e 6, 8. <hi>And that they were all baptized both men and women.</hi>

Here we have neither any walking required at their hands, for he better aÅ¿Å¿urance, either of <hi>Philip</hi> or the Church, of the Å¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e of their converÅ¿ion: Here is no publike confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith required before their admittance into Church-fellowÅ¿hip: Here is no evidences of their converÅ¿ion called for: Here is no particular explicite covenant demanded of them: Here is no conÅ¿ent of the people deÅ¿ired before their admiÅ¿Å¿ion into Church communion, and yet this was a Church eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed according to the GoÅ¿pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. So that according to the practice of the two Mother churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> all beleevers were admitted members, and received into Church-fellowÅ¿hip, without the conditions thoÅ¿e of the Congregational way now require of all thoÅ¿e of their new gathered Churches: Whether therefore it be not a high preÅ¿ump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and arrogancy in all the Independents, to Å¿light the Laws of ChriÅ¿t, the King of his Church, and the example of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, and the example of all the bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles, I leave it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all prudent and adviÅ¿ed ChriÅ¿tians. I will now to Å¿atisfie my Brother <hi>Burtons</hi> deÅ¿ire, viÅ¿it Å¿ome Churches of the Gentiles, formed according to the New TeÅ¿tament Form; and I will firÅ¿t in this viÅ¿itation, begin with that Church which he himÅ¿elf hath Å¿et before all Churches for a patern of imitation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the eighteenth of the</hi> Acts <hi>it is recorded, that when</hi> Silas <hi>and</hi> Timothy <hi>were come unto</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Corinth, <hi>the Jewes refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing to receive the GoÅ¿pel of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> that hee Å¿hooke his ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againÅ¿t them, and Å¿aid unto them your blood be upon your own heads, I am cleare, from hence-forth I will goe unto the Gentiles, and departing thence, hee entred into ones houÅ¿e named <hi>IuÅ¿tus,</hi> one that worÅ¿hipped God, <hi>and preaching the GoÅ¿pel there, it is Å¿aid, that</hi> CriÅ¿pus <hi>a chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue,</hi> beleeved on the Lord with all his houÅ¿e, and many of the Corinthians hearing, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and were baptized.</p>
               <p>Here wee Å¿ee in a Church put into a GoÅ¿pel forme, the Members of that church were admitted by the Å¿ole authority of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and that barely upon their hearing and beleeving; for the ApoÅ¿tle required no other conditions of them for their admiÅ¿sion into church FellowÅ¿hip, hee Å¿aid not unto thoÅ¿e many that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, that before they could be made Members of that church they muÅ¿t walke Å¿ome time with the church, that they might have
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:48122:328"/>
experience of the truth of their converÅ¿ion; neither did he injoyn them for Å¿atisfaction of the people, to make a publicke confeÅ¿sion of their faith, or to bring in the evidences of their converÅ¿ion, or to enter into any particular explicite covenant, or to have the conÅ¿ent of the whole church, nothing of all this did <hi>Paul</hi> require of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this church after the GoÅ¿pel forme; but following ChriÅ¿t the Kings commiÅ¿sion upon their Faith, Repentance, and BaptiÅ¿me, hee hy his owne and Å¿ole authority admitted them. The Å¿ame way of admitting of Members wee Å¿hall find in the Church of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> as it is at large to be Å¿eene in the nineteenth chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the manner of admiÅ¿Å¿ion of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers there is fully Å¿et downe, and that was a Church alÅ¿o my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿ets downe amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that muÅ¿t be brought in for the making up of a compleate paterne, now in all thoÅ¿e Churches they were all admitted upon ChriÅ¿ts owne termes, and by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters Å¿ole authority, without either walking Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with the Church, or without any publicke confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith to the Congregation, or bringing in their evidences, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into any private explicite Covenant, or without the conÅ¿ent of the people. How unÅ¿ufferable a thing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>therefore is it now then in all thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way, to demand other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all their Members before they can be admitted into Church-fellowÅ¿hip with them, then thoÅ¿e that ChriÅ¿t the King of his Church, and all his bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles demanded? If this be not the higheÅ¿t point of preÅ¿umption that was ever heard of, I leave it to the conÅ¿ideration of the very ruggedeÅ¿t Independents upon due deliberation, deÅ¿iting they may all Å¿eriouÅ¿ly lay it to heart, and timely repent of it: for if they doe not they will indeed be found fighters againÅ¿t God, and diÅ¿-throners of ChriÅ¿t the King, when they Å¿hall Å¿light both his Lawes and example, and the example of his bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles, and the practiÅ¿e of all thoÅ¿e glorious GoÅ¿pel formed Churches, and Å¿et up new Lawes and examples of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Churches, and of admitting of Members, whereas in all the New TeÅ¿tament wee have but one way of admitting of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whether in an ordinary way, or an extraordinary; for they that are made Members of any particular Church, by vertue of that they are made Members of the Catholike, and thoÅ¿e likewiÅ¿e that are made Members of the Catholike Church, may by vertue of their admiÅ¿Å¿ion into it, be Members in any particular Church, as
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:48122:328"/>
I Å¿hall prove by the Independents owne Principles. And as for the ordinary way of admitting of Members, I have proved it from the fore-going examples, and the Primitive practiÅ¿e, that it was upon condition onely of Repentance, Faith, and BaptiÅ¿me, and ChriÅ¿t required no more; and for the extraordinary way if it bee evinced that that was after the Å¿ame manner, and upon no other conditions, then all men may Å¿ee into what a deÅ¿perate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Rebellion all the Independents have by their new wayes plunged themÅ¿elves into, and may withall well perceive the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all thoÅ¿e cavils my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> made againÅ¿t my following Arguments. Now that they may Å¿ee how, and upon what conditions all ChriÅ¿tians were admitted into the catholicke viÅ¿ible Church, it will be worth their paines to looke upon the practice of the holy MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel, both EvangeliÅ¿ts and ApoÅ¿tles, who were all directed in what they did, by the Å¿peciall command of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe; And therefore farre more worthy of imitation then our Independents practiÅ¿es<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Now we may take notice, that when the Angel appeared unto <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> in the tenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> hee Å¿ent him unto <hi>Ioppa,</hi> to call for one <hi>Simon,</hi> whoÅ¿e Å¿urname was <hi>Peter;</hi> hee did not Å¿end him unto the Church in <hi>Joppa.</hi> And it is related that when <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and that hee had recited unto him the manner of the viÅ¿ion, and that hee was commanded by the Angell to Å¿end for him; it is further alÅ¿o declared what <hi>Peter</hi> there did, and that he Å¿aid, <hi>of a truth J perceive that God is no reÅ¿pecter of perÅ¿ons, but in every Nation, hee that feareth him, and worketh righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is accepted with him.</hi> And after a Sermon made unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and all that were aÅ¿Å¿embled there with him; It is Å¿aid, that <hi>the holy GhoÅ¿t fell on all them that heard the Word, and that all the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that came with</hi> Peter, <hi>were aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed at it, for they heard them speake with divers tongues, and magnified God. Then anÅ¿wered</hi> Peter, <hi>can any man forbid water that theÅ¿e men Å¿hould not bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as wee? And hee commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.</hi> Here wee Å¿ee firÅ¿t, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Å¿ent unto, and not the Church: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he admitted <hi>Cornelius</hi> and thoÅ¿e that were with him into the number of beleevers, and into the fellow-Å¿hip of the Church by his owne authority, and never conÅ¿ulted with the Church to aske their leave or voyce, but concludes the buÅ¿ines
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:48122:329"/>
with an interrogation, which hath a greater force of binding that no man ought to hinder any beleever from comming into the Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the church and communion of Saints, in whom the graces of Gods Å¿pirit evidently appeare, as in theÅ¿e; Å¿o that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the MiniÅ¿ters come into their houÅ¿es, or they goe into the MiniÅ¿ters and make Å¿ufficient teÅ¿timony by themÅ¿elves of their faith, and that they feare God, of what nation Å¿oever they bee, they are by the MiniÅ¿ters to bee admitted; the congregation hath nothing to doe to hinder any Å¿uch, nay, they may not, it is more than belongs unto them; neither did thoÅ¿e that came with <hi>Peter</hi> intermeddle in that buÅ¿ines, or require a covenant at their hand, or a publik confeÅ¿sion of their faith.</p>
               <p>Againe, when the Lord of his infinite mercy was purpoÅ¿ed to reveale himÅ¿elfe unto the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in the 8. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he Å¿endeth <hi>Philip</hi> the EvangeliÅ¿t unto him, whom hee found reading in his chariot, the propheÅ¿ie of <hi>JÅ¿aiah,</hi> and after that hee had interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him that propheÅ¿ie, and preached unto him IeÅ¿us and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me in his name it is related, <hi>that when they came unto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine water, the Eunuch Å¿aid unto him, what doth hinder me to be baptized? and</hi> Philip <hi>Å¿aid, if thou beleeveÅ¿t with all thine heart, thou maiÅ¿t:</hi> And hee anÅ¿wered and Å¿aid, <hi>J beleeve that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is the Sonne of God: and hee commanded the chariot to Å¿tand Å¿till and they went downe both into the water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the Eunuch, and hee baptized him.</hi> Here wee Å¿ee that <hi>Philip</hi> and not the church was Å¿ent unto the Eunuch, and that <hi>Philip</hi> by his owne authority, and upon the Eunuch his owne teÅ¿timony, without any reference unto any church, or without conÅ¿ulting with any Congregation, admits him into the number of beleevers, and makes him a member of the church, and here was neither a publicke confeÅ¿Å¿ion required of him by any of the church, or any Covenant exacted by the people: and Å¿o when <hi>Saul</hi> in the 9. of the <hi>Acts</hi> was fallen downe out of aÅ¿toniÅ¿hment, and afterwards was converted as the Storie there fully declareth the whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, the Lord Å¿ent one <hi>Ananias</hi> a DiÅ¿ciple, and MiniÅ¿ter unto him; hee did not Å¿end the church unto him, neither did <hi>Ananias</hi> when hee came to <hi>Saul,</hi> Å¿ay unto him, I will conÅ¿ult with the church to Å¿ee whether they will admit thee to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for thou haÅ¿t greatly waÅ¿ted the church, and made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocke of the Saints, and therefore I will have their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and conÅ¿ent, and I will have thee firÅ¿t walke with the Church Å¿ome time, that they may behold thy converÅ¿ation, and then thou Å¿halt make a confeÅ¿Å¿ion of thy faith publickly before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and give in thy evidences of the truth of thy converÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and enter in a private and Å¿olemne covenant, and Å¿o be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and admitted. But without all this adoe he baptizes <hi>Paul</hi> and admitteth him into the number of beleevers, and makes him a member of this formed Church, &amp; that by his Å¿ole authority, and he was received immediatly among the DiÅ¿ciples at <hi>DamaÅ¿cus</hi> without any reluctation, or Å¿o much as any Å¿cruple, and <hi>Å¿trait-way hee preached ChriÅ¿t in the Synagogue that hee was the Son of God;</hi> hee was both ordained and put in office without the approbation and conÅ¿ent of the people, who knew nothing of the buÅ¿ines, but <hi>onely Å¿tood amazed,</hi> and Å¿aid, <hi>Is not this hee that deÅ¿troyed them which called on this name in</hi> IeruÅ¿alem, <hi>and came hither for that intent, that hee might bring them bound unto the high PrieÅ¿t?</hi> The MiniÅ¿ters in thoÅ¿e dayes when they were all taught of God, they only admitted Members by their owne authority into the church, without the approbation of the people; but in theÅ¿e our dayes, wherin people have gotten itching eares, and teachers after their owne humours (Å¿uch as S. <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaks of in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles to <hi>Timothy)</hi> they teach a new doctrine, and bring forth new borne lights, to the darkening of truth it Å¿elfe, and to the bringing in a confuÅ¿ion of all things.

offenders out of the Church, Å¿o they onely had the authority of receiving them in againe upon their repentance, and not the Church; Å¿o if wee looke into all thoÅ¿e EpiÅ¿tles that were written unto the Å¿even Churches of <hi>AÅ¿ia,</hi> in the 2. and 3. of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> we Å¿hall find them all directed to the Angels of the Å¿even Churches, which is as much as to Å¿ay, to the preÅ¿idents of every Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Presbytrie eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed and conÅ¿tituted in every one of thoÅ¿e Churches; which is a Å¿ufficient Argument to me, to prove a CounÅ¿ell or Colledge of godly MiniÅ¿ters in every one of thoÅ¿e ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 1. verÅ¿e 5. <hi>for this cauÅ¿e left I thee in</hi> Creet <hi>that thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t ordaine Presbyters in every Citie,</hi> not one but many.

Å¿ame light of reaÅ¿on that counÅ¿ell or colledge to whom God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe writes and directs his letters for redreÅ¿Å¿ing of abuÅ¿es, has the power in their hands for the rectifying of things amiÅ¿Å¿e, and that it peculiarly belongeth unto them, as to the MagiÅ¿trates inveÅ¿ted with authority, to order things according to direction, and to puniÅ¿h and caÅ¿t out offenders; and that by their own power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conÅ¿ent and approbation of the people, as it is now in the great Councell and Parliament of the Kingdome; who make not the people acquainted with what they have to do, but Å¿o far as it pleaÅ¿eth themÅ¿elves, and not out of any duty: And Å¿o it was in the government of Gods Church by the firÅ¿t conÅ¿titution, every Church conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of many congregations, were governed by a colledge of Presbyters, as that of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> and this of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> and the other Å¿ix Churches; in all the which the PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters by their Å¿ole authority governed them according to Gods Word, without taking the people into councell with them, who were no where joyned in commiÅ¿Å¿ion with them: and therefore it is moÅ¿t apparent by thoÅ¿e examples I have now produced, and many more that might be added; and from the commiÅ¿Å¿ion that ChriÅ¿t gave to the ApoÅ¿tles, and in them to all MiniÅ¿ters, that the people had not their voices, either for the admitting of any to be Members in any church, or in the caÅ¿ting out of any for their delinquency, much leÅ¿Å¿e have they authority to require a publike confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith to be made unto the congregation, or to exact of them to bring in the evidences of their true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, or to require that they Å¿hould walk with them Å¿ome time before admiÅ¿Å¿ion, or to enter into a Å¿olemn private Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be admitted as Members, for we have no preÅ¿ident for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theÅ¿e things in Gods Word, much leÅ¿Å¿e any command, only in <hi>Acts</hi> the Å¿ixt, there is mention made, that the ApoÅ¿tles for the freeing of themÅ¿elves from all unneceÅ¿Å¿ary incombrances, and that they might the better attend upon their MiniÅ¿tery and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, gave the people liberty to make choice of their own Deacons, but Å¿till keeping the power of ordaining them in their own hand, which always was arbitrary in them whether they would exerciÅ¿e it or no, neither would the ApoÅ¿tles have ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, unleÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e that were to be ordained, had been men Å¿o qualified as they had appointed; for otherwiÅ¿e, it lay in their choyce whether they would ordain them or no.

Here the ApoÅ¿tle againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, twice in theÅ¿e few words, enjoyns them Å¿ilence in the church, and impoÅ¿es upon them Å¿ubjection and obedience: <hi>I Å¿uffer not,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>a woman to teach or to uÅ¿urpe authority over the man, but to be in Å¿ilene;</hi> and he giveth his reaÅ¿ons of this his command, <hi>becauÅ¿e</hi> Å¿aith he, Adam <hi>was firÅ¿t made,</hi> not by the woman nor of the woman, but the contrary; and therefore Å¿hee may uÅ¿urpe no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the maÅ¿culine Å¿ex, eÅ¿pecially in Gods matters, and Å¿he is to be the diÅ¿ciple of the man, and not the man her Å¿cholar: and therefore that Å¿uperiority that the God of order had eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed upon the man in the firÅ¿t creation, hee doth now re-eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h upon him againe in his holy Word, after all things through Å¿inne had beene diÅ¿ordered and confuÅ¿ed; and commands the woman to be both Å¿ubject and Å¿ilent, eÅ¿pecially in the Church. Another reaÅ¿on of this his command is, becauÅ¿e the woman was firÅ¿t in the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion, and was the cauÅ¿e of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as hee accuÅ¿es her, and her diÅ¿puting and voycing of it then brought confuÅ¿ion upon all man-kind; and for this her Å¿o doing, S. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hereafter, that Å¿he ought to hold her peace &amp; be in Å¿ubjection to her husband, and ought to learne in Å¿ilence at home, but more eÅ¿pecially in the Church; for if they come to voice it once againe in the Church, as <hi>Eve</hi> brought confuÅ¿ion upon man-kind by her diÅ¿putation and reaÅ¿on, Å¿o theÅ¿e with their loquacity and babble and confuÅ¿ion of voyces will bring in a new <hi>Babel</hi> into the Church and State, as they have prettily well already begun to doe.

be not to Å¿peak in the Church? and whether to have their voices in either admitting of Members or Officers, or in the caÅ¿ting of them out, be not to uÅ¿urpe authority over the man? for all the world knows, that they that have the power in their hands of either admitting of any into the fellowÅ¿hip or communion of the Church, or of hindring their coming in, or have their voices for the caÅ¿ting of them out when they are received, exerciÅ¿e and uÅ¿urpe authority over thoÅ¿e they Å¿o deal with<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and there-fore they do againÅ¿t the expreÅ¿Å¿e prohibition of the ApoÅ¿tles, and all thoÅ¿e women that have uÅ¿urped this authority, and all thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters that have permitted them Å¿o to do, or taught this doctrine unto them, are all guilty of great contumacy againÅ¿t God, and ought Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to repent for this their temerity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and it will be the imortall honour of thoÅ¿e women that have not intermedled; and if there be not Å¿ome Å¿peedy courÅ¿e taken by authority to forbid Å¿uch diÅ¿order, we may promiÅ¿e no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Church and whole Kingdome but confuÅ¿ion. It hath ever been obÅ¿erved, that Hermaphrodite councels in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or Country, when women that are Å¿ubjects intermeddle in government and matters of Å¿tate, that that Kingdome and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is very craÅ¿ed and not far from ruine and deÅ¿truction; and we need not look into many ages or countries for preÅ¿idents of this kind; and if Hermaphrodite counÅ¿els in Kingdoms have ever been Å¿o fatall unto them, what may any man think in time will become of this Church and Kingdome, when the women have gotten <hi>Peters</hi> Keys at their girdle, and have their voices in many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and a power of ordering and diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of things in Church affairs? Certainly, nothing but confuÅ¿ion can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; for this their doing is againÅ¿t the expreÅ¿Å¿e command of God, who is the God of order, and injoyns the contrary: Yea, it is not onely againÅ¿t the law of God, but againÅ¿t the very law of nature and the practice of all Nations; for never was it yet heard of in any well governed City, or Commonwealth, or Kingdome, that women that were Å¿ubjects had their voices in chooÅ¿ing offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or BurgeÅ¿Å¿es, or making of freemen, or disfranchiÅ¿ing of them, or were permitted Å¿o much as to Å¿it in counÅ¿ell with them, much leÅ¿Å¿e to rule and give laws to others out of their own houÅ¿es: And therefore as it is a thing odious to God and man, and that which is a Å¿hame to that Å¿ex, it ought to be caÅ¿t out of all
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:48122:332"/>
wel-governed Churches and States; and as the women ought to know their places, Å¿o ought all men that are under obedience to learne their duty, and not to take upon them that which God never gave unto them, as to have their voice either in making of members in Churches, or caÅ¿ting of them out, or of ordaining of officers, or of impoÅ¿ing laws upon others, either of making pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confeÅ¿Å¿ions before the congregations, or of producing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their converÅ¿ion, or that they Å¿hould walk with them Å¿ome time that they might behold their converÅ¿ation, or of impoÅ¿ing a Covenant upon any that Å¿hall be admitted; for all rule and government in the Church is put into the hands of the Presbyters, and does not belong unto the people or multitude, neither may the Presbyters uÅ¿urpe authority, but they alÅ¿o muÅ¿t exerciÅ¿e it onely, according to the commiÅ¿Å¿ion given unto them by ChriÅ¿t, they may not tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿e it or go beyond it in the leaÅ¿t thing; and therefore when many of the brethren call for a publike confeÅ¿Å¿ion of mens faith to be made in their new congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and the evidences of their converÅ¿ion to be produced, and impoÅ¿e a Covenant upon them before they admit them to be members of their Church, (as if they had lived before in infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Who notwithÅ¿tanding were known to be holy and godly ChriÅ¿tians, and as true beleevers as any that now live in the world) and think them onely ChriÅ¿tians and Beleevers that doe as they would have them, and count of others that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themÅ¿elves to their cuÅ¿tomes and novelties; but as the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cowring and refuÅ¿e and no ChriÅ¿tians<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I Å¿ay it is an intolerable uÅ¿urpation, and a thing that was yet never before practiÅ¿ed in the world, in any Church either JewiÅ¿h or ChriÅ¿tian till theÅ¿e dayes, and therefore they go beyond their commiÅ¿Å¿ion in Å¿o doing; for God in his commiÅ¿Å¿ion to his ApoÅ¿tles and all MiniÅ¿ters, bids them admit of all that come in and beleeve and are baptized, he quencheth not the Å¿moaking flax nor breaketh the bruiÅ¿ed reed; now then, when they know thouÅ¿ands in this Kingdome that do beleeve, and are men of unblamable lives, and Å¿uch as would lay down their lives for the faith once delivered unto the Saints and are baptized; what have they to do to lord it over them, and to hinder them from communicating in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and to be admitted into Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>fellowÅ¿hip with them, or to debarre them from the communion of the Saints? <q>Me thinks

the viÅ¿ion to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the tenth of the <hi>Acts</hi> Å¿hould teach Å¿uch men their duty, <hi>when God Å¿aid unto</hi> Peter <hi>riÅ¿e kill and eat,</hi> Peter <hi>Å¿aid not Å¿o Lord, for I have never eaten any thing that is common and unclean; and the voyce Å¿aid, what God hath cleanÅ¿ed call not thou common.</hi> And this, Å¿aith the Scripture, was done thrice, that by the mouth of two or three WitneÅ¿Å¿es this truth might be confirmed to <hi>Peter</hi> and all other MiniÅ¿ters, not to call thoÅ¿e people common, prophane and unclean, and to count them but rubbiÅ¿h, whom God hath graced with the gifts of his holy Spirit, and hath Å¿anctified, and Å¿uch as beleeve in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and are baptized as well as themÅ¿elves, and Å¿uch as Å¿tood to the truth when they durÅ¿t not Å¿hew their faces, but ran from the CauÅ¿e and deÅ¿erted it, or at leaÅ¿t temporized, and Å¿uch as if the like occaÅ¿ions were offered, would manifeÅ¿t unto the world (by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance) that their lives and all they have Å¿hould not be dear unto them for the reÅ¿timony of JeÅ¿us; and yet Å¿uch as theÅ¿e muÅ¿t be debarred from the communion in their AÅ¿Å¿emblies, unleÅ¿Å¿e they will conforme to their new-born traditions; for theÅ¿e are no traditions of the Elders, but of the younger: and if ChriÅ¿t in his time Å¿harply reproved thoÅ¿e that brake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God through the traditions of men, and deeply reproved the MiniÅ¿ters in thoÅ¿e dayes for teaching the people to preferre the traditions of the Elders before the commandements of God, and for teaching them the fear of God after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men: What Å¿hall we think thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters will have to anÅ¿wer at the dreadfull day of judgement, when they Å¿et up their traditions in the Church of God and preferre them before the Commandements of God? and what can any man think of the condition of that people, that account of Å¿uch novelties as the Oracles of God, and violate the law of Love, and make rents and Å¿chiÅ¿ms in the Å¿eamleÅ¿Å¿e garment of the church through theÅ¿e traditions?</q> Surely whatÅ¿oever they may promiÅ¿e to themÅ¿elves, their condition is very dangerous; for our Saviour Å¿aith, <hi>Woe be to thoÅ¿e by whom offences come,</hi> Matthew 18, <hi>and whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall offend one of theÅ¿e little ones that beleeve in me, it were better for him that a milÅ¿tone were hanged about his necke, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Å¿ea.</hi> And whether this be not to tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿e the the Commandements of God through their traditions and to offend thoÅ¿e little ones that beleeve in ChriÅ¿t, when they

will not receive Å¿uch into the communion and fellowÅ¿hip of the church, as beleeve and are baptized, but count them as aliens and Å¿trangers, yea, infidels and rubbiÅ¿h, I referre my Å¿elfe to any that is but of ordinary underÅ¿tanding. For Gods command unto all MiniÅ¿ters was, that they Å¿hould admit all Å¿uch into the church as beleeved and were baptized upon their deÅ¿iring it, without any confeÅ¿sion, either private or publicke, or entring into any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Now this command of God they trangreÅ¿Å¿e by their traditions, and keepe out many thouÅ¿ands of Beleevers through the Kingdome, as unholy, and as having no right to the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauÅ¿e forÅ¿ooth they will not obey their new-borne Lawes and Traditions; for where did ever God command that no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers Å¿hould bee admitted into the church except they made a publicke confeÅ¿sion of their faith, and walked Å¿ome time in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowÅ¿hip amongÅ¿t them, and then gave in the evidences of their converÅ¿ion, and entred into a private covenant, and gave the Church Å¿atisfaction? Or where was it ever practiÅ¿ed by any of the Primitive chriÅ¿tians, either by thoÅ¿e that were converted by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Sermons and the other ApoÅ¿tles, or by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching? was <hi>Lydia</hi> (when God opened her heart to beleeve <hi>Pauls</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching) admitted into the church upon any Å¿uch termes? was the Goaler and his converted family forced to make a publicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion to the church of their faith, and to give in the evidences of their converÅ¿ion, and to enter into a private convenant before they could be made Members of the Church, or was the Churches aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent required before they could be admitted and made members of it, or were ever any of theÅ¿e things they impoÅ¿e upon ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now, required at beleevers hands before theÅ¿e our times? and therefore they are to be abominated as vaine traditions, and Å¿uch as by which they breake the Lawes of God, making diviÅ¿ions in the Church and Kingdome, and through all the families, and houÅ¿es of the Å¿ame, Å¿o that neither MaÅ¿ters of families nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have any rule over their wives, children or Å¿ervants: their husbands goe out one way, the wife another, their children to this AÅ¿Å¿embly, their Å¿ervants to that Congregation, and as it was among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> blames in them, one Å¿aid, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> another I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the third I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and Å¿o they flutter about like a company of chickings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either heads or wit, and none will bee under obedience

by BaptiÅ¿me into the Church, I conceive the reaÅ¿on why the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did not intermeddle to hinder their admittance to that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of BaptiÅ¿me, was not becauÅ¿e they had not that liberty, but becauÅ¿e they had no juÅ¿t objections to declare to <hi>Peter.</hi> Now that the Brethren had a liberty to declare any thing which might juÅ¿tly have hindred, doth appeare by the queÅ¿tion the ApoÅ¿tle expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>(Å¿aith hee) I conceive hee meant propounded, verÅ¿e 47.</hi> Can any man forbid water that theÅ¿e Å¿hould not bee baptized?

                  <hi>My Brother</hi> Burtons <hi>words are theÅ¿e, page 17.</hi> It is one thing <hi>(Å¿aith he)</hi> to preach, and inÅ¿trumentally to convert Å¿oules, which chiefly pertaines to thoÅ¿e that are called thereunto, but in the caÅ¿e of Church-government, of admitting and casting out, it is otherwiÅ¿e.

Å¿hould not be baptized? &amp;c. Which words imply, that if any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions could have been made, it was in thoÅ¿e Jews preÅ¿ent, to give forth their allegations, why thoÅ¿e beleeving Gentiles Å¿hould not be admitted to become one Church with the beleeving Jews: So as your ObÅ¿ervations fall to the ground: as that firÅ¿t, <hi>Peter</hi> was Å¿ent to and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We <hi>(faith he)</hi> Å¿peak of Churches constituted, not of Å¿ingle converts here and there one, not yet joyned into a particular Church-body.</p>
               <p>Thus my brother <hi>Burton</hi> declareth himÅ¿elfe, whoÅ¿e words I have faithfully Å¿et down and all he hath to Å¿ay againÅ¿t all thoÅ¿e examples.</p>
               <p>But before I come to my anÅ¿wer I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire the Reader to take notice of theÅ¿e mens dealings, they make all theÅ¿e examples either extravagants or extraordinary, and yet they would from the example of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> queÅ¿tion to the brethren that came along with him, inferre that the authority of admiÅ¿Å¿ion of Members, lay not onely in the MiniÅ¿ters hand but in the peoples alÅ¿o, as who had the liberty to bring in their exceptions againÅ¿t any for their not admiÅ¿Å¿ion. So that theÅ¿e men at pleaÅ¿ure will make the Å¿ame Scripture they except againÅ¿t as not authoritative and binding for us, yet to be bindingly preÅ¿identiall for themÅ¿elvs; So that as far as in their own opinion it makes for their grolleries and Å¿erves their turn it Å¿hall be for a pattern of imitation to bind all Churches to the end of the world, which both MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> and my brother <hi>Burton</hi> learnedly inferre; but as far as it makes for the advantage of the Presbyterian opinion and to Å¿hew that the Presbyters have the Å¿ole authority of admitting Members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>fellowÅ¿hip from the example of <hi>Philip, Ananias, Paul</hi> in baptizing the <hi>Goaler</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> baptizing of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and admitting of him and thoÅ¿e that were with him Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into Church communion by their Å¿ole authority without thoÅ¿e conditions they propound and without the conÅ¿ent of the people, then they cry out that they are extraordinary examples or meer extravagants. Now whether this be not with the PapiÅ¿ts to make the Word of God a noÅ¿e of wax or a leaden rule that they may either work and mould it or bend it into what faÅ¿hion
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:48122:335"/>
they pleaÅ¿e, I leave it to the judgement of the learned and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ChriÅ¿tian. But by the way alÅ¿o I deÅ¿ire the Reader to take notice what my brother <hi>Burton</hi> granteth: <hi>viz. that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of thoÅ¿e Gentiles, and the admitting of them by</hi> Peter <hi>into the Church by BaptiÅ¿m, was to make them one Church with the beleeving Jews;</hi> theÅ¿e are his own words: From which it is Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently apparent, that be men baptized and admitted into the Church either after an ordinary way or after an extraordinary, it is Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to incorporate them into Church-fellowÅ¿hip both with the beleeving Jew and Gentile and to make them Members of <hi>ChriÅ¿ts Church,</hi> which is as much as I contend for: So that it is moÅ¿t certain as thoÅ¿e that are Members of any particular Church, are by vertue of that, Members alÅ¿o of the whole Catholique viÅ¿ible Church: Å¿o in like manner thoÅ¿e that are made Members of the Catholique viÅ¿ible Church may alÅ¿o by vertue of that, be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any particular church: for the Church of ChriÅ¿t is his Kingdome, and it is but one Flock and one Sheepfold, and there is but one Shepherd of it and King that governs it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in whatÅ¿oever part of this Kingdome of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t they are admitted Members, and after what manner Å¿oever they be admitted, whether in an ordinary or an extraordinary way, they are Members of the whole Church and may communicate in all ordinances with any particular Church whatÅ¿oever as being Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome and injoying all the immunities and priviledges that any of ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ubjects can challenge. And all this I learn from my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> doctrine, who Å¿o long as he holdeth out any truth unto me, I will liÅ¿ten unto, as he hath done in this point, but no farther. Again as all thoÅ¿e, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eunuch, Paul, Cornelius, Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>Goaler,</hi> were admitted to be Members of <hi>ChriÅ¿ts Church</hi> by the Å¿ole authority of the MiniÅ¿ters, EvangeliÅ¿ts and ApoÅ¿tles, and without any of thoÅ¿e conditions urged by the brethren; Å¿o are all other ChriÅ¿tians by the Å¿ole authority of the Presbyters to be admitted into church-fellowÅ¿hip, and that upon ChriÅ¿ts own conditions: <hi>viz. Faith, Repentance and BaptiÅ¿m.</hi> Having upon the occaÅ¿ion of my brother <hi>Burtons</hi> and <hi>HanÅ¿erdoes</hi> words Å¿pake thus much, I will now come to my AnÅ¿wer to them both.</p>

Å¿aith, <hi>Can any man forbid water that theÅ¿e men Å¿hould not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> &amp;c. that it doth imply that the brethren have power alÅ¿o of admitting Members into the church and ought to have their voices, as in the receiving of them in Å¿o in the caÅ¿ting of them out.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith <hi>Who Å¿hall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? Who is he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? who Å¿hall Å¿eparate us from the love of ChriÅ¿t?</hi> All the which interrogations do not imply as the ApoÅ¿tle himÅ¿elfe anÅ¿wereth, that any creature can lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, or that any creature can condemn, or that any creature can Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Elect from the love of God which is in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us. Another inÅ¿tance (to omit many) we have of the Å¿ame nature with that of <hi>Peter</hi> Acts 8. 35. <hi>Where the</hi> Eunuch <hi>Å¿aid unto</hi> Philip, <hi>See here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> I demand of any whether or no this interrogation of his doth not imply as much as if he had Å¿aid, no creature now can hinder me from <hi>BaptiÅ¿m,</hi> Å¿eeing that we have water that element that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it, and I do beleeve: And Å¿o much may be gathered from <hi>Philips</hi> AnÅ¿wer to him, who Å¿aith, nothing could hinder his baptiÅ¿m and admiÅ¿Å¿ion into the Church, <hi>if he did beleeve in ChriÅ¿t with all his heart;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Eunuch</hi> anÅ¿wered, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that JeÅ¿us Christ is the Son of God;</hi> and he was forthwith baptized.

               <p>And this Å¿hall Å¿uffice for anÅ¿wer to that impious cavill of my Brother <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>HanÅ¿erdo.</hi> Now for that inÅ¿tance that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter <hi>Knollys</hi> bringeth, it quite overthroweth their doctrine, for it is point banke againÅ¿t it and their practiÅ¿e. For although it be not denyed, but that all true beleevers may at any time make their complaint to the Church, that is to Å¿ay to thoÅ¿e that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church; to wit, the Presbyters, as the extreameÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge upon juÅ¿t offence; yet it muÅ¿t ever be granted that it lyeth in the breÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e that are Iudges to determine of the buÅ¿ines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the allegations and probations, Å¿o that thoÅ¿e that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine may not be both Plaintifs and Iudges; this I Å¿ay is Å¿o known a maxime that none can deny it. BeÅ¿ides, we muÅ¿t take notice that we never read inall the New TeÅ¿tament, that the diÅ¿ciples ever Å¿o much as queÅ¿tioned any that deÅ¿ired to be admitted into church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Å¿hip, or refuÅ¿ed communion to any but <hi>Paul;</hi> &amp; the reaÅ¿on was as the Scripture relateth, becauÅ¿e they knew that hee had beene a mortall enemy unto them, and had beene a great PerÅ¿ecutor, and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:48122:337"/>
were then ignorant of his converÅ¿ion, and therefore it is Å¿aid they were affraid of him; and upon the like occaÅ¿ion I beleeve any of the brethren in any church may doe the Å¿ame, and they may feare Å¿uch an one, and Å¿uÅ¿pect him, and complaine of him, and that is all they can doe, but power they have none to keepe him out of Church-fellowÅ¿hip if upon the MiniÅ¿ters and Presbyters exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the buÅ¿ines they find that the man is a beleever, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from his Å¿infull courÅ¿es; for by their Å¿ole authority without their good liking, or the conÅ¿ent of the people they may admit him into church fellowÅ¿hip; and if the people Å¿hould refuÅ¿e to receive him upon his aÅ¿Å¿aying to joyne himÅ¿elfe with them, hee may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from them to the Presbyters and MiniÅ¿ters who are Gods Stewards, and who have the power of the Keyes to open the doore of the church to whom they conceive are fit: and for this his Å¿o doing, and for the Presbyters accepting of his appeale they have the ApoÅ¿tles and Presbyters of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> for an example; for when the DiÅ¿ciples feared <hi>Paul,</hi> and Å¿eemed to be unwilling to admit him into communion with them: Hee forth with appeals to the ApoÅ¿tles, who upon his appeale admitted him into church fellowÅ¿hip according to their commiÅ¿Å¿ion, which was, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever beleeved and was baptized, hee Å¿hould be received into the church and that without the conÅ¿ent of the people, or any of thoÅ¿e conditions the Independents now impoÅ¿e upon their Members, as by this very example and inÅ¿tance of Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi> doth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, which makes wholly againÅ¿t their doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e, and utterly overthrowes their tenent: for moÅ¿t certaine it is that the power of admitting of Members, and caÅ¿ting out of offenders lies in thoÅ¿e mens hands only and Å¿olely that have the power of the Keyes, and are by God himÅ¿elfe made Stewards and Over-Å¿eers, and Guids of his Church his houÅ¿e, which when they peculiarly belong unto the Presbyters, and not to the people, they onely, and not the people ought to have the managing of the government of the church; and this hath beene Å¿ufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the receiving in of Members, both in an ordinary way, and in an extraordinary manner, by all the examples I have produced, and by this very inÅ¿tance of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> alleaged by MaÅ¿ter <hi>Knol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys</hi> himÅ¿elfe, who when hee was admitted into Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, not onely without the conÅ¿ent of the brethren, but againÅ¿t their good liking it is abundantly manifeÅ¿t, that the people have
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:48122:337"/>
nothing to doe with the government of the Church, but that it lyeth wholly in the Presbyters hands. And all this I Å¿ay is clearly proved out of the good Word of God, within the wals of the which, it is ever Å¿afe to abide, and in the action of obedience to the which all men may promiÅ¿e to themÅ¿elves perpetuall Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: and this Å¿hall Å¿uffice to have anÅ¿wered to all that Mr. <hi>Knol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys</hi> and my Brother <hi>Burton</hi> had to Å¿ay to all my Arguments.</p>
               <p>And by all that I have now Å¿poke, I hope it doth Å¿ufficiently appeare that there is neither precept nor example through all the Holy Scripture to warrant the practiÅ¿e of theÅ¿e men in the gathering of their new Churches; and if a man will but looke a little more upon the practice of ChriÅ¿ts Å¿eventy diÅ¿ciples, &amp; of all the ApoÅ¿tles in the gathering of Churches, they Å¿hall not find one footÅ¿tep through the whole Booke of God of the gathering Churches after the manner of their congregating of their aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: as for ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples, they were all Å¿ent to gather in the loÅ¿t Å¿heep of the houÅ¿e of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> they went not to gather in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted men from amongÅ¿t converted men, for they were to bring the loÅ¿t Å¿heepe into ChriÅ¿ts fold (and wee are taught there is but one Shepheard and one Å¿heep-fold) wee never read that after they were once folded and brought into the Church, that any true PaÅ¿tors came into the fold and flocks of their fellow-Å¿hepheards; and picked out all the beÅ¿t and the fatteÅ¿t Å¿heep, and the moÅ¿t whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome, and molded them into an Independent Fold by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, as Å¿eparate and diÅ¿tinct from the others, and with the which they would have no fellowÅ¿hip and communion in the Ordinances, this was never heard of before theÅ¿e dayes: <hi>Paul</hi> was Å¿o farre from getting away of others Å¿heepe that hee tooke it for a diÅ¿honour to him to build upon anothers foundation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and preached ChriÅ¿t in thoÅ¿e places where they had never heard of him before; and planted the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> himÅ¿elfe, and left <hi>Apollo</hi> to water it, and committed all the flocks that he had gathered, as that of <hi>EpheÅ¿us,</hi> to the charge and care of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full PaÅ¿tors, and commands both the flocks and the PaÅ¿tors, and in them all Shepheards and Folds, to keepe unity and love one with another, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 4. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. &amp;c. and forbids them to make Å¿eparations and diviÅ¿ions, and Å¿chiÅ¿mes betweene flock and flock, and this method hee uÅ¿ed whereÅ¿oever hee came; yea, as Å¿oone as hee was converted and entred upon his miniÅ¿try, as wee

opened the eyes of the blind, and turned them from darkeneÅ¿Å¿e to light, and from the power of Satan unto God that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes, and inheritance amongÅ¿t them that are Å¿anctified by faith in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and taught the people that they Å¿hould repent and turne to God, and doe workes meet for repentance; and that inÅ¿tructed all men that they being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the hands of their enemies, they Å¿hould Å¿erve God without feare, in holineÅ¿Å¿e and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e before him all the dayes of their life, and teaching them that the grace of God bringing Å¿alvation, hath appeared to all men, for this very end that they Å¿hould deny all ungodlineÅ¿Å¿e and worldly luÅ¿ts, and Å¿hould live Å¿oberly, righteouÅ¿ly and godly in this preÅ¿ent world, looking for that bleÅ¿Å¿ed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God of our Saviour IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, who gave himÅ¿elfe for us, that hee might redeeme us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himÅ¿elfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes.

               <p>It was the greateÅ¿t calamity to the poore Å¿ufferers under the Prelats tyrannie, and to all thoÅ¿e diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed chriÅ¿tians that were haled into the High-commiÅ¿Å¿ion court, or into the Star-chamber, or before the CounÅ¿ell-table for matter of Religion and conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (which was the lot of many thouÅ¿ands through the whole Kingdome) that commonly their greateÅ¿t enemies were thoÅ¿e of their owne houÅ¿e; their parents, their brethren and Å¿iÅ¿ters would be the chiefeÅ¿t calumniators and reproachers of them, and that in word and deed would moÅ¿t deÅ¿pightfully perÅ¿ecute them, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the common humanity of hoÅ¿pitality, and would not Å¿o much as looke on them, except it were to revile them and inÅ¿ult over them, and would ordinarily joyne with their enemies both privately and publickly, and deÅ¿ert them in their greateÅ¿t Å¿treights, as all of them can generally witneÅ¿Å¿e, which not onely encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their enemies againÅ¿t them, but added credit to their falÅ¿e ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and calumnies; for they would uÅ¿ually Å¿ay, ye may Å¿ee what manner of men theÅ¿e are, whoÅ¿e nigheÅ¿t friends are not only aÅ¿hamed of, but thus Å¿peake of them; which was a greater affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto them than all the other miÅ¿eries and Å¿ufferings they under-went; for had they beene their profeÅ¿Å¿ed enemies, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> Å¿aid, they could eaÅ¿ily have endured it, and there would leÅ¿Å¿e credit and regard have beene given to their words; but they were their parents, brethren, Å¿iÅ¿ters and familiars, and therefore it added more Å¿harpely to their affliction: So had they beene our profeÅ¿Å¿ed enemies as PapiÅ¿ts, Socinians, Arminians, or thoÅ¿e of the Prelaticall faction that Å¿hould have proclaimed us enemies of ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdome, and had they denyed unto us and our children the Å¿eales of grace, with all church-communion, it would not have troubled us; but <hi>tu Brute!</hi> that Brethren, that fellow-Å¿ufferers in affliction, that had gone up to the houÅ¿e of God together, and had taken Å¿weet counÅ¿ell together; that they Å¿hould now proclaime us the enemies of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and deny communion with us; oh let not this bee Å¿poken in <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>AÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelon!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that that grieves and Å¿ads the hearts of their brethren more then all their former afflictions, and gives a great advantage to the common enemy, and Å¿candalizes the GoÅ¿pel, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es

               <p>But this is that that makes all men wonder, to heare them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime all the MiniÅ¿ters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be Å¿uch as <hi>deny, diÅ¿claime, and preach againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿ts Kingly government,</hi> when it is apparently evident, both by all their preachings and writings, and all their practices, that they ever advance ChriÅ¿ts Kingly government as really as any of thoÅ¿e that oppoÅ¿e them, who in preaching up the Kingly office of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿etting ChriÅ¿t upon his Throne, are inferiour to none of them in this work: For we are taught out of Gods Word, that thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t in his Throne, that open the eyes of the blind, and turne them from darkeneÅ¿Å¿e to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God, that they might receive forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes, and an inheritance amongÅ¿t them that are Å¿anctified by faith in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and that teach men to repent and turne to God, and doe workes meet for repentance; and when the people that heare them give themÅ¿elves firÅ¿t to the Lord and upto his MiniÅ¿ters by the will of God, and after denying all ungodlineÅ¿Å¿e and worldly luÅ¿ts, live Å¿oberly, righteouÅ¿ly and godly in this preÅ¿ent world.</p>
               <p>And this, the Word of God teacheth us, is to Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne; and thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters that teach all theÅ¿e things, Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t upon his Throne, and thoÅ¿e people that embrace this doctrine, make ChriÅ¿t their King, as we may Å¿ee 2 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 12. For ChriÅ¿t Å¿its as King upon his Throne when hee is beleeved in to bee that horne of Å¿alvation, that was raiÅ¿ed up for us in the houÅ¿e of <hi>David,</hi> that has Å¿aved and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all that beleeve in him, out of the hands of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both Å¿pirituall and bodily, that they may Å¿erve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, and when ChriÅ¿t rules in all their hearts by the Scepter of his Word and Spirit, and when they owne him as their onely Law-giver, and acknowledge him to be the onely King in his Church, and the Saviour of all thoÅ¿e that truly beleeve in him;

and this is to Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t upon his Throne, and the brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves accord unto this.</p>
               <p>Now when the MiniÅ¿ters of <hi>England</hi> teach this doctrine, in their preachings and writings, how can they be truly Å¿aid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, diÅ¿claim and preach againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿ts Kingly government, over mens conÅ¿ciences and Churches? and how can that people be Å¿aid truly to deny ChriÅ¿ts Kingly government who do both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and to the uttermoÅ¿t of their power practice this doctrine and follow onely the guidance of his holy Spirit and Word, both for doctrine and government, who is King of the Church? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore this be not an unjuÅ¿t and unchriÅ¿tian calumny, laid both upon the MiniÅ¿ters and people of the church of <hi>England,</hi> I leave it to the conÅ¿ideration of any moderate minded chriÅ¿tian! doubtles all charitable minded chriÅ¿tians if they conÅ¿ider all things aright, will not think Å¿o diÅ¿honourably neither of the MiniÅ¿ters of <hi>England</hi> not of the people under their MiniÅ¿tery; for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve not to be accounted the profeÅ¿t enemies of ChriÅ¿t, who are freed from that heavy accuÅ¿ation by ChriÅ¿ts own teÅ¿timony; who when it was related unto him by Saint <hi>John, Mark</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 38. <hi>That they had Å¿een one caÅ¿ting out devills in his name, which followed them not, and that the DiÅ¿ciples had forbad him becauÅ¿e he did not follow them:</hi> Our Saviour ChriÅ¿t replying, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him not,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>for whoÅ¿oever is not againÅ¿t us is on our part.</hi>

               <p>Now theÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters that open the eyes of the blind, and turne them from darkneÅ¿Å¿e to light, and from the power of Satan to God, they cannot be eÅ¿teemed enemies of ChriÅ¿t, and to be againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿t but for him, and ought highly to be honoured for their works Å¿ake 1 <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿. chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and Å¿ingularly, <hi>to be beloved,</hi> and deÅ¿erve not to be maligned and reproached, eÅ¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by brethren who owe all their converÅ¿ions next unto God, to their MiniÅ¿tery; yea, both the PaÅ¿tors and people of all the new congregated churches are beholding unto them for their converÅ¿ion; for they admit none into their AÅ¿Å¿emblies but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and they were made beleevers and converted by their MiniÅ¿tery; and therefore they are friends of ChriÅ¿t and not his enemies, and they ought all of them to look upon them as their Fathers, and on the church of <hi>England</hi> as their Mother, and on the beleevers of <hi>England</hi> as their brethren, and ought not thus

unchriÅ¿tianly and ungratefully to caÅ¿t dirt in all their faces.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>EpiÅ¿tle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians, chap.</hi> 1. hath theÅ¿e words, <hi>Some</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>preach ChriÅ¿t even of envy and Å¿trife, and Å¿ome alÅ¿o of good will; the one preach ChriÅ¿t of contention and not Å¿incerely, thinking to adde affliction to my bonds, but the other of love: What then? notwithÅ¿tanding every way, whether in pretence or in truth ChriÅ¿t be preached, I therein do rejoyce, yea, and I will rejoyce.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaks here of Å¿uch as preach pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, though not with a pure mind, and was glad that ChriÅ¿t was preached, and counts them not the enemies of ChriÅ¿t, as he did the falÅ¿e teachers among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who joyned the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law and their own inventions with the GoÅ¿pel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wiÅ¿ht that they were cut off; but in this place he rejoyces that ChriÅ¿t and the GoÅ¿pell were purely preached, though it were of envy.</p>
               <p>Now when the MiniÅ¿ters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do not only preach the GoÅ¿pell purely, but of Å¿incerity and of love, and mingle not their own traditions and inventions with the GoÅ¿pell, but follow their commiÅ¿Å¿ion; how can any men without intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable injuÅ¿tice proclame them the enemies of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and make them odious to the people under the name of Presbyterians, whom they perÅ¿wade all men, that they will prove more cruell TaskmaÅ¿ters then the Prelates? yea and they have generally poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿t the people with Å¿o prejudicate an opinion of them all, as if they would more lord it over them than ever the BiÅ¿hops did, and cauÅ¿leÅ¿ly have moved the people to hate the name of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: And notwithÅ¿tanding they themÅ¿elves pretend they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the ancient Presbytery, and by this make themÅ¿elves PreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians as well as the other: What juÅ¿tice or equity then is there in their dealing, to make their brethren odious to the world for endeavouring to Å¿et up a Presbytery after Gods Word, when they themÅ¿elves are Presbyterians, and labor to Å¿et up a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of their own? and therefore if the name of Presbyters be odious in the MiniÅ¿ters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no reaÅ¿on can gainÅ¿ay it, but that they alÅ¿o Å¿hould be as odious to the people as their brethren, for they alÅ¿o are Presbyterians. But that the truth may the better appear, whether the MiniÅ¿ters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Independent MiniÅ¿ters, be moÅ¿t guilty of all the accuÅ¿ations laid to their charge, it will not be a miÅ¿Å¿e to compare
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:48122:342"/>
the practice of the MiniÅ¿ters of the church of <hi>England</hi> and the proceedings of the Independent MiniÅ¿ters together, and that both for their doctrine and diÅ¿cipline, and in their Å¿everall Å¿tudies and endeavours, for the advancing of ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome; and by Å¿o doing it will be eaÅ¿ie for any to judge, which of their governments and which of the MiniÅ¿ters are more intolerable, and which of them are moÅ¿t guilty of thoÅ¿e foule reproaches the MiniÅ¿ters of the church of <hi>England</hi> are aÅ¿perÅ¿ed with by their Brethren; for he hath a Å¿hallow underÅ¿tanding and a very dim Å¿ight that cannot diÅ¿cern, whether thoÅ¿e that advance ChriÅ¿ts their Kings Word and Laws onely, and follow his commiÅ¿Å¿ion and the example of the holy ApoÅ¿tles in their MiniÅ¿teries, and that of <hi>John</hi> BaptiÅ¿t and the primitive Preachers, or thoÅ¿e that Å¿et up their own inventions and prefer them before the Laws of ChriÅ¿t, and have neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nor preÅ¿ident for their doings in all the holy Word of God: He I Å¿ay, that cannot judge which of theÅ¿e moÅ¿t advance ChriÅ¿t for their King, either thoÅ¿e that obey ChriÅ¿ts Laws, or thoÅ¿e that obÅ¿erve their own, neglecting ChriÅ¿ts, is of a very Å¿hallow ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
               <p>But now let us compare them together; the MiniÅ¿ters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> preach faith and repentance, the Law and the GoÅ¿pell, according to ChriÅ¿ts commiÅ¿Å¿ion given to his ApoÅ¿tles, and they receive all into the Church that beleeve and are baptized, and Å¿uch as but deÅ¿ire to be admitted, they demanding of them what they Å¿hould do to be Å¿aved; and in their Å¿o doing they have both precept and preÅ¿idents: For ChriÅ¿t in his commiÅ¿Å¿ion unto them hath given them authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Å¿o to do.</p>
               <p>Neither did he ever Å¿ay unto his ApoÅ¿tles and MiniÅ¿ters, admit none into the church, although they beleeve and are baptized, without they walk with you Å¿ome dayes weeks, moneths or years, that you may behold their converÅ¿ation and manner of life, and after you have had Å¿ome tryall and experience of them, Å¿ee then that they make a publike confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith before the church and give in the evidences of the truth of their converÅ¿ion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the congregation, and enter into a private and Å¿olemne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and be admitted by the conÅ¿ent and approbation of the Church; or otherwiÅ¿e, if they will not Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves to this Law, and come into the Church upon theÅ¿e conditions,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:48122:343"/>
receive them not into your AÅ¿Å¿emblies, nor admit of them for members.</p>
               <p>Here is nothing of all this in ChriÅ¿ts CommiÅ¿Å¿ion, nor in his holy Word, nor any preÅ¿ident of the Å¿ame in Å¿acred Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore <hi>John</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t and the holy ApoÅ¿tles and primitive MiniÅ¿ters admitted all that came unto them, and Å¿uch as but demanded of them what they Å¿hould do to be Å¿aved; and baptized them and received them into the Church without any gainÅ¿aying or queÅ¿tion; as we may Å¿ee in the third of <hi>Luke,</hi> and in the Å¿eventh chapter of the Å¿ame book, and in the Å¿econd of the <hi>Acts;</hi> and no Å¿ooner did the Eunuch deÅ¿ire baptiÅ¿me, but <hi>Philip</hi> granted it; the Goaler did but aske <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> What they Å¿hould do to be Å¿aved, and they Å¿aid, <hi>Beleeve on the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and thou Å¿halt be Å¿aved and thy houÅ¿e;</hi> and it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Goaler and all his were Å¿treight way baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 31, 32, 33. that is, they were forthwith admitted into the Church, without either walking any time with the Church for their approbation, or without either making a publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith before the Church, or giving in evidences of the truth of their converÅ¿ion to the congregation, or entring into a private covenant, and without the conÅ¿ent and allowance of the Church.</p>
               <p>And ChriÅ¿t notwithÅ¿tanding was imbraced by them as their Lord and King, and was preached by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> as the Lord and King of his Church, and was Å¿et up upon his Throne as King by them, as well as he is in any Independent Churches, and yet they had none of all their new borne truths, and they could then Å¿ee how to Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t upon his Throne without their new lights; and as ChriÅ¿t was then by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> and the other ApoÅ¿tles Å¿et upon his Throne as King in all thoÅ¿e primitive Churches, Å¿o he is at this day in all the true ProteÅ¿tant Churches through the world, as well as in any of the Independent AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and yet they were and are all ignorant of their new way; Å¿o that any underÅ¿tanding chriÅ¿tian may gather, that all their new borne truths are no way requiÅ¿ite for the Å¿etting up of ChriÅ¿t as King in his Church, nor for the advancement of ChriÅ¿ts Kingly government; for if they had, ChriÅ¿t would have put them into the ApoÅ¿tles CommiÅ¿Å¿ion, and the ApoÅ¿tles who were led into all truth by the holy GhoÅ¿t, who brought whatÅ¿oever ChriÅ¿t had
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:48122:343"/>

               <p>I Å¿hall now demand of any moderate chriÅ¿tian therefore, and let him anÅ¿wer me candidly, whether of thoÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters and people moÅ¿t advance the Kingdome of ChriÅ¿t, and acknowledge him to be their onely Lord and Law-giver, that both in their teaching and beleeving follow his commiÅ¿Å¿ion and Word, and teach nothing nor beleeve nothing (as they are injoyned) but what ChriÅ¿t their King commands them? or thoÅ¿e, that to the commiÅ¿Å¿ion and commands of ChriÅ¿t adde their own inventions and traditions, and preferre them before the lawes of ChriÅ¿t the King and Law giver of his Church?

both teachers and hearers, the one <hi>for bringing in or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ceremoniall Law to the GoÅ¿pel,</hi> and the other <hi>for admitting of them,</hi> how highly would God have beene diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed with them if they had Å¿et up their owne inventions for the Lawes of God, and had brought in new borne truths, and intruded them upon the people as neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿alvation, and for the Å¿etting up of ChriÅ¿t upon his Throne? Without doubt the ApoÅ¿tle would moÅ¿t Å¿harpely have reproved them, and have given Å¿peciall cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats againÅ¿t them, as hee did in his EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>ColoÅ¿sians,</hi> the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>chapter</hi> of the which is chiefly Å¿pent in condemning all humane traditions; yea, in his firÅ¿t <hi>chapter</hi> of his EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Galatians, verÅ¿e</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Hee chargeth them, that though the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves, or an Angel from Heaven Å¿hould preach unto them otherwiÅ¿e than that they had received, they Å¿hould count him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curÅ¿ed; and as J Å¿aid before,</hi> Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>Å¿o Å¿ay I now againe, if any man preach unto you otherwiÅ¿e than that you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let him be accurÅ¿ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But none of the ApoÅ¿tles ever taught the Church, that chriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and beleevers, though baptized, Å¿hould not bee admitted as members into the Church, unleÅ¿Å¿e they had walked Å¿ome time in church-fellowÅ¿hip with them, and had firÅ¿t made a publicke confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith, and had brought in the evidences of the truth of their converÅ¿ion, and entred into a Å¿olemne private co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and were admitted by the conÅ¿ent of the church; none of all this did ever the ApoÅ¿tles teach, or the chriÅ¿tians of thoÅ¿e times embrace or beleeve, and therefore Å¿uch doctrines as theÅ¿e ought not to be received.</p>
               <p>In the firÅ¿t of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in many places he reproves thoÅ¿e that made Å¿chiÅ¿mes and brought in hereÅ¿ies and Å¿ects into the Church; and in the fourth <hi>chapter</hi> and Å¿ixth <hi>verÅ¿e,</hi> under his owne and <hi>Apollo's</hi> name, hee Å¿ets an example before them, that they Å¿hould containe themÅ¿elves within the limits and bounds of that doctrine and manner of preaching, preÅ¿cribed and Å¿et downe in the Word of God, and uÅ¿ed by the Spirit of God; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them that they Å¿hould learne in the ApoÅ¿tles, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume or to be wiÅ¿e above that which is written, and enjoynes all chriÅ¿tians to reject all wayes of teaching that have not Gods Word for their warrant: Now in all Gods Word there is nothing of all this written, that after men beleeve and are baptized, they

               <p>And in the 2 of the <hi>Corinths, c.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>v.</hi> 4. the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ignifieth unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that no man can teach the GoÅ¿pel &amp; the things of of heaven more exactly than he and the other ApoÅ¿tles have taught them, nor Å¿et before them a more perfect Doctrine of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t than that that they have taught them, for the converting of any unto ChriÅ¿t, and for the Å¿etting up of ChriÅ¿t as King upon his Throne, and for the making of them Members of the Church, and for the building of them up in their moÅ¿t holy faith, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to take heed of all falÅ¿e Teachers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever piety and godlineÅ¿Å¿e they make Å¿hew of, calling them <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull workers, and Å¿uch as transforme themÅ¿elves into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of ChriÅ¿t: And no marvaile,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>for Sat an himÅ¿elfe can transforme himÅ¿elfe into an Angel of light; and therefore it is no wonder his MiniÅ¿ters transforme themÅ¿elves, as though they were the MiniÅ¿ters of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if men will conÅ¿ider what thoÅ¿e falÅ¿e teachers were, wee Å¿hall find them to be no other, but Å¿uch as under Å¿hew of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e and piety taught their owne inventions and grolleries, and abuÅ¿ed the Å¿implicity of the people for their owne advantage, and brought them into bondage and devoured them, <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 20. as the PhatiÅ¿ees did the Widowes houÅ¿es, under pretence of their long prayers, which our Saviour ChriÅ¿t Å¿harpely reproves them for, and denounces a woe againÅ¿t them for their Å¿o doing; after the Å¿ame manner did theÅ¿e falÅ¿e Teachers amongÅ¿t the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who made their owne traditions joyned Members with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pel, as if they had had a more fine, neat &amp; eleganter way of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of churches, and admitting of Members than <hi>Paul</hi> and the other ApoÅ¿tles: But the ApoÅ¿tle bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> take heed of all Å¿uch, how glorious Å¿oever they Å¿eeme to appeare, and tels them they cannot teach the way to Heaven and happineÅ¿Å¿e better than hee and the other ApoÅ¿tles have done; and yet neither Saint <hi>Paul</hi> or any of the ApoÅ¿tles in preaching of the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:48122:345"/>
taught them that they Å¿hould admit of none to bee joyned Members of the Church, although they beleeved and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, except they walked Å¿ometime in fellowÅ¿hip amongÅ¿t them, that they might have approbation and tryall of their converÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firÅ¿t, and after make a publick confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith before the church, and did give in evidences of the truth of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ion to the congregation, and entred into a Å¿olemne private covenant, and were admitted Members by conÅ¿ent of the church.</p>
               <p>Not a word of all this in the GoÅ¿pel that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the other ApoÅ¿tles taught; and therefore all that teach their new wayes, their new-borne truths, and Å¿et up their new lights, are wiÅ¿e above that which is written, and teach otherwiÅ¿e than ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles have taught, or the chriÅ¿tians of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times had received, and therefore ought by the ApoÅ¿tles command, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 8. 9. to be accurÅ¿ed.

               </p>
               <p>Now the doctrine that the Independent MiniÅ¿ters teach for the gathering of churches and admitting of members, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and jumbling of them together, was never taught by ChriÅ¿t nor any of his ApoÅ¿tles; for they themÅ¿elves confeÅ¿Å¿e it is a new way, and a new<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>borne truth, and a new light, and therefore not the doctrine of ChriÅ¿t; and therefore Å¿uch novelties are not to be entertained nor imbraced, nor the teachers of them, if we will be obedient to ApoÅ¿tolicall precepts: I deÅ¿ire therefore thoÅ¿e of the Independent brethren to produce any one teÅ¿timony, or any one preÅ¿ident out of the Word of God, where theÅ¿e things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are taught or have beene practiÅ¿ed.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, that although men and women beleeve and are baptized, they are not yet to be admitted as joyned Members till they have walked Å¿ometime in fellowÅ¿hip with the church for approbation of their converÅ¿ation; this is the firÅ¿t thing; I deÅ¿ire of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren either a precept or an example for this in Gods Word.</p>
               <p>

The Å¿econd, where it is commanded that thoÅ¿e that beleeve and are baptized Å¿hould not be admitted as Members of the church, whithout a publike confeÅ¿Å¿ion of their faith before the church.</p>
               <p>The third, where it is enjoyned, that to their Faith and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, they Å¿hould bring in the evidences of the truth of their converÅ¿ion before they can be capable of their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip.</p>
               <p>The fourth, where it is commanded that they Å¿hould enter into a Å¿olemn and private covenant before they can be admitted to church-fellowÅ¿hip.</p>
               <p>The fifth, where it is impoÅ¿ed upon thoÅ¿e that beleeve and are baptized, that they Å¿hould not be received into the church without the conÅ¿ent of the congregation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, where it is commanded that the MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell Å¿hall run about from their own places and charges into the Å¿heepfolds of their fellow-Å¿hepherds, and Å¿eparate and pick out all their beÅ¿t Å¿heep and bring them into their own folds, and debar them from all church-fellowÅ¿hip and communicating with the other beleevers in Gods holy Ordinances and Sacraments; or where ever it is commanded that the Preachers of the GoÅ¿pel Å¿hall gather beleeving ChriÅ¿tians from among beleeving ChriÅ¿tians, and Å¿eparate them from the other Å¿heep, into Independent congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Å¿hall proclame all that are not thus moulded up after this new modell, to be people out of covenant, and to have no right to the Å¿eals of the new covenant, neither they nor their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though beleevers.</p>
               <p>All theÅ¿e things I deÅ¿ire the brethren by evident places of the holy Scripture to make good and to confirme, or by any preÅ¿ident or example to declare to have been practiÅ¿ed either by ChriÅ¿t or his bleÅ¿Å¿ed ApoÅ¿tles; for I look for a law from ChriÅ¿t the King of his church, who was as faithfull in the houÅ¿e of God as <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was, and hath not left the ordering and diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of his church to the will of men, but hath commanded the church to hear his voice, who is the great PaÅ¿tor and BiÅ¿hop of our Å¿ouls, and the teacher of his church; his Word therefore I look for, for a warrant for the ratifying of all theÅ¿e doctrines; and I have good ground and reaÅ¿on to demand of them a warrant and authority out of Gods Word for what they both teach and practice; for we are taught
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:48122:346"/>
by <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> the onely Prophet of his church, that they that Å¿erve God after the precepts of men, offer him a vain worÅ¿hip: and it Å¿tands with all good reaÅ¿on, that if all humane traditions, though of never Å¿o ancient Å¿tanding, and of never Å¿o long antiquity were all caÅ¿t out of the church, becauÅ¿e they had no footing or ground in Gods Word, that all novelties or new inventions of men (which notwithÅ¿tanding are impoÅ¿ed upon the people as the ways of God) Å¿hould be abrogated and nullified and caÅ¿t out of the church.</p>
               <p>It is recorded in holy writ, <hi>IoÅ¿hua</hi> 9. that the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>IoÅ¿hua</hi> and the people of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> under pretence that they came from a farre country, and for proofe of that they produced their mouldy bread, and their tattered botles and their old Å¿hooes, and they taking what they Å¿aid, <hi>pro confeÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and not conÅ¿ulting with the mouth of the Lord (as it is fully related in that <hi>chapter)</hi> were deceived by them, and entred into a League with their enemies: And thus the PapiÅ¿ts and Prelates, for theÅ¿e many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, have deluded the world, under pretence of their mouldy antiquities and tattered raggs of traditions, and in all this time they prevailed to miÅ¿lead the poore people, becauÅ¿e they conÅ¿ulted not with the mouth of God, nor examined things by the Word of God and the holy Scripture, as the noble <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Now whatÅ¿oever was written, was written for our inÅ¿truction, upon whom the ends of the world are come; and therefore as it was the errour of the <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> that they received things barely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on report, without conÅ¿ulting with the mouth of God; and as it was the honour and praiÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> that they Å¿ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Scriptures to Å¿ee whether the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> were according to the holy Scripture: Å¿o if we Å¿hall receive theÅ¿e new borne truths, theÅ¿e new lights, theÅ¿e new ways without conÅ¿ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the living Oracles, we Å¿hall offend as the <hi>IÅ¿raelites</hi> did in beleeving the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> upon their words, and Å¿hall degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and be unlike to thoÅ¿e the renowned <hi>Bereans,</hi> who would not receive <hi>Paul's</hi> doctrine, though an ApoÅ¿tle, without Å¿earching the Scriptures, whether things were Å¿o or no, as he taught them: and Å¿urely now much more ought we to try all things by the Word in theÅ¿e erroneous times, whoÅ¿oever they be that preach them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and if they be not evidently proved unto us out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:48122:347"/>
we may not admit of them; for it will be not only a Å¿in, but for our immortall Å¿hame to be deluded with novelties<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> much more then it was our anceÅ¿tors diÅ¿grace to be deceived by pretended an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore it is the duty of every ChriÅ¿tian Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider with themÅ¿elves,</hi> that theÅ¿e are matters of God, and concerne no leÅ¿Å¿e then our eternall welfare; <hi>and in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

otherwiiÅ¿e, that they deny &amp; diÅ¿claime and preach againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿ts Kingly government, and perÅ¿ecute the wayes of the Lord ChriÅ¿t; Å¿o that they can find more favour from moderate PapiÅ¿ts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ProteÅ¿tants than from them, by which their dealing, Å¿ay the Brethren, they have Å¿o taken off the edge of Gods peoples affection from them, that the Saints and Å¿ervants of God cannot pray for them, proclaiming themÅ¿elves the Saints and people of God, as if all the other beleevers through the Kingdome diÅ¿Å¿enting from them in their opinions, were no Saints nor people of God.</p>
               <p>Nay, they affirme it in their Pulpits, and in every Pamphlet, that both MiniÅ¿ters and people are enemies of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdome, and all Å¿uch as will not joyne with them in their new wayes: And one of them not long Å¿ince affirmed unto me, that the church of <hi>England</hi> was a Strumpet and an arrant Whore, and that Å¿hee being once a Whore, could never be preÅ¿ented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ChriÅ¿t as a chaÅ¿te SpouÅ¿e: which was an expreÅ¿Å¿ion not onely uncivill and unbeÅ¿eeming a chriÅ¿tian, but untrue alÅ¿o; for grant Å¿hee had beene Å¿o, Å¿hee is now come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and has entred into a publicke covenant againÅ¿t her; and we reade of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> howÅ¿oever they had defiled themÅ¿elves and played the Harlots, yet upon their unfained repentance and true faith in IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and renewing their covenant publickly of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, were preÅ¿ented unto ChriÅ¿t as a chaÅ¿te SpouÅ¿e, Å¿o that what is impoÅ¿Å¿ible with man is poÅ¿Å¿ible with God.</p>
               <p>But this is the generall opinion of the brethren, and howÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they will not all of them Å¿peake it out in plaine words, as Å¿ome of them doe, yet they preach and practiÅ¿e a Å¿eparation from all our aÅ¿Å¿emblies and congregations, as from a people not to bee communicated with, and declare that by their deeds, which they will not as yet publiÅ¿h in their writings, nor in expreÅ¿Å¿e words as hee did.</p>
               <p>And one of the Independent MiniÅ¿ters not long Å¿ince, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Gods judgements againÅ¿t all thoÅ¿e that would not aÅ¿Å¿ent unto their new wayes, nor light their candles at their new lights, nor embrace their new-borne truths, told them, that by their Å¿tanding out againÅ¿t the wayes of God (for Å¿o they Å¿uppoÅ¿e theÅ¿e are) and by their unkind uÅ¿age of the Saints, and perÅ¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, they would at laÅ¿t drive from amongÅ¿t them the praying people (meaning themÅ¿elves, as if no other prayed

               <p>With theÅ¿e and Å¿uch like expreÅ¿sions are their preachments Å¿tuffed, and to Å¿ay the truth of many of their Sermons, they are like Taylors cuÅ¿hions, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of a hundred Å¿everall Å¿hreds of various colours, all independent, making a fine Å¿hew, but comely no where but in a Taylors Å¿hop: and Å¿urely Å¿uch kind of expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions as theÅ¿e are may beÅ¿eeme their Pulpits, but no grave and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned honeÅ¿t miniÅ¿ters: for they have no juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to complaine of perÅ¿ecution amongÅ¿t us, it is a calumny; neither deale they chriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly with us, to accuÅ¿e us that wee oppoÅ¿e the wayes of God, for we doe not Å¿o; we onely contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints, and againÅ¿t the wayes of Men, and Å¿uch as were brought into the Church by the cunning craftineÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿ome, and thruÅ¿t up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people as the Lawes and Ordinances and wayes of God, when they are but their owne inventions, and tend to no edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to the trouble and diÅ¿turbance of Church and State, and Å¿uch as already have brought a confuÅ¿ion upon us all, and if the Lord do not Å¿peedily from Heaven Å¿end his helping hand, we can expect nothing but deÅ¿olation, and all from theÅ¿e diviÅ¿ions, that their new wayes have brought in, and therefore it is high time for all good chriÅ¿tians and Å¿uch as love the peace of <hi>Sion,</hi> more exactly to examine all theÅ¿e new wayes; and to put them upon the proofe of them.</p>
               <p>But that the Brethren Å¿hould complaine of perÅ¿ecution amongÅ¿t us, and of evill uÅ¿age, it is againÅ¿t all reaÅ¿on and humanity, and Å¿heweth little gratitude in them to all the chriÅ¿tians both thorow citie and countrey; for if they remember when they came over, though they had deÅ¿erted the cauÅ¿e when they had moÅ¿t need of them, they were more honoured then any of thoÅ¿e famous and learned MiniÅ¿ters that had undergone the labour and heat of the day, and they were preferred before them all, and Å¿etled in the prime Lectures of the Kingdome, and had more honourable maintenance then was uÅ¿ually given to any Lecturers before them; and therefore they deale not brotherly in any of all their

proceedings, nor humanely Å¿o to aÅ¿perÅ¿e them as they ordinarily doe both publickly and privately.</p>
               <p>I am confident there is not Å¿uch a preÅ¿ident in the world of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity as that Å¿hewed here to them; it is well knowne, and their books &amp; practices declare it, that they preach new ways, new-born truths, as they call them, and Å¿et up new lights: Now where was it ever heard of either in the ChriÅ¿tian or Pagan world, that it was ever permitted unto any MiniÅ¿ters or Preachers to have all the Pulpits in any nation to preach a diverÅ¿e doctrine, to that which is Å¿et up by authority, and Å¿uch as tends to make a faction and diviÅ¿ion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the people?

               <p>AmongÅ¿t the Heathen, the IewiÅ¿h Religion in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries was tolerated; but they were confined to their owne Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, they might not come in the Heathens Pulpits to preach up the IewiÅ¿h worÅ¿hip amongÅ¿t them or to Å¿et up another Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice contrary to the cuÅ¿tome of the Nation: It was an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Egyptians that the Iewes Å¿hould Å¿acrifice in their land, they would not have Å¿uffered them then to have preached up their Religion in all their Pulpits.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Turkey</hi> at this day ChriÅ¿tians in many places have the liberty of their conÅ¿ciences amongÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, and have their places for worÅ¿hip to aÅ¿Å¿emble in; but they are not Å¿o much as permitted to come into their Temples, much leÅ¿Å¿e to preach up their Religion in their Pulpits.</p>

It is well known and can Å¿ufficiently be proved, that godly ChriÅ¿tians and people of approved integrity and of holy converÅ¿ation, againÅ¿t whom they had no exception either for doctrine or manners, and who offered themÅ¿elves to be admitted members upon their own conditions, yet were not Å¿uffered to be joyned members, onely becauÅ¿e they were poor; and this very reaÅ¿on was given unto them for their not admiÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they would not have their Church over<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>burdened with poore.</p>
               <p>And others deÅ¿iring that their Children might be baptized in their Congregations, and going to the MiniÅ¿ters of thoÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to entreat this favour, that their children might be baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
               <p>For AnÅ¿wer, it was told them, that they could baptize none but Å¿uch as were infants of their joyned Members (which is their practice) and wiÅ¿hed them firÅ¿t to be made joyned Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert in one of their Churches: Whereupon they thought that there was no Congregation fitter for them to joyne to, than to that PaÅ¿tors AÅ¿Å¿embly that had given them this counÅ¿ell, and therefore they applyed themÅ¿elves unto him, and deÅ¿ired that they
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:48122:351"/>
might bee admitted joyned Members: for anÅ¿wer, it was replyed, that the congregation of which he was PaÅ¿tor, conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of great perÅ¿onages, Knights, Ladies and rich Merchants; and Å¿uch people as they being but poore, could not walke Å¿o Å¿uitably with them; withall hee Å¿aid, he could doe nothing without the conÅ¿ent of the congregation; wherefore hee perÅ¿waded them to joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to Å¿ome other congregation among poore people, where they might better walke, and more comfortably in fellowÅ¿hip with them, Å¿o that the laÅ¿t newes I heard of this buÅ¿ines, was that the children were neither baptized nor the poore men admitted to be joynt Members of that congregation.</p>
               <p>What their MiniÅ¿ters have done Å¿ince I know not, but I well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it is as great a difficuly for a poore man to get into Å¿ome of their congregations, as to get into <hi>Suttons-HoÅ¿pitall;</hi> and that I conceive to be the onely occaÅ¿ion that makes Å¿ome walke Å¿o long in many congregations before they come to be admitted members; for if they be rich they are Å¿peedily received, nay invited to be Members.</p>
               <p>It is too well knowne, that many godly and holy people have left their native countrey, and tranÅ¿ported themÅ¿elves over into <hi>New<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>England,</hi> where this government is Å¿et up, onely that they might enjoy the Ordinances there in their purity; they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers before they went, and were baptized, and Å¿uch as were knowne before they went thither to be the deare Å¿ervants of God; but when they come there (eÅ¿pecially if they be poore) they make them walke Å¿ome a yeare, Å¿ome more, yea, Å¿ome Å¿ix or Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before they can be admitted Members of their Congregations, and they baptize none of thoÅ¿e children that are borne there before their Parents be joyned Members; and except they will in all things conforme themÅ¿elves to their owne conditions, they Å¿hall never be admitted.</p>
               <p>And Å¿ome time the man onely is admitted, and his wife left out Å¿till to walke; and Å¿ome time the wife is admitted and the man left out Å¿till to walke, and both theÅ¿e notwithÅ¿tanding are beleevers and baptized; and after with a great deale of difficulty, they are admitted to be Members; a very Å¿mall offence will be Å¿ufficient to caÅ¿t them out againe, if they be poore. But for Å¿tories of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I doe not love to multiply them; but I have heard many of this kind from thoÅ¿e places, and from Å¿uch as have beene in <hi>New-England,</hi>

and men both then and now no way evilly affected ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the place or people, Å¿erving God there.</p>
               <p>But it is too notorious, they lord it there over Gods poor Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in the Å¿uperlative degree, and every man that hath but eyes in his head may Å¿ee it here in <hi>England</hi> in their congregations, what difference they make between the rich and poor, and that they have the faith of our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in reÅ¿pect of perÅ¿ons, a Å¿inne in Saint <hi>James</hi> his time highly blamed in ChriÅ¿tians, <hi>James</hi> 2. And as in their carriage towards the poor, they are very lofty, and look for great obÅ¿ervance and attendance from them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever they come, Å¿o likewiÅ¿e a little thing will diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e them; if they Å¿peak a word amiÅ¿Å¿e, it is enough to be caÅ¿t out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; preÅ¿idents of this nature might be brought many: And if all this be not to lord it over Gods Clergies, I know not what it is; to admit of none, though beleevers, and already bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but Å¿uch as will come in upon their own termes, and keep out the poor either altogether, or as long as pleaÅ¿eth them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other reaÅ¿on but becauÅ¿e they are poor, and caÅ¿t them out again upon every Å¿lender occaÅ¿ion; I Å¿ay, if all this be not a moÅ¿t diabolicall tyranny and lording it over Gods Clergies, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to any moderate man to judge of; and if to unchurch all Churches but their own, and at one blaÅ¿t to proclame them all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ChriÅ¿t and his Kingdome, and to deny all Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip with them, be not more than a Diotrephian, Prel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now when theÅ¿e Presbyters already make Å¿o great difference between the poor and the rich, and between beleevers and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as they will admit none but at their own times, and upon their own conditions, I do conceive that this is a moÅ¿t tyrannical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lording it over Gods Clergies and Inheritance; which when they dayly do it, and the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do it not, it is moÅ¿t apparent that their rule and domination is more prelaticall and more to be feared than that of the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for from the Independent Presbyters they can never expect any appeal for releife and redreÅ¿Å¿e, whatÅ¿oever wrong or injury they have Å¿uÅ¿tained by them; and therefore there is no juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e why any Å¿hould Å¿o traduce the Presbytery of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to think they will lord it over the people, from whom they may ever expect farre better meaÅ¿ure than ever they can from the Independent Presbytery, which if it Å¿hould once be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, would tend to nothing elÅ¿e but to enÅ¿lave the whole Kingdome, and to bring in a confuÅ¿ion upon both Church and State.</p>
               <p>But now it will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e before the concluÅ¿ion, as we have compared the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Presbyters Independent, both in regard of their doctrine and diÅ¿cipline; Å¿o now likewiÅ¿e here to paragonate them together, in their proceedings for the advancement of ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome, that all men may Å¿ee in that regard alÅ¿o, which of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours tend moÅ¿t to the advancement of the Kingdome of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and which of them ought to be preferred before other, and which of them doth more really and truly tend not onely to Gods glory, but to the peace alÅ¿o of the Church and State: For the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

he came; which covenant the Lord ever kept with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Å¿eed, delivering them out of the hands of all their enemies, when they Å¿erved him according to the conditions of the covenant, walking uprightly before him (as he will do to all his children to the end of the world, walking in father <hi>Abraham's</hi> Å¿teps) and of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Lord Å¿ays this, in the 18. of <hi>GeneÅ¿is ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>that which I doe.

               <p>In theÅ¿e words, we have Gods teÅ¿timony of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the which he gives this witneÅ¿Å¿e of him, that he would command his children and houÅ¿hold after him, that they Å¿hould keep the way of the Lord to do juÅ¿tice and judgement: Then it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t, that <hi>Abraham</hi> tolerated neither in his children, nor in his houÅ¿hold any Religion contrary unto that that God had taught him, nor Å¿uffered no idolatry nor Sects in his family; for this had not been to walke uprightly before God, for it had been unjuÅ¿t dealing with God Å¿o to have done; for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Å¿eed were to walk perfectly and Å¿incerely before God, and therefore he would never tolerate all Religions or the worÅ¿hipping of a falÅ¿e God, or the worÅ¿hip of the true God after a falÅ¿e manner, which alÅ¿o is Idolatry, for this had not been to do juÅ¿tice and judgement; but <hi>Abraham</hi> Å¿et up the true worÅ¿hip of God whereÅ¿oever he came, as the whole Å¿tory of his life doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declare: And Å¿o did <hi>IÅ¿aac</hi> after him, and <hi>Jacob</hi> after him, as in the 33. of <hi>GeneÅ¿is</hi> doth appear, where <hi>Jacob</hi> Å¿aid unto his houÅ¿hold and to all that were with him, <hi>put away the Å¿trange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments, and let us ariÅ¿e and go up to</hi> Bethel, <hi>and I will make there an Altar unto God, who anÅ¿wered me in the day of my diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e and was with me in the way which I went; and they gave unto</hi> Iacob <hi>all the Å¿trange gods that were in their hands, and</hi> Iacob <hi>hid them under the Oak that was at</hi> Sechem, <hi>and the terror of God was upon the cities which were round about them, and they did not purÅ¿ue after the Å¿ons of</hi> Iacob.</p>

In theÅ¿e words we have a preÅ¿ident for imitation, with the fruit and benefit that doth redound to all thoÅ¿e people and Nations that Å¿et up the true worÅ¿hip of God, and root out all Idolatry and falÅ¿e worÅ¿hip out of their families and Countries; for <hi>Jacob</hi> gives no toleration in his houÅ¿e nor amongÅ¿t his people for all Religions, or for any other but that which God himÅ¿elfe had appointed; he Å¿ets up the true worÅ¿hip of God, and that onely within his JuriÅ¿di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and buries all the Idols, of what price and how rich Å¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were, and he found the comfort and benefit of this his Å¿o doing; for the Lord for this his faithfull Å¿ervice, bleÅ¿Å¿ed him and protected him from the fury of all his provoked enemies; for the terror of God was upon them all, Å¿o that they durÅ¿t not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ue him.</p>
               <p>And if we take notice in our reading of the holy Scriptures, we Å¿hall find and that through the whole Word of God that the Lord ever followed that people, and thoÅ¿e Kings and governours and their whole Kingdomes and Countries with Å¿peciall bleÅ¿Å¿ings and Å¿ingular favours that purged their Country from idolatry and all falÅ¿e worÅ¿hips, and Å¿truck a terror into all their enemies round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; neither did they ever purge their Countries from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and root out Idolaters, but the anger of the Lord was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently appeaÅ¿ed by it; and it is alwayes recorded to the eternall praiÅ¿e and honour of thoÅ¿e Kings, Rulers and Judges that were moÅ¿t forward in reformation, and that Å¿et more throughly upon that good work of reformation; and thoÅ¿e that did things but to the halves in reformation, have not Å¿o honourable a teÅ¿timony in holy Scripture as the other: and that God hath ever been pleaÅ¿ed when Idolatry hath been rooted out, and Idolaters put to death, there be many preÅ¿idents of it in the Word of God.</p>
               <p>AmongÅ¿t others, that in the 32. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> how highly was God diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed there with the making of that Calf? and how well was he pleaÅ¿ed when execution was done upon the contrivers and authors of that Idolatry, that place Å¿ufficiently declareth; yea, in the 13. of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> the Lord declaring how much he dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teth Idolatry and all falÅ¿e worÅ¿hip, giveth a diÅ¿penÅ¿ation to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for diÅ¿obedience to their parents (who by his law they are bound to obey) in Gods matters; Å¿o that if thoÅ¿e of their nigheÅ¿t relations Å¿hould go about to intice any to Idolatry, or to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hipping of falÅ¿e gods, or the true God in a falÅ¿e manner, or Å¿hould

For anÅ¿wer, let them take notice, that no thanke is due to the Heathens for it (as we may Å¿ee in <hi>GeneÅ¿is</hi> the 12. chap. and the 20. chap. and chap. 26.) but onely the glory of that is to bee aÅ¿cribed to God, who reÅ¿trained them when they intended evill againÅ¿t them; for hee appeared to Å¿ome of them in viÅ¿ions, and commanded them not to touch his anoynted people, and forbad them to doe his Prophets any harme, and by the Å¿peciall bleÅ¿Å¿ings that hee rained downe upon his people, and by his miraculous preÅ¿erving of them in fiery furnaces and in Lyons dens, from the fury of Savage-beaÅ¿ts, &amp; delivering them Å¿o often out of the hands of all their enemies, he Å¿truck Å¿uch a terror into the heathen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they durÅ¿t not oppreÅ¿Å¿e his people, Å¿o that the Å¿ingular providence of God, who watcheth over them alwayes for good, was their Å¿hield and Buckler; Å¿o that what they did in tolerating them and their Religion, was not of their good nature, but it was <hi>Gods</hi> Å¿peciall favour towards his own peculiar people, and for the maintenance of his owne cauÅ¿e, and that Religion which they had learned from him; and therefore thoÅ¿e heatheniÅ¿h ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are not for ChriÅ¿tians imitation to tolerate all Religions, who are bound to obey Gods commandements, and to follow the example of <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> IÅ¿aac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all the holy Prophets and ApoÅ¿tles, who all of them have condemned the toleration of all Religions amongÅ¿t his people, and have denounced Gods judgements againÅ¿t them for Å¿o doing.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider the principles of the heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ophers, and the practice of all wicked godleÅ¿Å¿e Politicians in all ages; for the PhiloÅ¿ophers, though they were Å¿ufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by their naturall reaÅ¿on, that there was a God, and that
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:48122:357"/>
this God was the Author of all good, and the puniÅ¿her of all evill, and therefore that he ought to be feared and Å¿erved of all nations and people, yet becauÅ¿e they by that naturall light of underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which was but darkeneÅ¿Å¿e in them) could not comprehend what that infinite MajeÅ¿ty and divine being and God-head was, and were not in themÅ¿elves able to Å¿et downe a deÅ¿cription of him, nor how to conceive of that inviÅ¿ible Deity, nor what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip would be moÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ing unto him (which they could never doe without God himÅ¿elfe had revealed himÅ¿elfe unto them as hee did to his owne people) they Å¿erved him after Å¿ome traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had received from their Fathers, and left all nations, cities and families to Å¿erve God as they thought beÅ¿t, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their owne vaine imaginations; and for the AtheiÅ¿ticall Politicians of all ages, all Religions are one to them, who never regard any one more than another, and therefore tolerate all for their owne baÅ¿e ends, and thinke it beÅ¿t for the enriching of all their countries (as the experience of all ages and hiÅ¿tor es can Å¿ufficiently witneÅ¿Å¿e) and many of them doe not refraine to Å¿ay, that Religion was onely brought into the world out of policy, and to keepe people in awe; Å¿o that God of his infinite goodneÅ¿Å¿e having the ordering of all mens hearts in his hands, did Å¿o diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e of all things, that by their owne principles they Å¿hould give toleration of all Religions in their Å¿everall countries and juriÅ¿di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Å¿o that his people being Å¿cattered here and there through other nations by their Å¿innes, yet found this favour, that they alÅ¿o for the moÅ¿t part enjoyed the liberty of their Religion (though they met Å¿ometimes with moÅ¿t hot perÅ¿ecutions) but all this is ever to be aÅ¿cribed to God alone (as I Å¿aid before) and to his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waying providence and guidance, who ever preÅ¿erved thoÅ¿e that truÅ¿t in him, and Å¿erved him according to his revealed will, though it be in <hi>Babylon</hi> it Å¿elfe, and therefore it is not to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the good nature of the Heathen, neither would that tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration now be tolerable in ChriÅ¿tians, who have learned ChriÅ¿t otherwiÅ¿e than to Å¿et up any Religion but that which he the King and Prophet of his Church hath taught them.</p>

               <p>I have heard many magnifie our Independent brethren for their great learning, Å¿ome affirming that they were Å¿cholers from their mothers wombe, and for my part I beleeve it; for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of <hi>God</hi> and of his holy Word came with all men from their mothers wombe, and if Å¿uch interpretations of Scripture and Å¿uch illations from them, as theÅ¿e be, proceed not from the ignorance of <hi>God</hi> and of the Scripture, never any did; for what learned man that knows what ChriÅ¿ts office was in taking hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature upon him, when he became a Mediator and the high PrieÅ¿t of our redemption, would argue as theÅ¿e men do? eÅ¿pecially when ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿o often in holy Scripture profeÅ¿Å¿ed of himÅ¿elfe that he came then to Å¿ave thoÅ¿e th t were loÅ¿t, and not to judge the world; for he hath left that imployment till his next comming, when I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured theÅ¿e men will have a great deale to anÅ¿wer for, for Å¿o abuÅ¿ing the holy Scriptures to maintaine their own baggatellies: BeÅ¿ides, ChriÅ¿t came to keep the law for us which he himÅ¿elfe had given unto his people and took no way the office of a Judge upon him, but in Å¿courging out the buyers and Å¿ellers out of the Temple, that I remember, and Å¿aith, that he came not to break the bruiÅ¿ed reed, or quench the Å¿moking Å¿lax, onely he had declared his laws unto his people, <hi>Malachy</hi> the fourth, by his Å¿ervant <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> and the execution of theÅ¿e laws was put into the hands of the Elders of IÅ¿rael, whoÅ¿e place it was to puniÅ¿h all Å¿educers, and who Å¿hould have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that work of juÅ¿tice which our Saviour declaring doth not give liberty for the tolerating of all Religions, which was againÅ¿t the revealed will of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore they that will out of this place argue a toleration of all Religions, may as well
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:48122:359"/>
conclude, that ChriÅ¿t tolerated adultery and injuÅ¿tice, and all manner of wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, becauÅ¿e our Saviour ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid unto thoÅ¿e that brought the Woman to him, that was found in the act of uncleanneÅ¿Å¿e, he that is without Å¿inne amongÅ¿t you, let him caÅ¿t the firÅ¿t Å¿tone, and when her accuÅ¿ers were gone, Å¿aid unto the Woman, Woman where are thy accuÅ¿ers, goe thy way and Å¿inne no more. Ergo, ChriÅ¿t gave a toleration for all Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers: and when the young man in the 16. of <hi>Luke</hi> came to our Saviour and complayning of unjuÅ¿tice done unto him by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and deÅ¿iring him to Å¿peake unto his brother that he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the inheritance with him, to whom our Saviour anÅ¿wered, <hi>man, who made me a Judge or a Divider among you? ergo,</hi> ChriÅ¿t gave toleration of all injuÅ¿tice. And becauÅ¿e our Saviour ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid in that Parable of the good Å¿eed that was Å¿owne and of the tares that Å¿prung up, that they Å¿hould let them alone till the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veÅ¿t, an argument which they much depend on: Ergo, all wicked men are to be tolerated, and no juÅ¿tice to be done upon them till Dooms-day, and they are to live without moleÅ¿tation, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿trate ought not to meddle with them, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid, let the good corne and the tares grow together till the harveÅ¿t; who would not admire to heare any man thus to argue, that there Å¿hould be Å¿uch either folly or wickedneÅ¿Å¿e in the heart of man, to abuÅ¿e the holy Scriptures for their owne ends? And who knowes not, that it is concluded amongÅ¿t all learned men, that <hi>Symbolica Theologia non eÅ¿t argumentutiva;</hi> and that the Parable inferres no more, but that it is not for any private man to take upon him the MagiÅ¿trates office, or raÅ¿hly to intrude himÅ¿elfe into the place of Rulers and Governours: But truly all Å¿uch conÅ¿equences may as well be gathered from every one of the above Å¿pecified Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they gather from our Saviours words to the Sadduces, and from the Parable of ChriÅ¿t for the tolerating of all Religions; and therefore all Å¿uch argumentations as theÅ¿e are but poore props to uphold their Tenent: for God hath given us that are chriÅ¿tians both the Law and the GoÅ¿pel, by which we ought to be guided in the Å¿erving of him, and by the which all ChriÅ¿tians are directed what courÅ¿e to take in the puniÅ¿hing of vice, and for the Å¿uppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing of errors and offenders, whether they be delinquents in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or manners: And although ChriÅ¿tians by the GoÅ¿pel are freed from the ceremoniall Law, yet wee are not freed from the

Å¿ubÅ¿tance of it; for he that Å¿aid to the <hi>IÅ¿raelites, be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> Å¿aith alÅ¿o to all ChriÅ¿tians, <hi>be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Å¿o that although the ceremony be aboliÅ¿hed, yet the Å¿ubÅ¿tance remaineth Å¿till in force; and although the rigor of the judiciall law be taken away, and ChriÅ¿tians are not tyed to that manner of adminiÅ¿tration of juÅ¿tice, yet the equity of that law doth Å¿till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and righteous judgements is every where amongÅ¿t all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians to be executed, and Å¿atisfaction to be made to all Å¿uch as have been unjuÅ¿tly damnified; and although we are freed from the curÅ¿e, malediction and coaction of the morall law, yet we are not freed from the obedience of it; Å¿o that whatÅ¿oever was commanded in it to the IÅ¿raelites, or forbidden them, the Å¿ame is both commanded and forbidden to all ChriÅ¿tians to the ends of the world, and whatÅ¿oever was death by the law of <hi>God</hi> and nature then, for ought I know ought to be puniÅ¿hed with death now amongÅ¿t ChriÅ¿tians, as blaÅ¿phemors, wizards, witches, idolaters, and all Å¿uch as deÅ¿piÅ¿e <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> law; under the mouth of two or three witneÅ¿Å¿es, if they be people within the pale of the Church, and make profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the ChriÅ¿tian Religion, for ChriÅ¿tians have nothing to do with thoÅ¿e that are without to judge them except they offend againÅ¿t the civill and municipall laws of the Country and againÅ¿t the laws of nations and nature when they live amongÅ¿t them: for ChriÅ¿t came not to change the morall law, but to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it in all things.

               <p>The Å¿econd thing obÅ¿ervable, is, that hee did in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bleÅ¿Å¿e them, and gave them reÅ¿t round about: Å¿o that from thence wee learne, that if MagiÅ¿trates who are Gods MiniÅ¿ters, and whoÅ¿e place it is, will execute judgement againÅ¿t all Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and blaÅ¿phemous Teachers, by this they Å¿hall bring glory to God, and procure peace and welfare to their Countries, and Å¿afety to their dwellings.

               <p>Here wee have an example and patterne for all ChriÅ¿tian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trates, and Å¿uch as are in authority to follow. For this was pend for our inÅ¿truction, upon whom the ends of the world are come. This example of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was wont greatly to be urged upon ChriÅ¿tians for imitation, and that by thoÅ¿e of the congregationall way, and therefore I hope they will not now be diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed, that I make uÅ¿e of it upon the like occaÅ¿ion, and MagiÅ¿trates were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon by them to follow the patterne of noble and glorious <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in making a through Reformation in all things, and for Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ing of all errors and innovations in Religion, and in that hee would not Å¿uffer or tolerate any Å¿trange Religion amongÅ¿t them; for hee but hearing they Å¿peake the language of <hi>AÅ¿hdod,</hi> curÅ¿ed them and reviled them, and Å¿mote them, and beate them alÅ¿o for it, and tore off the very haire of their faces, Å¿o that hee laid Å¿evere corporall puniÅ¿hment upon them for it. Now if hee would not Å¿uffer them in his Å¿ight and hearing to Å¿peake the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>AÅ¿hdod,</hi> hee would never have granted them a toleration of all Religions; for hee was another <hi>IoÅ¿hua,</hi> fully reÅ¿olved
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:48122:366"/>
that hee and his houÅ¿hold, and all that were under his command Å¿hould Å¿erve the Lord, and him onely, and that after his way; and hee Å¿ufficiently there declareth his deteÅ¿tation againÅ¿t a toleration of all Religions, or of giving the people an indulgence to Å¿erve God which way they thought beÅ¿t, and to uÅ¿e the liberty of their conÅ¿ciences, for hee made them all to imbrace the true Religion, and to worÅ¿hip God according as hee had commanded in his holy word, which is meant by that hee <hi>made them Å¿weare by God,</hi> which as all the learned know, is ever in the holy Scripture to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood of the true worÅ¿hip of God. Now we Å¿ee godly <hi>Nehemiah</hi> not onely urges them to imbrace the true Religion, and to Å¿erve God according as hee himÅ¿elfe hath appointed, by Arguments and ReaÅ¿ons, Å¿etting before them the miÅ¿eries and calamities that came upon the whole land by <hi>Solomons</hi> tolerating of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongÅ¿t them: but gallant <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reviled them, as if hee Å¿aid, you rogues, doe you Å¿peake in the language of <hi>AÅ¿hdod,</hi> and then cudgels them into the true Religion, and forces them by Å¿tripes, and corporall puniÅ¿hments to imbrace it, which is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his immortall praiÅ¿e, and for all ChriÅ¿tian MagiÅ¿trates imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Å¿o that he abhorred the toleration of all Rel gions: and as <hi>David</hi> would not Å¿uffer a Lyar in his houÅ¿e, Å¿o good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would not Å¿uffer any of a contrary Religion to be under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; hee had learned this LeÅ¿Å¿on from <hi>God</hi> himÅ¿elfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. &amp;c. This renowned Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and MagiÅ¿trate was not affraid to conÅ¿traine them to doe that which was for the glory of God, and according to his will, and for the good of their owne Å¿oules, and for the good of the whole Land, and the Å¿afety and peace of them all: and yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>Nehemiah</hi> knew as well what belonged unto tender conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as any Independents now living, and hee underÅ¿tanding that <hi>the heart of man was deceitfull above all things, and desperately wicked,</hi> Jer. 17. v. 9. &amp; that conÅ¿cience being but a branch Å¿pringing from that deceitfull and deÅ¿perately wicked root, knew alÅ¿o that there could be nothing in it but evill, &amp; that continually, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tooke that liberty upon him to conÅ¿traine their wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences to conforme to the commandements of God, and to Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves to his moÅ¿t holy Lawes and Statutes, and to that way of worÅ¿hip God had injoyned his people, which is the duty of all Parents and MagiÅ¿trates, who by Gods command and
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:48122:366"/>
this example of good <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> may at any time uÅ¿e the rod of correction, and by it make rebellious and Å¿tubborne children and people conforme themÅ¿elves to the commandements of the Lord, and to his true worÅ¿hip, and this duty they are bound unto by the Law of God if they urge them to nothing but what God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be his will in his bleÅ¿Å¿ed Word. And truly it is not to be paÅ¿Å¿ed over without Å¿erious taking notice of it, how zealous this good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was againÅ¿t all Å¿inne and falÅ¿e worÅ¿hip, and how adverÅ¿e hee was to a toleration of all religions under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for hearing them Å¿peake but the language of <hi>AÅ¿hdod,</hi> hee by and by reviled them, and fell about their eares, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with conÅ¿trained them, and that by Å¿tripes to embrace the true worÅ¿hip of God. But if this good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> were now living here amongÅ¿t us, and Å¿hould heare not onely the language of <hi>AÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dod,</hi> but the language of hell out of every mouth, and Å¿ee the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable practiÅ¿es of the Sectaries of our times, and Å¿hould heare their helliÅ¿h and blaÅ¿phemous and hereticall doctrines of denying the Trinity, and the Deity of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿lighting the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and many Å¿uch deÅ¿perate doctrines, how may wee thinke would his righteous Å¿oule be troubled with it? and how would hee beÅ¿tirre him in cudgelling theÅ¿e fellowes into the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and making of them Å¿erve God according to his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not after their own fantaÅ¿ies as they all now doe? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all controverÅ¿ie good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would baÅ¿te them to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, and all Å¿uch as Å¿hould Å¿ide with them, and eÅ¿pecially hee would belabour all Å¿uch well as Å¿hould write bookes in defence of Å¿uch, and Å¿hould call them Saints, and their damnable blaÅ¿phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the infirmities of the Saints. I Å¿ay I am moÅ¿t confident that were good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in our times, and had hee that authority hee had then in <hi>IeruÅ¿alem,</hi> hee would baÅ¿te them all to Å¿ome purpoÅ¿e, and make, and force them by cudgelling of them to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wholeÅ¿ome words; and I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured, he would pull off <hi>CretenÅ¿is</hi> his blew beard, <hi>qui ne pilum boni viri habet,</hi> and knock him Å¿oundly about his hairy Å¿calp; And St. <hi>Quarter-man</hi> alÅ¿o he would have Å¿ome good Å¿laps as he deÅ¿ervs over his great pate, &amp; all the reÅ¿t of theÅ¿e hereticall &amp; dangerous Sectaries would by him be conÅ¿trained with beatings to yeeld obedience to the authority of <hi>Gods</hi> word, and hee would make them know themÅ¿elves; and this indeed is the duty and place of all MagiÅ¿trates and Parents, and
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:48122:367"/>
MaÅ¿ters of Families, neither to Å¿uffer or tolerate Å¿uch fellows in their houÅ¿es nor Countries; for this would but bring judgements upon the land, much more ought every man to deteÅ¿t all Å¿uch as Å¿hould labour to bring in a toleration of all Religions, when we Å¿ee what miÅ¿ery came upon all <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> by <hi>Solomons</hi> toleration of them there.</p>
               <p>But the Independents Å¿ay there is no preÅ¿idents of any corporall puniÅ¿hment layd upon any under the New TeÅ¿tament for matter of Religion that MagiÅ¿trates Å¿hould follow: but I conceive the example of our Saviour may Å¿uffice for their imitation, <hi>Who</hi> Joh. 2. <hi>whipped the buyers and Å¿ellers out of the Temple for merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing there;</hi> and therefore laid corporall puniÅ¿hments upon them. And truly if the MagiÅ¿trates now Å¿hould whip all the buyers and Å¿ellers of their new and blaÅ¿phemous doctrines out of their Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall new Temples and Churches, I am confident it would be very pleaÅ¿ing unto God, and ChriÅ¿ts example would juÅ¿tifie and hold them out in this their Å¿o doing: for who can they better imitate then the King of his Church? Yea we Å¿ee corporall puniÅ¿hment threatned againÅ¿t the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Thyatira, &amp;c.</hi> and afterwards inflicted upon them by God himÅ¿elf for Å¿uffering thoÅ¿e falÅ¿e Prophets and Teachers amongÅ¿t them. Yea we Å¿ee <hi>Act.</hi> 13. that <hi>BarieÅ¿us</hi> for but labouring to hinder the ProconÅ¿ull from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the GoÅ¿pell, was by <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿trucken with blindneÅ¿Å¿e for it by God himÅ¿elfe, to teach all MagiÅ¿trates that thoÅ¿e deÅ¿erve puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hinder the preaching of the faith; but much more thoÅ¿e that corrupt it ought to be puniÅ¿hed. And we have another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of corporall puniÅ¿hment; for when there was no MagiÅ¿trate to puniÅ¿h thoÅ¿e exorciÅ¿ts, thoÅ¿e Å¿onns of <hi>Sceva,</hi> the Lord Å¿uffered the devill which could not enter into a Å¿wine without his permiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, to be his executioner and to lay corporall puniÅ¿hment upon them for abuÅ¿ing his name and his authority: All which may teach all men how much God is diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed with all Å¿uch as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his worÅ¿hip and Å¿ervice, and would bring in <hi>a toleratiou of all Religions,</hi> and may Å¿erve to inÅ¿truct all MagiÅ¿trates in their duty for the puniÅ¿hing of all falÅ¿e and herericall Teachers and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers.</p>
               <p>And truly, if ever there were a time that called for an eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one Religion and a Å¿etled Government with Uniformity in a Church and State, and a SuppreÅ¿Å¿ion of all HereÅ¿ies, Sects and
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:48122:367"/>
Factions from the MagiÅ¿trates hand and a puniÅ¿hing of all falÅ¿e Teachers, now it is, when by the Å¿ad effects already of diviÅ¿ions and variety of opinions, we may well perceive what ruine will come upon the three Kingdomes, if there be a toleration of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted: for diviÅ¿ions and factions, eÅ¿pecially in Religion, have been fatall to Kingdomes and Commonwealth in all ages, as the holy Scriptures and all HiÅ¿tories relate. The conÅ¿ideration of which makes me take the liberty to recite a Å¿tory I heard of a great Nobleman in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes at her firÅ¿t comming to the Crown, when there was a mighty PopiÅ¿h faction in the Court and through the whole Realm as all men know, and when there was as great an indeavour for the bringing in of a tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Religion, as now there is for the Å¿etting up a Pantheon of all manner of Sects. And Å¿uch reaÅ¿ons there were then given for the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing of the Catholique Religion (as they called it,) as I beleeve (if they Å¿hould all be rehearÅ¿ed) there is few of thoÅ¿e that now plead for a toleration of all, can give the like; but better I am moÅ¿t confident they cannon give. For if multitudes of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion armed with Å¿trength &amp; power alÅ¿o, and they all furniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with malice and reÅ¿olution to put them upon the imployment of their Å¿trength, had been able to create danger to the Kingdome if the liberty of their conÅ¿ciences Å¿hould have been denyed unto them, then there was nothing wanting to terrifie a State to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿cend to grant a toleration: but all this could not then prevail, nor all the art of perÅ¿waÅ¿ion they then uÅ¿ed as that men of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry judgement were rather to be won with Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e and lenity and loving perÅ¿waÅ¿ions and arguments and reaÅ¿ons, then by any coercive way which often brought danger unto Kingdoms, &amp; many arguments more with great worldly wiÅ¿dom were then produced, which with many that were reall ProteÅ¿tants and then in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet he demanding of the Councell that was then in debate about this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e (the greateÅ¿t part of which Å¿eemed to make profeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of the ProteÅ¿tant Religion and Å¿omething incline to yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a toleration) whether or no, they thought the ProteÅ¿tant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was the true Religion, and that way of Å¿erving God that he
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:48122:368"/>
had appointed; and the moÅ¿t of them replyed, that they from their hearts and Å¿ouls beleeved, that it was Gods Religion, and that which was taught in the holy Scriptures: Then Å¿aid this Nobleman, my Lords, Å¿et up and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h that Religion only and no other, do you your duty and labour to authorize it; and your life for mine, God will help you to maintain his own honour and cauÅ¿e, againÅ¿t what power and policy Å¿oever Å¿hall come againÅ¿t you; for he can infatuate their counÅ¿ell and enervate their Å¿trength and blaÅ¿t all their attempts in a moment, who is all-Å¿ufficient, and againÅ¿t whom no counÅ¿ell nor underÅ¿tanding can prevail; for he Å¿itteth in Heaven and doth whatÅ¿oever he pleaÅ¿eth; for as there is no Lord or MaÅ¿ter that can indure any Å¿ervant, that Å¿hall comply with his enemies &amp; give equall honour and Å¿ervice to his adverÅ¿ary that he doth to himÅ¿elf, or connive at any Å¿o doing; Å¿o God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like of your Å¿ervice when you worÅ¿hip him, if ye Å¿erve the devill alÅ¿o; which you muÅ¿t do if you Å¿et up any other Religion or any other Religion or any other way of Church Government in the Kingdome, then that you beleeve in your hearts God himÅ¿elfe hath appointed: for as two Religions Å¿o contrary one to another are incompitible with the glory and honour of God, who hath Å¿aid, <hi>No man can Å¿erve two MaÅ¿ters;</hi> Å¿o they will be deÅ¿tructive to the Å¿afety of the Kingdome. And therefore my Lords, Å¿aith he, as we have but one <hi>God,</hi> Å¿o I beÅ¿eech your honours, let us have but one <hi>Religion</hi> in the Kingdome and one kinde of <hi>Church Government</hi> amongÅ¿t us, and that ratified and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by authority: for if their be a liberty left for every man or every faction to do what they pleaÅ¿e, we Å¿hall Å¿peedily bring down the judgements of <hi>God</hi> upon the Kingdome and a confuÅ¿ion upon us all. And many reaÅ¿ons more he gave to this purpoÅ¿e, by which he Å¿o prevailed with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell that they agreed to give no toleration for Popery or allow of any faction in Religion, but reÅ¿olved with all Å¿peed to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the ProteÅ¿tant Religion. And truly the Å¿ame argument may now be uÅ¿ed for the eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing of one <hi>Religion and one kinde of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vrnment.</hi> And as <hi>Elijah</hi> Å¿aid to <hi>Baals</hi> PrieÅ¿ts and to the people, <hi>If God be God then follow him, &amp;c.</hi> So if this way of worÅ¿hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>God</hi> that is held forth in the ProteÅ¿tant Churches and hath for Å¿ome generations been taught in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be that way, then it will be for the honour and glory of <hi>God</hi> and the Å¿afety of the Kingdome that that onely be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, which will

            <p>For the fifth particular, it is elevated very high, and becauÅ¿e you have in this exceedingly beÅ¿tirr'd your Å¿elfe, I am neceÅ¿Å¿itated (for the clearing my Å¿elf, &amp; to vindicate the truth of what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) to be Å¿omewhat large in my reply, that I may fully anÅ¿wer the Charge you bring againÅ¿t me therein, which is very great: <hi>viz. You accuÅ¿e me to be one of the greateÅ¿t Incendiaries in the Land,</hi> and to prove this you quote two paÅ¿Å¿ages in one of my bookes, and you bring them as two witneÅ¿Å¿es; for the confirmation thereof, the firÅ¿t is in my <hi>Preface</hi> pag. 28. the Å¿econd in my <hi>PoÅ¿tcript</hi> pag. 45. <hi>Now theÅ¿e two witneÅ¿Å¿es of your own</hi> (Å¿ay you) <hi>want but a Judge judicially to pronounce Å¿entence whether theÅ¿e words be not of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary nature and that in a high degree: For who's Å¿o blind as doth not clearly Å¿ee theÅ¿e fiery flaÅ¿hes and flames to fly in the face of that Army which God hath honoured with many Crowns of admirable Victories both at</hi> York, <hi>at</hi> NaÅ¿eby, <hi>and at</hi> Lamport, <hi>with the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of</hi> LeiceÅ¿ter, Bridgewater, Bath, &amp;c. <hi>Å¿o as God hath made this despiÅ¿ed Army, the PreÅ¿ervative of City and Country, the</hi>

               <hi>Repairer of the breach, the ReÅ¿torer of the pathes to dwell in.</hi> Thus you.</p>
            <p>Brother, this accuÅ¿ation hath a Tower raiÅ¿ed on the Å¿ame BaÅ¿is the whole Fabrick of your Charge is founded upon, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation being deep, you dare build Å¿o high as (if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible) to over-top truth, not fearing the fall of your <hi>Babel;</hi> but God, <hi>who is Truth it Å¿elfe,</hi> Å¿eeing the evill of your intentions, <hi>hath confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your Language, as he did thoÅ¿e builders who Å¿ought to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves a name,</hi> Gen. 11. 4, 5, 6, 7. And therefore it will fall not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding the height of its Tower. O what a confuÅ¿ed relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have you made to prove me an <hi>Incendiary!</hi> I aÅ¿Å¿ure you in all you have Å¿aid, men of the cleareÅ¿t eye-Å¿ight, nay were they Eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey'd, they can never diÅ¿cerne any truth where with you make good that Charge which you Å¿ay is Å¿o conÅ¿picuous to the view of all men: For thoÅ¿e two witneÅ¿Å¿es that you produce, thus they Å¿peak <hi>(Preface</hi> pag. 28. Å¿aith) <hi>They have the Å¿word now in their hand, and they think their party Å¿trong enough to encounter any adverÅ¿e and oppoÅ¿ing party, and they profeÅ¿Å¿e they care not how Å¿oon they come to cutting of throats, and Å¿peak of nothing but the Å¿laughtering and bunchering of the PreÅ¿byterians, and therefore there is juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e given us to think we may expect better quarter from the very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then from the Independents.</hi> (PoÅ¿tÅ¿cript <hi>teÅ¿tifieth) that the Independents boast they have Å¿uch a party in the Kingdome, (if their own words may be credited) as they now think by the Å¿word to be able to make their own laws; and have been frequently heard Å¿ay, that they had many abbettors in the AÅ¿Å¿embly, and in both HouÅ¿es of</hi> Parliament <hi>and in many parts through the Kingdome, beÅ¿ides in all the Armies; and they were all reÅ¿olved to have the liberty of their conÅ¿ciences, or elÅ¿e they would make uÅ¿e of their Å¿words, which they have already in their hands. So that moÅ¿t certain it is the Religion of too too many of them is a meer faction,</hi> &amp;c. Now what theÅ¿e two have affirmed, can be corroborated by other witneÅ¿Å¿es, and if in your account he be an <hi>Incendiary</hi> that in deteÅ¿tation thereof hath Å¿et down their words by way of repetition to diÅ¿cover the danger of permitting Å¿uch lawleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿pirits to go on in their unwarrantable wayes, what great <hi>Incendiartes</hi> are they that have imagined Å¿uch things in their hearts and boldly Å¿poken thoÅ¿e words with their mouths? <hi>For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth Å¿peaketh,</hi> Matth. 12. 34. Luke 6. 45. as it can be proved Independents have
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:48122:378"/>
done; and Å¿o much the two witneÅ¿Å¿es you Å¿pake of Å¿aid; and no more; for they accuÅ¿ed not that Army, <hi>which God hath honoured with many Crowns of admirable Victories, &amp;c. But you Å¿ay, they caÅ¿t fiery flaÅ¿hes and flames which do fly in the face of that Army,</hi> &amp;c. Truly this is no other but a falÅ¿e Comment made by your Å¿elfe, from which you draw an evill inference, and then you cry out (as a man overcome with paÅ¿Å¿ion) Å¿aying, <hi>theÅ¿e words are not to be born:</hi> but <hi>I leave</hi> (Å¿ay you) <hi>the judgement thereof to the wiÅ¿dome and juÅ¿tice of the</hi> Parliament, <hi>whoÅ¿e former freeing of you extends not to cleare your words from being Incendiary.</hi> Thus farre you.</p>
            <p>Brother, I profeÅ¿Å¿e I am heartily Å¿orry to Å¿ee that you my <hi>Quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Fellow Sufferer</hi> Å¿hould Å¿o much forget your Å¿elfe, as not only bitterly, unworthily, and moÅ¿t falÅ¿ly thus to inveigh againÅ¿t mee, but alÅ¿o to inÅ¿inuate into the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as if they could not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿t their <hi>wiÅ¿dome and juÅ¿tice,</hi> except they paÅ¿Å¿e their judgement, and cenÅ¿ure me according to your bill of Information. This vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent proÅ¿ecution, and your <hi>Canterburian</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿ions, make not me alone, but all other Å¿olid ChriÅ¿tians wonder at your Å¿pirit: for you may pleaÅ¿e to call to mind, <hi>how one once profeÅ¿Å¿ed he would not paÅ¿Å¿e any Å¿entence againÅ¿t You, my Brother</hi> Prynne, <hi>and My Å¿elfe, but left us as he Å¿aid to the wiÅ¿dome and juÅ¿tice of the Court,</hi> which was in the judgement of all that heard his whole Å¿peech, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce us Å¿o highly guilty, that if the Lords there preÅ¿ent, did not Å¿everely cenÅ¿ure us, they would Å¿hew themÅ¿elves neither wiÅ¿e, nor juÅ¿t. This preÅ¿ident you have exactly followed againÅ¿t me but it will never Crown your head with honour; and for the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> it is their glory to Å¿light troubleÅ¿ome informers: for Å¿hould they hearken to every information invented and drawn up by the unÅ¿atisfied and turbulent Å¿pirits of Å¿ome Independents, <hi>it would cloud their wiÅ¿dome, and totally eclipÅ¿e the Å¿hining of their JuÅ¿tice in our Horizon:</hi> But <hi>you cannot there obtain an Order to have your Bill taken</hi> pro confeÅ¿Å¿o, <hi>and gain Å¿o much of the</hi> Parliament <hi>that I Å¿hould not anÅ¿wer for my Å¿elfe;</hi> therefore I may and will Å¿peak for my Å¿elfe in my juÅ¿t defence and Å¿hew how unjuÅ¿tly you have accuÅ¿ed me; <hi>And here I deny your Charg in every particular circumÅ¿tance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I returne my anÅ¿wer thereunto, you having given me Å¿uch a Theam to Å¿peak upon, as the due acknowledgement of

Gods goodneÅ¿Å¿e in raiÅ¿ing us up deliverers when City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were Å¿orely afflicted and heavily oppreÅ¿Å¿ed on every Å¿ide, in Å¿peaking of Gods providentiall care and Å¿everall actings in way of mercy to his people, I cannot omit (by way of thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e to God and men) to declare how that in the firÅ¿t place City and Country are deeply ingaged for ever next unto divine goodneÅ¿Å¿e to honour and highly eÅ¿teem thoÅ¿e Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and Citizens who in the beginning of the Kingdomes troubles, like <hi>the Governours of IÅ¿rael and the Princes of IÅ¿Å¿achar did offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves willingly among the people.</hi> Judges 5. 9. 15. whoÅ¿e very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the cauÅ¿e was then of Å¿uch concernment, that as it made the hearts of all who were truly godly to praiÅ¿e God for them, Å¿o thereby God made them the preÅ¿ervative of City and Country; InÅ¿omuch that upon Å¿erious conÅ¿ideration we Å¿hall find, <hi>that thoÅ¿e Noble Lords, and all thoÅ¿e brave Commanders that adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, who as Zebulon and Napthali jeoparded their lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, in the high places of the field, and expoÅ¿ed themÅ¿elves to reproach,</hi> Judges 5. 18. are not to be over lookt, and their gallant undertakings obÅ¿cured under a Sable cloud of unthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e, nor to be buried in the grave of Oblivion.</p>
            <p>For, when the Kingdome was in greateÅ¿t danger, then God made uÅ¿e of them to preÅ¿erve Citie and Countrey, rayÅ¿ing an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by Land, and Å¿etting forth a Navie at Å¿ea, under the commands of the <hi>Right Honourable, thrice IlluÅ¿trious, Faithfull, Valiant, and for ever to be highly honoured Lords,</hi> Robert <hi>Earle of</hi> EÅ¿Å¿ex, <hi>and</hi> Robert <hi>Earle of</hi> Warwicke, <hi>whom hee made by Å¿ea, and land, inÅ¿trumentall for the good and welfare of the Kingdome;</hi> and the truth is, at this day, neither preÅ¿ervation nor Å¿afety could have beene expected in Citie and Countrey, as things then Å¿tood, had not theÅ¿e two Renowned Lords and Heroes, Å¿o nobly and undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly appeared in the cauÅ¿e, &amp; undertaken the charge, and care upon them, one to be Admirall of the Navie at Å¿ea, the other to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Parliaments forces by Land: For this their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking was in Å¿uch a juncture of time, that had they out of Å¿elfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pects declined it, unleÅ¿Å¿e the Lord by a miracle had withÅ¿tood and over-throwne our enemies, Citie and Countrey (in all probability) long before this time, would have beene over-run, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by them, and no man Å¿hould now have had peace in his going out or comming in: But by <hi>the valour, vigilancie, and faithfulneÅ¿Å¿e of</hi>

               <hi>our then Noble Admirall,</hi> our Seas were Å¿afe-guarded, by which meanes, forraine enemies were awed, home-bred enemies weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by Å¿urprizing many Ships, Armes, Ammunition, InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Preparations for warre, which were Å¿ent over into <hi>England,</hi> for the deÅ¿truction of Citie and Countrey; beÅ¿ieged Townes were by him relieved, as <hi>Lyme, Plymouth,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>the preÅ¿ervative of Citie, and Countrey,</hi> which lay open ready to be deÅ¿troyed by cruell and bloody enemies.

            <p>Truly it is by all, that will not manifeÅ¿t to the whole world that they are ungratefull to <hi>God,</hi> and unthankefull to men, ever to bee acknowledged, that the Earle of <hi>EÅ¿Å¿ex,</hi> the Earle of <hi>War wicke,</hi> with thoÅ¿e gallant Commanders, and Citizens in that Armie, and Navie commanded by them, deÅ¿erve the firÅ¿t place of honour to be our preÅ¿ervers, Å¿ome of whoÅ¿e names I Å¿hall by and by Å¿et downe, though I can never Å¿ufficiently Å¿et forth their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es and their merits, and to theÅ¿e many other worthy Generals muÅ¿t bee added with all thoÅ¿e gallant Officers and Commanders under them, who commanded Å¿everall Armies, Regiments and Companies by CommiÅ¿sions from the Earle of <hi>EÅ¿Å¿ex: as the</hi>

In a word I peremptorily aÅ¿Å¿ert it, that next under God the whole Kingdome are bound to be thankfull to the MiniÅ¿ters who Å¿trengthned the hands and hearts of the Å¿ouldiers everywhere to battell and made them Å¿tick cloÅ¿e to their Å¿everall Commanders and Captaines, who without their Å¿ouldiers could never have done any thing of moment for our deliverance; and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple through the aÅ¿Å¿ociated Counties eÅ¿pecially may thank their painfull and faithfull MiniÅ¿ters that they now live in peace and tranquillity under their Å¿everall Vines and Figtrees; and therefore the condemnation of thoÅ¿e men Å¿leeps not that for all their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters care for them and their pains taken both to preÅ¿erve them in a bodily being and for converting their Å¿ouls, in lieu of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneÅ¿Å¿e do not onely reproach them with odious and infamous names, but would deprive them alÅ¿o of their livelyhoods and take away their tythes from them.

            <p>This, brother <hi>Burton,</hi> being premiÅ¿ed, I come now to anÅ¿wer your Charge (which as I formerly Å¿aid) I do abÅ¿olutely deny.</p>
            <p>And here I affirme that after theÅ¿e two noble Earls, and other of our honourable and ever to be highly renowned worthies, ceaÅ¿ed from their warlike imployments and commands by Å¿ea and land; The Army which God hath Å¿ince made the <hi>preÅ¿ervative of City and Country,</hi> It is that Army under the Command of <hi>his Excellency Sir</hi> THOMAS FAIRFAX (which is imployed in all parts and quarters of this Kingdom) whom with the whole body, I honour, and every particular member thereof, as they have done worthily. And whereas you accuÅ¿e me to be an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> and Å¿ay thoÅ¿e <hi>forecited words are flaÅ¿hes and flames to fly into the face of that Army, I</hi> am ready upon oath to depoÅ¿e, that it is a falÅ¿e miÅ¿chievous Calumny conceived in the fiery brain of Å¿ome Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and brought forth into the world by your Å¿trong paÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Further I averre there is none Å¿o blind but they can diÅ¿cerne a myÅ¿tery of iniquity in your expreÅ¿Å¿ions: for it is generally known That there are many more Presbyterians then Independents in that Army, yea ten to one, which God hath now made victorious every where, and of them as valiant men as ever drew Å¿word, or wore iron, being experienced Souldiers, gallant Stormers, and as a man may Å¿ay, even the Cream of the Kindome, and the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eareth its denomination from the greater part, or the better, which the Independents are not.</p>
            <p>Now looking on the Army as it is united to one head under the command of one chiefe Generall, and whether diÅ¿perÅ¿ed <hi>EaÅ¿t, WeÅ¿t, North, South,</hi> yet hath acted together to be the PreÅ¿ervative of City and Country, is that the victorious deÅ¿piÅ¿ed Army you Å¿peak of? No, no, you will not hear of that, but you divide that Army which God hath made Å¿o inÅ¿trumentall for the Kingdomes Å¿afety, and you overlook the greateÅ¿t part thereof as if they were uÅ¿eleÅ¿Å¿e men and had done nothing for the preÅ¿ervation of City and Country; this may prove the work of an Incendiary indeed, what? will you attribute all the honour of thoÅ¿e many glorious
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:48122:382"/>
victories which God hath crowned the whole Army with, but onely to a part of that Army? This is a derogating and dividing language, yet as in your writings, Å¿o in the publike AÅ¿Å¿emblies, and where ever any Independents preach or pray, you, and they, agree in this language, Å¿aying, <hi>It is the godly party, the praying people, that deÅ¿piÅ¿ed Army, that Å¿ome Å¿peak evill of, that God hath done Å¿uch great things by.</hi> Now none are called nor accounted the godly party with you and thoÅ¿e of your judgement, but Independents and Sectaries; Å¿o that it is plain you give all that Honour which is due to the whole Army, onely to the leaÅ¿t part thereof; by which courÅ¿e you endeavour to divide in the eÅ¿teem and opinion of men that Army, which God and the State have joyned and made one. But for my part, God is my witneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿o far have I been from caÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiery flaÅ¿hes and flames to flie in the face of that Army or any part of it, that I have, I do, and ever Å¿hall acknowledge, all the Worthies of that Army have done gallantly, and that <hi>for their wiÅ¿dome, faithfulneÅ¿Å¿e, valour, and victories they are ever to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned,</hi> the whole body have purchaÅ¿ed perpetuall honour, and the Kingdome is bound to aÅ¿cribe to God all praiÅ¿e and glory: But herein you are failing, when you divide that Army, as by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ions you plainly do, and upon all occaÅ¿ions Å¿acrifice to your own net, by which practice you Å¿eek what lies in you to diÅ¿cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the hearts and weaken the hands of the body of that Army, and to caÅ¿t Å¿ecret Fire-brands, which may break forth into flames of diÅ¿content, and Å¿o cauÅ¿e hot and burning Emulations amongÅ¿t our valiant and couragious Heroes, when they hear and Å¿ee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves Å¿lighted, and quite Å¿tripped of the honour and due praiÅ¿es that God hath made them equall Å¿hares of.

            <p>Brother, I entreat you take a view of what you have Å¿aid, and then conÅ¿ider the incongruity of your relation; for can it be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿aid that it is a diÅ¿covering of my Å¿pirit againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e Worthies in the Army, and a Å¿eeking to eclipÅ¿e the glory of that famous Victory at <hi>MarÅ¿ton-moor</hi> and a Å¿peaking contemptuouÅ¿ly of it, becauÅ¿e I Å¿ay Å¿ome of the Independents Å¿tood to it in the Battell at <hi>York,</hi> when others ran away? Let all rationall men judge, for Å¿urely there cannot be a greater contradiction, nor more confuÅ¿ion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. What? is it a diÅ¿covering of my Å¿pirit againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies in the Army, to Å¿ay they Å¿tood to it in the Battell at <hi>Yorke?</hi> Doth it not rather crown their heads with Lawrell, and Å¿peak ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their perÅ¿ons who ever they were that did Å¿tand to it in the Battell of either party, whether Presbyterians or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents? for as Å¿ome of both parties did run away, yet divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence Å¿o ordered it (that God alone might have the glory) that Å¿ome of both parties valiantly Å¿tood to it; and thus much is in part acknowledged by your Å¿elfe, when you Å¿ay, <hi>you can produce thoÅ¿e that were actors in that <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>Battell, and are no Independents,</hi> &amp;c. So that by your own confeÅ¿Å¿ion they were not all Independents, (no nor the greateÅ¿t part according to the relation of many, who were alÅ¿o actors in that Battell) by whom God gave us that famous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.

               <pb n="632" facs="tcp:48122:383"/>
               <hi>you Å¿o much vilifie,</hi> &amp;c. Brother, judge not raÅ¿hly, but aÅ¿Å¿ure your Å¿elfe, I have more man-hood in me then to vilifie true valour; for I profeÅ¿Å¿e I do, and ever Å¿hall honour a Valiant man, whoÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he be. But is Å¿peaking the truth, and aÅ¿cribing to all our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies their due honour without reÅ¿pect of perÅ¿ons, become a vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Valour with you? this is Independent Rhetorick, and Å¿o deep, that every one as yet doth not underÅ¿tand it, neither will I here undertake to unfold the meaning and MyÅ¿tery of it; onely give me leave without offence to tell you, <hi>That if any do affirm there were no Independents that ran away, when others Å¿tood to it in the Batell at York, their affirmation is moÅ¿t falÅ¿e, though happily unknown to them Å¿o to be:</hi> now their ignorance herein may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your errour, and bring you to the knowledge of this truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that one Wing of an Army, may be diÅ¿comfited and flying, yet in the heat of the battle the other Wing being deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged at that preÅ¿ent time, may not know how it fareth with them nor Å¿ee their flight, and if a whole Body be worÅ¿ted as the wind may Å¿et and drive the Å¿moak, the ingaged party cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly preÅ¿ently diÅ¿cern it. Thus it was at that famous battle at <hi>MarÅ¿ton-moore,</hi> as I have been informed by Å¿uch as were Actors in that Battle both Presbyterians and Independents. And that Å¿ome Independents did then run away as well as others, and of them not a few, nor all of the meaneÅ¿t rank and quality, is a reall truth: But if you will not give credit to what I Å¿ay, that you may not hereafter with Å¿uch great confidence put in Print falÅ¿e informations as you too too often do, I refer you to <hi>Leiutenant Coll: Iohn Lilburne,</hi> who was there at the beginning of that Battel; and for your better Å¿atisfaction enquire of him, whether Å¿ome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents did not run away, and alÅ¿o whether I have Å¿poken any thing concerning that Battell, but what he himÅ¿elfe knows, and hath reported for a truth, as can be proved. I could tell you the names of Å¿ome Independents that did run away &amp; thoÅ¿e not a few and none of the leaÅ¿t eÅ¿teem amongÅ¿t you; but I forbear, unleÅ¿Å¿e to cleer the truth I am inforced thereunto; for I know, that upon a diÅ¿comfiture in the day of battell, gallant men, valiant, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Å¿ouldiers, have Å¿ometimes been glad to run: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I there writ in my PoÅ¿t-Å¿cript, was not to vilifie any, but to give to every man his due honour which you and others of your Judgement did then, and Å¿till do moÅ¿t injuriouÅ¿ly rob and
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:48122:383"/>
wholly Å¿trip them of, who diÅ¿Å¿ent from your opinions; and if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you, or any of your party, Å¿hall Å¿o far prevail with the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to queÅ¿tion me for thoÅ¿e words, I doubt not, but as formerly <hi>I have found Justice, Å¿o then I Å¿hall finde the like, and be cleered both by Lords and Commons, from the reproach of being an Incendiary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly brother <hi>Burton,</hi> when I read your lines, and Å¿ee how much you aÅ¿cribe unto men, and how little you Å¿peak of God upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ions, I cannot but wonder: for the truth is, in all your language you never Å¿peak of your party, who you call the confiding men, the wel-affected in the Army, the godly party, but you count them and them only the Å¿aviours of the Kingdome, the reÅ¿torers of our paths to walk in, and this is your own dialect, God is not Å¿o much as named many times to my knowledge in your ordinary diÅ¿courÅ¿es: although God hath given a caveat againÅ¿t Å¿uch expreÅ¿Å¿ions and Å¿peakings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. where the Lord charged all his people by a threefold prohibition that they Å¿hould not aÅ¿cribe the glory or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their victories to their own righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, or to their own arme (which is the Independents dayly practice to Å¿ay their party have done all) to teach all men that there is nothing that more diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿eth God then to give his glory to men that can deÅ¿erve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at his hands who is ever to have the Å¿ole glory and honour of caÅ¿ting the horÅ¿e and rider into the Å¿ea; yea in expreÅ¿Å¿e words it is often declared in holy Scripture, that God can Å¿ave by few as well as by many, and that a King is not Å¿aved by the multitude of an hoÅ¿t, and that the horÅ¿e is prepared for the battell, but God gives the victory; and all this to teach us ever to give the glory of all victories to God onely and to aÅ¿cribe the honour to him. Now then when we have Å¿o many witneÅ¿Å¿es that God is the Saviour of his people and the ReÅ¿torer of our paths to dwell in, and a Å¿peciall command to give him the praiÅ¿e of it; how is it Brother, that there is nothing in your mouth more frequent, yea in your Pamphlets and prayers, then that thoÅ¿e men you call the godly party in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my have done the whole work in this War, yea and are the only Å¿aviours of the people and the healers up of our breaches and the reÅ¿torers of our paths to dwell in? robbing both God of his glory and all the other gallant men that indeed under God did the work of their due honour and praiÅ¿es, who had in all reÅ¿pects a far greater Å¿hare in all the victories obtained againÅ¿t the enemy, as being farre
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:48122:384"/>
better Å¿ouldiers and better ChriÅ¿tians and valianter men, and the more in number by far ten to one then the Independent party. And that both at <hi>MarÅ¿ton-moore</hi> and <hi>NaÅ¿eby,</hi> as in its due place will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all future ages.</p>
            <p>But becauÅ¿e Brother you have particularized the Battell at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ton-moore,</hi> aÅ¿cribing the glory of that victory wholy to your party, and extreamly wrongfully accuÅ¿e me about that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, I Å¿hall here therefore Å¿et down what I find writ by a Å¿tedier hand then yours concerning that Battell, and by Å¿uch an one as I know would not divulge an untruth to the world: neither would I have made uÅ¿e of his teÅ¿timony, not withÅ¿tanding I know the truth of it, but that I am able my Å¿elfe to prove what he hath writ by a cloud of witneÅ¿Å¿es that were there and received many wounds in that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and againÅ¿t whom there can be brought no juÅ¿t exception: the words of the Author are theÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>In this Battell, <hi>Å¿aith he, (Å¿peaking of</hi> MarÅ¿ton-moore) divers gallant men of both Nations had an honourable Å¿hare of the Victory: but none I hear of, without diÅ¿paragement to any, did appear Å¿o much in action that day with gallantry, as <hi>David LeÅ¿ley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here thoÅ¿e of the party we Å¿pake of a little before: <hi>(viz.</hi> the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Independents) to indear themÅ¿elves to the people, attribute unto themÅ¿elves the honor of the day, and Å¿tick not to call one of theirs the Saviour of the three Kingdoms, when god knows he that they then did extoll Å¿o much, did not appear at all in the heat of the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e; having received at the firÅ¿t a little Å¿car, he kept off till the worÅ¿t was paÅ¿t. This had not been Å¿pake of at all <hi>(Å¿aith the Author)</hi> if Å¿ome idle men to gull the world had not given the honor of the day to thoÅ¿e who had but little or no Å¿hare in it.</p>
            <p>And all this that this Author relateth can be proved by an Iliad of witneÅ¿Å¿es to be true<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and as this teÅ¿timony is true, Å¿o many more witneÅ¿Å¿es, and thoÅ¿e men of reputation, can be brought to prove that the victory hath been wholly aÅ¿cribed unto the Independent party in other Battells and SkirmiÅ¿hes when they have been many miles of from the very place; and if there be but any commander of their party in any imployment though he Å¿trike but one Å¿troke, then he carries away all the honour from the reÅ¿t, and they have their pentionary pen-men both in the Army and at <hi>London</hi> to do this feat for them, to give them the praiÅ¿e and honour of it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare themÅ¿elves into the people, and all to delude them; and Å¿o it
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:48122:384"/>
was at that Battell; the Presbyterians underwent the heat of the day, and the Independents challenge the honour. Thus much Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have forced me to Å¿peak, and now I go on.</p>
            <p>Brother, for the other particulars which to pleaÅ¿e your Å¿elfe, and Å¿et forth your paÅ¿Å¿ion, you charge me withall, I will anÅ¿wer them as they lie. And here I proteÅ¿t before the Lord, <hi>I have never dealt diÅ¿honeÅ¿tly, nor Serpent-like with you nor any creature living, or that ever did live upon the earth: AlÅ¿o that my heart is Å¿ound unto my God, firme, and filled full with ChriÅ¿tian Love to all that fear his Name, and walk before him in truth and Å¿incerity.</hi> And for my brain, <hi>it is not Å¿o Å¿hallow,</hi> but that through the wiÅ¿dome which is given me of God, <hi>who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. I can diÅ¿cern into the depth of Error, and am able by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance to make it appear to all whoÅ¿e eyes are open to Å¿ee the clear Å¿un-Å¿hine of the truth, <hi>That the way of your Independency is not grounded on the Word of God, but its rice, continuance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿e hath for the foundation thereof, onely the fantaÅ¿ie, ambition, private intereÅ¿t, Å¿elf-Å¿eeking, and cunning practices (with a Å¿eeming hollowneÅ¿Å¿e) of Å¿ome Å¿ubtill and unÅ¿table spirits.</hi> And likewiÅ¿e, <hi>for the whole univerÅ¿e, I aÅ¿Å¿ure you it never did nor never can bring in a juÅ¿t verdict,</hi> and Å¿ay, <hi>I am a man not onely whoÅ¿e heart is divided but whoÅ¿e head is,</hi> &amp;c. For the whole univerÅ¿e hath been and is Å¿o far from bringing in any Å¿uch verdict, that grave, learned, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, zealous, and holy men (in the Reformed Churches) have given in another verdict of me, whoÅ¿e TeÅ¿timonies I can Å¿hew for my godly Life, Learning, and blameleÅ¿Å¿e ConverÅ¿ation, whileÅ¿t I lived amongÅ¿t them beyond the Seas; and I have the like from the moÅ¿t eminent, godly, learned men where ever I have inhabited in this Kingdome; yea, many Letters of late time I have received from godly learned men both at home and abroad that have read my Books, whoÅ¿e faces I never Å¿aw, and by them it plainly appeareth that the chiefe, pious, orthodox, learned men of the whole univerÅ¿e, eÅ¿teem of me <hi>as a man of piety and learning, and not</hi> (according to the Character you have given of me) <hi>as a man not onely whoÅ¿e heart is divided, but whoÅ¿e head is,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore I having Å¿uch a plaiÅ¿ter made by Å¿uch conÅ¿cionable, skilfull, and learned PhiÅ¿itians and men of reputation, it is approved of by all that are rationall and godly, to be efficacious not onely to Å¿alve this Å¿ore, but to keep from feÅ¿tering, and perfectly heal up the Å¿everall wounds I have
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:48122:385"/>
recived from you and your fraternity, although you have all cut deep, and many wayes, <hi>wounding me in my Religion, in my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in my good Name,</hi> (all which are more precious unto me, then my life) and then with one blow indeavouring to divide <hi>my heart and head, to make the wounds irrecoverably mortall.</hi> But if Å¿uch actions proceed from Independent principles, and the new light they pretend to walk by, doth guide you or any of them into theÅ¿e wayes, <hi>Å¿eeing Å¿uch inÅ¿truments of cruelty are in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations (to murther innocent men in their good names, which is greater cruelty and more wrong to an honeÅ¿t godly man, then to take away his naturall life) with good old Jacob</hi> Gen. 49. 6. I Å¿ay, <hi>O my Å¿oul come not thou into their Å¿ecret: unto their AÅ¿Å¿embly mine honour be not thou united,</hi> &amp;c. Now to conclude my AnÅ¿wer to your Charge, <hi>where you Å¿peak of me as if I were mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Prelaticall faction in their time Å¿pake of me and of all who in Å¿incerity and uprightneÅ¿Å¿e of heart <hi>oppoÅ¿ed their erroneous opinions, unwarrantable wayes and Å¿infull practiÅ¿es:</hi> and it is no new thing for Å¿uch who wander from the truth to walk in the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths of error, and to think and Å¿peak of any that hold out and maintain the truth, <hi>that they are mad and beÅ¿ides themÅ¿elves;</hi> thus <hi>Festus</hi> thought and Å¿pake of <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 26. 25. And thus it hath pleaÅ¿ed you (cunningly, but more Å¿cornfully) to Å¿peak of me; yet as the ApoÅ¿tle replyed to him, Å¿o I do to you, <hi>I am not mad</hi> (Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Fellow Sufferer) <hi>but Å¿peak forth the words of truth and Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> And here in the words of truth and Å¿oberneÅ¿Å¿e I averre, whereas you Å¿ay, Pag. 25. <hi>there wants but a Judge judicially to pronounce Å¿entence on the former repeated words in my PoÅ¿tÅ¿cript,</hi> that it is obvious to all men you aÅ¿Å¿umed the place of a Judge, (though not a judiciall one) and have proceeded Å¿o far, not onely to pronounce an unjuÅ¿t Å¿entence againÅ¿t me, but by your uÅ¿urped authority to judge my heart, which power is peculiar to God alone <hi>Who Å¿earcheth the hearts and tryeth the reines</hi> PÅ¿al. 7. 9. Jer. 11. 20. <hi>and will give to every man according to his wayes, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fruit of his doing,</hi> Jer. 17, 10. Revel. 2. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, further I Å¿ay,</hi> there is none Å¿o weak-Å¿ighted, but they may plainly Å¿ee, how you, and other Independents, do make it your maÅ¿ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece to uÅ¿e dividing and traducing language, Å¿lighting all men that differ from your opinions, as if they had neither piety, wit, nor lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in them. <hi>And were not you grown very skilfull in theÅ¿e fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi>
               <pb n="637" facs="tcp:48122:385"/>
you would never have falÅ¿ly accuÅ¿ed, Å¿at Judge, condemned the whole man, and then have turned Executioner, to divide my heart and head as you have done. <hi>For all which the Lord humble you low before him,</hi> giving you repentance not to be repented off; <hi>and never lay theÅ¿e your cauÅ¿leÅ¿Å¿e, paÅ¿Å¿ionate, unadviÅ¿ed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly dealings with me, unto your Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I paÅ¿Å¿e on, good brother give me leave here a little to parly with you.</p>
            <p>You Å¿ay Pag. 25. <hi>There wants but a Judge judicially to pronounce Å¿entence on the former words in my PoÅ¿tÅ¿cript,</hi> &amp;c. But that needs not, you have already done it for your purpoÅ¿e, though not judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; but it Å¿eems you would have me judged twice for one and the Å¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>me but conceived offence, which is very tyranny; yea I muÅ¿t tell you that you have proceeded in your cenÅ¿ure already againÅ¿t me, contrary unto all the laws of God, Nature and Nations, and all humanity; yea by a more tyrannicall law then that of the <hi>High CommiÅ¿Å¿ion Court</hi> or <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> all which by Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance I Å¿hall evidently make appear.</p>
            <p>For the manner of proceeding in all Courts of JuÅ¿tice appointed by God (to Å¿ay nothing how they never condemn a man twice for one and the Å¿ame but conceived crime) was, that none Å¿hould be condemned but by the mouth of two or three witneÅ¿Å¿es. And by the law of Nations their Courts of JuÅ¿tice were ever open to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead any prevaricators againÅ¿t their laws, obÅ¿erving ever an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way and manner of proceeding in them, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Statutes and Ordinances of their Å¿everal Countries.</p>
            <p>Now the conditions and requiÅ¿ites for a Judiciall Proceeding, were.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, that the parties queÅ¿tioned Å¿hould firÅ¿t be cited and Å¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned into the Court, and this was to be done either by Articles or Bill, or Allegation, Libell or Petition, Information or Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ation exhibited into the Court againÅ¿t the pretended Delinquent, before any Sentence could paÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t him.</p>
            <p>Secondly the party accuÅ¿ed was to be heard Å¿peak and plead for himÅ¿elf before Sentence might paÅ¿s againÅ¿t him, except he wilfully neglected the Summons and Å¿o declined his appearance: for Å¿o it was ordered by the law of God and practiÅ¿ed by all his people in the worÅ¿t times, as we may Å¿ee in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who to convince the Jews of injuÅ¿tice in their proceedings againÅ¿t the Lord of life,
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:48122:386"/>
Å¿aid unto ChriÅ¿ts enemies, <hi>Doth our law condemn any man before we have heard him?</hi> Yea, this was Gods own method before the deÅ¿troying of <hi>Sodom and Gomorrah, who came down to Å¿ee and know whether al things were according to the cry that was come up into the Court of Heaven:</hi> And it was the practice of all Judges and in all Courts of Judicature to proceed <hi>Å¿ecundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> the parties ever being brought before them face to face, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e they did not judicially pronounce Å¿entence againÅ¿t them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all things were to be proved by Å¿ufficient witneÅ¿Å¿es and by men without exception, Å¿uch as were people of worth and credit, of no infamous and beaÅ¿tly life, and by Å¿uch as bare no grudg or hatred againÅ¿t the party queÅ¿tioned, and againÅ¿t whom the party accuÅ¿ed could pretend no juÅ¿t exception: for all men know that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice can neither think, Å¿peak, or write wel of any they malign (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e your book againÅ¿t me) Å¿o that if the party complained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t could make it appear that the witneÅ¿Å¿es were his mortall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and that they were men or people of a vitious life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ation or guilty of any heinous crimes and offences, and with<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> all that they were enemies and implacable adverÅ¿aries unto him, there was then a caution in law that Å¿uch men might be excepted againÅ¿t, and their teÅ¿timony was not to be admitted without there were other more apparent evidence of the truth. And although the <hi>High CommiÅ¿Å¿ion</hi> and <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> were the moÅ¿t corrupt Courts in the Kingdome, yet even in thoÅ¿e Courts there was an appearance of juÅ¿tice in this kind, Å¿o that if any man had any juÅ¿t exception againÅ¿t any mans teÅ¿timony, if it did not totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their witneÅ¿Å¿e, which it many times did, yet it Å¿o enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their evidence that it was never Å¿o valid and prejudicall to him as otherwiÅ¿e it would have been; as you your Å¿elfe can witneÅ¿Å¿e it was in my cauÅ¿e in the <hi>High CommiÅ¿Å¿ion Court,</hi> where I making it appear by Å¿ufficient witneÅ¿Å¿e that <hi>Thomas Newcomin</hi> and <hi>John Danet,</hi> and <hi>Richard Daniel</hi> had formerly been expunged in the <hi>Chancery</hi> for Knaves, and had for that out of malice put me up into it, were all my adverÅ¿aries and perjured varlots, their teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by the whole Court was rejected, and they were by them all accounted a company of Knaves all over Å¿oul and body, for Å¿o Å¿ome of the <hi>Court</hi> Å¿aid of them, and I was onely condemned for my book: And this part of JuÅ¿tice in many cauÅ¿es remained even
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:48122:386"/>
in thoÅ¿e Courts in the worÅ¿t of times; &amp; in all Courts of the world there was ever leave and liberty given unto the accuÅ¿ed to make his juÅ¿t defence and bring in the evidences of his own innocency and non-guiltineÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; his juÅ¿t exceptions againÅ¿t both his accuÅ¿ers proÅ¿ecutors and witneÅ¿Å¿es, and this by the very law of nature, for Å¿o Å¿aid <hi>FeÅ¿tus,</hi> that it was not the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any before they had been brought face to face with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿aryes, and that they had bin fully heard what they could Å¿peak for themÅ¿elves: for otherwiÅ¿e if they had condemned any without either of the former conditions, they had not proceeded according to law nor condemned them judicially.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, thoÅ¿e that are judged judicially, and according to the Lawes of God and nations, they muÅ¿t ever be within the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿diction of that Court, and of thoÅ¿e that judge them, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Lawes. Neither doe any wiÅ¿e Judges take any cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of things without their juriÅ¿diction: and if any Å¿hould bee Å¿o unjuÅ¿t or unadviÅ¿ed to attempt any Å¿uch thing, the party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed hath the benefit of his Appeal, as wee Å¿ee in the cauÅ¿e of <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee appealed from the Tribunall of the Jewes to <hi>CaeÅ¿ars</hi> Barre. And all men know, that the Courts of one Countrey doe not judge and condemne the Å¿ubjects that dwell in an other, and that are under an other government; yea, the Courts Å¿ecular, and the Courts EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿ticall, even in the Å¿ame Kingdomes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths doe not intermeddle with one an others imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except it be by Å¿peciall appeale which is granted unto them by Å¿ome caution upon juÅ¿t occaÅ¿ions, but they leave each Court to the managing of thoÅ¿e cauÅ¿es that are of Å¿peciall cognizance there and within their juriÅ¿diction; for otherwiÅ¿e it would breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion Å¿peedily in a Country, and therefore thoÅ¿e diÅ¿tinct Courts and JuriÅ¿dictions take the cognizance of thoÅ¿e things onely that are peculiar and proper to themÅ¿elves, and within their Å¿pheare, and never intermeddle and exerciÅ¿e any power over others that are out of their juriÅ¿dictions, be they never Å¿o facinorous, or accuÅ¿ed of never Å¿o high a crime; yea, if any information or accuÅ¿ation be put up againÅ¿t any man into any Court, be it true or falÅ¿e, if the Judges conceive that the parties impleaded againÅ¿t belong unto an others juriÅ¿diction they will Å¿end them thither to be judged, and decline Å¿entencing of them; and this method of judgement the very Law of nature teacheth all men; yea <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi>
               <pb n="640" facs="tcp:48122:387"/>
though a moÅ¿t wicked and unjuÅ¿t Judge, yet underÅ¿tanding that ChriÅ¿t was of <hi>Galilee,</hi> of which <hi>Herod</hi> was the Tetrarcke or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and conceiving him to be under <hi>Herods</hi> juriÅ¿diction he Å¿ends him forthwith unto <hi>Herod,</hi> intimating that the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tryall of his cauÅ¿e peculiarly belonged unto him, if ChriÅ¿t were judicially to be proceeded againÅ¿t. Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himÅ¿elfe Å¿aith, <hi>What have I to doe to judge thoÅ¿e that are without?</hi> ThoÅ¿e that were without in <hi>Pauls</hi> opinion, and under an other juriÅ¿diction, hee profeÅ¿Å¿ed that hee had nothing to doe with them.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing required for the judiciall proceeding and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any cauÅ¿e, is this, that they that are to be Iudges may not be both parties, witneÅ¿Å¿es, proÅ¿ecutors, Iury, and Iudges in the Å¿ame cauÅ¿e; for it they be, they cannot be Å¿aid judicially to give Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. All that I now write unto you Brother, I am confident your conÅ¿cience tels you is juÅ¿t and true. Now in all nations and well governed Kingdomes and countries, if there have beene any faylings in either of theÅ¿e conditions and requiÅ¿ites, the Å¿ubjects have the benefit of the Law againÅ¿t both their ProÅ¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Iudges, and may appeale unto the King, or Å¿upreame Court of judicature in the Kingdom, &amp; crave juÅ¿tice there againÅ¿t Å¿uch Iudges, and Å¿uch proceedings, and if they cannot obtaine juÅ¿tice there, God will call them to an account one day for it: for, in the judgement of all men Å¿uch proceedings have ever beene counted illegall and unjuÅ¿t, and all thoÅ¿e Iudges that have at any time given Å¿entence, without obÅ¿erving thoÅ¿e rules and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did never cenÅ¿ure any man judicially, neither can their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be Å¿aid to be judiciall in any juÅ¿t mans underÅ¿tanding.</p>
            <p>Now Brother, if your proceeding againÅ¿t mee be examined by theÅ¿e rules, and by Å¿uch men as are judicious and truly godly without faction, you will not be thought judicially to have cenÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; condemned me: for it is moÅ¿t certain you have not in all the carriage of this buÅ¿ines beene a judiciall Iudge; for in this your Å¿entence you have gone againÅ¿t all the Lawes of God and nature; yea &amp; againÅ¿t the practice of the moÅ¿t corrupt Courts in the world, in that you have accuÅ¿ed me, arraigned me and condemned mee, without either Articles, Bill, Libell, (Å¿aving your owne Booke) allegation or information, and without any lawfull citation into your Court, or any Court, you have alÅ¿o condemned mee before
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:48122:387"/>
I knew who were my AccuÅ¿ers, and that without hearing mee ever Å¿peake for my Å¿elfe; yea, you have condemned and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged me an innocent man withou any lawfull witneÅ¿Å¿e; for as I am not conÅ¿cious to my Å¿elfe of ever having done any thing that deÅ¿erves convention before any Court of Iud icature in this world, much leÅ¿Å¿e to have Å¿entence given againÅ¿t mee, Å¿o I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if ever theÅ¿e your dealings againÅ¿t mee Å¿hall be brought to a tryall, and a judiciall hearing indeed, as they may be, if the time once grows more quiet; I Å¿hall make it clearly and evidently appeare, that the ground of this your beaÅ¿tly accuÅ¿ation brought againÅ¿t me, <hi>viz. that I am a Å¿candalous Walker to the Å¿hame of the very name of ChriÅ¿tian Religion,</hi> did firÅ¿t ariÅ¿e from one of the moÅ¿t infamous &amp; notorious creatures, though an Independent, that now lives upon earth for all manner of villanies, a Å¿hame &amp; diÅ¿ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>to</hi> her name &amp; kindred, known to be one of the moÅ¿t prodigious impudent Whores that is this day in the world, except the Whore of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and yet originally and primarily from that creature, or from Å¿uch as are as bad as her Å¿elfe, have you groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your moÅ¿t unbrotherly and extra judicall judgement againÅ¿t mee, and Å¿o you have made your Å¿elfe party, witneÅ¿Å¿e, Iury and Iudge in this your owne cauÅ¿e, and which is more have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one that is in your opinion without, and out of your juriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; whereas <hi>Paul</hi> had taught all ChriÅ¿ts DiÅ¿ciples by a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law from Heaven, that they Å¿hould not judge thoÅ¿e that are without: now you account mee and all the Presbyterians to bee enemies of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿uch Saints as <hi>Iob</hi> would not Å¿et with the dogs of his flocke, and proclayme us all the Å¿onnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> as your learned Works can Å¿ufficiently witneÅ¿Å¿e; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you account us all without, and yet you condemne me, and that in the face of the whole world, as guilty of all thoÅ¿e foule crimes you charge me with, whereas you had nothing to doe with mee, I being out of your juriÅ¿diction: I pray tell me courteous Brother, whether this your proceeding be to Å¿et up ChriÅ¿t as King upon his Throne, and be judicially to condemne any Brother? when it is apparently manifeÅ¿t by theÅ¿e your actions you tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿e all the Lawes of ChriÅ¿t our King, and trample them under your feet? for ChriÅ¿t hath taught all his people and Å¿ubjects, Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>If thy brother offend thee, tell him of it betweene him and thee,</hi> &amp;c. and againe, hee hath Å¿aid, <hi>judge not leÅ¿t yee be</hi>
               <pb n="642" facs="tcp:48122:388"/>
               <hi>judged,</hi> and againe, <hi>there Å¿hall be judgement without mercy to him that Å¿hewes no mercy;</hi> againe God hath Å¿aid, <hi>hee that condemnes the righteous, and hee that juÅ¿tifies the wicked, they are both an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord;</hi> whether therefore by all theÅ¿e your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againÅ¿t mee you have not violated all theÅ¿e moÅ¿t holy Lawes and Statutes, I Å¿hall leave to the judgement of others. Brother you may remember in the 17. page of your Booke, Å¿peaking there what you will doe when you come to my PoÅ¿tÅ¿cript (which you have finely performed) you aske mee whether or no, when you make mention of it my mind doth not miÅ¿give me? your words are theÅ¿e, <hi>which when I mention here</hi> (Å¿ay you) <hi>doth not your mind miÅ¿give you?</hi> for anÅ¿wer I tell you no: for I am able to prove every word of that Booke by Å¿ufficient witneÅ¿Å¿e, and out of the very Independents writings; yea, their daily practiÅ¿es have made good every period of it, and Å¿o farre
I am that my mind Å¿hould miÅ¿give mee at the mention of it for doing my duty, that I will with all Å¿peed print it againe with Å¿ome little inlargement concerning your <hi>New-lights,</hi> and other of your grolleries. But this by the way. But becauÅ¿e Brother, you take that liberty to propound now and then queÅ¿tions to me, I will here alÅ¿o uÅ¿e the Å¿ame freedome with you: Therefore tell me <hi>I</hi> pray the next time I heare from you, whether or no your mind doth not miÅ¿give you when <hi>I</hi> mention your bookes, and when you thinke what you have done againÅ¿t mee in thus condemning mee, and adjudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an innocent man, and your quondam Fellow-Å¿ufferer? Brother had you to deale with Å¿ome man, hee would recriminate, which would not be for your honour; but for the preÅ¿ent <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my Å¿elfe to have declared my innocency; only by the way conÅ¿ider what you did to my reverend Brother, MaÅ¿ter <hi>George Walker,</hi> a man to whom you were Å¿o much ingaged to; and when I <hi>mention him, doth not your heart miÅ¿give you?</hi> But enough of this.</p>
            <p>Now before I conclude this my parley with you; I will Å¿ay thus much <hi>concerning your new Courts, in your new gathered Churches, if this be your way of proceedings there, to be witneÅ¿Å¿e, party, Iury, and Iudge in your owne cauÅ¿e, and when you have given Å¿entence againÅ¿t the innocent if ther be no appeale: then your Courts are worÅ¿e, and more tyrannicall then that of the High CommiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, or Star-chamber; and for ought I know all Å¿uch arbitrary</hi>
               <pb n="643" facs="tcp:48122:388"/>
               <hi>Courts as your are, and all Å¿uch arbitrary and unjuÅ¿t Iudges as you are, may as well be queÅ¿tioned, cenÅ¿ured and put downe, for all theÅ¿e your illegall, unjuÅ¿t, and extrajudicall proceedings, as either they or any other tyrannicall Courts were; and truly it concernes the whole Kingdome now Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to looke about them, and to have a Å¿peciall eye to your Jndependent proceedings and Iudgements: for if they bee not timely looked unto, all the repairing of our breaches, and all the reÅ¿toring of our pathes to dwell in which you make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, will be no Å¿uch thing to the poore Presbyterians, who cannot already paÅ¿Å¿e quietly in the Å¿treets for you: nor any man avoyd your uniuÅ¿t cenÅ¿ures, nor the filth both of your tongues and pens, which you caÅ¿t in our faces every Å¿tep wee goe.</hi> The Lord rebuke you for theÅ¿e your revilings. Truly Brother, I Å¿ee a divine hand of juÅ¿tice againÅ¿t you in many paÅ¿Å¿ages, though you looke loftily, and Å¿peake great Å¿welling words, in all which you breath out hell, and your own Å¿hame, the Lord I hope in time will diÅ¿cover unto you all your vanity, and Å¿infulneÅ¿Å¿e. I will Å¿ay thus much of you, that whiles you uÅ¿ed the Å¿harpeneÅ¿Å¿e of your parts againÅ¿t the common enemy, you were very Å¿erviceable to the Church of God; but now turning the edge of them againÅ¿t your ChriÅ¿tian brethren<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> you have through their Å¿ides both wounded your Å¿elfe, and all thoÅ¿e of your party, as I am moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured they will all aÅ¿Å¿ert. Yea, I can aÅ¿certaine you of this, that it is exceedingly admired by many, that you having beene Å¿ome yeares in captivity under the Prelates tyrannie, Å¿hould continue Å¿uch a trewant in the Å¿choole of affliction, as not yet to have learned the leÅ¿Å¿on of patience, Å¿o that you cannot digeÅ¿t a merry word, or but a conceived IeÅ¿t. But this they are moÅ¿t of all Å¿tranged at, that out of the height and greatneÅ¿Å¿e of your Å¿pirit you will Å¿trike your enemy, though it be through the Å¿ides of Religion, and the ChriÅ¿tian cauÅ¿e; and truly this your dealing with all your ChriÅ¿tian brethren, eÅ¿pecially with my Å¿elfe, cals for deepe and Å¿erious repentance at your hands.</p>
            <p>For my part, I freely forgive you, and do profeÅ¿Å¿e it is a griefe unto my Å¿oul that you have drawn me out with Å¿uch violence in forcing me to encounter with you by name; it's true, the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes, opinions and falÅ¿e lights (under the name of new) late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth, I did and cannot but write againÅ¿t, they being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Å¿acred writ; yet you my Brother, and <hi>Quondam</hi> Fellow Sufferer, I reverenced and did ever love, honour and eÅ¿teem, and

               <hi>from them (before they had Å¿een my books) they railed againÅ¿t me, raiÅ¿ed up falÅ¿e reports and calumniated me,</hi> as the greateÅ¿t Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary in the Kingdome; <hi>in all which they moÅ¿t Å¿hamefully (as day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿till they do) abuÅ¿ed me; thereunto I replyed in theÅ¿e words,</hi> I have been freed from that reproach by both HouÅ¿es of Parliament who adjudged all my Å¿ufferings unjuÅ¿t, as againÅ¿t the Law and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject. And if it were a thing that could be any way uÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto me. I could prove by many of the brave Gentlemen in the Kings Army, who in great AÅ¿Å¿emblies did acknowledge, when I was a PriÅ¿oner amongÅ¿t them, that I had great injury done me. Yea, the PapiÅ¿ts themÅ¿elves have often averred it, that never any Subject Å¿uffered more unjuÅ¿tly then I did, in that I was caÅ¿t into PriÅ¿on and fined, for maintaining the Prerogative Royall of the King againÅ¿t the Pope; and for defending that Religion which was eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed by the Laws of the Land: And further added, that had any Catholique writ as well in defence of their Religion, as I did for the maintenance of the ProteÅ¿tant ProfeÅ¿Å¿ion, he Å¿hould have been Å¿o far from Å¿uffering for it, as they would not only greatly have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, but alÅ¿o highly have rewarded him for his endeavour; and this that I now write I am able to prove by a cloud of witneÅ¿Å¿es: and my unjuÅ¿t Å¿uffering in their opinion, made me find more favour amongst all the Governours that were PapiÅ¿ts (which I do ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for a Å¿ingular courteÅ¿ie from them) then ever I found from ProteÅ¿tant Goalers. And therefore whereas the Independents do accuÅ¿e me for the greateÅ¿t Incendiary of the Kingdome, all men may Å¿ee they speak as untruly, Å¿o moÅ¿t maliciouÅ¿ly, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now theÅ¿e are my words: And herein is obÅ¿ervable:</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, that as I Å¿ay I have been cleared by both HouÅ¿es of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> from being an <hi>Incendiary,</hi> Å¿o I mention not, commend, or Å¿peak of the Cavaliers, for their undertakings; I onely Å¿ay, many of the brave Gentlemen in the Kings Army have alÅ¿o cleared me from that aÅ¿perÅ¿ion being convinced that my Å¿ufferings were moÅ¿t unjuÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Secondly that I Å¿ay many of the brave Gentlemen; I Å¿peak not of all the Cavaliers in the Kings Army; but you Å¿ilencing my words and omitting to Å¿hew the cauÅ¿e which induced me there to Å¿peak of them, make your complaint in Generall Å¿aying, <hi>He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Kings Cavaliers for brave Gentlemen.</hi>

            <p>Whether I diÅ¿covered unto the Cavaliers Å¿ome of that bitterneÅ¿Å¿e of spirit againÅ¿t the Independents.</p>
            <p>I anÅ¿wer, this is a cunning deceiveable queÅ¿tion, whereby you delude poore ignorant, harmeleÅ¿Å¿e people, baring them in hand, as if there were a vaÅ¿t difference and great diÅ¿agreement between the Cavaliers and Independents, which is quite contrary; for there is a direct harmonie betweene the Independents and Cavaliers of all Å¿orts, whether malignant, or popiÅ¿h Cavaliers, and the truth is, to Å¿peake againÅ¿t Independents to Cavaliers, may purchaÅ¿e diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure to any man Å¿ooner then gaine him favour; for I know, and many can teÅ¿tifie the Å¿ame, that the Cavaliers doe generally applaud the Independents; and indeed they have reaÅ¿on Å¿o to doe; for they drive on the Cavaliers great deÅ¿igne, with as much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tneÅ¿Å¿e as themÅ¿elves, yet they have done it with farre more IeÅ¿uiticall policie, doing it under the pretence of holineÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿o have beene leÅ¿Å¿e diÅ¿cerned by many in their deÅ¿tructive practiÅ¿es. But their cunning undermining both Church and State, doth now daily more and more, very manifeÅ¿tly appeare, and is diÅ¿cerned, and bewayled of all, who have not the eye of reaÅ¿on blinded with Å¿elfe-ends, and by-reÅ¿pects, and for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Å¿ake will connive at, and Å¿ide with any party: But who ever prudentially, conÅ¿cienciouÅ¿ly, and judiciouÅ¿ly examine, and take a view of their proceedings, they plainely Å¿ee and confeÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>that the Independents have exceedingly laboured to Å¿et forward, and daily doe indeavour, leaving no wayes unattempted to effect that thing, which was and is the Cavaliers grand deÅ¿igne,</hi> for it is well knowne, <hi>that the Cavaliers did make it their great, and one of their chiefeÅ¿t deÅ¿ignes to have BiÅ¿hops, and all the Prelaticall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction continued, that Å¿o Popery, though it were not by a Law Å¿et up, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in this Kingdome, yet it might be countenanced, and privately authorized by them, which is all one with the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in effect, that the Independents doe Å¿o plead, Å¿eeke after and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, calling it Liberty of ConÅ¿cience:</hi> Thus while they Å¿trive to get an unlimited, which is an irreligious and unlawfull Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

them with all their power, and Å¿hould the Independents obtaine their deÅ¿ire herein, the greateÅ¿t part of the Cavaliers worke would be done to their hand; for then Cavaliers, PapiÅ¿ts, Prelates, Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Turkes, Iewes and Heathens, would all pretend, <hi>that they beleeve, Å¿erve, and worÅ¿hip God, according to the Light they have received, and as they are perÅ¿waded in their ConÅ¿ciences is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods Word, and Will (and ConÅ¿cience is a tender thing, and ought not to be forced); Å¿o that by the Å¿ame rule in equity, a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Liberty of ConÅ¿cience cannot be denyed to any of them, if once granted to the Independents, and Sectaries of our times, who for the greateÅ¿t part of them are as erroneous, if not worÅ¿e, in their Doctrine as the Papists and Prelates; many of them as blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as the Turkes and Iewes, and live as without God in the world;</hi> and the malignant party knowing this very well, doe therefore all of them, Cavaliers, PapiÅ¿ts, and the profaneÅ¿t Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants in the Kingdome, looke upon the <hi>Independents,</hi> and Å¿peak of them uÅ¿efull as their friends, and unanimouÅ¿ly agree upon all occaÅ¿ions to withÅ¿tand the Presbyterian government, that way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too Å¿trict and holy for any of them, yea the Independents and they doe all joyne together as one man, with one voyce pleading and crying out <hi>for a toleration, liberty of conÅ¿cience, or an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence without any limitation,</hi> that Å¿o every man may beleeve and Å¿erve God as it Å¿eemes good in his owne eyes, under the name of tenderneÅ¿Å¿e of conÅ¿cience.</p>
            <p>Now the Independents practices, and the way they plead for, being thus knowne to be very pleaÅ¿ing, and acceptable to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, whether PopiÅ¿h or otherwiÅ¿e, then Å¿urely had <hi>I</hi> diÅ¿covered any bitterneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿pirit againÅ¿t Jndependents, it might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aÅ¿perated their Å¿pirits againÅ¿t mee, it could never have extracted pitie or favour, nor have drawne any applauÅ¿e from them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is cleare, that was not the cauÅ¿e: But know the onely cauÅ¿e which moved Å¿ome of the Cavaliers (after <hi>J</hi> had for the further tryall of my patience, and the manifeÅ¿tation of my faithfulneÅ¿Å¿e, for a long time indured Å¿trict and cloÅ¿e impriÅ¿onment in the Goale of <hi>Yorke)</hi> to Å¿hew me favour, was the gracious working, and over-ruling power of God, vvho inclined their hearts to deale kindly vvith me his faithfull Å¿ervant.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a true anÅ¿vver to your firÅ¿t Querie, <hi>I</hi> come now to the Å¿econd, which you propound in theÅ¿e words.</p>

Or was it Å¿ome Courtly Compliance with PapiÅ¿ts, preferring them before Independents or ProteÅ¿tants, that made thoÅ¿e PopiÅ¿h Cavaliers Å¿o much to applaud you?</p>
            <p>To which I anÅ¿wer<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that part of this laÅ¿t Querie, is the Å¿ame with the former; for here you Å¿peake as if to Å¿light the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, were a Å¿ure way to obtaine favour and applauÅ¿e from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿h Cavaliers; truly you flatter your Å¿elfe if you thinke your Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till dealing herein is not Å¿eene, when as it is Å¿o notoriouÅ¿ly known, that any man who Å¿peaks againÅ¿t Independents may be Å¿cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but never applauded by PopiÅ¿h, or any that are Cavaliers; for they applaud the Independents, whom they hold to be more Å¿ubtill, and powerfull to effect the thing they chiefly ayms at, and deÅ¿ire then themÅ¿elves; and it is well knowne, and can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they will run and goe to doe any Malignant a favour, yea, they will joyne with the wickedeÅ¿t Cavaliers againÅ¿t a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to doe him a miÅ¿chiefe.

To which I anÅ¿wer, that my conÅ¿tant perÅ¿everance in holding forth the true ProteÅ¿tant Religion where ever I lived, at home and beyond the Å¿eas, is Å¿ufficiently knowne to all the godly, faithfull, orthodox ChriÅ¿tians, that inhabited in any of thoÅ¿e parts where I have dwelt, and Å¿o farre have I ever beene from any courtly complying with PapiÅ¿ts, or preferring them before ProteÅ¿tants, as Å¿ome in <hi>England</hi> at this day can teÅ¿tifie, that when I lived in forraine nations, my zeale was Å¿o great for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant Religion, that with no little hazard I have maintained it; for all the while I travailed abroad, and continued in PopiÅ¿h Countries, which was many yeares, it fared with mee as with the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul,</hi> while hee waited at <hi>Athens, Act.</hi> 17. 16, 17. my Å¿pirit was Å¿tirred in me when I Å¿aw the Cities and all the Countries wholly given to Idolatry; therefore carrying my life in my hand I daily diÅ¿puted with PapiÅ¿ts, and thoÅ¿e they accounted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout perÅ¿ons, PrieÅ¿ts and IeÅ¿uits againÅ¿t Popery, maintaining the ProteÅ¿tant Religion; inÅ¿omuch, as it was only the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of my God that kept me Å¿afe, giving them no power to hurt mee; further <hi>J</hi> anÅ¿wer you, the Bookes that <hi>I</hi> have written againÅ¿t Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, in Latine, and in EngliÅ¿h, are yet extant, and they doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e

Brother, have you had Å¿uch experience of Gods power and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goodneÅ¿Å¿e in giving you favor two years together in the eyes of Å¿ome to whom you were committed PriÅ¿oner, and do you now think it Å¿o Å¿trange as you cannot Å¿earch out the reaÅ¿on of it when God hath wrought the Å¿ame thing for me, (one Moneth) but Å¿uÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the favor I received was purchaÅ¿ed by wronging my conÅ¿cience? Surely when you writ theÅ¿e quaeries you had forgot the loving kindneÅ¿Å¿es of our God Å¿hewed to you in your impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onment, and how notwithÅ¿tanding for the firÅ¿t halfe year, the Governour of <hi>GarnÅ¿ey</hi> kept you cloÅ¿e PriÅ¿oner in very Å¿trict du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (in Å¿ome things exceeding the rigor of his Warrant); Yet at laÅ¿t <hi>God</hi> moving his heart to more humanitie, he afterwards gave you what liberty the CaÅ¿tle did afford, Å¿uffered you not to want any accommodation that he could poÅ¿Å¿iblie helpe you unto, and uÅ¿ed you courteouÅ¿ly all the remaining time of your baniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Had you called theÅ¿e things to mind (me thinks) the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Gods mercies unto your Å¿elfe would have fully Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied you in this particular, and Å¿ilenced your carnall reaÅ¿onings, knowing <hi>Gods</hi> arme is not Å¿hortned nor his power leÅ¿Å¿ened, He is the Å¿ame <hi>God</hi> yeÅ¿terday, to day, and for ever; therefore (I Å¿ay) Å¿urely you had forgot his loving kindneÅ¿Å¿es to you, or elÅ¿e you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Å¿topped the mouth of your experiences and would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to Å¿peak for me, whom you Å¿o Å¿eek to blot with falÅ¿e reports, ignominie, and diÅ¿gracefull language, that even the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>God</hi> manifeÅ¿teÅ¿t towards me, you to obÅ¿cure with a vail of evill Å¿urmiÅ¿es; But that the name of <hi>God</hi> may be ever magnified, the world undeceived, and you receive a Å¿atisfactory anÅ¿wer unto your quaeries, know, it was not any courtly compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with PapiÅ¿ts which procured me favor; I did no Å¿uch thing; let <hi>God</hi> be true, and every man a lyar; for to him all praiÅ¿e is due, who in his Word hath Å¿aid, <hi>When a mans ways pleaÅ¿e the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him,</hi> Prov. 16. 7. This did my <hi>God,</hi> when I was committed cloÅ¿e PriÅ¿oner to a PapiÅ¿t, make good to me his Å¿ervant (who though in much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, do make it the ultimate end of all my endeavors to pleaÅ¿e the Lord): Now this was <hi>the Lords doing, and let it not Å¿eem marvellous in your eyes, That that God, who called Cyrus by name, made him a friend to the people of God, though he knew not God,</hi> IÅ¿aiah 45. 4. <hi>Who Å¿ent his Angel and Å¿hut the lyons mouthes</hi>

No Å¿urely! For this and greater things then this, my <hi>God</hi> hath done for me; Therefore the experiences I have had of his goodneÅ¿Å¿e, free grace, rich mercies, and never failing loving kindneÅ¿Å¿es, I for ever will extoll, predicate, declare, and Å¿peak of, that men may know it is not in vain to Å¿erve and patiently wait upon the Lord our <hi>God,</hi> nor to relie on him, in the time of their diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e, when they Å¿eem to be deprived of all outward comforts and expoÅ¿ed to the greateÅ¿t miÅ¿eries.</p>
            <p>Thus I have labored to Å¿atisfie your doubts truly, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anÅ¿wer your quaeries. The Lord convince you of your error, and of the reail truth of all I have herein Å¿aid, and forgive your unbrotherly practices and bitter invectives againÅ¿t me, one of your <hi>Quondam Follow Sufferers.</hi>

            <p>Now becauÅ¿e my brother <hi>Burton</hi> hath Å¿o deeply cenÅ¿ured me for my <hi>PoÅ¿tÅ¿cript,</hi> and becauÅ¿e all thoÅ¿e of his fraternity have upon all occaÅ¿ions Å¿o often reviled me for it, though none but himÅ¿elf ever indeavored to diÅ¿prove the leaÅ¿t title of it, which they can never do, I intend within theÅ¿e few daies to Å¿end it out again into the world Å¿omething inlarged touching their New Lights, undertaking before all men to make good whatÅ¿oever is contained in it, and much more concerning their practices.</p>
