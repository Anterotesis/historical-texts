            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all duty and submission I here present unto your Lordship a Treatise concerning the fift ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Councell</hi> held at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, the cause being the Controversie of the Three Chapters which for many yeares troubled the whole Church, and was at length decided in this <hi>Councell</hi> held under <hi>Iustinian</hi> that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Emperour. This Treatise, now printed, was long agoe penned by one well known unto your Honour; your sincere affection to the truth of God and Gods cause, gives mee good assurance of your favourable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hereof. I confesse indeed, that when I call to minde the manifold affaires wherein your Honour is daily imployed, the very thought hereof had almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded mee not to interrupt your more serious affaires, by drawing your Honour to the reading or view of this
<pb facs="tcp:7679:3"/>
Booke: but when I call to minde those respects of love and duty, in which the Author hereof stood bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Lordship, I was againe incouraged in his name to tender it to your Honour: And although I my selfe can challenge no interest in your Lordships favour to offer this, yet your Lordship may challenge some interest in the fruits of his labours, who was so truely (as I can truely speake) devoted unto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Among many other, hee especially acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged two assured bonds of love and duty by which hee was obliged unto you, and your friends; the former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from that unfained affection which you ever bare him from your first acquaintance in the Colledge; that other, by which he was further ingaged unto you, and your friends, was, when in a loving respect had unto him in his absence, without any meanes made by him, or knowledge of his, he was called by that much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Knight Sir <hi>Iohn Levison</hi> his Patron, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, unto the best <note n="a" place="margin">Black Notley <hi>in</hi> Essex.</note> meanes of livelihood he ever enjoyed in the Ministery, where spending himselfe in his studies, hee ended his dayes; during which time your Honour made your affection further knowne unto him by speciall expressions of extraordinary favours: In regard whereof I perswaded my selfe, that I could no where better crave Patronage for this worke, than of your Honour, that it may bee a further testimony of his love againe, who cannot now speake for himselfe.
<q>And this I intreat leave to doe, the rather, because I doubt not but hee acquainted your Lordship with his paines and intent in this, and other Tractates of the Councels; <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>See his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of</hi> Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, <hi>printed</hi> Anno <hi>1616.</hi>
                  </note> for when after divers yeares study be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
<pb facs="tcp:7679:3"/>
in this argument of <hi>Councels,</hi> hee was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make some use of his labours; his intent was, to reduce all those points into foure severall Bookes; <hi>1.</hi> That the <hi>right</hi> of calling generall <hi>Councels</hi>; <hi>2.</hi> That the <hi>right</hi> of highest <hi>Presidency</hi> in them; <hi>3.</hi> That the <hi>right</hi> of the last and supreme <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of them; is onely <hi>Imperiall</hi> and not <hi>Papall. 4.</hi> That all the lawfull generall <hi>Councels</hi> which hitherto have beene held, consent with ours, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the doctrines of the present <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> Some of these hee finished, the fourth hee could not so much as hope to accomplish, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the examining of some particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he desisted and weaned himselfe from those stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: And yet after some yeares discontinuance, being by some of his learned friends sollicited to communicate to others, at least some one Tract in that argument, consenting to their earnest desire, after long suspence he resolved on this Treatise, as being for weighty and important matters most delightfull unto him. That it was not then published, let it not seeme strange unto your Honour, for having long since finished the Tract of this whole <hi>Councell,</hi> it was his purpose, that it should have undergone the publike view and judgement of the Church; but when he came (as I can truely testifie) unto them, whose art and ayde is needfull in such a businesse, and found an aversenesse in them, for that it wholy consisted of controversall matters, whereof they feared that this age had taken a satiety, he rested in this answer, as willing to bury it.</q>
After this, being upon a speciall
<pb facs="tcp:7679:4"/>
command from his Majesty, King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory, made known unto him by my <hi>Lord his Grace of Canterbury,</hi> to addresse himselfe to <note n="c" place="margin">Disensio Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae Anglic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cont. Archiep. Spal.</note> another worke, hee then desisted from his former intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and in finishing of that last worke of his, he ended his dayes. Some few yeares after his death being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to take a view of some of his Papers, I came to the view and handling of this boooke, a booke fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for the Presse in his life time, the publishing whereof being long expected, and of many earnestly desired, it was my desire and theirs, to whose most grave and judicious censure I willingly submitted it, that it might be published for the benefit of Gods Church; and the rather, that it might give some light in the study of the Councels, and animate some of <hi>the</hi>

The middle ranke, beginning at the second <hi>Nicene,</hi> unto the Councill of <hi>Florence,</hi> which were held in those ages of the mingled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Church, none of them are either wholly ours or wholly theirs, those miscellane Councils, are neither thine nor mine, but they must all be divided. The two last, the one at <hi>Laterane,</hi> the other at <hi>Trent,</hi> which are the very lees and dreggs of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills, held onely by such as were the drosse of the Church quite severed from the gold, wee willingly yeeld unto them: they and they onely are wholly theirs, let them have, let them enjoy their <hi>Helenaes,</hi> we envy not such refuse Councils unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When first I set my selfe to the handling of this argument
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7679:13"/>
concerning the Councils, it was my purpose, besides those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generall questions, concerning the right of calling generall Councils, the right of Presidencie in them, and the right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them, to have made manifest those three severall points, touching those three rankes of Councils; every one of which, is not onely true, but even demonstrable in it selfe. And though with a delightfull kind of toile I have made no small progresse therein, yet alas, how unequall am I to such an <hi>Herculean</hi> labour? whose time, whose strength of body, or industry of minde, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to accomplish a worke of such amplitude, and of so vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for which not <hi>Nestors</hi> age would suffice? Wherefore tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my sailes, from this so long, and tedious a voyage, which I could not so much as hope to end, &amp; which beside many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rockes, hidden Syrtes and sands, is every where beset by many Romane enemies, specially by <hi>Baronius</hi> the Archpirate of this and former ages, with whom at every turne, almost, one shall be sure to have an hot encounter; I thought a shorter course far more fit, for my small and unfurnisht barke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing of more or longer voyages, I shall be glad if God will enable me to make but a cut onely over some one arme of that great Ocean, not doubting but the ice being once broken, and the passage through these straits opened, many other will with more facilitie, and felicitie also, performe the like in the rest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the whole journey through every part of these seas be at length fully accomplished.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Among all the Councils I have for sundry reasons made choice of the fift, held at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the time of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Iustinian</hi> and Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> for authoritie equall to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it being, as well as they, approved by the consenting judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholike Church; for antiquitie venerable, being held within 600. yeares after Christ, even in those times while as yet the drosse had not prevailed and got the predominancie above the gold, as in the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod and succeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it did: for varietie of weighty and important matters, more delightfull then any of the rest; and, which I most respected of them all, most apt to make manifest the truth and true Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ancient and Catholike Church touching those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of the Popes supremacy of authority and infallibility of judgement, which are of all other most ventilated in these dayes.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="8">8. The summe and effect of the Popes <hi>Constitution</hi> is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of those <hi>three Chapters,</hi> which the Emperor by his most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Edict had condemned and accursed.

                  <hi>pro ipsorum defensione laborat; Vigilius labored for defence of the Three Chapters.</hi> But the <hi>Constitution</hi> it selfe maketh this most evident.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Concerning the <hi>first Chapter,</hi> whether <hi>Theodorus</hi> (being dead more then an hundred yeares before this Council) ought to be condemned, <hi>Vigilius</hi> thus decreed, <hi>Nulli</hi>

                  <hi>minime repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuntur in vit a damnati, are not found to have beene condemned while they lived.</hi> This for the generality of the dead: particularly for <hi>Theodorus B. of Mopsvestia</hi> he thus decreed <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. nu.</hi> 179.</note>, Seeing the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not, (as he saith) condemned him, <hi>eum nostra non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus damnare sententia, we dare not condemne him by our sentence, sed nec ab alio quopiam condemnari concedimus; neither doe we permit that any other shall condemne him.</hi>

               <p n="10">10. For the <hi>second Chapter</hi> which concernes the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> against <hi>Cyrill, Vigilius</hi> was so tender of the credit of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that he would by no meanes permit his name to be

               <p n="11">11. The <hi>third Chapter</hi> (which indeed is the most materiall, but withall most intricate and obscure) concerns the Epistle written against <hi>Cyril</hi> and the holy <hi>Ephesine Synod,</hi> by <hi>Ibas</hi> B. of <hi>Edessa</hi> unto <hi>Maris</hi> a Persian and an Hereticke: the copie whereof is set downe in the 10.

               <p n="12">12. This to have beene indeed the true meaning of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> his owne words in his <hi>Constitution</hi> make manifest. There he first sets downe the ground of his sentence, and that was the sayings of <hi>Pascasinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> in the Councill at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> The <note n="h" place="margin">

                  <hi>Ex relecto rescripto epistolae, orthodoxa est ejus declarata dictatio; by the Epistle of Ibas now read, his Epistle or writing is declared to be orthodoxall.

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Epistolam pronunciantes orthodoxam, pronounced this Epistle to be orthodoxall:</hi> and yet more plainly, <hi>Orthodoxa est Ibae à patribus pronunciata dictatio; the Epistle or writing of Ibas was pronounced orthodoxall by the Fathers at Chalcedon</hi>; The other, that by this Epistle they judged <hi>Ibas</hi> to be a Catholike; to which purpose <hi>Vigilius</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Iuvenalis would never have said that Ibas was a Catholike, nisi ex verbis epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siolae ejus confessionem fidei orthodoxam comprobaret,</hi> Vnles <hi>by the words of his Epistle he had proved his faith to be orthodoxall,</hi> which words evidently shew that <hi>Vigilius</hi> thought in like sort all the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7679:18"/>
Bishops at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to have judged the same by the words of that Epistle, for it is certaine that they all embraced <hi>Ibas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for a Catholike.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Hereupon now ensueth the <hi>Definitive</hi> sentence of <hi>Vigilius</hi> touching this Chapter, in this manner: <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. nu.</hi> 196.</note> We following the judgement of the holy Fathers in all things, seeing it is a most cleare and shining truth, <hi>ex verbis Epistolae venerabilis Ibae; by the words of the Epistle of the reverend B. Ibas,</hi> being taken in their most right and godly sense, and by the acts of <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius,</hi> and by the meaning of <hi>Ibas</hi> being present, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> did most justly pronounce the faith of this most reverend Bishop <hi>Ibas</hi> to be orthodoxall, we decree by the authoritie of this our present sentence, that the Iudgement of the Fathers at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ought to remaine inviolable, both in all other things, and in this Epistle of <hi>Ibas</hi> so often mentioned. Thus <hi>Vigilius</hi>: decreeing both that this Epistle of <hi>Ibas</hi> is Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, &amp; that by it &amp; by the words thereof, <hi>Ibas</hi> ought to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a Catholike; both which he decreeth upon this ground, that the Councill of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> (as he supposeth) had judged the same.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In the end, to ratifie and confirme all that concernes any of these <hi>Three Chapters</hi> in the Popes <hi>Decree,</hi> he addeth this very remarkable conclusion; <note n="n" place="margin">

               <p n="7">VII. The holy Councill teacheth, that in Christ there are <hi>two distinct natures,</hi> yet but one person consisting of both: The Epistle teacheth, that as there are two natures, so also <hi>two persons</hi> in Christ, and that there is no personall, but onely an affectuall unitie of those two persons.

former Anathemaes all denounced and proclamed to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, to be accursed and separate from God, by the judiciall and definitive sentence of this holy generall Councill.</p>
               <p n="21">21. With what comfort, alacritie and confidence may the servants of Christ fight his battles, and defend their holy faith and religion? or how can the servants of <hi>Antichrist</hi> chuse, but be utterly dismayed and daunted herewith, seeing they cannot wag their tongues or hands, to speake or write ought either against ours, or in defence of their owne doctrines, especially not of that which is the foundation of the rest, and is virtually in them all, but <hi>ipso facto,</hi> even for that act alone, if there were no other cause, they are declared and pronounced by the judiciall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an holy, generall, and approved Councill, to be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed heretikes.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The Councill yet adds another clause, which justly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth a speciall consideration. Some there are who would be held men of such a milde and mercifull disposition, that though they dislike and condemne those assertions of the Popes supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of authoritie, and infallibility of judgement, yet are they so charitably affected to the Defenders of those assertions, that they dare not themselves, nor can indure that others should call them heretickes or accursed: <hi>Durus est hic sermo,</hi> this is too harsh and hard. See here the fervour and zeale of this holy Councill! They first say, Cursed be the defenders of this Epistle or any part thereof: As much in effect, as if they had said, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be <hi>Vigilius, Baronius, Bellarmine,</hi> and all who defend the Popes judgement in causes of faith to be infallible, that is, all that are members of the present Church of Rome, Cursed be they all.

After all these just Anathemaes denounced as well in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall as in particular by the Councill against the defenders of these <hi>Three Chapters</hi> or any one of them; the holy Synod sets downe in the last place one other point as memorable as any of the former: And that is by what authority they decreed all these things, of which they thus say, <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 8. <hi>pa.</hi> 588. <hi>a.</hi>
                  </note> we have rightly confessed these things, <hi>quae tradita sund nobis tam à divinis scripturis; which are delivered unto us both in the divine scriptures, and in the doctrines of the holy Fathers, and in the definitions of faith made by the foure former Councils.</hi> So the holy Councill. Whence it doth evidently ensue, that to teach and affirme, that the Pope in his judiciall and cathedrall sentence of faith may erre and define heresie, and that <hi>Vigilius</hi> in his constitution <hi>de facto</hi> did so, is a truth conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Scriptures, fathers, and the foure first general Councils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But on the other side, to maintaine or affirme (as do all who are members of the present Romane Church) that the Popes cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall sentence in causes of faith is <hi>infallible,</hi> is an hereticall posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repugnant to Scriptures, Fathers, and the 4. first Councils, and condemned by them all. So at once the Holy Councill judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially defineth both our faith to be truly ancient &amp; Apostolical, the selfe same which the Holy Fathers, generall Councills, and the Catholike Church professed for 600 yeares; and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the present Romane Church, even that fundamentall position, on which all the rest doe relye, to be not onely new,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7679:25"/>
but hereticall, such as none can maintaine, but even thereby he oppugneth and contradicteth both the Scriptures, Fathers, the foure first general Councils; and the Catholike Church for 600 yeares after Christ.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Further yet: because one part of their sentence is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursing of all who defend the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> either expresly, as did <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or <hi>implicitè,</hi> and by consequent, as do all who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Popes judgement in causes of faith to be infallible, that is, al who are members of the present Romane Church, and so die; it cleerely ensueth from that last clause of the Councill, that to condemne and accurse as heretikes all these, yea, all which doe not accurse these, is by the judgement of this whole generall Council, warranted by Scriptures, by Fathers, by the foure first generall Councils, and by the Caholike Church for 600 yeares after Christ: The judgement of this fifth Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consonant to them all, and warranted by them all.</p>

               <p n="29">29. From whence it evidently and unavoidably ensueth, that as this fift Synod, so all succeeding Councils, Popes and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to the time of the Councill of <hi>Constance</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7679:26"/>
heart beleeve, and in words professe and teach, that the Popes Cathedrall sentence in causes of faith, may be, and <hi>de facto</hi> hath been hereticall: that is, they all did beleeve and teach, that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which the reformed Churches maintaine, to be truly anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, orthodoxall and catholike, such as the whole Church of Christ, for more then 14 hundred yeares, beleeved and taught: but the doctrine (even the Fundamentall position whereon all their doctrines doe relie, and which is vertually included in them all) which the present Church of Rome maintaineth, to be new, hereticall and accursed, such as the whole Church for so many hundred yeares together with one consent beleeved and taught to be accursed and hereticall. It hence further ensueth, that as this fift Councill did, so all the fore-mentioned generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Popes and Bishops, doe with it condemne and accurse for heretikes not onely <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but all who either have or doe hereafter defend him and his <hi>Constitution,</hi> even all, who either by word or writing, have or shall maintaine that the Popes <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall</hi> judgement in causes of faith is infallible, that is, all who are members of the present Romane Church, and so continue till their death: nay, they not onely accurse all such, but further also, even all who doe not accurse such. And because the decree of this fift Councill is approved by them, to the least <hi>iôta</hi> it in the last place followeth, that the condemning and accursing for hereticall that doctrine of the Popes infallibilitie in causes of faith, and accursing for heretikes, all who either by word or writing have, or doe at any time hereafter defend the same, and so presist till they dye; nay, not onely the accursing of all such, but of all who doe not accurse them, is warranted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by Fathers, by all generall Councils, by all Popes and Bishops, that have beene for more then 14. hundred yeares after Christ.</p>

So by all the notes of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> it is evident, not onely that this question about the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> is <hi>a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith</hi>; but, which is more, that the holy generall Councell proposed their Decree herein, <hi>tanquam de fide, as a Decree of faith.</hi> Now because every Christian is bound to beleeve <hi>certitudine fidei cui falsum subesse non potest, with certainty of faith which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> every doctrine and position of faith, then especially when it is published and declared by a Decree of the Church to bee a doctrine of faith: Seeing by this Decree of faith which the Councell now made, not onely the Popes <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a cause of faith, is condemned to bee hereticall, but all they also who defend it, to be Heretikes and accursed; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all defend it who maintaine the Popes cathedrall sentence to be <hi>infallible,</hi> that is, <hi>all who are members of the present Church of Rome</hi>: it hence inevitably ensueth, that every Christian is bound to beleeve <hi>certitudine fidei cui falsum subesse non potest,</hi> not onely the doctrine, even the <hi>fundamentall</hi> doctrine of the present Church of Rome to be hereticall, but all that maintaine it; that is, all that are members of that Church, to be heretikes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed, unlesse disclaiming that heresie they forsake all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with that Church. <hi>Baronius</hi> perceiving all those <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes</hi> to fall inevitably upon himselfe, and their whole Church, if this cause of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> which <hi>Vigilius</hi> defended and defined by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Constitution, that they must be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7679:33"/>
if this I say were admitted to be a cause of faith, that hee might shuffle off those <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> which like the leprosie of <hi>Gehazi</hi> doth cleave unto them; thought it the safest, as indeed it was the shortest way, to deny this to be a cause of faith, which not onely by all the precedent witnesses, but by the judgement of their owne Cardinall, and all the three notes set downe by him, is undeniably proved to bee a cause of faith, and that the Decree of the Holy Councell concerning it, is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as a Decree of faith.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I might further adde their owne <hi>Nicholas Sanders,</hi> who though he saw not much in matters of faith, yet he both saw and professed this truth,, and therefore in plaine termes calleth <note n="k" place="margin">

Now heresie it could not be, unlesse it were a cause of faith, seeing every heresie is a deviation from the faith. But omitting him, and some others of his ranke, I will now in the last place adde one other witnesse, which with the favourites of <hi>Baronius</hi> is of more weight and worth, than all the former, and that is <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe, who, as he doth often deny, so doth he often and plainly professe this to be a cause of faith. Speaking of the Emperours Edict concerning these <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> he bitterly reproveth; yea, he reproacheth the Emperour for that he would <note n="l" place="margin">

               <p n="15">15. The truth is, the Cardinals judgement was unsetled, and himselfe in a manner infatuated in handling this whole cause touching <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the fift generall Councell. For having once resolved to deny this one truth, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence maintained and defined heresie, and decreed that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should maintaine it, (which one truth, like a <hi>Thesean</hi> threed would easily and certainly have directed him in all the rest of his Treatise;) now he wandreth up and down as in a Labyrinth, toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himselfe in uncertainties and contradictions, saying, and gainsaying, whatsoever either the present occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he hath in hand, or the partialitie of his corrupted judgement, like a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7679:33"/>
tempest doth drive him unto; when the Emperour or his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict (to both which he beares an implacable hatred) comes in his way, then this question about the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> must bee a cause of faith: for so the Cardinall may have a spacious field to declame against the Emperour for presuming to intermeddle and make lawes in a cause of faith. But when Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> or his <hi>Constitution</hi> (with which the Cardinall is most partially blinded) meet him, then the case is quite altered, the question about the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> must then bee no more a question or cause of faith; for that is an easie way to excuse <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of his Chaire: he erred onely in some personall matters, in such the Pope may erre; he erred not in any doctrinall point, nor in a cause of faith; in such is hee and his Chaire infallible.</p>
               <p n="16">16. There remaineth one doubt, arising out of the words of <hi>Gregory,</hi> by the wilfull mistaking whereof <note n="p" place="margin">

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> was misse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. He seemeth to teach the same with the Cardinall, where speaking of this fift Synod, hee saith, <note n="q" place="margin">

                  <hi>In eâ de personis tantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo, non autem de fide aliquid est gestum; In it was onely handled somewhat concerning those persons, but nothing concerning the faith.</hi> So <hi>Gregory,</hi> whose words if they be taken without any limitation, are not onely untrue, but repugnant to the consenting judgement of Councels and Fathers above mentioned, even to <hi>Gregory</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: for speaking of all the five Councels held before his time, he saith, <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Whosoever embraceth, praedictarum Synodorum fidem, the faith explaned by those five Councels, peace be unto them.</hi> And if hee had not in such particular manner testified this; yet seeing hee approveth (as was before <note n="s" place="margin">

               <p n="17">17. What then is <hi>Gregory</hi> repugnant to himselfe herein? I list not to censure so of him; rather by his owne words I desire to explane his meaning. There were divers in his time, as also in his Predecessor's <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who condemned this fift Councell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as they supposed, it had altered and abolished the faith of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> by condemning these <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and had established a new doctrine of faith. <hi>Gregorie</hi> intreating against these, whom he truly calleth <note n="t" place="margin">

The Decrees made at <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> were Introductive; as first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning those heresies of <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches.</hi> The Decree of this fift Councell was onely <hi>Corroborative,</hi> or <hi>Declarative,</hi> expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and corroborating those former decrees, by condemning these writings of <hi>Theodorus, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Ibas,</hi> which did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the same. As <hi>Vigilius</hi> and other followers of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> did not at this time broach any new heresie, but under those <hi>Three Chapters</hi> on which they put the visor of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> sought to revive the heresie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> which before, when it came in its owne habit, was condemned: Even so the fift Councell needed not, neither did they condemne any new, but unmasked the old &amp; condemned heresie of <hi>Nestorius</hi> lurking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the defence of these <hi>Three Chapters</hi>; they pulled off the visor of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> from it, under which it most subtilly now sought to insinuate it selfe, and creep into the Church. And when <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, that in this fift Councell they dealt <hi>tantummodo de personis,</hi> that <hi>tantummodo,</hi> in his sense doth not exclude all handling of the faith, not the explaning, not the corroborating of the faith, for both these they certainly did, and <hi>Gregory</hi> acknowledgeth: but it onely excludes such an handling of the faith as was used at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7679:34"/>
and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> by making an <hi>Introductive</hi> decree for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning some new heresie. The fift Councell dealt onely with persons, without making such a Decree; yet it dealt with those persons with an intent to explane and corroborate those <hi>Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> decrees.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The words of <hi>Gregory</hi> next following those on which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> relied, doe yet more fully explane this to have beene his meaning. In the fift Synod nothing was done concerning the faith, but only the persons; and those persons, <hi>de quibus in Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donensi Synodo nihil continetur, concerning wch</hi> 
                  <hi>persons nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or set downe in the Councell at Chalcedon.</hi> For as there is much contained in that Councell concerning those persons, especially <hi>Ibas,</hi> (in whose cause, and the examining therof, two <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.</note> whole A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are bestowed) and yet in a favourable construction, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Gregory</hi> his meaning, he might truly say, that nothing concerning them is contained there; to wit, nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>Theodorus,</hi> or the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Ibas</hi> in such an expresse and particular manner as they are condemned in the fift Councell: Right so, though the fift Councell not onely handled a cause of faith, but published their decree as a Decree of faith; yet in a like favourable construction, and according to <hi>Gregories</hi> meaning he might truly say, that nothing was done therein concerning the faith, to wit, nothing to make such an <hi>Introductive</hi> decree for condemning a new heresie, as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made in the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. By all which the true meaning of <hi>Gregory</hi> is now by his owne explaning most evident. In the fift Councell nothing was done contrary to the faith, (as the malignant slanderers of this Councell pretended) nothing was done <hi>de novo, to condemne any new heresie</hi>; nothing was done absolutely, or without reference to these <hi>Three Chapters</hi>: all this <hi>Gregory</hi> truly intendeth, when he saith, nothing was done therein concerning the faith: but seeing all that was done in the Councell, was done to explane, confirme &amp; corroberate the faith decreed at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ephesus</hi>; as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> himselfe professeth, it undoubtedly followeth, that even for this cause, and by <hi>Gregories</hi> owne testimonie, the question here defined was a cause and question of faith. Vpon <hi>Gregories</hi> words the Cardinall might well have collected, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> erred not in any new heresie, or new question of faith, such as was not before condemned; but that he erred not at all in a cause of faith, is so farre from the intent of <hi>Gregory,</hi> that out of his expresse words the quite contrary is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be collected. For how can the Pope be said not at all to erre in the faith, when by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Constitution hede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth that cause of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> the defending whereof contradicteth a former definition of faith, and utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the holy Councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalaceon</hi>; yea, the whole Catholike faith.</p>

Neither must this seeme strange to any, that the fift gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell did onely explane and confirme a former definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, and made no decree to condemne any new heresie repugnant to the faith. The like hereof in some other Councels may be obserued. The Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> was a generall holy Councel, as beside <note n="b" place="margin">

it is evidently proved so nearely to concerne the faith, that to defend these Chapters (which <hi>Vigilius</hi> did) is to enervate and overthrow; and to condemne them (which the Councell did) is to uphold and confirme the Holy Catholike faith.

               <p n="15">15. But leaving the Cardinall in these bryars, seeing by the upright, and unpartiall judgement of the whole Catholike Church of all ages, we have proved the Popes decree herein to be erroneous, and (because it is in <hi>a cause of faith</hi>) heretical, let us a little examine the two reasons on which <hi>Vigilius</hi> groundeth this his assertion: The former is taken from those words of our Saviour, <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth</hi> 18, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>whatsoever ye binde on earth,</hi> whence, as you have seene, <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and, as he saith, <hi>Gelasius</hi> also collecteth, that such as are not on earth or alive, cannot be judged by the Church.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The answer is not hard; our Saviours words, being well considered, are so farre from concluding, what <hi>Vigilius</hi> or <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> or both, doe thence collect, that they clearly and certainly doe enforce the quite contrary; for he said not, Whatsoever yee binde, or loose, concerning those that are on earth, or living; in which sense <hi>Vigilius</hi> tooke them: but, Whatsoever concerning either the <hi>living</hi> or <hi>dead,</hi> ye my <hi>Apostles</hi> and your <hi>successors</hi> being upon earth, or during your life time, shall binde or loose, the same according to your censure here passed upon earth, shall by my authority bee ratified in heaven. The restrictive termes [<hi>upon earth</hi>] are referred to the parties, who doe binde, or loose; not to the parties, who are bound, or loosed. The generall terme [<hi>whatsoever</hi>] is referred to the parties who are bound, or loosed, whether they be dead, or alive, not to the parties who binde or loose, who are onely alive, and upon earth. Nor doth our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our say, Whatsoever yee seeme to binde or loose here upon earth, shall bee bound or loosed in heaven; for, (<hi>ecclesiae clave errante</hi>) no censure doth, or can either binde, or loose, either the quicke or the dead: but he saith, Whatsoever ye doe binde or loose, if the party be once truly and really bound, or loosed, by you that are upon earth, it shall stand firme, and bee ratified by my selfe in heaven. So the parties who doe binde, or loose, are the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and their <hi>successors</hi> onely while they are upon earth: the parties who are bound, or loosed, are any whosoever whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>alive</hi> or <hi>dead</hi>; the partie who ratifieth their act in binding and loosing, is <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe in heaven; For I say unto you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever ye binde on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever yee loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This exposition is clearly warranted by the judgement of the whole catholike Church, which, as we have before declared, both beleeved, taught, and practised this authority of binding,

Now after the reasons of <hi>Vigilius</hi> fully refuted, in stead of a conclusion, I will adde one short consideration to all that hath beene said, That this position decreed by <hi>Vigilius</hi> is such, as doth not onely condemne the catholike church, that is, all the oppugners of it, but even <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe, and all who defend it. Say you, that a dead man may not <hi>noviter</hi> be condemned? In saying so you condemne the holy Councell at <hi>Sardica,</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> for they all did <hi>noviter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne such persons being dead, as in their lives time had not beene condemned. Now the holy Fathers of those Councels, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus condemned the dead, dyed themselves in the Lord, and were in peace gathered to the Lord. If you say, they should not have condemned the dead, even in saying so you doe <hi>noviter</hi> condemne all those Fathers being now dead; and so you doe that same thing, which you say must not bee done; and even by defending your position, you overthrow your owne position; for you doe <hi>noviter</hi> condemne all those holy Fathers being dead; and yet you say, that no man may <hi>noviter</hi> condemne the dead: Nay, you condemne not them only, but even your own selfe also herein, for you condemne those, who condemne the dead, and yet your selfe condemnes all those holy Fathers, being now dead; and you condemne them for doing that, which your selfe now doe; even for condemning the dead. Such a strange dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord there is in this hereticall position of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> that it not only fights against the truth, and the opposites unto it; but viper-like, even against it selfe, and against the favourers, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it.</p>

                  </note> Councell, where, as it were of purpose, this reason of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is refuted in this manner; <hi>Whereas it is said of some</hi> (and <hi>one of those is</hi> Vigilius) that <hi>Theodorus</hi> died in the peace and communion of the Church, <hi>mendacium est &amp; calumnia, magis adversus Ecclesiam; this is a lie and slander, and that especially to the Church.</hi> For he is said to die in the communion and peace of the Church, <hi>qui usque ad mortem rectae Ecclesiae dogmata servavit; who hath kept and held the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of faith, even till his death:</hi> But that <hi>Theodorus</hi> did not keepe those doctrines, <hi>certum est, it is certaine</hi> by his blasphemies: and <hi>Gregory Nissen</hi> witnesseth the same.

               <p n="4">4. Can ought be wished more pregnant to manifest the foule errours of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this part of his decree? <hi>Vigilius</hi> affirmeth that <hi>Theodorus</hi> dyed in the peace and communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church: The Emperour and Councell not onely testifie the contrary, but for this very cause the Councell (impatient at such indignitie offered to Gods Church,) cals him in plaine termes a lyar, and a slanderer; yea, a slanderer of the whole Catholike Church in so saying. <hi>Vigilius</hi> from the not condemning of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> in his life time, collecteth, that hee dyed in the peace and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7679:42"/>
communion of the Church: both the Emperour and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell witnesse his doctrinall errour herein: truly teaching, that though an heretike live all his life time, not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned by the Church, but in all outward pompe, honour, and applause of the Church; either himselfe cunningly cloaking, or the Church not curiously, and warily observing his heresie while hee liveth; yet such a man neither lives, nor dyes in the intire peace and communion of the Church. The Church hath such peace with none, who have not peace with God; nor communion with any, who have not union with Christ. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him not, because, as it teacheth others, so it selfe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth most charitably of all: It judged him to be such, as hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and professed himselfe to bee. It was not his person, but his profession, with which the Church in his life time had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and peace; As soone as ever it seeth him not to bee indeed such as hee seemed to bee, it renounceth all peace and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, whether dead, or alive: nay, rather it forsaketh not her communion with him, but declareth unto all, that shee never had communion or peace with this man, such as hee was indeed before, though she had peace with such as he seemed to bee. Shee now denounceth a double anathema against him, condemning him first for beleeving or teaching heresie, and then for covering his heresie under the visor of a Catholike, and of the Catholike faith. So justly and fully doth the Emperour, and Councell refute, both the personall errour of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in that hee affirmeth <hi>Theodorus</hi> to have dyed in the peace of the Church; and the doctrinall also, in that he affirmeth it upon this ground, that in his life time hee was not condemned by the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now whereas <note n="i" place="margin">

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> saith, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had just, and worthy reasons to defend this <hi>first Chapter</hi>: one of which is this, because, if this were once admitted that one dying in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, might after his death be condemned for an heretike; <hi>pateret ostium,</hi> there would a gap be opened, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ecclesiasticall writer, <hi>licet in communione Catholica defunctus esset; although hee dyed in the communion of the Catholike Church,</hi> might after death be out of his writings condemned, for an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike; truly hee feareth where no feare is at all. This gap, nay, this gate and broad street of condemning the dead hath laine wide open this sixteen hundred years. Can the Cardinall, or any of his friends in all these successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ages, wherin have dyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand millions of Catholikes; can he name or finde but so much as <hi>one</hi> who hath truly dyed in the peace and communion of the Church, and yet hath beene after his death condemned by the Catholike Church for an heretike? He cannot. The Church should condemne her owne selfe, if shee condemned any with whom she had peace, and whom she embraceth in her holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which is no other but the society with God. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may dye in some errour, yea, in an errour of faith, as <hi>Papias,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7679:42"/>
Irenee, Iustine,</hi> in that of the millenaries: as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> (as is likely) and other Africane Bishops in that of <hi>Rebaptization</hi>; but either dye heretikes, or be after their death condemned by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, for heretikes, they cannot.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But there is most just cause why the Cardinall, and all his fellowes, should feare another matter, which more neerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes themselves; and feare it, even upon that Catholike posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the dead out of their writings may justly bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

So both the assertion of <hi>Vigilius</hi> which from <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> he would prove, is untrue, that none who are dead may bee condemned, and yet the saying of <hi>Dionysius</hi> is true, that such as goe to rest, or dye in the peace of the Church, ought not to bee condemned.</p>
               <p n="14">14.

                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 491</note> that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was therefore very slacke to condemne him, because hee would not condemne those, <hi>quos scisset in catholica communione de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functos,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7679:45"/>
whom he knew to have died in the catholike communion of the Church.</hi> So the cardinall tells us that <hi>Vigilius</hi> knew, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it is not onely true, but certaine, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> dyed in the catholike communion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. What thinke you doth the cardinall gaine by pleading thus for <hi>Theodorus</hi> a condemned heretike? Truly for his paines herein the holy Councell payes him soundly: for first in plaine termes it calls him a lyar, and a slanderer, yea a slanderer of the whole Church, and if this be not enough, it denounceth an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> unto him for so saying: Cursed bee hee that curseth not <hi>Theodorus</hi>; how much more cursed then is he, who acquits <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> from that curse, who makes <hi>Theodorus</hi> blessed? for blessed are all they that dye in the peace and holy communion of the Church, and that <hi>Theodorus</hi> so dyed the Cardinall for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty doth assure us; for <hi>Vigilius</hi> knew that he so dyed.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But what Church I pray you is that in the communion whereof the Cardinall assures us <hi>Theodorus</hi> to have dyed? you may bee sure it is their Romane: for in the Cardinalls idiome thats not onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Church, but its the <hi>one and onely Church.</hi> In the communion then of their Romane church, even in the communion with the Cardinall himselfe dyed <hi>Theodorus.</hi> Now its certaine, he died not in the communion of the Church, which was in the fift generall Councell, for they utterly disclaim him, accurse him, and call them lyars, and slanderers, that say hee dyed in their communion. Againe, its certaine that the Church of that fift Councell, was of the same communion with the whole Catholike and Apostolike Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themselves profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to hold the same faith, and communion with all former ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generall Councells, and Catholikes, and all succeeding catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes by approving it, professing the same faith and communion with it. Seeing then <hi>Theodorus</hi> dyed not in the communion of this Church, which is the true and truly catholike Church, and yet dyed as the Cardinall assures you in the communion of their Romane church, it doth clearly and certainly hence ensue, that their Romane church is neither the true catholike, neither hath full communion with the true catholike Church.</p>

Lastly, seeing <hi>Theodorus</hi> as the Cardinall tells us, died in the peace, and communion of their Church, and <hi>Theodorus</hi> was most certainly an heretike, condemned by the catholike Church; declared by the same Church to bee accursed, that is, separated from God; nay to be a very Devill, as the holy Councell <note n="p" place="margin">

Since this is the peace,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7679:45"/>
this the communion of their church (if <hi>Theodorus</hi> dyed, as the Cardinall assureth us he did, in the peace and communion of it) let them for ever keep to themselves, let them alone enjoy, both alive and dead, this peace, this communion, of their Church. But let dis-union, and immortall warres, be for ever betwixt us, and it; betwixt the society with God, and all communion with it.

Whence two things may be observed, the one, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> was not onely accounted, and by name condemned for an heretike, as by other catholiks, so by the Emperors also, but that this particular condemning was consonant to the decree of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Synode, this being nothing else but an explanation of that, which they in generall termes had set down, and a corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the same: The other, that seeing this Imperiall decree, hath stood ever since the inacting thereof in force and unrepea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by vertue of it; had it beene, or were it as yet, I say not rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, but duly, and justly put in execution, not any one defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> no not Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe, nor any who defends his <hi>Apostolicall constitution,</hi> (and those are all the members of the present Romane church) not one of them, shold either have beene heretofore, or be now tolerated, in any city, suburbs, towne, village, or field; but besides the ecclesiasticall, censures and anathemaes, denounced against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and catholike church, they should endure, if no sharper edge of the civill sword, yet, perpetuall banishment out of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Common-wealths, with losse and confiscation of all their goods.</p>
               <p n="16">16. After this Imperiall Law was once published, the name and credit of <hi>Theodorus</hi> (whose memory the Emperors had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and forbidden) grew into a generall contempt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, whereof the church of <hi>Mopsvestia,</hi> where hee had beene Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, gave a memorable example.

boute, all the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and among them Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as Generall to them all, undertooke the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Theodorus:</hi> and, as if there had never beene any sentence of condemnation, either in generall, or in particular denounced against him, even in his definitive, and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> constitution declareth, That <hi>Theodorus</hi> was not condemned, either by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Councels, or Fathers; and this he declareth after his solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, circumspective, and most diligent examination of their writings.</p>
               <p n="20">20. What thinke you was become of the Popes eyes at this time, that he could see none of all those condemnations of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> before mentioned? Not the general <hi>anathema</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in which <hi>Theodorus</hi> was involved: not the expresse, and particular <hi>anathema</hi> denounced against him by <hi>Rambulas,</hi> and <hi>Acatius,</hi> with the Councell of <hi>Armenia:</hi> not the condemnation of him, and his writings by Saint <hi>Proclus,</hi> by S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> by the Church of <hi>Mopsvestia,</hi> by the Edict of the religious Emperours, by the whole Catholike Church. None of all these things were done in a corner; they were all matters of publike notice, and record<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obvious to any that did not shut their eyes against the sun-shine of the truth. But, as I said before, and must often say, Nestorianisme, like <hi>Naash</hi> the Ammonite, had put out the Popes right eye, he could see nothing with that eye; all that he saw in this cause, was but a very oblique, and sinister aspect, as doth now, I hope, fully appeare, but will bee yet much more manifest, by that which in the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> wee are next to consider.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For, as if it were a small matter, not to see <hi>Theodorus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the former Councels, and Fathers, (though in a man professing so exact and accurate inspection in any cause, such grosse oversights are not veniall) the Pope ventures one step fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the credit of this condemned heretike. Hee could not finde that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was condemned by the former witnesses: Tush, that is nothing, he findes him acquitted by them all: hee findes by <hi>Cyrill,</hi> by <hi>Proclus,</hi> by the Councels of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> yea, by <hi>Iustinians</hi> owne law, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> ought not to be condemned. This was indeed a point worthy the Popes owne finding. But withall I must tell you, that you also shall finde one other thing, that Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> having once passed the bounds of truth, for defence of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> cares not now if he wade up to the eares, and drowne himselfe in untruths.</p>

blasphemies unto him, or for them to condemne him, (as the whole Church, ever since the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councell hath done) doth it not argue, nay demonstrate an hereticall, and most extreme distemper in the Popes judgment, and in his cathedrall sentence at that time.</p>
               <p n="34">34. The other point which <hi>Vigilius</hi> observeth out of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesine</hi> Councel is worse then this, for as yet he hath onely found that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was not <hi>de facto</hi> condemned by the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node; but in the next place, he will finde by that Councell, that <hi>Theodorus, de jure</hi> ought not to bee condemned. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he saith <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vigilius in const. nu.</hi> 173.</note>, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> (and so the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Synode consenting to him as President) would not have the name of <hi>Theodorus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Synodall Acts at <hi>Ephesus: propter regulam quae de mortuis in sacerdotio servanda est, for the rule which is to bee kept in such Bishops as are dead.</hi> And that rule he explaines in the words following, to be this, that the dead should not bee condemned, nor should the living bend their bow against ashes, or insult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the dead, whereby <hi>Vigilius</hi> even by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> decree, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgeth both <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and the whole <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councell consenting therein with him, to have beleeved and held a condemned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as an Ecclesiasticall rule, or rule of their faith and actions; That one who is dead may not bee condemned: and so by the Popes <hi>Constitution</hi> both <hi>Cyrill</hi> and the holy <hi>Ephesine</hi> Synode were heretikes. Such worthy points doe the Popes finde when they use their art, and industry, to review ancient writings, with a reference to their owne determinations, and so easie was it for <hi>Vigilius</hi> to finde the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councell, first injurious to the dead, and then hereticall in a doctrine or rule concerning the dead.</p>
               <p n="35">35. The very like he found also in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that <hi>Theodorus</hi> ought not to be condemned. His reason is this; <hi>Iohn</hi>

And now you have seene all that <hi>Vigilius</hi> bringeth for defence of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> all that hee found after his most diligent search of the Fathers, Councels, and ancient writings; whereby I doubt not but it is evident unto all, that Nestorianisme had either quite blinded the Pope, or at least induced him to play (which he hath done very skilfully) one of the <hi>Lamia</hi> in this cause; when ought that tended to the truth, came in his way, and offered it selfe unto him, he then lockt up his eyes, and kept them fast in a basket; but when, or where ought that tended to nestorianisme, and the defence of a condemned heretike, might in a likelihood be found; then he put his eyes in his head, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as quicksighted, as the Serpent of <hi>Epidaurus.</hi> The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> condemning <hi>Theodorus</hi> for an heretike, worse than either Iew, or Pagan, the Councels of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> anathematizing him; the Imperiall lawes of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> commanding all memory of him to bee abolished, &amp; his heretical books to be burned; the expunging his name out of the Ecclesiasticall tables, even in that Church, where hee had beene Bishop; and a number the like; none of all these could <hi>Vigilius,</hi> in his most diligent inquisition, finde or see: why, the <hi>Lamia</hi> had lockt up his eyes against all these publike, and known evidences, and records. But when the base Counterfeits, forged in the name of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and <hi>Proclus</hi>; when the depraving, or calumniating the Councels of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> as being maintainers of a condemned heresie: when these, or the like might be found, oh the Pope saw these at the first; his eyes were now as cleare, as the sight of <hi>Linceus,</hi> he could spie these through a Milstone; nay, which is more, hee could see them, though there were no such matters at all to bee seene: And truly, if you well consider, there was good reason why hee should see the one, and not the other. For the Pope saw the Epistle of <hi>Ibas</hi> to bee orthodoxall, and to be approved by the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; he saw in that Epistle <hi>Theodorus</hi> to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <note n="a" place="margin">

That <hi>Theodorus</hi> was dead, is <hi>personall</hi>; but that none after death may bee condemned for an heretike, is <hi>doctrinall</hi>; yea, an heresie in the doctrine of faith.

So many wayes is the Popes sentence, in this <hi>first Chapter,</hi> erronious in faith; of which <hi>Baronius</hi> most vainely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, that it is no cause of faith, no such cause as doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the faith.</p>

And yet when <hi>Vigilius</hi> saw good, hee who durst not doe this, durst doe a greater matter, he durst doe that which not any of all the former, nay which they all put together, never durst doe. <hi>Vigilius</hi> durst defend both an heresie, and a condemned and anathematized heretike, he durst commend forged, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall writings, under the name of holy Fathers, hee durst ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that Epistle, wherein an heretike is called, and honoured for a Saint; he durst, contrary to the Imperiall and godly Edict of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> contrary to the judgements of the holy generall Councells, defend <hi>Theodorus,</hi> honor his memorie, yea honor him as a teacher of truth while he lived, as a Saint being dead; These things none of all the former ever durst doe: in these <hi>Vigilius</hi> is more bold and audacious then they are all.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Whence thinke you proceeded this contrariety of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Vigilius,</hi> that made him sometimes more bold then a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and other times more timerous then an Hare? Truely even from hence: As <hi>Vigilius</hi> had no eyes to see ought, but what favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Nestorianisme, so hee had not the heart to doe ought which did not uphold Nestorianisme. If a Catholike truth met him, or the sweet influence thereof hapned to breath upon him, <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> could not endure it, the Popes heart fainted at the smell thereof: but when the Nestorian heresie blew upon him, when being full with <hi>Nestorius</hi> he might say, <hi>agitante calescimus illo,</hi> not <hi>Ajax,</hi> not <hi>Poliphemus</hi> so bold nor full of courage as Pope <hi>Vigilius.</hi> As the Scarobee or beetle <note n="g" place="margin">

So truly was it fulfilled in him, which the Prophet saith <note n="h" place="margin">

               <p n="45">45. The other branch of the Popes conclusion is, <hi>Sed</hi>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:7679:57"/>46. And as if all this were not sufficient, the Pope addes one other clause more execrable, then all the former; for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited those threescore hereticall assertions, which as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, were all collected out of the true, and indubitate writings of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> he adjoynes, <note n="l" place="margin">

               <head>CHAP. IX. That <hi>Vigilius</hi> besides divers personall, held a doctrinall errour in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith, in his defence of the <hi>second Chapter,</hi> which concernes the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> against <hi>Cyrill.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was some shadow of reason to thinke, that the former Chapter was a personall matter; seeing that was indeed moved concerning the person of <hi>Theodorus.</hi> But in the two other, there is no pretence, or colour for <hi>Baronius</hi> to say, that in them the question, or cause was personall, and not wholy doctrinall; who in all the fift Councell once doubted of the persons of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> or <hi>Ibas,</hi> whether they were Catholikes, after their anathematizing of <hi>Nestorius</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>? The onely question about them was, whether the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> against <hi>Cyrill</hi> were to bee condemned, which the Pope denyeth, and the holy Councell affirmeth, and whether the Epistle of <hi>Ibas</hi> was Orthodoxall, or he by it known to be Orthodoxal, which the Pope affirmeth, and the holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell denyeth. The question about them, no way concerned their persons, but onely their writings. And it might be a wonder that <hi>Baronius</hi> should have the face to say, that the cause in these <hi>two Chapters</hi> was onely personall, if it were not daily seene by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that <hi>necessitas cogit ad turpia,</hi> mere necessity enforced the Cardinall to use any though never so untrue, never so unlikely excuses for <hi>Vigilius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are I confesse divers personall matters, and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of facts, which concernes both these Chapters: and although they were not the controversies moved, and debated, betwixt the defenders, and the oppugners of those Chapters; yet is it needfull to say somewhat of them also; partly for more illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cause of faith, &amp; specially that we may see how foully <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> have erred, not onely in doctrinall causes, which are more obscure, but even in those personall matters, which had beene easie, and obvious, if they had not shut their eyes against the truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning the <hi>second Chapter,</hi> the Popes decree herein relyeth, and is grounded, on three personall points, or matters of fact. The first is, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> would perswade, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> was not the author of those writings against <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and against his twelve Chapters or Anathematizmes <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </note> this as one reason, why the Councell of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne those writings, because they having those matters which were done but of late before their eyes, <hi>Theodore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nihil tale fecisse probaverunt, did judge that Theodoret had written no such thing.</hi> Thus <hi>Vigilius</hi> pretending those writings against <hi>Cyrill</hi> not to be <hi>Theodorets,</hi> and that the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so thought the same: whence he would inferre, (and justly upon this supposall) that <hi>Theodorets</hi> name ought not to bee blemished by those writings which were none of his.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

But in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, he proves not himselfe orthodoxal, by that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he saith well, but unconstant and contrary to himselfe in overthrowing that which he saith well, for if <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings against <hi>Cyrill</hi> may not be condemned, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> decreth; then may not the doctrines of <hi>Nestorius</hi> defended therein be condemned as <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> would seeme to doe. <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings and Nestoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme are inseparable companions, either both must stand, or both fall together. Its as impossible, and repugnant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the one, and deny that the other may be condemned, as to condemne Euticheanisme, and yet defend the Ephesine latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinie and decree thereof, or condemne Arianisme, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the <hi>Arimine</hi> Councel. Its the honor of truth, that it never is nor can be dissonant to any other truth: but heresie not onely may, but almost ever doth fight, not only against truth, but against it selfe, &amp; overthroweth with one hand, or positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what it builds up by another, as in this of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is now apparent.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Now although this clearly convinceth the Popes decree to be hereticall, seeing it maintaineth two contradictory positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a cause of faith, &amp; the one is without all doubt an heresie; yet is it worthy the examining, whether of these contradictories must passe for the Popes judgment &amp; <hi>cathedrall</hi> resolution in this cause. Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> will certainly direct vs in this doubt: for he tells us (which of it selfe also is evident) that the Popes purpose <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro ipsorum de sensione laborat Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius. Bar. an.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 172.</note> &amp; intent in setting forth this <hi>Constitution,</hi> was to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the 3 <hi>Chapters: adversus Imperatoris decretum, &amp; sententiam Synodi, against the Emperors Edict, and the sentence of the fift Synode.</hi> As the Emperour then and the Synode condemned,<note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. nu.</hi> 222.</note> so was it the Popes maine purpose to defend the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> against <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which was the <hi>second Chapter.</hi> This is &amp; must stand for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; cathedrall resolution of the Pope in this matter: what he speaks repugnant to this is casuall, &amp; <hi>praeter,</hi> nay <hi>contra intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, its against his mind &amp; purpose</hi>; its to be thought onely by in-incogitancy to have slipt from his pen. So his condemning of the Nestorian doctrine is but in shew, its onely verball, his defining that <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings which maintaine Nestorianisme may not be condemned, is the true purpose and intent of his mind, its cordial &amp; real. By his verball condemning of Nestorianisme, he shuts it out in words, or as you may say at the foregate of his pallace, By his defining that <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, he puls in Nestorianisme with all his might, &amp; sets wide open a postren gate unto it: by condemning Nestorianisme in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7679:62"/>
shew of words, he seemes to be orthodoxall, by defending Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storianisme indeed and in truth, he demonstrates himselfe to be hereticall. Or because <hi>Vigilius</hi> was so very wise a Pope as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after out of <hi>Baronius</hi> you shall heare, it seemes he meant to shew one part of his wisedome, and policie, in this matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while the heresie of <hi>Nestorius</hi> comes in his owne naturall habit, or in the liverie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> away with it, the Popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse will not admit it, hee cannot abide it: but when it comes countenanced, and graced, with the name of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and in his liverie, the Pope embraceth it in both his armes, and by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authoritie commandeth all men, to give most friendly welcome and entertainement unto it.</p>
               <p n="22">22 You have now the judgement, and cathedrall resolution of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> touching this <hi>second Chapter,</hi> that the hereticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> against <hi>Cyril,</hi> and the Catholike faith may not bee condemned. Take a view also of those two reasons, by which hee labours to strengthen, and perswade the same. The former is drawne from the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> It is, saith <hi>Vigilius,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="23">23 Could he not content himselfe, to be hereticall alone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he disgraced the holy Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> as guilty of the same heresie, as if they also had judged that none of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi> writings, not those written against the faith, ought to bee condemned? They to judge this? or is it contrary, and that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitabiliter,</hi> to condemne those writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> or any writings under his name? Far was it from the thought, much more from the grave judgement of so holy a Councell.

If to condemne those writings be repugnant to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> then is the fift Councell not a follower but a confuter and contradicter of the judgement at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Nor onely the fift Councell, but the whole catholike Church ever since the time of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> they all doe reject, and condemne the judgement of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> seeing they all by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the fift Synod, and decree thereof, do anathematize
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7679:63"/>
those writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which to doe is, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> teacheth, <hi>indubitanter contrarium, most certainely contrary to the judgement at Chalcedon.</hi> If the whole catholike Church bee not hereticall (which to thinke is impietie) by contradicting and condemning the judgement of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> then undoubtedly is <hi>Vigilius</hi> hereticall in teaching and decreeing, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> or any under his name, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the judgement of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. The other reason of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> is, because it were a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, injury and slander, against <hi>Theodoret,</hi> to condemne his writings. This the Pope <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vigil. Const. nu.</hi> 282.</note> expresseth in the very words of his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in this manner; <hi>The truth of these things,</hi> (those are the three personall points before handled) <hi>being weighed, we ordaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, nihil in injuriam, at que obtrectationem probatissimi viri, hoc est Theodoreti sub taxatione nominis ejus, à quoquam fieri vel proferri, that nothing shall be done or spoken by any, to the injury and sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of the most approved Bishop Theodoret by taxing of his name:</hi> and it must needs be taxed, if his writings or bookes be condemned.</p>
               <p n="25">25. See here the compassionate and tender heart of <hi>Vigilius.</hi> Not onely <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and the fift generall Councell, but <hi>Pelagius, Gregory,</hi> and other succeeding Popes, and Councels, even the whole Catholike Church ever since the time of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> they all, by approving the decree of the fift Synod, doe not onely taxe the name of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> but accurse, &amp; anathematize the writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and that even under his name: Now, such a loving and tender affection doth the Pope carry towards the hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that rather than they may be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or his name taxed by the condemning of them; <hi>Iustinian, Pelagius, Gregory,</hi> and other his successors, the fift, the sixt, and other generall Councels, even the whole Catholike Church, they all must be, and are <hi>de facto,</hi> here declared, and by the Popes <hi>cathedrall</hi> sentence decreed, and defined, not onely to bee hereticall, (as the former reason imported) but injurious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, backbiters, &amp; slanderers, they all must be condemned, and for ever disgraced, rather then <hi>Theodorets</hi> name must bee taxed, or his hereticall writings condemned, or disgraced.</p>
               <p n="26">26. But say indeed: Is it an injurie, a slander, a disgrace to one, that his errors should either by himselfe, or by the Church be condemned? How injurious was that holy Bishop Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> to himselfe in writing so many retractations, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of what he saw amisse? And what himselfe did, hee would not onely willingly, but gladly have permitted the holy Church to have done. Nor may we think this mind to have been onely in <hi>Austen,</hi> Modestie and humilitie, are the individuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of true knowledge and learning: and the more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any man is, the more judicious is he in espying, the more ingenuous in acknowledging, the more lowly and humble, in condemning his owne errors.

                  <hi>his image in a Chariot, and with great pompe, and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hymnes, brought it in triumphant manner into the City of Cyrus,</hi> where <hi>Sergius</hi> a Nestorian, and Bishop of that place, mentioned in a Collect <hi>Theodorus</hi> of Mopsvestia, <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> as three of their principall Nestorian Saints: was it not now high time to wipe away that blemish from the name of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and to condemne those writings of his which gave occasion to the Nestorians to make such boasts?</p>
               <p n="31">31. I appeale now unto any man, whether their condemning of <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings, did not much more tend to the honour, then, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> fancieth, to the slander, and disgrace of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. As it is a blemish to a man to retaine a filthy spot in his garment, but the taking of it away doth grace, and make him more comely; even so the name of <hi>Theodoret</hi> was stained by those writings; they emboldened the Nestorians to put him in their cursed Calender; but by the condemning of those writings was the staine and blemish wiped away from his person, his name, and honour was vindicated from the Nestorians, and brought, as it well deserved, to the holy Church of GOD; nothing of <hi>Theodoret</hi> left for heretikes to vaunt of, but the onely staines of <hi>Theodoret</hi>; nothing but those hereticall writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and accursed, both by <hi>Theodoret</hi> himselfe, and by the whole Church of God.</p>
               <p n="32">32. No, no; it is Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> (and such as applaud his decree for infallible) that disgraceth, and most ignominiously useth the name, person, and memory of <hi>Theodoret</hi>: By his decree those he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which, by the Churches sentence of condemnation are quite dulled, receive full strength, and vigour for the Nestorians against Catholikes: By him the Nestorians
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7679:65"/>
have an eternall charter, and irrevocable decree, that <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings against <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and with them the heresie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> ought not to be taxed, nor condemned. His <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is a triumphant chariot for them to set the Image of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret,</hi> in their Temples, and with Anthemes and Collects to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize, yea adore him in their Masses, among their hereticall Saints. But for the Church of God, I constantly affirme they could not possibly have more honoured <hi>Theodoret,</hi> than by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the hay and stubble of his writings, the condemning of which the Pope decreeth to bee an injury and slander unto him.</p>
               <p n="33">33. May wee now in the last place consider a little what might be the intendment of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in pleading, and decreeing this for <hi>Theodorets</hi> writings? I doubt not but the love he bare to Nestorianisme might make him zealous for those writings, which are the bulwarks of the Nestorians: but <hi>non sunt in eo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> Popes are men of profound thoughts, and very long rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; they have deepe, and mysticall projects in their decrees. <hi>Vigilius</hi> had, and it may be principally, an eye to this his owne, and all their <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Constitutions like unto it: If the hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> may not be condemned, because him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was a Catholike, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> this decree of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so hereticall, may not bee condemned, because the Pope is the head of all Catholikes. If it bee an injury, and a slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> to taxe him, or his name, by condemning his writings; it must much more be an injury, and slander, nay, that is nothing, even a blasphemy and sinne irremissible to taxe the Popes Holinesse, by condemning his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> decree: If you presume to condemne, nay, but taxe them, or their names, though their decrees shall bee as apparently hereticall, as are those writings of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> you are condemned for ever as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, as contumelious, as slandering persons. And let this suffice for the errours both personall, and doctrinall, of <hi>Vigilius</hi> touching this <hi>second Chapter.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The second untruth is like this <hi>Vigilius</hi> having cited the interloquutions of <hi>Pascasinus,</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> wherein they say that <hi>Ibas</hi> by his <hi>Epistle</hi> is declared to bee a Catholike, <note n="d" place="margin">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7679:66"/>
and that most manifestly unto those interloquutions.</hi> So <hi>Vigilius.</hi> It had beene enough, and too much to have said, that the Councell had assented, or had but seemed to assent: but <hi>Vigilius</hi> in saying that all the rest did most manifestly assent to those interloquuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, uttered a papall and supreme untruth, whereof no coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretence can be made, witnesse the fift general Councell, and the whole Catholike Church, which hath approved it: They expresly <note n="e" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="11">11. O, but the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, and the publike acts thereof, they witnesse the same which the Cardinall affirmeth, that this is not the Epistle of <hi>Ibas.</hi> They doe so indeed: But as it is an untruth in the Cardinalls mouth: so it is also in those his Nicene Fathers from whom hee tooke it, unlesse perhaps those men of <hi>Nice,</hi> knew better whose Epistle it was, then did the 600 holy Bishops of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> before whom <hi>Ibas</hi> stood, or better then <hi>Ibas</hi> himselfe who confessed it to bee his owne Epistle. The Cardinall may not be offended that we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from his Nicene Councell, which dissenteth from the holy Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> from <hi>Ibas</hi> his owne confession, yea from whom the Cardinall dissenteth as much as we in this point. And I cannot see, what depth of wisedome it was in his Cardinalship to alleage them for witnesses, whose testimony, himselfe in this very point for which he produceth them, doth avouch to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. But let him please himselfe in those Nice Fathers, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie not such a Councell, nor such Fathers, nor such publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords unto them.

And whosoever shal be pleased to examine and rip up the Acts of that Councell, I will give him this one assured comfort, that besides their superstitious &amp; heretical doctrins therin main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he shall finde them full stuft with many grosse and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble untruths, of matters <hi>de facto,</hi> on which they build their doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

heresie. Those sleights are principally two. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is gathered out of the latter part of the <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Ibas,</hi> where mention is made of the <hi>union</hi> betwixt <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> which although I touched before <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. In the time of the Ephesine Councell, there was, as all know, an exceeding breach betwixt <hi>Cyrill,</hi> with other Catholike Bishops, who condemned <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with divers other Eastern Bishops, who tooke part with <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> against the holy Councell. And the division was so great, that at the selfe-same time, in one, &amp; the selfe-same citie of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, they held two severall Councels, and set up <hi>altare contra alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> Councell against Councell, Patriarcke against Patriarcke, Bishops against Bishops, and Synodall sentence against Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall sentence. But betwixt those two Councels, there was as much difference, as is betwixt light and darkenesse, betwixt truth and heresie, betwixt the Church of God, and the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan. The one consisted of holy orthodoxall and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bishops whose President was <hi>Cyrill</hi>: the other of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, <note n="b" place="margin">

This have they gained as a just recompence for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but the end onely of that <hi>Epistle,</hi> and much more for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it by pretence of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> though they should condemne all the rest of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But if the matter be well considered, it will appeare that <hi>Vigilius</hi> by this one clause of the <hi>union</hi> makes good, not only the latter part, (as <hi>Baronius</hi> pretendeth) but even the whole Epistle of <hi>Ibas</hi>; for had he intended to approve no more than onely the latter part of that Epistle, his reason had beene this; The Fathers at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> approved that part of the Epistle, wherein the un<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> mentioned; therefore they approve the latter part of the Epistle, which is a meere nugation, proving <hi>idem per idem</hi>; for seeing the <hi>union</hi> is onely mentioned in the latter part, it is all one as if he had said, They approved the latter part, therefore they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7679:71"/>
approved the latter part; and mee thinkes it sounds not well, to heare such nugatory, and frivolous reasons to proceed out so the <hi>infallible Chaire</hi>: Nor doth indeed <hi>Vigilius</hi> so conclude; but from that <hi>union</hi> and concord which the latter part of the Epistle testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>Ibas</hi> to have approved, he inferres, that <hi>Ibas</hi> when hee writ this was a Catholike, and writ it as a Catholike, and so the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or Epistle it selfe to be Catholike; for thus stands his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; The <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p n="10">10. Which will be more plaine if we observe one other point out of <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> which may not well be omitted; for whereas all contained in any part of the Epistle respects things done, either before, or at, or after the <hi>union,</hi> in none of these, if ye will beleeve them, is this writing hereticall, or against the faith; for what was done before the <hi>union,</hi> though therein much be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against <hi>Cyrill,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councell, and <hi>Cyrill</hi> called an heretike, yet is all that, saith <note n="d" place="margin">

                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 211.</note>, that after the <hi>union</hi> it could not bee proved, <hi>aliquod verbum indecens adversus Cyrillum protulisse; that Ibas spake any unseemely word against Cyrill.</hi> Hereupon now it followeth, that the whole Epistle is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, written by <hi>Ibas</hi> when he was a catholike, written with a catholike minde and affection; by him, who both at, and after the <hi>union</hi> would not write against the faith which himselfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and what is spoken of matters before the <hi>union,</hi> that is all historically narrated, not by assent approved.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Oh how doe these men even labour and study to be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and to tye more fast the knots of those Anathemaes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against them by the holy Councell, which nothing but renouncing their hereticall defences of this Epistle can ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve! what will they doubt or feare to say, who would justifie that whole Epistle, as affirming nothing repugnant to the faith, (for a narration is no assertion of that which is related) of which the holy Councell, and catholike Church hath pronounced, that it is wholly hereticall; and every part, head and taile, beginning and ending, an absolute, and positive deniall of the faith? what untruth will they not avouch, who deny <hi>Ibas</hi> after the <hi>union</hi> to have injured <hi>Cyrill,</hi> whereas the holy generall Councell witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and that truly, as you shall straight see, that even in this <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which <hi>Ibas</hi> mentioneth, he wrongeth <hi>Cyrill</hi> and all catholikes more, than in any part of his Epist. yea, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="12">12. The former is, (at the consideration whereof I could not refraine from laughter) how curious, and even superstitious the Cardinall is in calculating the nativity of this impious Epistle, as if he had performed the office of <hi>Iuno Lucina</hi> unto it, and knew the very moment of time when this faire babe was first brought to light: It was written, saith hee, <hi>eodem momento pacis inita, in that very moment when the union was made betwixt Iohn and Cyrill.</hi> At that very moment? Sure the Cardinals <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> or the constellations deceived him.

and if there were none else, by the last onely, that <hi>Ibas</hi> writ this, being Bishop of <hi>Edessa,</hi> it is cleere, that some good while, in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood three or foure yeares, were past after the <hi>union,</hi> before <hi>Ibas</hi> writ this Epistle, of which <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us so precisely, that it was writ, <hi>eo momento, at the very moment,</hi> and instant when the peace was concluded.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The other point, to be observed is, what manner of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> have here set forth unto us. <hi>Ibas</hi> when he writ this Epistle, is with them a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, a Catholike Writer, a Catholike Bishop; in him you shall see the lively portrature of one of their Catholikes. Hee even in this Epistle, written after the <hi>Vnion</hi> (when he was as they teach <note n="y" place="margin">

Of such Catholikes their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church hath great store; nay, seeing none is now of their Church, who approves not all the Cathedrall decrees of their Popes, and therefore this of <hi>Vigilius</hi> among the rest, it hence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth, that none is now a Romane Catholike, that is, a member of their present Romane Church, who approves not <hi>Ibas,</hi> such as he was when he writ this Epistle, for a Catholike, that is, who approves not the most blasphemous heretikes, and oppugners of the whole faith, to be Catholikes, and who condemnes not the <hi>Cyrillians,</hi> that is, all that maintaine the Catholike faith, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But still as yet the doubt concerning the <hi>Vnion</hi> remaineth: <hi>Ibas,</hi> say they, when he writ this Epistle embraced the <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and none can embrace that <hi>union</hi> but hee shewes himselfe thereby to bee a Catholike.

Had <hi>Ibas</hi> approved that <hi>union</hi> or consented unto it; <hi>Ibas</hi> had not beene <hi>Ibas,</hi> he had never written that impious Epistle, which in every part, &amp; most of all in the end, where hee speakes of the <hi>union,</hi> is repugnant to that holy <hi>union.</hi> It is the <hi>union</hi> in Nestorianisme, the union in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning

and overthrowing the whole Catholike faith, which <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> when he writ this Epistle embraced, and which in his Epistle he commendeth, which that it may appeare to all, wee are now to unfold the mystery of that <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> under colour whereof <hi>Ibas</hi> first, then <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and lastly <hi>Baronius</hi> with all who hold the Popes judgement to bee <hi>infallible,</hi> doe very cunningly convey their hereticall doctrines, and contradict the Catholike faith.</p>

First, here is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed their maine heresie, that Christ is not God, as the house is not the man who dwelleth in the house. Secondly, is set downe a notorious slander against <hi>Cyrill</hi> and the Catholikes, that they at the union made with <hi>Iohn,</hi> did anathematize all who held one naturall subsistence, or one person to be in Christ, that is, in effect did accurse all Catholikes, and the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Faith. Thirdly, it is a notable untruth, that <hi>Cyril</hi> made the union with <hi>Iohn</hi> upon this condition, that hee should anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize all who hold Christ to be one person, the condition was quite contrarie, to wit, that <hi>Iohn,</hi> and they on his part, should anathematize all who denied Christ to be one, or who affirmed him to be two persons. Fourthly, it is a slander, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> writ an Epistle to that effect, as if he assented to that condition men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Ibas.</hi> The Epistle is testified by <hi>Cyrill</hi> himselfe not to bee his, but a counterfaite writing, forged by the Nestorians. Fiftly, it is a Calumnie, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> and the rest who condemned <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> were seditious persons: it is as much as to say, that the holy Ephesine Councell, was a conspiracie and seditious conventicle. Sixtly, it is an unexcusable slander and untruth, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> and they who held with him, that is, the Catholikes, that they were confounded, and repented of their former doctrines, or writ contrarie unto them. These, besides
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7679:75"/>
divers the like, are the flowers wherewith the latter part of that <hi>Epistle</hi> is deckt, even that part which Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> doe so magnifie, the one defining, the other defending, that by it <hi>Ibas</hi> ought to be judged a Catholike, and his <hi>Epistle</hi> received as Catholike: This part above all the rest, is so stuffed with heresies and slanders, that I doe constantly affirme, that none of all their Romane Alcumists can extract or distill one dramme of Catholike doctrine, or any goodnesse out of it. Only Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> being, as I have often said, blinded with Nestoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, and Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> being infatuated with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Pontificall <hi>infallible</hi> Chaire, they two by the new found art of Transubstantiating, wherein that sect excelleth <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> and all the inchanters in the world, they by one spell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They forsooth will not in plaine tearmes say that Nestorianisme is the Catholike faith, that Christ is not God, that the Sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> is not the Sonne of God, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> is an hereticke, and the holy Ephesine Councell hereticall: Fie, these are too <hi>Beoticall,</hi> and blunt, they could never have gotten any one to tast of that cup of Nestorianisme, had they dealt so plainely, or simply ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> are Schooles of better manners, and of more civilitie and subtiltie: you must learne there to speake heresie in the <hi>Atticke Dialect,</hi> in smooth, plausible, sweet and sugred tearmes; you must say the <hi>union</hi> which <hi>Ibas</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> embraceth is the Catholike union, that <hi>Ibas</hi> by embracing that union was a Catholike, and ought to bee judged a Catholike; that whosoever embraceth not this union, which the Pope hath defined to be the Catholike communion, cannot be a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: or if you speake more briefly and <hi>Laconically,</hi> you may say, the Popes decrees and <hi>Cathedrall</hi> judgements in causes of faith are infallible.

He was most inflexible
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7679:79"/>
and constant in maintaining the true faith; more inexorable than <hi>Aeacus,</hi> or rather, as <hi>Moses</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.26.</note> would not consent to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> no, not in the least hoofe, so would not <hi>Cyrill</hi> yeeld one heire-bredth unto them, but brought them to subscribe wholly, and in every point, to that which he desired.</p>
               <p n="35">35. The second is, the occasion which the Nestorians tooke for their pretended calumnie: They knew that <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Bishops had written to <hi>Cyrill,</hi> willing him to condemne his owne Chapters; yea, that they had writ so resolutely, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>Cyrill</hi> did so, they would not consent unto any peace, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus much was true, as by the letter of <hi>Acatius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> to <hi>Cyrill</hi> is evident: Now they saw that <hi>Cyrill</hi> afterwards, and in that very yeare consented with <hi>Iohn,</hi> and made union with him, whereupon they boasted that <hi>Cyrill</hi> did it upon the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required by <hi>Iohn</hi> at the first, which was the condemning of his former doctrine; wilfully and maliciously concealing both how <hi>Cyrill</hi> utterly denyed to yeeld unto them, or to that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required by them; and how at the length <hi>Iohn,</hi> and so many of them as were received into communion, consented whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him, and subscribed to the Catholike faith.

               <p n="37">37. In which narration of the Cardinall, besides many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths wherewith it is stuffed, there are two things, above all the rest, to be observed. The former is, how wise and politike the Cardinall doth make <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the whole Synod of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to be in this matter of the union: first, they condemne the heresies of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> approve the Ephesine Councell, and by so doing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the twelve Chapters of <hi>Cyrill</hi>; they doe this in a Synod, and publish their Synodall decree at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and other places, to shew and testifie themselves to bee truly ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall; and when all this is done, they labour earnestly, with <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> to make him condemne his owne twelve Chapters, which is in effect to maintaine Nestorianisme; to condemne the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine Councell, (wherein his Chapters were approved) yea, to condemne their owne Synodall decree, by which themselves, at <hi>Antioch,</hi> had condemned <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and approved the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Cyrill.</hi> Againe, he makes <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his Synod to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with <hi>Sixtus,</hi> with <hi>Maximianus,</hi> with all other Catholikes save <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and them of his Patriarchship; with all the former they will communicate, though they all approved the twelve Chapters of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> with <hi>Cyril</hi> they will not communicate, unlesse he will condemne the same twelve Chapters. If they thought the twelve Chapters to be hereticall, why hold they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Sixtus, Maximianus,</hi> and others who approved them? nay, why did themselves approve them? If they thought them orthodoxall, why would they (being themselves orthodoxall) perswade, yea, enforce and wring out of <hi>Cyrill</hi> a condemnation of the orthodoxall faith? Besides, what a worthy peece of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was this, which the Cardinall doth fasten upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all the rest? he makes them to send <hi>Paulus,</hi> a reverend Bishop, with a letter purposely to be delivered to <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which testified their Synodall, and willing consent in approving the twelve Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that is, of the Catholike faith, and yet command <hi>Paulus</hi> to urge and wring from <hi>Cyrill,</hi> if he could, a condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those twelve Chapters, that is, of the whole Catholike faith? What deepe dissemblers and hypocrites doth hee make <hi>Iohn, Paul,</hi> and the rest of those orthodoxall Bishops? Lastly, of what faith or religion, doe you thinke, must <hi>Iohn, Paul,</hi> and the rest be, by the Cardinals narration. By their Synodall sentence, and holy confession therein; they appove the twelve Chapters
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7679:80"/>
of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and so are perfect Catholikes; againe, by their urging of <hi>Cyrill</hi> to condemne his twelve Chapters, they are perfect Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, for the condemning of them, is the defending of all the Nestorian heresies; so, by the Cardinals divinity, they are at the selfe same time, both perfect Nestorians, and perfect Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes; which can no way be effected, but by admitting the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals old position, which he learned of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> that perfect Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storianisme is the perfect Catholike faith.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Into such labyrinths doth the Cardinals foule misrepor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this matter leade, and even draw a man; whereas the truth, as, by that which formerly hath beene declared, is evident, that <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the rest of the Synod, when they vrged <hi>Cyrill</hi> to condemne his Chapters, had not made that Synodall decree for condemning of <hi>Nestorius</hi>; &amp; when they had once made that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, they never, either by word or writing, urged <hi>Cyrill</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne those Chapters: Before they made that decree, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Nestorius,</hi> they were hereticall, and held communion neither with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> nor <hi>Sixtus,</hi> nor any other Catholikes: After they had made that decree, and condemned <hi>Nestorius</hi> with his heresies, they were orthodoxall, &amp; communicated no lesse with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with <hi>Sixtus,</hi> or any other Catholike; nay, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated first of all with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> &amp; then with all other Catholikes.</p>
               <p n="39">39. The other point to bee observed out of the Cardinalls words, is, that by his narration <hi>Cyrill</hi> did indeed, as <hi>Ibas</hi> and the Nestorians slandered him, renounce &amp; reject the Catholike faith, for the Cardinall makes <hi>Paulus</hi> of <hi>Emisa</hi> but to goe once to <hi>Alexandria</hi> about the union, or if any can finde in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall a second journey thither, yet by his narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Synodall Epistle of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the rest, wherein they condemne <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and set downe an orthodoxall profession, that Epistle was sent by <hi>Paulus</hi> at the first time, for he had withall in charge to urge <hi>Cyrill</hi> to condemne his twelve Chapters, which at his last going had beene absurd and incongruous. So then the Epistle which <hi>Paulus,</hi> at his first going to <hi>Cyrill</hi> brought with him, was the orthodoxall Epistle of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Synod. Now it is certaine by the expresse words of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that the letter which <hi>Iohn</hi> and the rest, sent by <hi>Paulus</hi> at his first going, was rejected by <hi>Cyrill,</hi> for he saith of that Epistle, <hi>hujusmodi epistolas non accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavi, I did not accept this Epistle sent by</hi> Paul: and the Cardinall <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 432. <hi>nu.</hi> 66.</note> citing those words of <hi>Cyrill verbatim,</hi> and making some prettie collection out of them, could not be ignorant hereof. Seing then by the Cardinalls narration, the Epistle which <hi>Paulus</hi> brought at his first comming was orthodoxall, and seeing it is certaine that <hi>Cyrall</hi> rejected that Epistle, which <hi>Paulus</hi> at his first comming brought from <hi>Iohn,</hi> it inevitably followeth, upon the Cardinalls narration, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> indeed rejected an ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall and Catholike profession, containing the condemnation of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and his heresies, and therefore that <hi>Cyrill</hi> renounced
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7679:81"/>
his former Catholike doctrine, &amp; consented to Nestorianisme, which is the same calumnie wherewith <hi>Ibas</hi> in his impious <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> slandereth <hi>Cyrill.</hi> And although <hi>Baronius</hi> doe in words deny this, as I know hee doth, yet considering the deepe projects which the Cardinall hath, it may bee feared, that he meant by this meanes, cunningly, and closely, to lay a foundation to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that union, in which <hi>Ibas</hi> in his Epistle rejoyceth, and which <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the Cardinall himselfe approve for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or if the Cardinall intended not this, yet I am sure that hee hath then unwittingly devised, such a notable ground, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that slander, which <hi>Ibas</hi> imputeth to <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that at the time of the union he rejected his former doctrines, as that neither <hi>Ibas</hi> himselfe, nor any of the old Nestorians could possibly have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a more faire and colourable pretence for the same.</p>
               <p n="40">40. My conclusion now of this their former reason, for defence of the impious <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Ibas</hi>; drawne from the <hi>union</hi> mentioned therein, is this: Seeing that <hi>union</hi> mentioned and approved by <hi>Ibas</hi> in the later part of his <hi>Epistle,</hi> is no other but the <hi>union</hi> in Nestorianisme, unto which hee malitiously slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth <hi>Cyrill</hi> to have consented: and seeing Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> not onely approve as Catholike, the union there mentioned by <hi>Ibas,</hi> but prove by it and consenting to it, both <hi>Ibas</hi> himselfe to bee a Catholike, and his <hi>Epistle,</hi> in that part at least, to be orthodoxall, it hence cleerely ensueth, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence defineth, and <hi>Baronius</hi> by name (as also all who maintaine the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> sentence in causes of faith to bee <hi>infallible</hi>) <hi>doe all defend Nestorianisme to be the Catholike union, and so Nestorianisme to bee the Catholike faith:</hi> which whosoever affirmes, are by the judgement not onely of the fift, but the fourth and third generall Councells, <hi>convicted, condemned,</hi> and <hi>anathematized heretickes.</hi>

                  </note> those who deny two natures in Christ, sure none can thinke but this was a fit text for <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> by it to commend this impious <hi>Epistle</hi> as ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall &amp; Catholike, wherein so Catholike a confession seemeth to bee made. But let us see how the Pope and the Cardinall descant on these words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Baronius</hi> saith not much, but yet hee speakes plainely of this matter; The fathers at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> saith he <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 448. <hi>nu.</hi> 75.</note>, out of this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> of <hi>Ibas,</hi> gathered <hi>Ibas</hi> then (when he writ it) to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, <hi>ut pote quod ex eadem epistola demonstratur ipse, because by this very Epistle</hi> Ibas <hi>was demonstrated,</hi> both to have held com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>Cyrill, execratusque esse unam naturam in Christo confitentes, confessus vero esse, naturas duas unam</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <hi>[personam] effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum,</hi> and also he was demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by this Epistle, <hi>to have accursed those who confesse one onely nature in Christ, and to have confessed the two natures, to make one person, and Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> So <hi>Baronius:</hi> teaching not only that profession which <hi>Ibas</hi> makes in his Epistle, <hi>of two natures, and one person,</hi> to be Catholike, but that <hi>Ibas</hi> by that very confession is proved, nay demonstrated to be a Catholike.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Vigilius</hi> handles this matter farre more largely, but very obscurely &amp; mystically, as being indeed so miserably intangled in the birdlime of Nestorianisme, that hee know not possibly how to unfold himselfe. I must first of all set downe his words, though they be many, and because they are very obscure, they will require more attentive, and serious ponderation; <hi>Those things,</hi> saith he <note n="e" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ibid. nu.</hi> 193.</note> the interloquution of <hi>Invenalis</hi> doth signifie the same, who therefore decreed that <hi>Ibas</hi> should receive his Bishopricke, as holding the orthodoxall profession of faith, because he devoutly ranne, to embrace the communion with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> after that <hi>Cyrill</hi> had explaned his Chapters, and <hi>Ibas</hi> had understood them otherwise then before he did, though he had carped at <hi>Cyrill,</hi> when hee misunderstood those Chapters, for thus said <hi>Iuvenalis; The holy Scripture commandeth that hee who is converted should be received, for which cause we receive such as returne from heretickes; wherefore I decree that the reverend</hi> Ibas <hi>should obtaine favour and receive his Bishopricke, both because he is an old man, and because he is a Catholike.</hi> So <hi>Iuvenalis</hi>: By which this is understood: If wee receive such as returne from heretikes, how should we not receive <hi>Ibas</hi> who is a Catholike? whom it is manifest to be a Catholike, seeing hee is now converted, from that understanding of <hi>Cyrills</hi> Chapters, whereby hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, who while hee doubted of the understanding of those Chapters, did seem to speak against <hi>Cyrill</hi>: for never would <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venalis</hi> say that <hi>Ibas</hi> were a Catholike, unlesse he had proved by the words of this <hi>Epistle</hi> his confession to bee orthodoxall. And that the Interloquutions of <hi>Iuvenalis</hi> and <hi>Eunomius</hi> doe agree, the words of <hi>Eunomius</hi> doe shew, which are these; In what things <hi>Ibas</hi> seemed to blame <hi>Cyrill,</hi> by speaking ill; hee hath refuted all those things which he blamed, by making a right confession at the last. By which words of <hi>Eunomius</hi> it is evidently declared, that in the confession of faith, made by <hi>Ibas,</hi> nothing was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, seeing it is manifest, that his faith was praised; and that <hi>Ibas</hi> hath refuted that, which by misunderstanding <hi>Cyrill,</hi> hee had thought amisse of him.</p>

Thus farre are the words of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and so much of his Constitution as concernes this profession made by <hi>Ibas,</hi> of <hi>two natures and one person in Christ.</hi>

Add yet, to say truth, had <hi>Binius</hi> used all his art in this point, that alas would but have helped a little; he, poore lambe, is not able of himselfe to wade, no not through shallow places, it would require an Elephant to swimme through such a deepe: All his light is but borrowed of others, specially from <hi>Baronius,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:7679:83"/>
where <hi>Baronius</hi> is silent, he is more mute than a fish: yea, and when some of the Cardinals beames doe happen to collustrate his notes, yet even there they lose a great part of that vigour which they have in the Cardinals Phoebean lampe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The only man in the world fit to make a full and just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on this text of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> had beene <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe: He by his long acquaintance with Popes, and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by his continuall rifling of the Vaticane Manuscripts, and anatomising so many Pontificall decrees, had quicke sense of the Popes pulse, he knew every string and straine in their breasts. But so unhappily it fals out, that the Cardinall himselfe durst not touch this soare; he passeth it over, nay, rather shuffles it from him with deepe silence; wote you why? you may bee sure hee knew there was a padde in this straw, which had the Cardinall uncovered, his owne friends could not have indured the loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some sent of the Pontificall <hi>Constitution,</hi> but for very shame would have swept it out of the Church of God. Now because it were great pitty that so many mysteries as lye hid in this part of the Popes decree should be unknowne to the world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the very explication of the Popes words, is a full convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his heresie, for want of a better, I will lend them my best endeavours to supply the defect of the Cardinals Commentary in this point: And although all that I can say is, <hi>nihil ad Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonis suem,</hi> nothing to that which you should have applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>si ipsam belluam audissetis,</hi> if the Popes commentator had beene himselfe pleased to write hereof; yet truly, by long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Popes workes, and industrious observing the Cardinals <hi>artificium</hi> in explaning the like decrees, I well hope that I shal be able <hi>dolare,</hi> and after a rude fashion to rough-hew a peece of a commentary at this time; onely not being trained up in their Romane Schooles, where they learne to speake silken and sugered words of their Popes, and sow the softest Pillowes under their elbowes; I must crave pardon, if according to the Macedonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rudenesse of our dialect I call a spade, a spade, a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a slander, and heresie, heresie, though it happen to be found even in his Holinesse himselfe, and in his Pontificall and <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall</hi> decree: In hope of which pardon (specially since the fault is so veniall) I will now addresse my selfe to an unaccustomed taske of making a Commentary upon the Popes writings.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The scope and purpose of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this whole passage, is, to prove not onely <hi>Ibas</hi> himselfe, but his faith and profession also to have beene Catholike, not onely when he writ this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> but ever since <hi>Cyrill</hi> explaned his Chapters, and <hi>Ibas</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the same, which was before this <hi>Epistle</hi> was writ.

The second is taken from his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councel before <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Eustathius</hi>; in these words, For the same venerable <hi>Ibas,</hi> &amp;c. The third is drawne from the very profession it selfe, and words thereof set downe in the <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Ibas,</hi> where he confesseth <hi>two natures, and one person</hi>; and though there be a touch and taste of this through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole text, yet is it specially and more expresly set downe in those words, Further, it doth without all doubt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, &amp;c. I must be inforced, for more perspicuities sake, to invert the order of mine author, and begin with the exposition of his third reason, because, if that be well understood, it will serve for a torch to direct us in both the other.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In his third reason the Pope both affirmes, and by divers meanes proves that confession of <hi>Ibas,</hi> which in his <hi>Epistle</hi> hee makes to bee orthodoxall, and before wee handle his proofes hereof we must diligently consider the position it selfe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession made by <hi>Ibas: Ibas</hi> his confession in his <hi>Epistle</hi> is, that there are <hi>two natures, and one person in Christ: This confession in his Epistle,</hi> saith <hi>Vigilius</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. For the full manifestation whereof it must bee observed, that the Nestorians, the more plansibly to convey their heresie, wherein they <hi>denyed Christ the sonne of Mary to be God,</hi> used the very same words altogether which Chatholikes did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes said that there are <hi>two natures in Christ,</hi> the divinity, and the humanity, so said the Nestorians also: As Catholikes confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Christ to be our Lord,</hi> so confessed the Nestorians likewise. In words they both agreed and said the same, but in the sense and meaning of those words they were quite contrary.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:7679:84"/>11. When Catholikes said, that there are <hi>two natures in Christ,</hi> they meant truly &amp; orthodoxally, that the divinity &amp; humanity in Christ were differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in essence and substance, &amp; yet they both made but one <hi>hypostasis,</hi> that is, but <hi>one,</hi> and not <hi>two subsistent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>: But when the Nestorians said, that there are <hi>two natures in Christ,</hi> they meant that either nature made a severall and <hi>distinct person</hi> by it selfe, and so they made <hi>Christ to be two distinct persons,</hi> each subsisting by it selfe, <hi>two Sonnes, two Christs,</hi> that is, in truth, <hi>no Christ, no Saviour at all</hi>; for a Saviour he cannot bee, unlesse the selfe same person which is man be God also.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Againe, when Catholikes said, that <hi>Christ is one person,</hi> they meant truly and orthodoxally, that both natures together make but one personall subsistence, as the humane soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy make but one person, or one man: but when the Nestorians said, that <hi>Christ was one person,</hi> they meant not of that unity which is by naturall or personall subsistence, but <hi>of unity in affection, of unity by consent and liking, of unity by cohabitation</hi>; the person of the Sonne of God, so affecting and liking the sonne of <hi>Marie,</hi> that it inhabited and dwelt therein, as in a holy temple or house; but yet, as neither the house is the inhabitant, nor the inhabitant the house; so neither was God (by their doctrine) <hi>the sonne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or man; nor yet was that man which was the sonne of Mary, God</hi>; but onely the house or temple of God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. When Catholikes called Iesus Christ <hi>our Lord,</hi> they meant truly and orthodoxally, that the man Iesus Christ, who tooke flesh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is in truth very God, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head being hypostatically united unto the manhood, and both of them making but one person, who is both God and man: but the Nestoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in calling Iesus Christ <hi>our Lord,</hi> meant not that the man Christ was truly &amp; personally God or Lord, but that he was God, and the Lord, onely by having God and the Lord inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in him, and united, not personally, but onely affectually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; wherupon it followed, that they in adoring Christ, &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divine honours unto him, were indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for they gave the honour proper onely to God, unto that person, or that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which, according to their doctrine, they held not to be God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And, which of all may seeme most strange; whereas Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes not onely professed the Virgin <hi>Mary to bee the Mother of God,</hi> but under those very tearmes, and by that forme of words, as being most easie and perspicuous, contradicted &amp; condemned all the heresies of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> which were all by consequent inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their denying <hi>Mary</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Mother of God; The Nestorians, to avoid the hatred of this speech, if they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and more plausibly to convay their heresie, said, and in words professed even this also, that <hi>Mary was the Mother of God</hi>; but they meant not thereby, as Catholikes did, that Christ, who tooke flesh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was the same person or one personall subsistence with the Sonne of God; or, that God was
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7679:84"/>
incarnate, and assumed the manhood to make one person with the Godhead, but all that they meant was, that the Son of God, was onely by affection, and love united unto the sonne of <hi>Marie,</hi> being already perfect man in the wombe of his mother, and that God was borne of her, not by assuming flesh unto him, but by inhabiting that man who tooke flesh of her. Thus in shew of words the Nestorians seemed to bee Catholikes, and to say the same with Catholikes, but their sense and meaning in those words was most hereticall, and therefore indeed and in truth themselves notwithstanding all these speeches, were heretikes.</p>
               <p n="15">15. For the full and ample proofe of all these, I must referre my selfe to another Treatise, if it ever happen to see the light: wherein I have at large handled this point, and proved another of their Popes somewhat more ancient then <hi>Vigilius,</hi> I meane <hi>Hormisda,</hi> to have beene as deepe in the heresie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and to have as firmly by his Cathedrall and Apostolicall sentence confirmed the same, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe hath done, who as I thinke, by the example and authority of his predecessor was the more emboldned to plead for Nestorianisme, it being of all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies which ever sprung up in the Church, most full of all sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall subtilties, and colourable pretences of wit, was most fit of all the rest, to be commended by such as under the shew of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and truth, meant to defend and uphold heresie. But for this time I will now alleage onely a few evident testimonies, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth of that concurrence in words, and difference in sense, betweene Catholikes and Nestorians, which even now I mentioned.</p>

The <hi>Epistle</hi> it selfe doth so abundantly declare this truth, that none I thinke but a Nestorian, can make any doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Maris</hi> to whom <hi>Ibas</hi> writ this was a Nestorian hereticke: The end of his writing was to confirme, both <hi>Maris</hi> and the rest of that sect in their heresie. Had <hi>Ibas</hi> writ this touching two natures, and one person, in an orthodoxall sense, he had utterly condemned that same doctrine, which he purposely commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; he had overthrowne Nestorianisme, which he by this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> meant to establish. Againe, how could hee have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Cyrill</hi> or the Ephesine Councell as hereticall, had he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>two natures</hi> to be personally united in Christ? for that is the selfe same which <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and the Councell defendenth. Or how could he have commended <hi>Theodorus,</hi> for a teacher of the truth, who denies the personall, and holds onely an affectuall unitie of those <hi>two natures,</hi> had <hi>Ibas</hi> meant that there had beene a true personall and Hypostaticall union of them? Take the words in the Nestorian sense, there is a perfect harmonie in the whole <hi>Epistle</hi>: take them in the orthodoxall sense, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will then jarre from the middle and end, this makes a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the whole writing, yea, it makes the profession of <hi>Ibas</hi> to fight with the maine scope and purpose of <hi>Ibas.</hi>
               </p>

That one place in the end of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> concerning the <hi>union,</hi> makes this most evident, <hi>Ibas</hi> saith that among other things <hi>Paulus Emisenus</hi> required, and <hi>Cyrill</hi> consented to anathematize those who professe, <hi>quia una natura est divinitatis, &amp; humanitatis, that there is one nature of the deitie and humanitie in Christ.</hi> Had <hi>Ibas</hi> by one nature, meant one essence, so that both the humanitie, and deitie were one essence, why should they require <hi>Cyrill</hi> to anathematize that? for neither <hi>Cyrill,</hi> nor any Catholike ever affirmed there was onely one nature, that is, one onely essence in Christ. But by <hi>nature, Ibas</hi> understood Person, and so its true that <hi>Cyrill</hi> taught one nature, that is, one onely person in Christ, whereas <hi>Nestorius, Ibas</hi> and all the Nestorians affirmed <hi>two such Natures,</hi> that is, <hi>two persons</hi> to be in Christ: according to which sense <hi>Ibas</hi> saith, that <hi>Paulus</hi> dealing with <hi>Cyrill</hi> to yeeld to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storianisme, and on the behalfe of the Nestorians, required him to anathematize those who say there is but one <hi>Nature,</hi> that is but <hi>one person</hi> in Christ: and he slanderously adds, that <hi>Cyrill</hi>

consented so to do: that is, that he subscribed indeed to all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storianisme, and renounced the Catholike saith, the decree of the Ephesine Councell, and his owne twelve Chapters. In which slanderous report <hi>Ibas</hi> insulting saith, <hi>Non enim quisquam audet dicere quia una est natura, None dare now say that there is one nature of the divinitie and humanitie,</hi> one nature, that is, one essence: no Catholike then, or ever, did say, but none dare now say, that there is <hi>one Nature,</hi> that is, <hi>one person</hi> in Christ, which all Catholikes both then, and ever said, and this the very next words doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; but now they doe professe to beleeve <hi>in templum, &amp; in eum qui in hoc habitat, in the temple, and in him who dwelleth in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which was the very comparison of <hi>Nestorius</hi>

The he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie of <hi>Eutiches</hi> did equally contradict both the Catholike truth and the Nestorian heresie, because they both consented in one common truth, that there are two distinct natures, or essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abiding in Christ.

Seeing then it is knowne, that the profession of <hi>Flavianus</hi> was Catholike, the profession also of <hi>Ibas</hi> made in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> being like to that of <hi>Flavianus,</hi> must needes be Catholike; My annotation on this reason of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is, that it is inconsequent, sophisticall, and worth nothing at all, <hi>Ibas</hi> indeede in words said the like with <hi>Flavianus,</hi> but <hi>Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> said it in a Chatholike sense, holding those two natures to make but one person or personall subsistence, and <hi>Ibas</hi> said it in this <hi>Epistle</hi> in an hereticall sense, holding those two natures to make two distinct persons, or two personall subsistences.

Had they judged him, since that Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a Catholike; they must approve this <hi>Epistle</hi> for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and so prove themselves to be hereticall, to be Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Thus <hi>Vigilius,</hi> to cloake his owne heresie, would faine fasten it upon the holy Counsell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which was so farre from partaking with <hi>Vigilius</hi> herein, that by their definitive sentence, this very <note n="u" place="margin">

Now I pray you, what a consequent, or colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction call you this? <hi>Ibas</hi> being suspected of Nestorianisme, to cleare himselfe, consented to the Ephesine Councell, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe to bee a Catholike, sixteene yeares after the <hi>union,</hi> or thirteene yeares after he writ this <hi>Epistle</hi>: therefore at the time of the <hi>union,</hi> and of the writing of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> he was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike also, and not a Nestorian. Why, twelve or sixteen years might have a strange operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Ibas</hi>; and there is no doubt but so it had? In so many revolutions <hi>Ibas</hi> saw, how both himselfe and other Nestorians were publikely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by the Church, and by the Emperour, and hated of all, who had any love to the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7679:89"/>
Catholike faith: He saw that himselfe was personally called <hi>cora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nobis,</hi> for maintaining that heresie: he knew, that unlesse hee clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe before those Iudges, deputed by the Emperour to heare and examine his cause; he was in danger of the like depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and some others had justly felt. The serious and often meditation of these matters wrought effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ibas,</hi> and therefore before <hi>Photius</hi> &amp; <hi>Eustathius</hi> he renounced, disclamed, and condemned Nestorianisme, and so at that time proved himselfe, by his profession before them, to bee a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as he had before that time, and specially when he writ this <hi>Epistle,</hi> demonstrated himselfe to be, not onely an earnest, but a malicious and slanderous heretike. I cannot illustrate the Pope, my Authors reason, by a more fit similitude, than of a man once deadly sicke of the Pestilence, but afterwards fully cured and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; for <hi>Vigilius</hi> his reason is, as if one should say, This man was not sicke of the Pestilence, no not when the sore was running upon him, and hee at the very point of death, because some twelve or sixteene yeares after, hee was a sound man, cleare from all suspition of the Pestilence. Not needeth this second reason of <hi>Vigilius</hi> any further explanation.</p>

We come now, in the last place, to that which <hi>Vigilius</hi> maketh his first reason in the former text; into which, because hee hath compacted the very venome of the Nestorians, wee must bee inforced to take somewhat the more paines, in our Commentary upon it. This reason (in which, it seems, the Pope puts his greatest confidence) is drawne from the explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, of which <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vig. Const. nu.</hi> 192 193, 194.</note> 
                  <hi>Vigilius</hi> saith, that <hi>Ibas</hi> at the first, &amp; before <hi>Cyrill</hi> had explaned them, misconceived the meaning of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and therefore seemed to speake against <hi>Cyrill:</hi> but so soone as <hi>Cyrill</hi> had explaned them, and decared his owne meaning, then <hi>Ibas,</hi> and all the Easterne Bishops forthwith embraced the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>Cyrill</hi>; and ever after that, <hi>Ibas</hi> continued a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. This <hi>Epistle</hi> then of <hi>Ibas,</hi> and profession of faith made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which certainly followed the Explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, must needs be Catholike, &amp; declare <hi>Ibas,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he writ it, to have been a Catholike; seeing, when he made this confession of faith, and writ this <hi>Epistle,</hi> he held the same faith with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no doubt held the Catholike faith. This is the full summe and effect of the Popes reason, taken from the Explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, and for the excellency of it, it spreadeth it selfe into every part of the two other reasons also, as containing an explication of them, or giving strength unto them; for which cause wee are with more diligence and circumspection to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the pith of it.</p>
               <p n="35">35. And that we may more clearely behold and admire the Popes <hi>Artificium,</hi> in handling this reason, we are to observe five severall points thereof. The first, a peece of the Popes Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, in that he saith <note n="d" place="margin">

               <p n="37">37. I say yet more for the further clearing of this matter, that

neither all, nor so much as any one of all those Easterne Bishops, who tooke part with <hi>Iohn,</hi> consented to <hi>Cyrill</hi> upon his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the twelve Chapters, for <hi>Cyrill</hi> set forth his explanation during the time of the Ephesine Councell, while hee was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned at <hi>Ephesus, Cyrill,</hi> saith <hi>Baronius</hi>

So they more detested that explanation then the Chapters explaned, it was more hereticall in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the other.

                  <hi>say they to strive unto death, and neither receive Cyrill, neque capitula ab eo exposita, neither the Chapters by him explained.</hi> Whence it is without all doubt, that neither all, nor any at all, not <hi>Iohn</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who was the ringleader to the rest, did consent to <hi>Cyrill</hi> and hold communion with him, upon his publishing that Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Chapters, or upon their knowing thereof.</p>
               <p n="39">39. But how long after this explanation, was it before their union and communion with <hi>Cyrill? Peltanus</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> say <note n="u" place="margin">

                  </note> that those jarres continued for three yeares after the end of the Councell.

Thus much is evident, that the <hi>union</hi> betwixt <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> was not concluded till De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember; in the next yeare after the Councell was ended.

               </p>
               <p n="40">40. The third part of the Popes <hi>Artificium</hi> is his Logicke, which in very truth is nothing else but trifling sophistication: he supposeth that <hi>Cyrills</hi> explanation of the twelve Chapters, was the cause and occasion of the <hi>union</hi> betwixt <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and the rest. It was not, for that was published, and knowne unto them, more then an whole yeare before the <hi>union:</hi> nay that explanation did more alienate their minds from <hi>Cyrill,</hi> they detested that, more then the Chapters themselves, as we have clearly proved; so far was it from effecting the <hi>union,</hi> that it increased the breach and dis-union. The onely true, and certaine cause of the union, was the relenting of the Easterne Bishops, from their former sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, obstinacie, and heresie: their subscribing to all that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> required of them, to wit, to the condemning of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and his heresies: till they did this, <hi>Cyrill</hi> was unmoveable, inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any <hi>union:</hi> as soone as ever this was done, <hi>Cyrill</hi> most gladly embraced them, and sung his hymne, <hi>Let the heavens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> for their consenting to the Catholike faith. <hi>Vigilius</hi> still harps on a wrong string, and fallaciously puts <hi>non causam, pro causa,</hi> which was not fitting for the Popes gravitie &amp; judgment.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The fourth and fift which are the chiefe parts of my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>Artificium,</hi> concerne his Ethicall, and Theologicall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which being confused and mingled together throughout this whole text, and manifesting the Pope to joyne to his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, slander, I must bee forced to handle them both together. These consist in that which the Pope so often beats upon, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> explaned his Chapters, and upon that explanation, <hi>Ibas</hi> and the other Easterne Bishops ranne to embrace him, and his communion, what thinke you is that explanation of <hi>Cyrills</hi> Chapters, which the Pope so eagerly urgeth, and makes the cause of the <hi>union</hi> with <hi>Ibas</hi> and the rest? Truly thats a mysterie indeed, and containes in it the pith of Nestorianisme: <hi>Baronius</hi> was very loath to unfold this secret of the Popes Art: but I hope to make it so perspicuous, as that none shall bemone the want of the Cardinalls Commentarie in this point.</p>

And in particular they avouched this of <hi>Cyrill</hi> who was the chief agent on the Catholikes part, and who most zealously had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himselfe to their heresie.

Now the same Nestorians being no lesse subtle, then malicious: when they spake or writ of this matter to any of their owne consorts, to their <hi>Electi,</hi> one of which this <hi>Maris</hi> was to whom <hi>Ibas</hi> writ, then they said in plaine termes, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> (and the other Catholikes) had recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, condemned, or anathematized his twelve Chapters, and his former doctrine; as in the end of this Epistle <hi>Ibas</hi> tells <hi>Maris,</hi> and wisheth him to shew the same, <hi>Omnibus patribus nostris pacem amantibus, to all their Fathers, to the whole society of Nestorians,</hi> and all that loved the peace with them, that <hi>Cyrill</hi> did now, <hi>contraria docere priori doctrinae, teach the contrarie to his former doctrine,</hi> that hee anathematized it and all that held it. Loe heres plaine dealing with <hi>Maris. Cyrill</hi> now condemneth and anathematizeth his twelve Chapters: but when they spake to men otherwise affected then themselves, to such as could not endure to heare that <hi>Cyrill</hi> had recanted or anathematized his former doctrine, and Chapters, then they would not use such harsh and homely words of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> but they would signifie the same thing, by a more facile, faire, and courteous phrase, saying <hi>Cyrill</hi> explaned his Chapters, and they upon his explanation, received him into their communion, and held him for a Catholike.</p>
               <p n="43">43. This to be that which <hi>Ibas</hi> and other Nestorians meant by <hi>Cyrills</hi> explanation of his Chapters, the words of <hi>Ibas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe uttered in the judgement, before <hi>Photius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Eustathius,</hi> 16 yeares after the <hi>union,</hi> doe make cleare; for although <hi>Ibas</hi> had then in the maine point renounced Nestorianisme: yet he still retained a touch or smack of their Nestorian language, hee had not as yet perfectly learned to pronounce <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> nor wholy weaned himselfe, or disused his tongue from those Nestorian phrases, which were so familiar in their mouthes.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7679:92"/>

               <p n="45">45. This will bee more cleare, if we consider the occasion of this phrase, and why the Nestorians called that an Explanation, which (as they meant) was a condemnation of his Chapters.

               <p n="48">48. We doe now clearly see, not onely that the explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, which <hi>Ibas,</hi> and the other Nestorians of his time meant, is an utter condemning of them all; but upon what pretence and occasion they called his anathematizing, an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Chapters. If now it may further appeare, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> in his Constitution meant this Nestorian, and slanderous Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; I doubt not, but his text will bee sufficient, easie, and cleare in this point: And though none, who diligently peruseth the Popes words, can, as I thinke, doubt hereof; yet because it is not fit, in a just Commentary, to give naked asseverations, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a point of such moment, I will propose three or foure reasons to make evident the same. The first is taken from the correspondence and parity of the effect, which followed upon this Explanation, as the cause therof: It is no doubt but <hi>Vigilius</hi> meant such an explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, as upon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, that <hi>union</hi> which <hi>Ibas</hi> held with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> at the time when he writ this <hi>Epist.</hi> ensued; for <hi>Vigilius</hi> proveth <hi>Ibas</hi>

                     <hi>Vt ante probatum est ca.</hi> 11.</note>, that <hi>Ibas,</hi> when he writ this <hi>Epistle,</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> and true <hi>union,</hi> which <hi>Cyrill</hi> truly made with <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the rest, upon their profession of the orthodoxall faith, sent unto him; but onely the union in Nestorianisme, the slanderous union, which they falsely affirmed <hi>Cyrill</hi> to have made; wherefore it certainly followeth, that the Explanation of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which <hi>Vigilius</hi> intendeth, as a cause of that union, can bee no other then the slanderous explanation, wherein <hi>Cyrill</hi> was falsely said to have explaned his Chapters; that is, anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed them, and the doctrine delivered in them: for the true and orthodoxal explanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither did, nor could effect that unio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Nestorianisme, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
                  <hi>Ibas</hi> embraced at the time when he writ this <hi>Epistle</hi>; it was the condemning of his Chapters, and in such sort to explane them, that they were anathematized; it was this, and no other explanation, which did make the union, whereof <hi>Ibas</hi> boasteth. Seeing then the hereticall union of <hi>Ibas,</hi> followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that explanation which <hi>Vigilius</hi> here meaneth, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, that the explanation also which hee intendeth, is the same slanderous, &amp; hereticall explanation, which <hi>Ibas,</hi> and the other Nestorians ascribed to <hi>Cyril,</hi> &amp; upon which they joyned in union and communion with him. The cause was like the effect; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, an hereticall, and slanderous union; the cause, an hereticall and slanderous explanation.</p>
               <p n="49">49. The other reason is taken from the words of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> which, being very pregnant to this purpose, I shall desire the reader dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to consider the same. <hi>Vigilius</hi> having said <note n="h" place="margin">

                  <hi>Ex quo apparet,</hi> By this it appeareth, <hi>Ibas,</hi> both before hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the twelve Chapters of <hi>Cyrils,</hi> and when he suspected one Nature to be taught thereby, <hi>orthodoxo sensu, quod male dictum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istimabat, reprobasse; then to have reproved those Chapters in an ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall sense</hi>; and also after the Explanation of them, <hi>orthodoxo sensu, quae rectè dicta cognoverat, venerabiliter suscepisse; then to have approved them very reverently,</hi> and in an orthodoxall sense embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that which he knew to bee rightly spoken therein. So <hi>Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> plainly affirming the sense of <hi>Ibas</hi> to have been orthodoxall, both before, and after the Explanation, or <hi>union</hi> (made by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all the <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cum omnibus Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entalibus Episcopis. Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> rest,) with <hi>Cyrill</hi>: At both those times the doctrine, sense, and meaning of <hi>Ibas</hi> was the same, and at both orthodoxal: and <hi>Cyrill,</hi> by that Explanation which <hi>Vigilius</hi> meaneth, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Chapters to have the very same meaning, and orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sense which <hi>Ibas</hi> had; which, when <hi>Ibas</hi> perceived to bee the sense of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> forthwith he held <hi>Cyrill</hi> for a Catholike, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned communion with him, and reverently received his doctrine, as being consonant to the sense of <hi>Ibas,</hi> which was still or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall; so there was no alteration in the sense of <hi>Ibas,</hi> that both before, and after <hi>Cyrils</hi> Explanation, was orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, onely before the union, or Explanation <hi>Ibas</hi> mis-understood <hi>Cyrils</hi> meaning, and thought he had taught one Nature to bee in Christ, whereas <hi>Cyrill</hi> by his Explanation shewed, that he meant just as <hi>Ibas</hi> did, that there were in Christ two Natures, even in that orthodoxall sense which <hi>Ibas</hi> had held, as well before, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Explanation.</p>

I have manifested this before, and the <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Ibas,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten two yeares at least after that <hi>union,</hi> doth make it undeniably evident, that his sense was then, <hi>that there</hi>

                  </note> of theirs, was, <hi>that Cyrils twelve Chapters were hereticall, contrary to the Euangelicall and Apostolicall doctrine, that there are two Natures, making two Persons in Christ; that to teach one Nature, that is, one Person in Christ; was hereticall: that Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, and all that tooke part with him; or consented to his Chapters, were heretikes; yea, condemned and anathematized heretikes; that the holy Ephesine Councell was a Conspiracie of heretikes, of seditious and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons.</hi> This was the sense of <hi>Iohn,</hi> this the sense of <hi>Ibas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>union</hi>: and this sense the Popes Holinesse hath decreed to be a Catholike and orthodoxall sense: The sense of <hi>Ibas,</hi> saith hee, both before the Explanation, or union, and after it, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall; so, by the Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> his decree, it is good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine to teach <hi>two Persons in Christ</hi>; to teach, <hi>Cyrill, Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> the whole Ephesine Councell, to be heretikes, that is, in a word, to teach Nestorianisme, and nothing but Nestorianisme to be the Catholike faith.</p>
               <p n="52">52. But that which I principally aimed at, out of those words of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> was, to observe, that <hi>Cyrils</hi> Explanation here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and meant by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> neither is, nor can be ought else but an absolute condemning, and anathematizing of his twelve Chapters; for by that explanation, which <hi>Vigilius</hi> intendeth, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> shewed, that his sense was the very same with that which <hi>Ibas</hi> had before, and after the <hi>union,</hi> but that sense which <hi>Ibas</hi> had before, and divers yeares after the union, was, that the <hi>two Natures</hi> in Christ make <hi>two distinct Persons,</hi> and that <hi>Cyrils</hi> twelve Chapters, in which it is constantly taught, that there is but one Person (or, as the Nestorians spake, but one nature) in Christ, are hereticall, and to be anathematized, as being contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith; wherefore, that Explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, which <hi>Vigilius</hi> intendeth, is certainly a declaring and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that there is not one, but two distinct Persons in Christ; and that his own twelve Chapters, for teaching but one Person, are all of them hereticall, and to be anathematized.</p>
               <p n="53">53. The third reason is taken from <hi>Vigilius</hi> his scope and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in this whole passage: Suppose <hi>Vigilius</hi> to have meant the orthodoxall Explanation <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quae extat in Actis Conc.

                  <note n="o" place="margin">

Seeing then by that Explanation which <hi>Vigilius</hi> intendeth, his purpose is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and strengthen this <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Ibas,</hi> and prove it to bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall, which is onely done by approving the slanderous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of <hi>Cyrill</hi> to be orthodoxall; the very scope, and maine purpose of <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth declare, that it is not, nor can be the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7679:95"/>
but the slanderous and hereticall Explanation only of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, which the Pope here meant, and by which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commended for Catholike, hee indevoureth to prove the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, which shewes <hi>Ibas</hi> to have consented most gladly, and reverently, as the Pope saith, to it, to bee indeed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</p>
               <p n="54">54. The fourth and last reason is taken from the fit coherence, and congruity, which this exposition of <hi>Vigilius</hi> meaning, hath, with his whole text concerning this matter. Take him to speake of the true and orthodoxall explanation of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> his words are riddles, more obscure than <hi>Plato's</hi> numbers, yea, they are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliable to the truth of the story: <hi>Ibas,</hi> saith the Pope <note n="p" place="margin">

Lastly, <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> though hee commended them, yet because hee did it in an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall sense, and with an hereticall spirit, was justly condemned by the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; but <hi>Ibas,</hi> though hee condemned them, yet because he did it in an orthodoxall sense, and with an orthodoxall spirit, amending what by an errour, and mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he had done amisse, was approved by the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and judged by them to have continued in the right Catholike faith. Thus by our exposition, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> meant the slanderous, and hereticall explanation of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Chapters, is his whole text both coherent, and congruous to it selfe, and very perspicuous, and easie; which, if <hi>Vigilius</hi> should meane, or be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to have understood of the true and orthodoxall Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> would bee, not onely obscure, and inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but even repugnant, as well to the scope as to the words and text of <hi>Vigilius.</hi>

               <p n="56">56. My conclusion now of this second reason of <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> for defence of this Epistle of <hi>Ibas,</hi> is this: seeing the one defineth, and the other defendeth both <hi>Ibas</hi> himselfe, and his profession in this Epistle, in this point, and in the sense of <hi>Ibas</hi> to be orthodoxall, because <hi>Ibas</hi> professeth therein two natures, and one person to bee in Christ; and seeing as wee have certainly proved, <hi>Ibas</hi> meant <hi>two such natures, as make two distinct persons,</hi> and one person, not by a naturall, and hypostaticall union, but onely by affection, liking and cohabitation, which is the very he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie condemned in <hi>Nestorius</hi>: It doth hence clearly and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably ensue, not onely that this <hi>third Chapter</hi> touching the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Epistle of <hi>Ibas,</hi> doth concerne the faith, and is a <hi>questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cause of faith,</hi> but that <hi>Vigilius</hi> first, and next <hi>Baronius,</hi> and then all who by word or writing, doe defend either <hi>Vigilius</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> or the Popes judgment in causes of faith to be <hi>infallible,</hi> that they all by defending this Epistle as orthodoxall; or that <hi>Ibas</hi> by it ought to bee judged a Catholike, doe thereby main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the condemned heresie of <hi>Nestorius</hi> to be the onely Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith.</p>

               <p n="3">3. See how heresie makes a man to dote. That this question about the <hi>three Chapters</hi> is a cause of faith, wee have cleerly and unanswerably confirmed; and <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe hath confessed; That the defenders of them, and condemners, were in a manifest contradiction in this cause, (the former, by an evident consequent and cunningly defending; the other condemning the heresies of <hi>Nestorius</hi>) is most evident, and yet both of them in the Cardinals judgement are good Catholikes: neither the one, who with the Nestorians <hi>deny Christ to be God:</hi> nor the other, <hi>who affirme him to be God,</hi> may be called heretikes. This truly is either the same heresie which the Rhetorians maintained, who as <hi>Philastrius</hi> saith <note n="c" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:7679:97"/>
which either have beene or shall arise hereafter. For seeing in this cause of faith two contradictories may be held without here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, the like may be in every other point of faith; and so with <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> the Arians, Eutycheans, and all heretikes shall have their <hi>quietus est</hi>: say what they will in any cause of faith, none may call them heretikes. I commend the Cardinall for his wit. This makes all cocke sure, it is an unexpugnable bulwarke to defend the <hi>Constitution</hi> of Pope <hi>Vigilius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Say you, neither the defenders, nor the condemners of these Chapters may for that cause bee called heretikes? For the condemners of them, trouble not your wit, they are and shall be ever acknowledged for Catholikes. But for the defenders of them, who are the onely men, that the Cardinall would gratifie by this assertion, I may boldly say with the Prophet <note n="d" place="margin">

All these must be hereticall, if the defenders of those <hi>three Chapters</hi> be not heretikes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now against this assertion of <hi>Baronius,</hi> whereby he would acquit <hi>Vigilius</hi> and all that defend him from heresie: I will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose another and true assertion, ensuing of that which wee have clearly proved; and this it is: That, <hi>one or moe, either men or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may dissent from the Popes Cathedrall and definitive sentence in a cause of faith, made knowne unto them, and yet be no heretikes.</hi> For to omit other instances no lesse effectuall, this one concerning <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> doth make this most evident. The cause was a <hi>cause of faith,</hi>

                     <hi>Vid. sup. ca.</hi> 5. <hi>nu.</hi> 14.</note> as <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe often professeth. The Popes defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence in that <hi>cause of faith,</hi> made for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of those <hi>three Chapters,</hi> was published and made knowne to the fift generall Councell, and to the whole Church: this also <hi>Baronius</hi> confesseth <note n="f" place="margin">

                  </note>, and yet they who contradicted the Popes <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence in this <hi>cause of faith,</hi> made knowne unto them, were not heretikes: this also is the confession of <hi>Baronius,</hi> whose assertion as you have seene is, that neither the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of these Chapters, nor the defenders of them were heretiks. So by the Cardinalls owne assertions: one may contradict and oppugne the Popes knowne, Cathedral, and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in cause of faith, and yet bee no heretike. But what speake I of <hi>Baronius,</hi> the evidence and force of reason doth unresistably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this. For the whole fift generall Councell contradicted, yea condemned and accursed the Popes Cathedrall and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sentence in this cause of faith made knowne unto them. The whole Catholike Church ever since hath approved the fift
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7679:98"/>
Councell, and the decree thereof, and therefore hath contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, condemned and accursed the Popes sentence as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had done. And none I hope will be so impudently hereticall, as to call not onely the fift generall and holy Councell, but the whole Catholike Church of God, heretikes: who yet must all be heretikes, or else the dissenting from, yea the detesting, and accursing the Popes Cathedrall sentence in a <hi>cause of faith,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make one an heretike.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I say more, and adde this as a further consequent on that which hath been declared, <hi>That none can now assent to their Popes, or to their Cathedrall definitions</hi> and doctrines maintained by the present Romane Church, but <hi>eo nomine, even for that very cause,</hi> they are convicted, condemned, and accursed heretikes. For the manifesting of which <hi>conclusion,</hi> I will begin with that their <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall</hi> position of the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibility</hi> in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning causes of faith, whereof before I have so often made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And to prove the present Romane Church to bee hereticall herein, <hi>two things</hi> are to be declared: the one that this is indeed the <hi>position</hi> or doctrine of their Church: the other, that this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is <hi>hereticall,</hi> and for such condemned by the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the former; that the assertion of Popes <hi>infallibility</hi> in defining causes of faith, is the doctrine of the present Romane Church, I thinke none conversant in their writings will make doubt. Give mee leave to propose some testimonies of their owne. <hi>The Pope</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

Now because all doubts and controversies of faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the one of these, it clearly followeth upon that decree, that the very last stay in all doubts of faith, is the Churches judgement; but that, upon no other, nor higher stay, doth, or can relie; for whatsoever you take besides this, the truth, the waight, and validity of all must be tried in the Church, at her judgement it must stand or fall; yea, if you make a doubt of the Churches judgement it selfe, even that, as all other, must be ended by the judgement of the Church; it is the last Iudge of all. This, to bee the true meaning of the <hi>Trent</hi> Councel, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> both saw, and professeth, when hee saith <note n="e" place="margin">

Now all this which they have said of the Church, if you will have it in plaine termes and without circumloquution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to the Pope, who is <hi>vertually</hi> both Church and Councell. As the Church or Councell is called infallible, no otherwise but by a <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> because the Pope, who is the head both of Church and Councell, is <hi>infallible:</hi> So is the Church or Councell called the foundation of faith, or last principle on which their faith must relie, by the same figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Pope who is the head of them both, is the <hi>foundation</hi> of faith. And whosoever is a true Romane Catholike or member of their present Church, hee beleeveth all other doctrines, because the Church, that is, the Pope doth teach them; and the Pope to teach them <hi>infallibly,</hi> he beleeveth for it selfe, because the Pope saith hee, is in such teaching <hi>infallible.</hi> This <hi>infallibility</hi> of the Pope is the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the very corner stone</hi>; the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on stone, the rocke and fundamentall <hi>position</hi> of their whole faith and religion, which was the point that I purposed to declare.</p>
               <p n="18">18. I have hitherto declared, and I feare too abundantly, that the assertion of the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> infallibilitie in causes of faith, is not onely a <hi>position,</hi> but the very <hi>fundamentall</hi> position of all the doctrines of the present Romane Church. In the next place we are to prove that this position is <hi>hereticall,</hi> and that for such it was adjudged and condemned by the Catholike Church. In the proofe whereof I shall not need to stay long. This whole treatise, and even that which hath already beene declared touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Constitution</hi> of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth evidently confirme the same. For seeing the defending of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> hath been proved <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ca.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.</note> to be hereticall, the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> made in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of those Chapters, must of necessity be confessed to be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall. Nay if you well consider, you shall see, that this very <hi>position</hi> of the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibilitie,</hi> is adjudged to bee hereticall. For the fift generall Councell knew this cause of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> to bee <hi>a cause of faith.</hi> They knew further that Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> decree, and Cathedrall Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution had defined that those <hi>Three Chapters</hi> ought to bee defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now seeing they knew both these, and yet judicially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the defence of those <hi>Three Chapters</hi> to be hereticall, and for such accursed it, even in doing this, they define the <hi>Cathedrall</hi> judgement of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this <hi>cause of Faith,</hi> to be hereticall; and therefore most certainly and <hi>à fortiori</hi> define this <hi>position</hi> [That the Popes Cathedrall sentence in a cause of faith is infallible] to bee <hi>hereticall,</hi> and for such they anathematize both it, and all that defend it. And because the judgement and definitive sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the fift Councell is consonant to all former, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all subsequent Councels till the <hi>Laterane</hi> Synod under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, it unavoydably hence ensueth, that the same <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:7679:102"/>
of the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibility</hi> in <hi>causes of faith,</hi> is by the judgement of all generall Councells untill that time, that is, by the constant, and uniforme consent of the whole Catholike Church, adjudged, condemned, and accursed for hereticall, and all who defend it for heretikes. And seeing we have cleerly proved the whole present Romane Church, and all that are members therof, to defend this <hi>position,</hi> yea to defend it as the maine <hi>foundation</hi> of their whole faith; the evidence of that asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I proposed <note n="g" place="margin">

And yet by that <hi>fundamentall position,</hi> they are bound (and now doe <hi>implicitè</hi>) beleeve whatsoever any Pope either by word or writing, either hath already, or shall at any time hereafter define to be a doctrine of faith. Because I will not stay on particulars, if any please seriously to consider this matter, hee shall perceive (that which now I intend to prove) such venome of <hi>infidelity</hi> to lye in that one <hi>fundamentall position</hi> of the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibility,</hi> that by reason of holding it, they neither doe nor can beleeve or hold with <hi>certaintie of faith</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:7679:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any one point or doctrine, which they professe to beleeve, and hold upon that <hi>Foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. For the clearing of which point (being very materiall) it is to be observed, that unto certainty of faith, two things are of necessity required; The one <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> on the part of thing beleeved, which must be so true and certaine in it selfe, that it cannot possibly bee or have beene otherwise then it is beleeved to be, to have beene, or to be hereafter. And therefore none can truly beleeve any untruth, for nothing which is untrue, is or can be the object of faith. The other thing is required, <hi>ex parte sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti,</hi> on the part of him who beleeveth. Now faith being onely of such things are inevident, that is, which neither by sense can be perceived, nor by naturall reason collected or found out; but which are onely by the testimonie of such as first knew them, made knowne unto us, and none doth or can know that which is supernaturall, unlesse God himselfe reveale the same unto him, it hence followeth that whatsoever is by any beleeved, the same is revealed and testified to him by God himselfe, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: and further, that it is certainly knowne unto him who beleeveth, that it is God himselfe, who doth reveale and testifie that thing unto him. For otherwise though the doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, be in it selfe never so certaine and divine, yet unto thee, or me, it cannot be certaine, nor held by certainty of faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse first we be sure and infallibly certaine, that he who testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it unto us is himselfe infallible, that is, that he is God. Let us for perspicuity, call the former of these two, <hi>materiale fidei,</hi> the materiall in faith or the thing beleeved: and the later, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male fidei,</hi> that which is formall in faith, seeing as the former is the thing beleeved, so the later containes the reason, the ground or foundation upon which, and for which it is beleeved.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Consider now first the <hi>materials</hi> in their <hi>faith.</hi> In them there is a great difference; for some of them are in themselves credible, as being divine truths, and true objects of faith. Such are all those Catholike truths common to us and them, as that there is a <hi>Trinity, that Christ was borne of a Virgin, dyed, rose againe,</hi> and the like. Others are in themselves untrue, such as cannot be the object of faith: Of this sort are all those doctrines wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they dissent from us, <hi>Transubstantiation, reall and proper sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, worshipping of Images, Purgatory, Iustification</hi> by the merit or dignity of our works, and the like, which may rightly bee called popish doctrines. The later sort of these they neither <hi>doe nor can beleeve.</hi> The former they <hi>might,</hi> but they <hi>doe not beleeve.</hi> The reason whereof will appeare by considering that which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall or the fundamentall ground of their faith: where it is first to be observed, that a man may hold many, yea all the doctrines professed by the present Church, except that one of the Popes <hi>Cathedrall infallibility,</hi> and yet bee no <hi>Papist</hi> or member of their present Church. For although the things professed, or the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:7679:103"/>
be the selfe same, yet the formalitie or diverse reason of holding them, causeth a maine difference in the parties that hold them. And for our present purpose it may suffice to note three divers wayes, whereby their doctrines are or may be held.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The first is, of them, who build all those doctrines upon the <hi>Scripture</hi> as the <hi>Foundation</hi> thereof: upon that ground, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely many Catholike truths, which they most firmly beleeve, the Church inducing, the Scriptures outwardly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the holy Spirit inwardly sealing, the same unto them: but together with those truths hold some errors also of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church (take for example <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>;) which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the inducement of that present Church wherein they live, they thinke to be taught in the Scriptures, and therefore hold and professe them, and thinke they beleeve them, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are neither in truth taught in the Scriptures, nor sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Gods Spirit unto their hearts, therefore they hold not these, nor in truth can they hold them with that firmnesse and certainty of faith, as they doe the former truths, but they have a faintnes and feare in their assent unto these, and so a readines and willing preparation of heart; to disclaime these, and to hold or professe the contrary, if ever it may be fully cleared &amp; manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Scriptures unto them. Of this sort we doubt not but many thousands of our fathers were, who living in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; thicke mists of their Antichristian superstition, upon the Scriptures &amp; word of God which they held for the foundation of their faith, builded indeed much gold &amp; precious stones, but with a mixture of much hay; stubble &amp; drosse, thinking (but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry erroneously) the later as well as the former to be contained in that <hi>foundation.</hi> The state of all these is very like to S. <hi>Cyprians,</hi> and those other Africane Bishops, which were so earnest for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> supposing it to be taught in the Scriptures, &amp; though the <hi>foundation</hi> of it, &amp; of those catholike truths that Christ was God, or the like; was one and the same unto them, yet they held not both with like firmnes &amp; certainty of faith. The doctrine of Christs deity &amp; manhood they so beleeved, that they would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with any that denied this, nay they would rather die then deny it. But <hi>Rebaptization</hi> they so held, as not thinking their opposites to be heretikes, nor refusing <note n="p" place="margin">

that hee ought not onely to teach with knowledge, but learne with patience, hee I doubt not would readily have demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not onely how learned, but how willing to learne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had beene, had this question in his life time beene deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by such learned and holy men, as afterwards it was. I often admire that one observation, among many, which the same <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> makes touching this error in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of whom being so very learned, he saith, <hi>Propterea non vidit aliquid ut per cum aliud eminentius videretur; He therefore saw not this one truth touching Rebaptization, that others might see in him a more eminent and excellent truth.</hi> And what truth is that? In him we may see the truth of Humilitie, the truth of modestie, the truth of Charitie and ardent love to the peace, and unitie of the Church: but the most excellent truth that I can see, or as I thinke, can be seene in <hi>erring Cyprian</hi> is this, <hi>that one may be a true Catholike, a Catholike Bishop, a pillar of Gods Church, yea even a Saint and glorious Martyr, and yet hold an error in faith,</hi> as did that holy Catholike Bishop, and blessed Martyr Saint <hi>Cyprian.</hi> To him then and the other Africane Bishops, who in like sort erred as he did; may fitly be compared the state of those servants of God, who in the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and invincible ignorance of those times of Antichrist, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many golden truths, which they most firmely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, upon that solid <hi>foundation</hi> of the Scriptures, held either <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or the like errors, thinking them (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did, of <hi>Rebaptization</hi>) to be taught in that <hi>foundation</hi> also. They erred in some doctrines of faith, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those errors, they may be Catholikes, and blessed as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was, because they both firmely beleeved many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike truths, and their error was without pertinacie as <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was. For none, who truly beleeves the Scripture, and holds it for the <hi>foundation</hi> of his faith, can with pertinacie hold any doctrine repugnant to the Scripture, seeing in his very beleeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, and holding it as the <hi>foundation,</hi> he doth in truth, though <hi>implicitiè,</hi> and <hi>in radice,</hi> as I may say, beleeve the flat contrarie to that error, which <hi>explicitè</hi> he professeth. And because he doth <hi>implicitè</hi> beleeve the contrarie thereof, he hath, (even all the time while he so erreth) a readinesse and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hart to professe the contrarie whensoever out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it shall bee deduced and manifested unto him.</p>
               <p n="23">23. A second way of holding those doctrines, is of them, who together with the truths, hold the errours also of their Church, <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatorie,</hi> or the like, thinking them to bee taught in Scriptures, as did the former, but adding obstinacie, or pertinacie to their holding of them, which the former did not. And their pertinacie is apparant hereby, if either they will not yeeld to the truth, being manifested out of the Scriptures unto them, or if before such manifestation, they be so addicted and wedded to their owne wills, and conceits,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7679:104"/>
that they resolve either not to heare, or if they doe heare; not to yeeld to the evidence of reason, when they are convinced by it. For it is certaine, that one may bee truly pertinacious not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after conviction, and manifestation of the truth, but even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it also, if he have a resolution not to yeeld to the authority, and weight of convincing reasons. Of this sort were all those who ever since their second <hi>Nicen</hi> Synod (about which time, the Romane Church made their first publike defection from the true and ancient faith) tooke part with that faction in the Church, which maintained the <hi>adoration</hi> of Images, and after that, <hi>Deposing</hi> of Princes, then <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and other like heresies, as they crept by degrees into the Church, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ages. From that time untill <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, the Church was like a confused lumpe, wherein both gold and drosse were mingled together: or like a great Citie infected with the plague. All as well the sicke as found, lived together within the walls, and bounds of that Citie, but all were not infected; and of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> it were, not all alike infected, with those hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diseases which then raigned, &amp; more, and more prevaled in the Church. Some openly, and constantly withstood the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and heresies of their time, and being worthy Martyrs, sealed with their blood that truth which they professed. Others dissented from the same errors, but durst not with courage, and fortitude oppose themselves; such as would say to their friends in private: Thus <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Paralip. ad. Abb.

Onely that violent, and strong faction, which pertinaciously adhered to the hereticall doctrines, which then sprung up, (the head of which faction was the Pope) and who preferred their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, before the truth, out of the Scriptures manifested unto them, and by some Councels, also decreed, as namely by that at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Constantinus Iconomachus,</hi> and that at <hi>Frankford,</hi> these I say who wilfully and maliciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, yea persecuted the truth and such as stood in defence of it, are those, who are ranked in this second order, who though they are not in proprietie of speech to bee called Papists, yet because the errors which they held are the same, which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church now maintaineth, they are truly and properly to be tearmed <hi>Popish Heretickes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. The third way of holding their doctrines, beganne with their <hi>Lateran</hi> decree, under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, at which time they held the same doctrines which they did before, but they held the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now upon another <hi>Foundation.</hi> For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they cast away the old
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7679:105"/>
and sure <hi>Foundation,</hi> and laid a new one of their owne in the roome thereof, The Popes word, in stead of Gods, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs in stead of Christs. For although the Pope long before that time, had made no small progresse in Antichristianisme, first in usurping an universall authority over all Bishops, next in upholding their impious doctrines of <hi>Adoration</hi> of Images, and the like, and after that in exalting himselfe above all Kings and Emperors, giving and taking away their Crownes at his pleasure; yet the height of the Antichristian mysterie consisted in none of these, nor did he ever attaine unto it, till by vertue of that Laterane decree he had just led out Christ and his word, and laid himselfe and his owne word in the stead thereof, for the Rocke &amp; <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Catholike faith. In the first, the Pope was but Antichrist <hi>nascent</hi>; In the second, Antichrist <hi>crescent</hi>; In the third, Antichrist <hi>regnant</hi>; but in this fourth, he is made Lord of the Catholike faith, and Antichrist <hi>triumphant</hi>; set up as God in the Church of God, ruling, nay tyrannizing, not onely in the externall and temporall estates, but even in the faith, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of all men; so that they may beleeve neither more, nor lesse, nor otherwise then he prescribeth, nay that they may not beleeve the very Scriptures themselves, and word of God, or that there are any Scriptures at all, or that there is a God, but for this reason, <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> because <hi>he saith so,</hi> and his saying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Transce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dent principle of faith,</hi> they must beleeve for it selfe, <hi>quia ipse dixit, because he saith so.</hi> In the first, and second, hee usurped the authority and place but of Bishops; in the third, but of Kings: but in making himselfe the Rocke and <hi>Foundation</hi> of faith, he intrudes himselfe into the most proper office and prerogative of Iesus Christ, <hi>For</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>other foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid, Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Here was now quite a new face of the Romane Church, yea, it was now made a new Church of it selfe, in the very es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence thereof distinct from the other part of the Church, and from that which it was before. For although most of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls,</hi> as <hi>Adoration</hi> of Images, <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and the rest, were the same, yet the <hi>Formalitie</hi> and foundation of their faith and Church was quite altered. Before they beleeved the Pope to doe rightly, in decreeing Transubstantiation, because they beleeued the Scriptures, and word of God, to teach and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that doctrine: but now <hi>vice versa</hi> they beleeve the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and word of God, to teach Transubstantiation, because the Pope hath decreed and warranted the same. Till then one might be a good Catholike, and member of their Church, such as were the Bishops in the generall Councels of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basill,</hi> and those of the fift, sixt, seventh, and succeding Councels, and yet hold the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> judgement in causes of faith to bee not onely <hi>fallible,</hi> but <hi>hereticall</hi> and accursed, as all those Councels did: But since <hi>Supremacie,</hi> and with it <hi>Infallibilitie</hi> of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7679:105"/>
judgement, is, by their <hi>Laterane</hi> decree, transferred to the Pope: he who now gainsayeth the Popes sentence, in a cause of faith, is none of their Church, as out of <hi>Gregory de Valentia, he is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,</hi> as out of <hi>Stapleton, Canus,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sup. hoc cap. nu.</hi> 7</note> declared: He may as well deny all the Articles of his <hi>Creed,</hi> and every text in the whole Bible, as deny this one point; for in denying it, he doth <hi>eo ipso,</hi> by their doctrine <hi>implicitè,</hi> and in effect, deny them all, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he rejects that formall reason, for which, and that <hi>foundation</hi> upon which, they are all to be beleeved; and without beleefe of which, not one of them all can be now beleeved.</p>

which is the worst degree of heresie, are <hi>Papists,</hi> that is, <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian heretikes</hi>; not onely holding, and that in the highest degree of pertinacy, those heresies which are contrary to the faith, but holding them upon that <hi>foundation</hi> which quite overthroweth the faith.</p>

               <p n="28">28. This may be further cleared by returning to our example of <hi>Vigilius.</hi> If, because the Pope judicially defineth a doctrine of faith, they doe therefore beleeve it, then must they beleeve Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storianisme to be the truth, and Christ not to bee God, because Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> by his judiciall and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed this, in decreeing that the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> are to be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: If they beleeve not this, then can they beleeve nothing at all,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7679:107"/>
                  <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because the Pope hath defined it; and then the <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of their faith being abolished, their whole faith, together with it, must needs be abolished also. Againe, if because the Pope defineth a doctrine, they doe therefore beleeve it; then seeing Pope <hi>Caelestine,</hi> with the Ephesine, and Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> with the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Councell, decreed Nestorianisme to be heresie, they, by the strength of their fundamental positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Popes <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> must, at one and the same time, beleeve, both Nestoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme to be truth, as Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> defined, and Nestorianisme to be heresie, as Pope <hi>Calestine</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> defined; and so they must either beleeve two contradictories to be both true, yea, to bee truths of the Catholike faith, which, to beleeve, is impossible; or else they must beleeve, that it is impossible to beleeve, either the one or the other, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because the Pope hath defined it, and so beleeve it to bee impossible to beleeve that, which is the <hi>foundation</hi> of their whole faith. Neither is this true onely in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points, but even in this very <hi>foundation</hi> it selfe: for the fift Councell, which decreed the Cathedrall and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the cause of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> to be hereticall, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the decrees of Pope <hi>Gregory, Agatho,</hi> and the rest, unto <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth. If then they beleeve a doctrine to be true, because the Pope hath defined it, then must they beleeve the Popes <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral</hi> sentence in a cause of faith, to bee, not onely falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but hereticall; and so beleeve, that upon this fallible and hereticall <hi>foundation,</hi> they can build no doctrine of faith, nor hold thereupon any thing with certainty of faith: So, if the Pope in defining such causes be <hi>fallible,</hi> then, for this cause, can they have no faith, nor beleeve ought with certainty of faith, seeing all relies upon a <hi>fallible foundation.</hi> If the Pope, in defining such causes, be <hi>infallible,</hi> then also can they have no faith, seeing, by the infallble decrees of Pope <hi>Gregory, Agatho,</hi> and the rest unto <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, the Popes Cathedrall sentence in a cause of faith, may bee hereticall, as this of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> by their judgement, was: So, whether the Pope in such causes, be <hi>falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or <hi>infallible,</hi> it infallibly followeth upon either, that none who builds his faith upon that <hi>foundation,</hi> that is, none who are members of their present Romane Church, can beleeve, or hold with certainty of faith, any doctrine whatsoever, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to beleeve.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Here I cannot chuse, but, to the unspeakeable comfort of all true beleevers, observe a wonderfull difference betwixt us, and them, arising from that diversitie of the <hi>foundation,</hi> which they and we hold; their <hi>foundation</hi> being not onely uncertaine, but <hi>hereticall</hi> and Antichristian, poysoneth all which they build thereon; it being vertually in them all, makes them all, like it selfe, uncertaine, hereticall, and Antichristian; and so those very doctrines, which, in themselves, are most certaine, and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall, by the uncertainty of that ground, upon which, and for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7679:107"/>
which they are beleeved, are overthrowne; with us, and all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes it fals out otherwise. Though such happen to erre in some one, or moe doctrines of faith, (say, in <hi>Transubstantiation, Purgatory,</hi> or, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did, in <hi>Rebaptization</hi>) yet seeing they hold those errors, because they thinke them to be taught in the Scriptures, and Word of God, on which alone their faith rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; most firmely, and undoubtedly beleeving whatsoever is taught therein; (among which things are the contrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Purgatory, &amp; Rebaptization:) such, I say, even while they doe thus erre in their Explicite profession, doe truly, though <hi>implicitè,</hi> by consequent, and <hi>in radice,</hi> or <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> beleeve, and that most firmely, the quite contrary to those errours, which they doe outwardly professe, and think they doe; but indeed doe not beleeve. The vertue and strength of that fundamentall truth, which they indeed and truly beleeve, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth all their errours, which in very deed they doe not, though they thinke they doe beleeve, whereas, in very truth, they beleeve the quite contrary. And this golden <hi>foundation</hi> in Christ, which such men, though erring in some points, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly hold, shall more prevaile to their salvation, than the Hay and Stubble of those errours, which ignorantly, but not pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously, they build thereon, can prevaile to their destruction: and therefore if such a man happen to die, without explicite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and repentance of those errours in particular, (as the saying of Saint <hi>Austen</hi>

               <p n="30">30.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7679:108"/>
defining Nestorianisme to be truth, and so Christ not to be God; it must needs be confessed, that even while they doe <hi>explicitè</hi> professe Christ to bee God, they doe <hi>implicitè, in radice,</hi> and <hi>in fundamento,</hi> deny Christ to be God: and because, by the Philosophers rule, they doe more firmely beleeve that <hi>foundation,</hi> than they doe, or can beleeve any doctrine depending thereon; it must needs ensue hence, that they doe, and must by their doctrine more firmely beleeve the Negative, that Christ is not God, which in the <hi>foundation</hi> is decreed, then they doe, or can beleeve the Affirmative, that Christ is God, which upon that <hi>foundation</hi> is builded. The truth, which upon that <hi>foundation</hi> they doe <hi>explicitè</hi> professe, cannot possibly be so strong to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the errour of the <hi>foundation,</hi> upon which they build it, will be to destruction: For the fundamentall errour is never amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by any truth superedified and laid thereon, no more than the rotten foundation of an house is made sound by laying upon it rafters of gold or silver, but all the truths that are superedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are ruinated by that fundamentall errour and uncertainty on which they all relye, even as the beames and rafters of gold are ruinated by that rottennesse and unsoundnesse which resteth in the <hi>foundation</hi>: Or if they say, that both the assertions (which are directly contradictory) are from that <hi>foundation</hi> deduced, <hi>Caelestine</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> decreeing the one, that Christ is God, as <hi>Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> decreed the other, that Christ is not God, then doth it inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, that they can truly beleeve neither the one, nor the other, seeing, by beleeving that <hi>foundation,</hi> they must equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them both, which is impossible. Such an unhappy, and wretched thing it is, to hold that erroneous, hereticall, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian foundation of faith.</p>
               <p n="31">31. My conclusion of this point is this.

Where againe I cannot but observe to the comfort of all true beleevers, another exceeding difference betwixt us and them, even in these matters concerning life, and good workes: whatsoever things are either in themselves good, or being of themselves indifferent, are by the lawfull authority either of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or ecclesiasticall governours, commanded, we in doing any of those things, and shewing our willing obedience thereunto, performe an act not onely lawfull, but laudable and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God.

On the other side, <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his Faction separated themselves from the Councell, and all that tooke part with it, for this onely reason, because they were Catholikes; because they embraced and constantly defended the Catholike faith; because he wold not cooperate (as <hi>Stapleton</hi> speaketh) with them, to maintaine the true Catholike faith, and so on their part, there was that which essentially made them Schismatickes. <hi>Baronius</hi> in saying that those who then dissented from <hi>Vigilius,</hi> were Schismatickes, speakes sutably to all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer assertions; For in saying this, he in effect saith, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to avoid a Schisme, should have turned Heretickes, should have embraced Nestorianisme, and so have renounced and condemned the whole Catholike faith, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> then did. Had they so done, they should have been no Schismatikes with <hi>Baronius</hi>: But now for not condemning the Catholike faith with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> they must all be condemned by the Cardinall, for Schismatickes.</p>
               <p n="38">38. For the very same reason, the whole present Romane Church are Schismatickes at this day; and not the Reformed Churches from whom they separate themselves. For the cause of separation on their part, is the same for which <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his schismaticall faction separated themselves from the fift Councell, and the Catholikes of those times who all tooke part with it, even because wee refuse to embrace the Popes <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall</hi> sentence in causes of faith, as the fift Councell refused that of <hi>Vigilius.</hi> The cause on our part is the same which the fift Councell then had, for that they defend the Popes hereticall <hi>constitution</hi>: nay not onely that of <hi>Vigilius</hi> (which yet were cause enough) but many other like unto that, and especially that one of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth with his Laterane Councell, wherby <hi>Supremacie</hi> and with it <hi>Infallibilitie</hi> of judgement is given unto the Pope in all his decrees of faith: In which one <hi>Cathedrall</hi> decree (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereticall by the fift Councell, and constant judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of precedent and subsequent Councells, as before we have declared) not onely innumerable heresies such as none yet doth dreame of, are included, but by the venom and poyson of that one fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall heresie, not only all the other doctrines are corrupted, but the very <hi>foundation</hi> of faith is utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.

Let them boast of multitudes, and universalitie never so much, (which at this day, is but a vaine brag) say they were far more, even foure hundreth to one <hi>Luther,</hi> or the whole kingdome of <hi>Babilon</hi> to the two witnesses of God; yet seeing it is the cause which makes a schismaticke; &amp; the cause of separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on their part is most unjust, but on ours most warrantable &amp; holy, for that they will not cooperate with us, in upholding the ancient and Catholike faith, that especially of the fift Councell, condemning and accursing the Cathedrall sentence of Pope <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> as hereticall, &amp; all that defend it, as Heretickes, it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth, that they are the only, &amp; essentially schismatickes, at this time, and in this great rent of the Church,</p>

the exact forme of vaunting and reviling. What silly men were <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiches, Nestorius,</hi> and the old heretikes? they boasted but of one or two Councells.

This, being one part of the Philistimes weapons, wherein he trusted and vanted, with his owne sword is his head, (the head and foundation of all their faith) cut off, so that of him and the whole body of their Church it may be truly said, <hi>Iacet ingens littore truncus, Avulsum<expan>

               <p n="13">13. You see now how both ancient and moderne heretikes boast of Councells, and therefore, that the reason of <hi>Baronius</hi> is most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was no heretike because hee professeth to hold the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Nay I say more, though one professe to hold the whole Scripture, yet if with pertinacy hee hold any one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine repugnant thereunto, the profession of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cannot excuse such a man from being an heretike; If it could, then not any of the old heretikes would want this pretence: or, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, seeing both Protestants and Papists make profession to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Scriptures, and whatsoever is taught therein; would this profession exempt one from heresie, neither they, nor wee, should be, or be called heretikes. But seeing in truth they are, and wee in their Antichristian language are called heretikes, as <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall beleevers in his time, were by the Nestorians, it is without question that this profession to hold the whole Scriptures, much lesse to hold one or two Councells (as <hi>Vigilius</hi> did) cannot free one from being an heretike.</p>
               <p n="14">14. You will perhaps say, can one then beleeve the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7679:115"/>
and be an heretike, or beleeve the faith decreed at <hi>Nice, Ephesus,</hi> or <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; and be an <hi>Arian, Eutychean</hi> or <hi>Nestorian</hi> heretike? No verily, for as the Scripture containeth a contradiction to every here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, seeing as Saint <hi>Austen</hi> truly saith <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de doct. Christ. ca.</hi> 9.</note>, <hi>all doctrines concerning faith, are set downe, and that also perspicuously therein:</hi> so doe every one of those three Councels containe a contradiction to every one of those three heresies, and to all other which concerne the divinity or humanity of Christ. But it is one thing to professe the scriptures, or those three Councells, and say that he beleeves them, which many heretikes may doe; and another thing to beleeve them indeed, which none can doe and be an heretike, for whosoever truly beleeveth the scriptures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly with pertinacy hold any doctrine repugnant to scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but such a man upon evident declaration that this is taught in them (though before he held the contrary) presently submits his wit and will to the truth which out of them is manifested unto him. If this he do not, he manifestly declareth, that he holds his error with perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and with an obstinate resolution not to yeeld to the truth of the scriptures, and so hee is certainly an heretike, notwithstanding his profession of the scriptures, which he falsly said he beleeved, and held, when in very truth he held, and that pertinaciously the quite contrary unto them. The very like must be said of those three Councells, and them who either truly beleeve, or falsly say, that they beleeve the faith explained in them, or any one of them.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Whence two things are evidently consequent, the former, that all heretikes are lyars in their profession: not onely because they professe that doctrine which is untrue, and hereticall, but because in words they professe to beleeve and hold that doctrine which they doe not, but hold, and that for a point of their faith, the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: All of them will and doe professe that they beleeve the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the doctrines therein contained: and yet every one of them lye herein, for they beleeve one, if not moe doctrines contrary to the scriptures. The <hi>Nestorians</hi> professed to hold the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith, and so they professed two natures and but one person to bee in Christ, for that in the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith is certainly decreed: but they lyed in making this profession, for they beleeved not one person, but pertinaciously held two persons to be in Christ. The <hi>Eutycheans</hi> in professing the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councell, professed in effect two natures to abide in Christ after the union, for this was certainly the faith of that holy Councell, but they lyed in this profession, for they held that after the union two natures did not abide in Christ, but one onely. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and members thereof professe to hold the faith of the fift generall Councell, and so professe <hi>implicitè</hi> the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> sentence in a cause of faith to be <hi>fallible</hi> and hereticall: but they lye in making this profession, for they beleeve not the Popes sentence in such causes to be fallible, but with the <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> Councels, they hold it to be <hi>infallible.</hi> It is the practice of all heretikes to make such faire, though lying professions. For should they say in plaine termes, (that which is truth indeed) wee beleeve not the scriptures, nor the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of <hi>Nice, Ephesus,</hi> or <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; every man would spit at them, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7679:116"/>
detest them, <hi>cane pejus &amp; angue,</hi> nor could they ever deceive any, or gaine one proselyte. But when they commend their faith (that is, their heresie) to be the same doctrine with the scriptures, which the Councells of <hi>Nice, Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> taught, by these faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and this lying profession, they insinuate themselves into the hearts of the simple, deceiving hereby both themselves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The other consequent is this, That the profession of all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes is contradictory to it selfe. For they professe to hold the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and so to condemne every heresie, and yet withal they professe one private doctrine repugnant to scripture, and which is an heresie. The like may be said of the Councells. The <hi>Nestorians</hi> by professing to hold the faith decreed at <hi>Nice,</hi> professe Christ to bee but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and yet withall by holding <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> they professe Christ to be two persons. The <hi>Eutycheans</hi> by professing to hold the Councell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> professe two natures to remaine in Christ after the union; which in that Councell is certainly decreed, and yet by professing the heresie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> they professe the quite contradictory, that one nature onely remaines after the union. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, by professing the faith of the fift Councell, professe the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> sentence in a cause of faith to be <hi>fallible,</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> to have beene <hi>hereticall</hi>; and yet they professe the direct contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the Councell of <hi>Laterane</hi> hath defined, that the Popes sentence in such causes is <hi>infallible,</hi> and neither hath beene nor can be <hi>hereticall.</hi> So repugnant to it selfe, and incoherent is the profession of all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, that it fighteth both with the truth, and with it owne selfe also. The very same is to be seene in <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his <hi>Constitution.</hi> For in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing to defend the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> and in decreeing that all shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, he professeth all the blasphemies of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and decreeth that all shall maintaine them, and professing to hold the faith decreed at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and decreeing that all shall hold it, hee professeth that <hi>Nestorianisme</hi> is heresie, and decreeth that all shall condemne it for heresie: and so decreeing both these, he decreeth that all men in the world shall beleeve two contradictories, and beleeve them as Catholike Truths. Such a worthy <hi>Apostolicall</hi> decree is this of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> for defending whereof <hi>Baronius</hi> doth more then toyle himselfe.</p>
               <p n="17">17. You will againe demand: Seeing <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth so earnestly and plainely professe both these, why shall not his expresse profession to hold the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> make him or shew him to bee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, rather then his other expresse profession, to defend the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> make or shew him to bee an hereticke? Why rather shall his <hi>hereticall,</hi> then his <hi>orthodoxall</hi> profession give denomination unto him? I also demand of you, Seeing every hereticke in expresse words professeth to beleeve the whole Scripture, which is in effect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of every heresie, why shall not this <hi>orthodoxall</hi> profession make or shew him to be a Catholike, rather then his expresse profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some one doctrine contrarie to Scripture (say for example sake, of <hi>Arianisme</hi>) make or shew him to bee an <hi>Arian</hi> hereticke? The
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7679:116"/>
reason of both is one and the same. Did an <hi>Arian</hi> so professe to hold the Scriptures, that hee were resolved to forsake his <hi>Arianisme,</hi> and confesse Christ to bee <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, upon manifestation that the Scriptures taught this, certainely his professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Arianisme,</hi> with such a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold the Scriptures, could not make him an hereticke, no more then <hi>Cyprians</hi> profession of Rebaptization, or <hi>Irenees</hi> of the millenarie heresie, did make them heretikes: Erre hee should, as they did, but being not pertinacious in error, hereticke hee could not be, as they were not. But it falls out otherwise with all heretickes. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to hold the Scripture, yet so that they resolve not to forsake that private doctrine which they have chosen to maintaine: That they will hold, and they will have that to be the doctrine of the Scripture, notwithstanding all manifestation to the contrarie, even of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselves. They resolve of this, that whosoever, Bishops, Councells, or Church, teach the contrarie to that, or say &amp; judge that the Scripture so teacheth, they all erre or mistake the meaning of the Scriptures. Thus did not <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nor <hi>Irenee.</hi> And this wilfull and pertinacious resolution it is, which evidently sheweth that in truth they beleeve not the Scriptures, but beleeve their own fancies, though they say a thousand times, that they beleeve and embrace whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Scriptures teach, for did they beleeve any doctrine, say <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, eo nomine,</hi> because the Scripture teacheth it, they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently beleeve the contrarie thereunto, when it were manifested unto them (as is was to the <hi>Arians,</hi> by the <hi>Nicen</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell) that the Scripture taught the contrarie to their error. Seeing this they will not doe, It is certaine that they hold their private opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>eo nomine</hi> because they will hold it; and they hold it to bee the doctrine of scripture, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so, but because they will have it to bee so, say what any will or can to the contrarie. So their owne will, and not Scripture, is the reason why they beleeve it, nay why they hold it with such a stiffe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for beleife it is not, it cannot be. This pertinacie to have beene in the <hi>Nestorians, Eutycheans</hi> and the rest, is evident. Had they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as they professed, the faith decreed at <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on manifestation of their errors out of those Councels, they would have renounced their heresies: but seeing the <hi>Nestorians</hi> persisted to hold two persons in Christ, notwithstanding, that the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> manifested unto them that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel held but one person, and seeing the <hi>Eutycheans</hi> persisted to hold but one nature after the union, notwithstanding that the whole Councell at <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> manifested unto them, that the holy <hi>Ephesine</hi> Synod held two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to abide in him after the union, they did hereby make it evident unto all, that they so professed to hold those Councels, as that they resolved not to forsake their <hi>Nestorian</hi> and <hi>Eutichean</hi> heresies for any manifestation of the truth, or conviction of their error out of those Councels, and their profession of them was in effect as if they had said, we hold those Councels, and will have them to teach what wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, whatsoever any man or Councell saith, or can say to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. The like must be said of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this cause: Had he so professed to hold the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as that upon manifestion
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7679:117"/>
that the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> were condemned by it, he would have forsaken the defence of them, then certainely his defending of these 3. <hi>Chapters</hi> had not bin pertinacious, nor should have made him an hereticke, but his profession to hold the faith decreed at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> notwithstanding his error about the 3. <hi>Chapters,</hi> should have made him a catholike. But seeing <hi>Vig.</hi> persisted to defend the 3. <hi>Chapt.</hi> though it was made evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t unto him by the Synodall judgement of the fift Councell, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of faith decreed at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> condemned them all, he by this persisting in heresie did demonstrate to all, that he professed to hold the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> no otherwise then with a pertinacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution not to forsake the defence of those <hi>Three hereticall Chapters,</hi> although the whole Church of God should manifest unto him, that the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> condemned the same: and for this cause his defending of those <hi>three Chapters,</hi> with this pertinacie and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full resolution declareth him to bee indeed an hereticke, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his profession to hold the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and faith thereof, whereby all those Chapters are condemned, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession being joyned with the former pertinacie, could not now either make or declare him to be a Catholike.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The very fame must bee said of the present <hi>Romane</hi> Church and members thereof. Did they in such sort professe to hold the fift Councel, and faith thereof, as that upon manifestation that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell beleeved, taught and decreed that the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> sentence in a cause of faith is <hi>fallible,</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> hath beene hereticall, they would condemne that their <hi>fundamentall</hi> heresie of the Popes <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall infallibilitie</hi> decreed in their <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> assemblies, then should they much rather, for their profession of the fift Councell and faith thereof, bee <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> then for professing (together with this) the Popes <hi>Cathedrall infallibilitie,</hi> bee hereticall. But seeing they know by the very Acts and judiciall sentence of that fift Councell, by which the <hi>Cathedrall Constitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is condemned and accursed for hereticall in this cause of faith, touching the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> that the fift Councell beleeved this, and decreed, under the censure of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should beleeve it, and that all who beleeve the contrary, are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes: seeing, I say, notwithstanding this manifestation of the faith of that Councell, they persist to defend the Popes <hi>Cathedrall infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in those causes, yea, defend it as the very foundation of their faith; this makes it evident to all, that they do no otherwise professe to hold this fift Councell, or the other, whether precedent, or following, (for they all are consonant to this) but with this pertinacious resolution, not to forsake that their <hi>fundamentall</hi> heresie; and therefore their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse profession of this fift, and other generall Councels, yea, of the Scriptures themselves, cannot be so effectuall to make them Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, as the profession of the Popes <hi>infallibility,</hi> which is joyned with this pertinacy, is to make and demonstrate them to be heretikes.</p>
               <p n="19">19. There is yet a further point to be observed touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy of <hi>Vigilius:</hi> For one may be, and often is pertinacious in his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, not onely after, but even before conviction, or manifestation of

See now, I pray you, how farre <hi>Vigilius</hi> was from this care of seeking, and preparation to embrace the truth. He by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authoritie decree <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Const. Vigil. apud Bar. an.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 208.</note>, that none should either write, or speake, or teach ought contrary to his <hi>Constitution</hi>; or if they did, that his decree should stand for a condemnation and refutation of whatsoever they should either write or speake. Here was a tricke of <hi>Papall,</hi> that is, of the most supreme pertinacy that can bee devised: He takes order before hand, that none shall ever, I say, not convict him, but, so much as manifest the truth unto him, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth, or write a syllable for the manifestation thereof: and so, being not prepared to bee corrected, no nor informed neither, hee was pertinacious, and is justly to bee so accounted before ever either Bishop, or Councell manifested the truth unto him. Even as he is farre more wilfully and obstinately delighted in darknesse, who dammes up all the windowes, chinkes, and passages, whereby any light might enter into the house, wherein hee is, than hee, who lyeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe, and is willing to be awaked, when the light shineth about him: So was it with Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> at this time; his tying of al mens tongues, and hands, that they should not manifest by word, or writing, the truth unto him; his damming up of the light, that never any glimpse of the truth might shine unto him, argues a mind most damnably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious in errour, and so far from being prepared and ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, that it is obdurate against the same, and will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it so much as to come neere unto him.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The very like pertinacy is at this day in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, and all the members thereof: for having once set downe this transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent principle, the <hi>foundation</hi> of all which they beleeve; that the Popes judgement, in causes of faith, is <hi>infallible,</hi> they doe by this exclude and utterly shut out all manifestation of the truth, that can possibly bee made unto them: Oppose whatsoever you will against their errour, Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, reason and sense it selfe, it is all refuted before it be proposed, seeing the Pope, who is <hi>infallible,</hi> saith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which you would prove, you, in disputing from those places, doe either mis-cite them, or mis-interpret the Scriptures, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Councels, or your reason from them is sophisticall, and your sense of sight, of touching, of tasting, is deceived, some one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or other there is in your opposition; but an errour in that which they hold, there is, nay, there can be none, because the Pope teacheth that, and the Pope, in his teaching is <hi>infallible.</hi> Here is a charme, which causeth one to heare with a deafe eare, whatsoever is opposed: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry head of <hi>Medusa,</hi> if you come against it, it stunnes you at the first, and turnes both your reason, your sense, and your selfe also, into a very stone. By holding this one <hi>fundamentall</hi> position, they are pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all their errours, and that in the highest degree of pertinacy,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7679:118"/>
which the wit of man can devise; yea, and pertinacious before all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and that also though the truth should never by any meanes be manifested unto them: For by setting this downe, they are so far from being prepared to embrace the truth, though it should be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested unto them, that hereby they have made a <hi>fundamentall</hi> law for themselves, that they never will be convicted, nor ever have the truth manifested unto them. The onely meanes in likelihood to perswade them, that the doctrines which they maintaine, are heresies, were first to perswade the Pope, who hath decreed them to bee <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> to make a contrary decree, that they are <hi>hereticall.</hi> Now although this may be morally judged, to be a matter of impossibilitie; yet, if his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse could be induced hereunto, and would so farre stoope to Gods truth, as to make such a decree; even this also could not perswade them, so long as they hold that <hi>foundation.</hi> They would say, either the Pope were not the true Pope, or that he defined it not as Pope, and <hi>ex Cathedra</hi>; or that, by consenting to such an hereticall decree, hee cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be Pope, or the like; some one or other evasion they would have still: but, grant the Popes sentence to be <hi>fallible,</hi> or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, whose <hi>infallibility</hi> they hold as a doctrine of faith, yea, as the <hi>foundation</hi> of their faith, they would not. Such, and so unconquerable pertinacy is annexed, and that essentially, to that one <hi>Position,</hi> that so long as one holds it, (and whensoever he ceaseth to hold it, hee ceaseth to be a member of their Church,) there is no possible meanes in the world to convict him, or convert him to the truth.</p>
               <p n="21">21. You doe now clearely see, how feeble, and inconsequent that Collection is, which <hi>Baronius</hi> here useth in excuse of Pope <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> for that he often professeth to defend the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the faith therein explaned: Hee did but herein that which is the usuall custome of all other heretikes, both ancient and moderne: Quit him for this cause, and quit them all; condemne them, and then, this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can no way excuse <hi>Vigilius</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heresie. They all with him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, with great ostentation to hold the doctrines of the Scriptures, of Fathers, of generall Councels, but because their profession is not onely lying, and contradictorie to it selfe, but alwayes such, as that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a wilfull and pertinacious resolution, not to forsake that heresie which themselves embrace, as <hi>Vigilius</hi> had, not to forsake his defence of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi>: Hence it is that their verbal profession of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Fathers, and Councels, cannot make any of them, nor <hi>Vigilius</hi> among them, to be esteemed <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> or Catholike: but the reall and cordiall profession of any one doctrine, which they, with such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy hold against the Scriptures, or holy generall Councels, as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> did this of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> doth truly demonstrate them all, and <hi>Vigilius</hi> among them, to be heretikes. And this may suffice for answer to the second exception, or evasion of <hi>Baronius.</hi>

This scurrility doth the Cardinall use against the most religious and prudent Emperour, and his holy and orthodoxall Edict; and hee saith, that he was <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Haec addidisse voluimus. An.</hi> 546. <hi>nu.</hi> 43.</note> willing to adde these, <hi>ad roborandam Facundi senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, to fortifie the sentence of Facundus,</hi> whereby he, with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> did defend the <hi>Three Chapters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Were one disposed to make sport with the Cardinall, himselfe here offereth a large field, wherein one may exspaciate; and seeing he useth not others as Kings, hee might expect, <hi>lege tulionis,</hi> not to bee used himselfe as a Cardinall: But because wee shall in another place more fitly convince the Cardinall, both for his reviling the Emperor, and raling at his Edict, as penned by heretikes, for this time I will but by the way observe two or three points touching this passage. The first, that <hi>Facundus</hi> by defending the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> by fortifying his defence, doe unavoydably pull upon themselves the just censure of <hi>Anathema,</hi> denounced by the holy Councell against the defenders of those Chapters, and those who are abetters of them: So, the more <hi>Baronius</hi> doth labour to fortifie the sentence of <hi>Facundus,</hi> the more he entangles himselfe in that curse of the generall Councel. The second, that both <hi>Facundus</hi> &amp; <hi>Baronius</hi> do quite mistake the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in carping at the Emperour, as if by his Edict, or in condemning those <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> he had taught or published some new doctrine of faith; he did not: He taught and commanded all others to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that true, ancient, and Apostolicall faith, which was decreed and explaned at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as both the whole fift Councell witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, which sheweth, that all those Chapters were <hi>implicite,</hi> but yet truly, and indeed condemned in the definition of faith made at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7679:120"/>
and Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> also testifieth the same, saying of this fift Councell, that it was <hi>in omnibus sequax, in every point a follower of the Councell at Chalcedon.</hi> This the religious Emperour wisely discerning, did by his imperiall edict, and authoritie (as <hi>Constantine,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> had done before him) ratifie that old and Catholike faith, which the <hi>Nestorians</hi> by defending those Chapters craftily undermined at that time. The third &amp; speciall point which I observe, is that which <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> noteth, as the cause why Pope <hi>Vigil.</hi> was so eager against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his edict. And what thinke you was it? Forsooth because, <hi>Iustinian primus</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 237.</note> 
                  <hi>legem sancivit, was the first who made a law,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Decree for condemning of those <hi>three Chapters.</hi> Had the Pope first done this, and <hi>Iustinian</hi> seconded his holinesse therein, hee had beene another <hi>Constantine,</hi> a second <hi>Theodosius,</hi> the dearest child of the Church. But for Princes to presume to teach the Pope, or make any lawes concerning the faith, before they consult with the Romane <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> or make him acquainted therewith, thats <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vel si rectum fuisset, recte non fieret, quia nulli Regum hinc ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid agere, sed solis est sacerdoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus datum.

                  <hi>piaculum,</hi> a capitall, an irremissible sinne, the Pope may not endure it. So then, is was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther zeale, not pietie, nor love to the truth, but meere stomacke and pride in <hi>Vigilius</hi> to oppose himselfe to the Emperours edict, and make an insurrection against him. A sory reason God wot for any wise man in the world, much more for the Pope, to contradict the truth and oppugne the Catholike faith. Now if <hi>Iustinian</hi> for doing this which was an act of prudence and pietie, tending wholy to the good and peace of the Church, if hee could not escape so undutifull usage at the Pope, &amp; his orators in those better times, religious Kings may not thinke it strange, to finde the like or far worse entertainment at the Popes of these dayes and their instruments, men so exact and eloquent in reviling, that in all such base and uncivill usage they goe as farre beyond <hi>Facundus, Tertullus,</hi> and them of former ages, as drosse or the most abject mettle is inferiour to refined gold. This is the first Period, and first judgement of <hi>Vigilius</hi> touching this cause of the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> in defence of which, and oppugning of the Emperours e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, hee continued more then a yeare after the publishing of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, even all that time while hee remained at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was absent from the Emperour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As soone almost as <hi>Vigilius</hi> was come to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and had saluted the Emperor, and conferred with them who stood for the Edict, he was quite another man, he changed <hi>cum caelo animum, the aire of the Emperors Court altered the Popes judgement,</hi> and this was about a yeare after <note n="o" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ibid. nu.</hi> 37.</note>, <hi>How shall not this bee a prejudice to the cause, if it bee demonstrated that Pope</hi> Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>with thirty Bishops or therabouts, have condemned the Epistle (of Ibas) approved by the Councell of Chalcedon, and anathematized that Bishop (Theodorus of Mopsvestia) with his doctrines, the praises whereof are set downe in that Councell</hi>? Thus <hi>Facundus.</hi> Besides all this, <hi>Vigilius</hi> was
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7679:120"/>
now so forward in this cause, that as before he had written bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Edict, in defence of the <hi>three Chapters</hi>; and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those who condemned those Chapters; so now on the Emperors side, he writ bookes, and gave judgement, for the condemning of those Chapters, and excommunicated some, by name, <hi>Rusticus</hi> and <hi>Sebastianus,</hi> two Romane Deacons, because they would not condemne them. <hi>None can deny</hi> saith <hi>Baronius</hi>

                     <hi>Ibid. pa.</hi> 580.</note>, that it was ratified by his <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> authority, saying, that no man may doe, <hi>contra constitutum nostrum quod ex beati Petri authoritate proferimus, against this our Constitution which we set forth by the authority of Saint Peter.</hi> The like hee testifieth, in his Epistle <note n="h" place="margin">

                  </note> to <hi>Valentinianus, We beleeve</hi> saith he, <hi>that those things may suffice the children of the Church, which we writ to Mennas, concerning the blasphemies of Theodorus of Mopsvestia and his person, concerning the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Ibas, and the writings of Theodoret against the right faith.</hi> Thus <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> consenting now with the Emperor, defending his Imperiall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and condemning the <hi>three Chapters</hi>; in all which, his profession was Catholike and orthodoxall.</p>

               <p n="9">9. Now this demonstrates that which before I touched, that though the Pope upon his comming to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> made a decree for condemning the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> yet still hee was in heart an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate lover of <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> and a defender of those Chapters, seeing for his love to them, and defence of them, he is ready not onely to bee bound, but to goe, and dye in banishment for his zeale unto them. For had he sincerely embraced the truth, (as in his former Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he professed,) why doth he now at the time of the fift Councell, disclame the same? Of all times this was the fittest to stand constanly to the faith, seeing now both the glory of God, the good and peace of the Church, the authority of the Emperor, the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of orthodoxall Bishops, and the whole Councell invited, urged, and provoked him to this holy duty. What was there or could there be to move him at this time, to defend the 3. <hi>Chapters,</hi> save only his ardent and inward love to <hi>Nestorianisme</hi>? Indeed had he continued in defence of those Chapters untill this time; and now relented or changed his judgement, it would have bin veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly suspected, that not the hatred of those chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or of <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> but either the favour of the Emperor, or the importunity of the Easterne Bishops, or the feare of exile, or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or some such punishment had extorted that sentence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession from him: But now when hee decreeth contrary to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to the generall Councell, and to his owne former and true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when by publishing this <hi>Decree,</hi> he was sure to gaine nothing, but the censure of an unconstant and wavering minded man, the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> of the whole generall Councell, and the heavy indignation of the Emperor; when he goes thus against the maine current &amp; streame of the time, who can thinke, but that his onely motive to doe this, was his zeale and love to <hi>Nestorianisme</hi>? Love <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6.</note> (specially of heresie) is strong as death. It will cause <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or any like him, when it hath once got possession of their heart, with the <hi>Baalites</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> to contemne launcing, whipping, and tearing of their flesh; yea to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light as much in <hi>Phalaris</hi> Bull, as in a bed of doune, and in the midst of all tortures to sing with him in the Orator <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p n="10">10. You see now the third period, and the third judgement of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this cause. A judgement, which being delivered <hi>ex Tripode,</hi> and with all possible circumspection, puts downe for many
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7679:122"/>
respects both the former, what hee spake the first time in defence of these <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> was spoken in stomacke, and in his heat and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler against the Emperor. What he spake the second time for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those Chapters, he did therein but temporize and curry favour with the Emperor. But what he spake now this third time, after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeares ventilating of the cause, when all heat and passion being abated, he was in cold blood, and in such a calme, that no perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did trouble his mind, or darken his judgement, that I say, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the very bottome of the heart, and from the <hi>Apostolicall</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his <hi>infallible</hi> Chaire, which to be a true and divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he like a worthy Confessor, sealed with his banishment. And of this judgement hee continued in likelihood more, but as <hi>Baronius</hi> (whom I now follow) tels <note n="c" place="margin">

Here is now the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the Popes turnings and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and often changing in this cause of faith: Concerning which this is especially to bee remembred, that whereas all the three former judgements of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> the first, when he defended those three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being in <hi>Italie,</hi> the second, when he condemned them upon his comming to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the third, when he againe defended them at the time of the Councell, and after, have all of them certaine and undeniable proofes out of antiquitie, such as the testimonies of <hi>Facundus, Victor, Liberatus,</hi> the Popes owne letters and Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with the witnesse of the Emperor, and the whole fift Councell; onely this last period, and this last change, when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the fift Councell, and condemned the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> This I say, which is the onely judgement whereby <hi>Vigilius</hi> is excused from heresie, is utterly destitute of all ancient witnesses, not any one that I can finde makes mention of this change, or of ought that can any way enforce the same, and therefore this may and must be called the <hi>Baronian</hi> change or Period, he being the first man, that I can learne of, who ever mentioned or dreamed of his change. And although this alone were sufficient to oppose to all that the Cardinall or any other can hence collect in excuse of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> reason and equitie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us to bee too credulous upon the Cardinals bare word, (which even in this one cause touching the Three Chapters, and this fift Councell, besides many the like, demonstratively to be proved untrue and false, I speake it confidently and within compasse, in six hundreth sayings at the least) yet that they may not say wee decline the force of this so pregnant an exception, we will for a little while admit and suppose it to bee true, and try, whether by this being yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto them, there can accrew any advantage to their cause, or any help to excuse either <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe, or his <hi>Constitution</hi> set forth in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> from being hereticall.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Say you <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his last decree confirmed the fift Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and approved the Catholike faith? Be it so, we deny not but that <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or any other of their Popes may decree, and have decreed a truth, thats not the doubt betwixt us and them. The question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of their Popes have at any time by his <hi>Cathedrall</hi> authoritie, and teaching, as Popes, decreed an heresie, or untruth. That Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> did so, his <hi>Apostolicall Constitution</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> is an eternall witnes against them, a monument <hi>are perennius,</hi> Had <hi>Baronius</hi> said that <hi>Vigilius</hi> never decreed the defending of those Chapters, he had fully cleared him in this matter, if he could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what he had said. But seeing undeniable records testifie, and the Cardinall himselfe with a Stentors voice proclameth, this to be the true and undoubted <hi>Constitution</hi> of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> though hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and repealed it a thousand times, yet can not this quit his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Decree from being <hi>hereticall,</hi> nor excuse their ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall chaire from being <hi>fallible.</hi> It is nothing at all materiall which of the Popes Cathedrall Decrees, the first, last, or middle bee <hi>hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call:</hi> If any one of them all bee: wee desire no more, the field is wonne.</p>

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:7679:123"/>14. Say you <hi>Vigilius</hi> by an <hi>Apostolicall decree,</hi> confirmed the fift Councell? Then did hee certainely decree that all writings defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> doe defend heresie: and that all persons who defend those Chapters, for so long time as they defend them, after the judgement of that Councell, are convicted and condemned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Then the former <hi>Constitution</hi> of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> set forth by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authoritie in the time of the Councell, in defence of those Chapters, is now by Popes <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe and by his <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> authority and <hi>infallible</hi> Chaire declared to bee <hi>hereticall</hi>; and <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> himselfe for that yeare after the Councell, is now by <hi>Vigilius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe pronounced to bee an Hereticke; yea a definer of heresie, <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> now orthodoxal decreeth himselfe to have been before heretical. Nay it further followeth, that by confirming that Councell, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, and that by an <hi>Apostolicall</hi> and <hi>infallible Decree,</hi> that all who defend the Popes <hi>Cathedrall</hi> sentence in causes of faith, to bee <hi>infallible,</hi> are convicted and accursed heretickes, for by defending that position, they do <hi>eo ipso</hi> defend that Constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> made in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> to bee true, infallible, and orthodoxall, which <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> himselfe by an infallible decree hath declared to bee erroneous, and hereticall. So far is this last and <hi>Baronian</hi> change from excusing <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this cause, that upon the admission thereof it doth inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ensue, both that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was an hereticke and a definer of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and that all who defend the Popes Cathedrall <hi>infallibitie,</hi> in causes of faith, that is, al who are members of their present Romane Church, to bee not onely heretickes, and for such condemned and accursed, but defenders also of a condemned and accursed heresie, even by the infallible judgement and decree of Pope <hi>Vigilius.</hi>

Their whole reason whereby <hi>Vigilius</hi> might bee excused, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now fully dissolved; There remaineth one point, which <hi>Baronius,</hi> and after him <hi>Binius,</hi> observeth, touching this often changing of <hi>Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>: which being a point of speciall note, I should wrong both <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> if I should over-passe the same.

               <p n="16">16. Now in stead of a better conclusion to this Chapter, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate the reader to observe with me two things touching their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this manner. The former is, what an happie thing it is to be a Pope, or have a Cardinall for his spokesman. Let <hi>Luther, Cranmer,</hi> or a Protestant make farre lesse change the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did <hi>Vigilius,</hi> what shall they not heare? An Apostate, unconstant, inconsiderate, a Chamelion, a Polipus, another Proteus, even <hi>Vertumnus</hi> himselfe. Let the Pope say and gaine say the same doctrine of faith, and then <hi>ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra</hi> define both his sayings being contradictorie, to bee not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, but <hi>infallible</hi> truths of the Catholike faith: O, It is all done with rare wisdome, with great reason, and consideration, The Pope in all this deales wisely, and that in the superlative degree. If when he is absent from the Emperor, he oppugne the truth published by the Emperors edict, It is wisely done; Kings and Emperors may not make Lawes in causes of faith, no not for the faith; The Cobler must not goe beyond his latchet. If when hee is brought before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he sing a new song, and say just as the Emperor saith, <hi>Ait, ato: Negat, nego:</hi> It is wisely done, <hi>principibus placuisse viris,</hi> for the Kings wrath is the messenger of death. If after both these bee become a meere Neutralist and Ambodexter in faith, holding communion with all sides, Catholikes, heretickes, and all, this is also an act of rare wisdome, the Pope is now become another Saint <hi>Paul, factus est om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia omnibus,</hi> with Catholikes he's a Catholike, that he may gaine Catholikes, with Heretickes, he's an Hereticke, that he may gaine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, he's all with all, that hee may gaine them all. If when the Emperor, the generall Councell, the whole Church calls for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in a cause of faith, if then hee step into his <hi>infallible</hi> Chaire, and thence by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authoritie define, that the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> that is, that Nestorianisme shall for ever bee held for the Catholike faith, O wisely done, he now drops oracles from heaven, <hi>in Cathedra sedet,</hi> the voice of God, and not of man. If, when hee is banished for his obstinacie against the truth, upon some urgent cause which then he discernes, he calls againe for his holy Trevit, and thence decrees the quite contradictorie to his former <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence, In this he's wiser then in all the rest: for by this he shews that he's more wise and powerfull then all the Prophets and Apostles ever were; They silly men could make but the one part of a contradiction to be true, but the Pope he is <hi>tanto</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">

                  <hi>potentior Prophetis, so much more wise and powerfull then all the Prophets,</hi> that hee can make both parts of a contradiction to be <hi>infallible</hi> truths; and unto which of the Prophets was it ever said, <hi>Tu es Petra</hi>? But the Pope is a Rocke indeed, a Rocke upon which you may build two contradictories in the doctrine of faith, and in them both say unto him, <hi>Tu es Petra.</hi> Such a Rocke neither the Prophets, nor Apostles, nor Christ himselfe ever was. So wise, so exceeding wise is the Pope, in all his turnings, even as wise as a wethercocke for turning with the wind and weather.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Againe, when the Pope, his instruments or Inquisitors (to whom <hi>Phalaris, Busiris,</hi> and all the heathen persecutors may yeeld)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7679:124"/>
exercise against us for maintaining the truth of God, all exquisite &amp; hellish tortures (to which the old heathenish were but <hi>ludus &amp; jocus</hi>) all which they doe must be extolled as due punishments, and just censures of the Holy Father of the holy Church, of the Holy inquisition, of the Holy house, all must bee covered with the mantle of holinesse. On the other side, when they resist the most religious lawes, or Edicts of Kings or Emperors, when <hi>Vigilius</hi> or any of them (being by an holy generall Councell declared, and condemned for an Hereticke,) are for their obstinate rebellion against the truth justly punished, though <hi>Iustinian</hi> yea Iustice it selfe, shall use rather moderate then severe correction against them; they forsooth must be accoumpted catholikes: Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sessers, &amp; holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, such as suffer for religion, for the sacred lawes, and for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith; but <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Defender of the faith, must be called <hi>Iulian,</hi> Iustice be termed <hi>Scelus</hi>

                     <hi>Vidisti Scelus, &amp;c. Bar. an.</hi> 554. <hi>nu.</hi> 2.</note>, and the Church for that cause said to bee in farre worse condition, then in the times of <hi>Nero, Dioclesian,</hi> or any of the heathen Tyrants. Such an happie thing it is to bee a Pope, or Papist, for then their wavering shall be Constancie; their rebellion, Religion and fortitude: their folly, greate and rare wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: their heresie, Catholike doctrine: and their most condigne punishments shall be crowned with Martyrdome.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The other thing which I observe, is, what a strong faith, Papists had need to have, who rely upon the Popes judgement, which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out and in, in and out so many times: who yet are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve al the Pope <hi>definitive</hi> sentences in causes of faith, that is, to speake in plaine tearmes, who are bound to beleeve two contradictories to bee both true, both of them the infallible oracles of God. Or if any of them have so weake a faith, that he can but beleeve the one, I would gladly learne of some who is an <hi>Oedipus</hi> among them, In this case of two Contradictorie <hi>Cathedrall</hi> decrees, such as were these of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> whether of the Popes definitive judgements, that is, according to their language, whether of the sayings of God is true, and whether false, or what strength the one hath, more then the other. If the Apostolicall sentence of <hi>Vigilius</hi> delivered <hi>cum omni undique cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tela,</hi> and by his Cathedrall authoritie, in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> be repealeable by a second, why may not the second (which cannot possibly have more authoritie) bee repealed by a third, and the third by a fourth, and fourth by a fift, and so <hi>in Infinitum?</hi> If the Pope after seaven yeares deliberation and ventilating of the cause, while hee is all that time in peace, and libertie, may be deceived in his judiciall and Cathedrall sentence in a cause of faith, how may wee be assured, that when some yeares after that, the tediousnesse of exile and desire of his pristine libertie and honour perswades him to make a contrary decree, he may not therein also bee deceived? If the Popes decrees made in libertie, peace and prosperity be of force, why shall not the decree of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> be an article of faith? If those free decrees may be admitted by a stronger sentence when the Pope is in banishment, how may any beleeve their <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> decrees, as doctrines of faith? For why may there not once
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7679:124"/>
againe, come some other <hi>Iustinian,</hi> into the world, (as great pitie it is but there should) who in these, or future times may minister that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne medicine to cleare the Popes judgement, and restraine, or close him up in some meaner estate, and farre lower place, whence, as out of a darke and low pit, he may discerne those coelestiall truths in the Word of God, like so many Starres in heaven, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invironed with the circumfused splendor of the Romane Court, he cannot possibly behold. If those <hi>Three Chapters</hi> were to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, why did the Pope defend them at the time of the Councell? If they were to be defended, why did he condemne them after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from exile? Nay, if the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> were <hi>orthodoxall,</hi> why did the Pope at any time first or last by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them? If they were <hi>hereticall,</hi> why did he at any time, first or last, by his <hi>Cathedrall</hi> and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence defend them? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I am here in a Labyrinth; if any of the Cardinals friends will winde mee out, he shall for ever be <hi>Theseus</hi> unto me.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Concerning which, none I thinke can judge otherwise, but that <hi>Baronius,</hi> as he is miserably infatuated in this whole cause of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi>; so, in this passage, hee was growne to that extremity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that hee seemes utterly to have beene bereft, both of common sense, and reason: For I doe constantly avouch, that in no part of all this his narration, (which, as you see, is very large and copious, and runneth, like a great streame, through divers yeares in <hi>Baronius</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals) there is any truth at al. No such Decree of <hi>Taciturnity,</hi> ever made by <hi>Vigilius</hi>; no Synod wherein it was decreed; no assent, either of <hi>Mennas,</hi> or <hi>Theodorus,</hi> or the Emperour unto it; no violating of that Decree by <hi>Mennas,</hi> or <hi>Theodorus</hi>; no excommunication of them, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops, for doing contrary to it; no hanging up of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Edict after it; no resistance made by <hi>Vigilius</hi> against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; no persecuting of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> no buffeting of him, no objecting of murder unto him; no fleeing either to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, or to <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; no thundring out from thence of his Pontificall Censures; no embassage sent from the Emperour to call him thence; no such magnanimitie in <hi>Vigilius</hi> as to refuse to returne; no recalling, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating of the Emperiall Edict by the Emperour; no submission of <hi>Mennas,</hi> or <hi>Theodorus</hi> to the Pope; no solemnizing of the <hi>Encaenia</hi> for those three Apostles at that time by <hi>Mennas</hi>; no carying of those holy reliques in a triumphing manner, and in a golden Chariot; no laying them up by <hi>Mennas</hi>; and, in a word, in that whole passage of <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> there is not so much as one dramme, nor one syllable of truth. The Cardinall from an Historian is here quite metamorphozed into a Poet, into a Fabler, and in stead of writing Annals, matters of fact, and reall truths, he guls his readers with fictitious, anile, and more than <hi>Aesopicall</hi> fables.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For the clearing whereof I will begin with the Decree it selfe, which is the ground of the whole fiction, and therefore if it bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated to bee but an idle dreame and fancie, all the rest, which hang on it like so many consequents, and appendices, will of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves fall to the ground. Nor doe I speake to disgrace this Decree, as if <hi>Baronius</hi> could gaine ought thereby, though it were admitted and granted unto him: For alas, what a poore pollicy or peece of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was this in the Pope, being a Iudge <hi>infallible,</hi> to command, and decree by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority, that for five or sixe, or, as it might have hapned, for forty or sixty yeares together, no man should speake a word in this cause of faith, neither condemne the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> nor defend the same; which is in effect, that they should neither speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, nor for Nestorianisme; neither dare to say, that Christ is God, nor, that he is not God, but suspend their judgement in them both; that for all that time none should either be Catholikes, or heretikes,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7679:126"/>
but be like <hi>Vigilius,</hi> meere Neutralists in the faith, what other wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is this but that of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> which Christ condemneth <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.15, 16.</note>? <hi>I would thou werst either hot or cold, but because thou art neither hot nor cold, it will come to passe that I will spue thee out of my mouth:</hi> what other then that which <hi>Elias</hi> reproves <note n="x" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21.</note>? <hi>Why halt yee betweene two opinions? If the Lord be God follow him, but if Baal, or Nestorianisme, be he, goe after it.</hi> By this Decree of Taciturnity <hi>Vigilius</hi> provideth that neither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe nor others should speake against the truth or condemne it. True, but that is not enough; He should have defended it also, and caused others by his instruction and example to doe the like. A neutralist, <hi>one that is not</hi>

                  <hi>with Christ, is against Christ:</hi> Hee that is not with the truth is against the truth. Silence where God commands to speake, is betraying of Gods truth. If the Heathen wise man <note n="z" place="margin">
                     <hi>Solonis lex apud A.

Nay if we well consider, even for this very decree of silence, <hi>Vigilius</hi> is to bee judged an heretike, for the whole Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> condemned <hi>Domnus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> as an Heretike, onely for this cause <note n="a" place="margin">

These three were as certainly condemned by the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as the other twelve were approved by the Councell of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> As <hi>Domnus</hi> by teaching silence in those of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> even thereby taught that men should not allow them, nor say that they might be allowed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in overthrew the faith of the Ephesine Councell, which approved them, and taught all men to approve them: Even so, <hi>Vigilius</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing silence in these <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> decreeth that none shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, or say they are to be condemned, and so overthroweth the Catholike faith which was declared at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> whereby they are all three condemned, and taught that they ought to bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If the teaching of silence in the one can make <hi>Domnus</hi> an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, certainly the decreeing of silence in the other, cannot chuse but make <hi>Vigilius</hi> an heretike. O but this decree was to continue but for a time, <hi>Vigilius</hi> would expect the assembling of a generall Councell, and then he would resolve the matter to the full. And you have seen how well he resolved it then. But what? Expect a Councell? why is not his Holinesse able to decide a doubt in faith, without a generall Councell? Is he not of himselfe infallible? Doth his infallibilitie like an Ague goe away, and come by fits upon him? Is the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel that Angel which must move the Poole in the Popes brest, before he can teach infallibly? The Pope scornes to hold his infallibility
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7679:127"/>
                  <hi>precario,</hi> by the curtesie either of the whole Church, or of any generall Councell: He is all-sufficient in himselfe, he gives to them <hi>infallibility,</hi> he receives none from them; what thinke you then was become of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his infallibility, that for deciding a doubt in faith, hee must suspend all in silence; and stay till the generall Councel be assembled, which, for ought he knew, might bee 60. or 100. yeares after? If of himselfe he was infallible, why did he hold men in suspence in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith? why did he not presently, and without the Councell infallibly decide it, and so set the Church at quiet? If of himselfe he was not infallible, how could he at the time of the Councell infallibly decide it? for they make not him or his sentence infallible, but all their infallibility is borrowed from him. So little helpe is there for them in this decree of taciturnity, (if wee should admit thereof) that in very deed, it doth many wayes prejudice their cause. It is not then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of any advantage which hence they might have, that causeth me to reject this decree, but the onely love of the truth perswadeth, nay enforceth me hereunto. For I professe I was not a little moved to see the Cardinalls Annalls so stuffed with untruths and figments, and see him also not onely by these to abuse, and that most vilely, his Readers, but even to vaunt and glory (as you have seene hee doth) in that which is, and will be an eternall ignominy unto him. But let us come to make evident the fiction of this Decree.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That <hi>Vigilius</hi> made no such decree of <hi>Taciturnitie,</hi> first the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Iustinian</hi> in his Letters to the fift generall Councell is a witnes above exception, <hi>When Pope</hi> Vigilius, saith he <note n="c" place="margin">

                  </note>, <hi>was come to this our Princely City, we did accurately manifest unto him all things touching these three Chapters, and we demanded of him what he thought hereof: and he not once or twise, but often in writing, without writing, did anathematize the same Chapters. Quod vero ejusdem voluntatis semper fuit de condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione trium Capitulorum, per plurima declaravit, and that he hath alwayes,</hi> (ever since his comming hither) <hi>continued in the same minde of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those three Chapters, he hath very many wayes declared.</hi> And after, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating some of those particulars, hee adds, <hi>Et compendiosè dicere, sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in eadem voluntate perseveravit, and to speake briefly, he hath ever since persevered in this minde.</hi> So writ and testified the Emperour. In the seventh Collation the Emperour sent <hi>Constantine</hi> the most glorious Quaestor of his Palace, unto the Synod, to deliver unto them certaine letters of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> who againe testified this from the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Councell: <hi>Vigilius,</hi> saith he <note n="c" place="margin">

                  </note>, <hi>hath very often manifested by writings his minde, that he condemneth the Three Chapters, which also without writing, he hath said before the Emperour in the presence of the most glorious Iudges, and of very many of your selves, who are here in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: et non intermisit, semper anathematizans Theodorum, and hee hath not intermitted or ever ceased</hi> (since his first comming almost to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>) <hi>to anathematize the defenders of Theodorus of Mopsvestia, and the Epistle of Ibas, and the writings of Theodoret against Cyrill:</hi> and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the letters of <hi>Vigilius</hi> unto them, he addeth, <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth by these make manifest, <hi>quod per totum tempus, eorundem trium Capitulorio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impietatem aversatur, that for this whole time</hi> (since his first consenting to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7679:127"/>
the Edict upon his comming to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> untill the assembling of the generall Councell) <hi>hee hath detested the impiety of those Three Chapters.</hi> Thus said and testified <hi>Constantine</hi> from the Emperor.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If I should say no more at all, even this one testimony being so pregnant, and withall so certaine, that there can bee no doubt but the Emperor both knew and testified the truth herein, this alone, I say, is sufficient to demonstrate the vanity of that fictitious Synod &amp; decree of <hi>Taciturnity.</hi> For seeing it is hence certaine, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> persisted and persevered to condemne the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> after the time of his consenting to the Emperors Edict, upon his comming to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> till the time of the fift Councell; it must needs be acknowledged for certaine, that in that time hee made no decree to forbid men to condemne the same; and then, not this decree of Taciturnity, which tyes all mens tongues that they shal neither defend, nor yet condemne them. And if the decree be fictitious, such as was never made, as by this testimony it is now certaine: then is the Councell fictitious wherein it was decreed, then the whole fable of <hi>Baronius,</hi> how the Emperor and <hi>Mennas</hi> violated that decree, how the Pope indured persecution for maintaining that Decree, and the other Consequents, they all are certainly fictitious, this one testimonie overthroweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. But I will adde a second reason drawne from the consideration of the observing and putting in execution this Synodall and pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Decree. For it is not to bee doubted, but if such a Decree had beene made, especially, with the consent of a Synod, and of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour also, but some one or other would have observed the same; the rather, because <hi>Baronius</hi>

               <p n="9">9. Let us begin with the Pope himselfe, who of all is most likely to have kept his owne decree; but he was so farre from observing it, that he practised the quite contrary.

So cleare and undoubted it is that the Emperor continued so constant in his condemning of these Chapters, that for every yeare since the Decree of Silence is supposed to be made, he was resolute in this cause, condemning and banishing such as consented not to the condemning of them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Whence the shamelesse untruths of the Baronian narration is demonstrated. He tells you, and tells it with a <hi>Constat,</hi> that in the next yeare before the fift Councell, the Emperour recalled his Edict, and abrogated what he had done in this cause of the 3. <hi>Chapters,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as not onely the whole generall Councell testifieth on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that hee still persisted constant in condemning of them, but <hi>Victor</hi> (one who had good reason to know these matters, as feeling the smart of the Emperors severity for his obstinacie in defending those Chapters) particularly witnesseth of that very yeare, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was so eager in maintaining his Edict, and condemning the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he both drew <hi>Firmus,</hi> the Primate of <hi>Numidia</hi> to his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and banished <hi>Macarius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem, Verecundus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nica,</hi> and <hi>Primasius</hi> another Bishop, because they would not consent to his Edict, and condemne the same Chapters. And what a brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse devise was this, that the Emperor in his 25. yeare should hang out his Edict, at Constantinople, so the Cardinall <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>orbis Catholicus,</hi> the whole Catholike Church was divided and rent into a schisme about that Edict, the one halfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, the other oppugning the same? Or what reason can the fabler give, why <hi>Vigilius</hi> should in the 25. yeare quarrell with the Emperor, rather then in the 24.23.22. in every one of which, <hi>Iustinian</hi> was the same man, constant in maintaining the truth published by his Edict? Did the hanging out of the Edict, more provoke the Popes zeale then the banishing, imprisoning of those who withstood the Edict? more then the Emperors enforcing, and compelling, <hi>omnes antistites,</hi> all the Bishops to condemne the <hi>Three Chapters</hi>? But enough of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> to manifest that he never observed this fictitious Decree of Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnitie.</p>
               <p n="14">14. After the Emperor and Pope, let us see if Catholikes, that is, those who condemned the three Chapters, did observe this Decree.

               <p n="15">15.

Among them, if anywhere, the Pope might hope to have his Decree observed. They observe it? They are silent in this cause; Nay you shall see them, after the time that this Decree is supposed to be made, to be farre more eager in defending the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> then ever they were before.

If one lifted to digresse, here were a fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to make a little sport with his Cardinalship, upon whose asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it clearely ensueth, that a Synod, even an Africane Synod (which with them is more) yea the whole Church of Africke, may (and <hi>de facto</hi> hath so done) judge, censure, excommunicate and exclude from their communion the Pope; and yet for all this, themselves at the same time may be, and have <hi>de facto</hi> beene very good Catholikes, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretickes, nor schismatickes. But of that point I have before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.

               <p n="21">21. Truly this was scarse faire and honest dealing in the Cardinall, by untruths to strive to bolster out forged Acts and writing: But the Cardinals Annals are so full of such like stuffe, that, if you divide them into foure parts, I doe constantly affirme there is no more truth in three of those foure, than you have seene to bee in this fable, which from a most base forgery, knowne also to the Cardinall for such, hee hath commended for a grave and authentike history unto us: And I should grow somewhat out of patience to see the Cardinall so grosly contradict, both the truth, and his owne writings also, but that, by my long and serious tossing of his bookes, I perceive this is so fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar a tricke with him, that, for the usuall meeting of it, I have long since forgotten to be angry with him for such pettie faults. This I hope, which hath beene declared, will serve for a caveat unto all, to take heed how they credit any matter whatsoever upon the Cardinals relation: either it is in it selfe untrue, or it springs from some untruth, or by his purpose in relating it, it is made to serve but for a pully to draw you into some untruth, <hi>aut aliquis latet dolus, either in the head or taile there is a sting,</hi> beleeve him not.

And truly I could wish so much good to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as that there might appeare some cleare, and ancient records, to testifie his renouncing of heresie, and condemning of his owne hereticall and <hi>Cathedrall decree,</hi> published in the time of the Councell, for defence of the <hi>Three Chapters:</hi> But the truth is more precious unto me than the love of <hi>Vigilius</hi> or any Pope whatsoever; &amp; because it is the truth alone which causeth me to discusse this point, I must needs confesse, that I can finde nothing at all, which can effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally induce mee to beleeve it, but there are many and pregnant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which inforce me to thinke, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> never made any such <hi>Decree</hi> or Change, as <hi>Baronius</hi> fancieth, but that this whole fourth Period and change of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> so gloriously painted out by <hi>Baronius,</hi> is nothing else but another fiction, and peece of the Cardinals owne Poetry, which, without all warrant or ground from any ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee, like a Spider, onely out of his owne braine hath woven and devised.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Vigilius</hi> made no such <hi>Decree,</hi> the reason w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
                  <hi>Bar.</hi> gives in this very case, may declare: he, to prove that <hi>Vigilius</hi> made not this decree, either during the time of the Synod, or shortly after the end thereof, hath these words <note n="e" place="margin">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7679:132"/>
that he made no such decree at al, or not a yeare after, as that he made it not within one or two moneths after the end of the Synod? with what labour, at what price would not the Bishops of the fift Synod have purchased that decree? how gladly would they have annexed it to their Acts, as the Decree of <hi>Leo</hi> is to the acts at <hi>Chalcedon</hi>? How many copies and extracts would they have taken of it, and dispersed them every where, both in the West and East, to testifie the truth of their Synodall judgement, and that the <hi>infallible</hi> Iudge had consented to their sentence, and confirmed the same. Or would they have done this within a month, and not a yeare after the end of the Synod? what odds to the point in hand can that small difference of time make in the cause? specially considering that the very Epistle of <hi>Leo</hi>

If then the Cardinalls reason bee of force to prove that hee writ not this Decree shortly after the Synod, it is altogether as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to prove he writ it not at all, nor after his returne about a year after out of exile.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Cardinall gives yet another evidence hereof, <hi>Pelagius,</hi> saith he <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 236.</note>, <hi>the successor of</hi> Vigilius <hi>did thinke it fit, that the fift Synod should bee approved, and the three Chapters condemned, moved especially hereunto by this reason, that the Easterne Church, ob Vigilij constitutum schismate scissa, being rent and divided from the Romane by reason of the Constitution of</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius, <hi>might be united unto it.</hi> How was the Easterne Church divided from the Romane in the time of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> by reason of that decree of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> if <hi>Vigilius</hi> by another decree published after it had recalled, and adnulled it? If the Popes condemning of those Chapters, and approving of the fift Councell could unite the Churches, then the decree of <hi>Vigilius</hi> (had there beene any such) would have effected that union. If the <hi>Apostolike Decree</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> could not effect it, in vaine it was for <hi>Pelagius</hi> to thinke by his approbation, which could have no more authority then <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> to effect that union.

For as they teach, and teach it with osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as a matter of great wit and subtilty, that the Pope may erre <hi>personally,</hi> or in his owne person hold an heresie, which onely hurts himselfe, and not the Church, but erre <hi>doctrinally,</hi> or judicially define an heresie he cannot, even so (to pay them with their owne coine) might it fall out at this time with <hi>Vigilius</hi>; hee being wearied with long exile, might perhaps for his owne person condemne the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and approve the Synod, which may be called a <hi>personall</hi> truth, or a personal profession in the Pope, the benefit wherof
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7679:134"/>
was onely to redound to himselfe, either to free him from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Synod, or procure the Emperors favour, &amp; goodwill, that he might returne home to his See, but that this professing (supposing he made it) was <hi>doctrinall</hi> or <hi>Cathedrall,</hi> delivered <hi>ex officio</hi> by the Pope as Pope, so that by it he entended to bind the whole Church to doe the like, neither <hi>Baronius,</hi> nor any of all his favourers can ever prove. Now were I sure that the Cardinall, or his friends, would be content with this grant of a <hi>personall</hi> truth in Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> I could be willing to let it passe for currant without further examination. But alas, they are no men of such low thoughts and lookes, their eyes are ever upon the Supremacie and <hi>Infallibilitie</hi> of the Popes judgement: As <hi>personall</hi> errors hurt them not, so <hi>personall</hi> truths helpe them not, <hi>Baronius</hi> will either have this consent of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to bee <hi>Iudiciall, Doctrinall, Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall</hi>

               <p n="8">8. The Cardinalls reasons to prove this, are three: The first is taken from the testimonie of <hi>Evagrius</hi>

                  <hi>omnes affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> they all testifie <hi>Vigilius</hi> to have assented to this fift Councell, and that by letters, or by a booke, whence the Cardinall collects, that seeing he consented not either during the time of the Synod, or shortly after, for he was sent into banishment, because he would not consent unto it, <hi>necesse est affirmare</hi>

                  <hi>id ab ipso factu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse hoc tempore, cum ab exilio solutus est, liberque dimissus; It must of necessitie be affirmed, that he consented at that time when he was freed from exile, and dismissed home to Rome.</hi> Thus <hi>Baronius:</hi> whom I will never beleeve to have been so simple and ignorant, as that he knew not, how lame, defective, and unsound this his necessarie collection was. That his <hi>Necesse est,</hi> is meerly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, it is not so good as <hi>Contingens est.</hi> That <hi>Vigilius</hi> consented by a booke, or letters, to the Synod, is certaine, none that I know makes doubt of it, and that is all that <hi>Evagrius,</hi> or any of his other witnesses affirme: but neither <hi>Evagrius,</hi> nor any one of them saith, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> consented to the Synod after the end thereof, or after he was sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to banishment: this and this onely is it which wee deny, and which <hi>Baronius</hi> undertakes to prove: but when he comes to his proofe, hee still, and that most fraudulently, omitteth this which is the principall, nay the onely verbe in the sentence. And to prove that <hi>Vigilius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Synod in condemning the three Chapters, what needed the Cardinall to cite all, or any one of the Greeke writers? The very Acts of the fift Councell doe often and expresly testifie this, <hi>Vigilius</hi> hath <note n="q" place="margin">

at those things which are noted concerning these Chapters, <hi>&amp; tam sine scriptis, quam in scriptis ea saepius condemnasse, and to have condemned the same as well by writing as by word.</hi> The whole purpose of the seventh Collation is no other but to shew out of <hi>Vigilius</hi> own writings, that he consented with the Councell in condemning the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> the very letters of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> which were read in that seventh Collation, do clearely witnesse his consent and judgement in condemning those Chapters. The Councell condemnes them, <hi>Vigilius</hi> condemnes them; Doth not <hi>Vigilius</hi> consent to, and with the Synod? Did he not <hi>per li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum, &amp; literas,</hi> expresse that assent, when his owne Epistles testifie that he condemned those Chapters, as did also the Synod: wherefore of his consent to the Synod there is no doubt. But this consent of his was before the time that the Councell made their Synodall Decree, yea before they assembled in the Synod, it was during the time of the second Period, before mentioned, shortly after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> untill the Councell met together, all that time he consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in judgement with the Councell, he condemned the Chapters, as the Councell did. But at the time of the Councell, when <hi>Vigilius</hi> should have consented also in making the Synodall <hi>Decree</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of those Chapters, then hee dissented from the Synod and published an <hi>Apostolicall Constitution</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> So he both consented and that by letters, yea by his Decree, with the Synod, and withall he dissented, and that also by his Decree, from the Synod. His consent, which the Synodall Acts doe shew and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, <hi>Evagrius</hi> and the rest who saw and therein followed the Acts, report and that truly. His dissent, which his owne <hi>Apostolicall Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> kept in their Vaticane doth shew and testifie, &amp; which in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood <hi>Evagrius</hi> saw not, nor knew thereof, they report not, but they deny it not. But for that Baronian consent after the end of the Synod, or after his exile, of that in <hi>Evagrius</hi> and the rest there is no mention, nor any small signification.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is the precedent consent of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> not that Baronian and subsequent consent, of which <hi>Evagrius</hi> and the rest intreat, which may appeare even by the very words of <hi>Evagrius. Vigilius</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>per liter as consensit Concilio, non tamen interesse voluit.</hi> He saith not, <hi>Vigilius would not be present at the Councell, but after the end of it hee consented by letters, unto it,</hi> (this is the false and corrupt glosse of <hi>Baronius</hi>) but <hi>Vigilius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Councell by his letters, but would not be present. His consent by letters was the former, his deniall to come was the later. For when <hi>Evagrius</hi> saith, <hi>consensit, sed noluit interesse,</hi> he plainely shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Vigilius</hi> might have beene present in the Councell, as well as have consented by his letters, he might, but he would not: now had his consent beene after his returne from exile, that is, an whole yeare after the end of the Councell, <hi>Vigilius</hi> could not possibly, though hee would never so gladly, have beene present in the Councell, nor would <hi>Evagrius</hi> have said, <hi>consensit sed noluit interesse,</hi> but hee should have said, <hi>consensit sed non potuit interesse, hee consented indeed with the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, but he could not be present in it,</hi> because when he consented, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod was dissolved, and ended a yeare before. The sense in <hi>Nicephorus</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:7679:135"/>
is the very same, but his words a little more cleare, <hi>Vigilius,</hi> saith he <note n="s" place="margin">

               <p n="10">10. Now whereas the Cardinall <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 554. <hi>nu</hi> 4.</note> adds, that <hi>Graeci omnes de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensione Vigilij affirment, that all Greeke writers affirme Vigilius to have consented to the Councell,</hi> it is nothing but an untrue, and vaine bragge of <hi>Baronius</hi> to downeface the truth, for <hi>Zonaras</hi> affirmes it not, nor <hi>Cedrenus</hi> (and yet both these are expresly named by the Cardinall to write this) nor <hi>Glicas,</hi> nor <hi>Constantinus Manasses,</hi> nor the Cardinalls owne <hi>Theophanes.</hi> And yet if we should admit them to say the like, or the same with <hi>Evagrius, Nicephorus,</hi> and <hi>Photius,</hi> that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Synod by a booke or letters, yet what one of all the Greek writers, yea or Latine either, can the Cardinall produce to say that which he doth, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> after the end of the Synod, or after hee was sent into banishment, consented to the Synod? That by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent letters, and judiciall sentence he consented to the same faith, which the Synod decreed, is true; this the Cardinall doth, but should not prove; but that by a subsequent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent or writing he approved the Synod after his owne exile, this none of the Cardinals witnesses af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, this the Cardinall should, but neither doth nor can prove.</p>

It was as great incongruitie and disproportion in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Constantius</hi> an Arian, to restore <hi>Liberius,</hi> then a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as for <hi>Iustinian</hi> being a Catholike Emperor, to restore <hi>Vigilius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now an hereticall Bishop.

He did not; but al that he demanded of them was this, <hi>vultis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere</hi> Vigilium, will yee have <hi>Vigilius</hi> to continue your Pope, as hee was before, or will you have <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who is here among you? A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had not then consented to the Synod, when the Emperor said this; for there was no cause, either to deprive <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> or elect any other in his roome, but his persisting in heresie; had he consented to the Synod, and condemned the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror should have done wrong unto him, to have suffered any other to have beene chosen: nay, the See being full, <hi>Pelagius</hi> could not, though all the banished Clergy had desired it, have beene chosen Bishop in his stead. Seeing then, both the Emperours words, and the answer of the Clergy, as <hi>Anastasius</hi> relateth them, doe shew, that if they had pleased they might lawfully have chosen another Pope; and seeing they could not by right have done that, unlesse <hi>Vigilius</hi> had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his pertinacious defence of heresie; even hereby it may bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that at his restoring he persisted in the same hereticall minde of which he was before, and that hee had not then consented to the Synod, nor to the condemning of those <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> So blinded was the Cardinall in this cause, that he could not, or rather would not see how his owne reason, drawne from the intreaty of <hi>Narses,</hi> and the narration of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> doth quite overthrow the conclusion which by them he intended to confirme.</p>
               <p n="14">14.

But now I must adde another answere, which I feare will bee much more displeasing to the Cardinal and his friends, and that is, that this whole narration touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exile of <hi>Vigilius</hi> after the Synod, the intreaty of <hi>Narses,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing

How did the Emperour dismisse them all, and particularly <hi>Pelagius,</hi> when <hi>Vigilius</hi> was sent home, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pelagius</hi> remained in exile till <hi>Vigilius</hi> was dead? But that which I principally collect is this: Seeing <hi>Vigilius,</hi> by the Cardinals narration, was not freed from exile, nor consented to the Synod, but at the same time when <hi>Pelagius</hi> was released; and seeing it is certaine, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Victor,</hi> that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was not freed, nor consented unto the Synod at that time, (for <hi>Vigilius</hi> was dead before <hi>Pelagius</hi> was relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) it hence certainly ensueth, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> neither was freed from exile, nor at all consented unto the fift Synod after his exile.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The other, which is indeed the speciall point, concernes the banishment of <hi>Vigilius</hi> after the end of the Synod, which <hi>Baronius</hi> so often mentioneth, and on which depends the whole fable; this banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being in very deed nothing else than a Baronian fiction; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and the onely author whom <hi>Baronius</hi> names for proofe of this banishment, is <hi>Anastasius</hi>: and because the Cardinall in good discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would name the best author, and authority which hee had; him, whose antiquity and name might gaine credit to the narration: it is not to bee doubted but <hi>Anastasius</hi> was the best, most credible, and authentike author, which the Cardinall had for this banishment: of him then <hi>Baronius</hi>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7679:139"/>
yet seeing none of all these doe mention that banishment; truly if <hi>Baronius,</hi> from the silence of two writers, might conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Anastasius,</hi> that he was a lyar in the former narration, I thinke none will deny; but <hi>à fortiori,</hi> it will follow, that seeing more than two score are silent in this matter, it may farre more justly bee said, <hi>aperti mendacij redarguitur,</hi> which is the Cardinals owne doome and words that hee bestoweth on <hi>Anastasius:</hi> and here much more fitly may the Cardinals reason take place, <hi>res adeo ignominiosa, so ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a matter</hi>; nay, so glorious a peece of martyrdome on the Popes part, as the banishment and cruell persecution of the Pope, the chiefe Bishop in the world, for such a cause, as for not assenting to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, could not have bin unknowne unto those writers, who most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently prosecute the affaires of their times, and such as concerned the Church: Nay, from the most of these wee may draw an affirmative argument also, and reason, more strongly than the Cardinall doth in his disputes. <hi>Anastasius, Aimonius, Diaconus, Platina,</hi> and divers moe of the forenamed authors, to the number at least of twenty, affirme, <hi>Vigilius</hi> was banished before the Synod, and in the life time of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>; and withall teach but one banishment of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and therefore they not onely are silent of that which the Cardinal saith, but they say the quite contrary unto him; and so, both by their silence, and by their speech refute that, as an untruth, which the Cardinal so positively and historically narrateth.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Now, as the negative kinde of arguing disproves the Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, so doth it also the Anastasian banishment, and forcibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was not at all banished, either before, or after the Councel; for there is no banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at all of <hi>Vigilius</hi> mentioned, either by <hi>Victor,</hi> or by <hi>Liberatus,</hi> or by <hi>Evagrius,</hi> or by <hi>Procopius,</hi> who all lived &amp; writ at that time, or by <hi>Photius,</hi> or by <hi>Zonaras,</hi> or by <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> or by <hi>Glicas,</hi> or by <hi>Constantinus Manasses,</hi> or by <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> or by <hi>Aimonius</hi> (though <hi>Sanders</hi> falsely affirmed them to teach this) or by <hi>Luitpran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> or by <hi>Bede,</hi> or by <hi>Krantzius,</hi> or by <hi>Mutius,</hi> or by <hi>Papirius Masso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> or by <hi>Caranza,</hi> besides others. Adde now here againe the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals words, <hi>Res adeo ignominiosa,</hi> surely so ignominious and shamefull a fact, as the banishing of a Pope, could not have beene unknowne to those who writ (as exactly as <hi>Facundus</hi> and <hi>Procopius</hi>) the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall affaires, and occurrents in their times; and therfore seeing these so many, so exact writers, mention not that Anastasian banishment of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> it may be rightly concluded, that <hi>Anastasius</hi> therin <hi>aperti men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicij redarguitur</hi>; or if none but the Cardinall may give the lye to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastasius</hi>; yet, confessing his narration to be untrue, let us leave that as a priviledge of the Cardinals, that he alone shal bestow lies, for liveries, upon <hi>Anastasius.</hi> Nay, seeing none of these Writers mention any ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment at all of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> it must further be concluded from their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> neither first nor last, neither before, nor after the Synod was banished, but that the whole narration, touching his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, is a meere fiction and fable, devised, partly by <hi>Anastasius,</hi> and partly by <hi>Baronius.</hi>

That one example had graced the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> more than twenty, nay, than twenty hundred besides, seeing by this it would have beene evident, that the Oracle of the world, the <hi>infallible</hi> Iudge had sealed the truth of that cause with his glorious ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which is a kinde of Martyrdome. <hi>Anastasius, Diaconus, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,</hi> and all the rest, who say he was banished, should have had the lye an hundred times at the Cardinals hands, for saying that he was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, either before or after the Councell, rather than Bishop <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> who then lived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and was fellow-partner in those troubles and banishments, should have beene thought either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or forgetfull to expresse that banishment of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> had there beene truly any at all.</p>

                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:7679:140"/>24. You see now the weaknesse, nay the nullity of the Cardinalls reason, even of his <hi>Achilles,</hi> drawne from the Emperours fact, in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or freeing him from exile, which he would never have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he had consented to the Synod. For, seeing we have proved that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was not at all banished, it clearly thence ensueth, that neither <hi>Narses</hi> entreated to have him freed from exile, neither did the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour upon that entreaty free him from exile, neither did <hi>Vigilius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Synod after his exile, and all the other consequents, which upon this foundation of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his exile the Cardinall builds like so many Castles in the ayre, they all of themselves doe now fall to the ground: and which I specially observe, it hence followeth, that <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> did never after the end of the fift Councell consent unto it, or to the condemning of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> either by his <hi>Pontificall</hi> decree, or by his <hi>personall</hi> profession: for the Cardinall assures us, and delivers it as a truth, which of necessity <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Necesse est af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmare. Bar. an.</hi> 554. <hi>nu.</hi> 4.</note> must bee granted, that his consent, (whether personall or pontificall) was at no other time, but when he was loosed out of banishment.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Now at that time it neither was nor could be, for there was never any such time, nor was hee at all banished, and therefore upon the Cardinals owne words we are assured that <hi>Vigilius</hi> after the end of the Synod never revoked his <hi>Constitution</hi> published in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> never after that time condemned the <hi>Three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> or consented to the Synod, either by any pontificall, or so much as by a personall profession, but that hee still persisted in his hereticall defence of the same Chapters, and subject to that censure of <hi>Anathema,</hi> which the fift Councell denounced against all the defenders of those Chapters.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Some perhaps will marvell, or demand how it should come to passe, that the Emperour, who as wee have shewed was so rigorous and severe in imprisoning, banishing, and punishing the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and such as yeelded not to the Synod, should wink at <hi>Vigilius</hi> at this time, who was the chiefe and most eminent of them all: which doubt <hi>Baronius</hi> also <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 222.</note> moveth, saying, he who published his Edict against such as contradicted him, <hi>Num Vigilio pepercit, may wee thinke he would spare Vigilius,</hi> and not banish him who set forth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution against the Emperours Edict? <hi>Minime quidem:</hi> Truly the Emperour would never spare him, saith the Cardinall. Yes, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour both would and did spare him. Belike the Cardinall measures <hi>Iustinian</hi> by his owne irefull and revengefull minde. Had the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall beene crossed and contradicted, nothing but torture, exile, or fire from heaven to consume such rebells, would have appeased his rage. <hi>Iustinian</hi> was of a farre more calme, and therefore more prudent spirit. <hi>Vigilius</hi> deserved, and the Emperour might in justice for his pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious resisting the truth, have inflicted upon him either imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or banishment, or deposition, or death. It pleased him to doe none of all these, nor to deale with the Pope according to his deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>Iustinian</hi> saw that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was but a weake and silly man, one of no constancy and resolution, a very wethercocke in his judgement concerning causes of faith: that hee had said and gainsayd the same
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7679:141"/>
things, and then by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority judicially defined both his sayings being contradictory, to be true, and truths of the Catholike faith: the Emperour was more willing to pity this imbecility of his judgement, than punish that fit of perversenesse which then was come upon him. Had <hi>Vigilius</hi> beene so stiffe and inflexible as <hi>Victor,</hi> as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratus,</hi> as <hi>Facundus</hi> were, whom no reason, nor perswasion would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to yeeld to the truth, its not to be doubted but hee had felt the Emperours indignation as well as any of them. But <hi>Vigilius</hi> like a wise man tooke part with both, he was an <hi>Ambodexter,</hi> both a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a condemner of the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> both on the Emperours side, and against him: and because hee might bee reckoned on either side, having given a judiciall sentence as well for condemning the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> as for defending them: it pleased the Emperour to take him at the best, and ranke him among the condemners; at least to winke at him as being one of them, and not punish him among the defenders of those Chapters.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Nor could the Emperour have any way provided better for the peace and quiet of the Church, than by such connivence at <hi>Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and letting him passe as one of the condemners of those Chapters. The banishing of him would have hardned others, and that far more than his consent after punishment would have gained: the former, men would have ascribed it to judgement; the latter, to passion, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his exile. But now accounting him as a condemner of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> if any were led by his authority and judgement, the Emperor could shew them, Loe here you have the judiciall sentence of the Pope for condemning the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> if his authority were despised by others, then his judiciall sentence in defence of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters could doe no hurt; and why should the Emperor banish him if he did no hurt to the cause? nay it was in a manner necessary for the Emperour to winke at him, as at a condemner of the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> for he had often testified to the Councell, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both by words and writings those Chapters, hee sent the Popes owne letters to the Synod, to declare and testifie the same: those let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as well of the Emperour as of the Pope testifying this, were inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Synodall Acts <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc.</hi> 5. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note>. Had the Emperour banished <hi>Vigilius</hi> for not condemning those Chapters, his owne act in punishing <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> had seemed to crosse and contradict his owne letters, and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall Acts. If <hi>Vigilius</hi> be a condemner of the Chapters, as you say, and the Synodall Acts record that he is, why doe yee banish him for not condemning those Chapters? If <hi>Vigilius</hi> bee justly banished as a defender of those Chapters, how can the Emperours letters and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall Acts be true, which testifie him to be one of the condemners of those Chapters? So much did it concerne the Emperors honour, and credit of the Synod, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> should not be banished at that time. <hi>Vigilius</hi> had sufficient punishment that he stood now a convicted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and anathematized heretike by the judgement of the whole and holy generall Councell: but for any banishment, imprisonment, or other corporall punishment, the Emperour in his wisedome, in his lenity thought fit to inflict none upon him. Onely he stayed him at
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7679:141"/>
                  <hi>Constantinople</hi> for one, or as <hi>Victor</hi> saith, for moe yeares after the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, to the end that before he returned, the Synodall sentence and Acts of the Councell being every where divulged, and with them, nay in them the judgement of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in condemning those Chapters as the Synod did, might settle if it were possible, the mindes of men in the truth, or at least serve for an Antidote against that poison, which either from the contrary constitution, or his personall presence when he should returne, could proceed.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And by this is easily answered all that the Cardinall and <hi>Binius</hi> collect from those great offices, gifts, rewards, and priviledges with which the Emperor graced and decked <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and so sent him home: which the Cardinall thinkes the Emperour would never have done, unlesse <hi>Vigilius</hi> had consented to the Synod, and condemned the <hi>three Chapters.</hi> Truly these men can make a mountaine of a mole-hill. There is no proofe in the world that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was so graced at his returne: no nor that the Emperour bestowed any gifts or rewards upon him at all. That which the Emperour did was the publishing of a pragmaticall sanction, wherein are contained divers very wholesome lawes, and good orders for the government of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Provinces adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The date of the sanction is in August, in the eight and twenty yeare of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and thirteene after the Cons. of <hi>Basilius,</hi> which was the next yeare after the Councell. But that <hi>Vigilius</hi> at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, there is no solid proofe; and <hi>Victor</hi>

                  </note> pompously set out the matter. Now it is true that the Emperour ordered and decreed those matters upon the entreaty of <hi>Vigilius</hi>: for so the words <hi>pro petitione Vigilij,</hi> doe make evident: but that either <hi>Vigilius</hi> entreated, or the Emperour granted this upon any entreaty which he made, either after his return out of exile, (which certainly he did not) or after the end of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, or at the time of his return (al which are the Cardinals tales with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proofe) none of the Cardinalls friends will bee ever able to make cleare. And for my owne part, till I see some reason to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I cannot otherwise thinke, but that this petition was made by <hi>Vigilius</hi> some three or foure yeares before the Councell, at which time <hi>Vigilius</hi> consented wholly with the Emperor, was in great grace and favour with him.

Or if it were admitted (whereof I can find no proofe at all) that <hi>Vigilius</hi> made, and the Emperour granted unto him this petition after the end of the Councell, yet will it not hence follow that <hi>Vigilius</hi> then consented to the Synod; for as wee have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the Emperour was not so eager, nor rigorous against <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but that upon his entreaty hee might grant to establish those Lawes, which being in themselves so commodious and behoovefull, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any entreaty, upon the consideration of those matters, would in all likelihood have enacted. And so every joynt of the Cardinalls se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason (wherein consists the very pith of his cause) drawne from the fact of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> in restoring him from exile, and dismissing him home with gifts and priviledges, being now fully dissolved by that which hath beene said, it remaineth cleere, that notwithstanding all which the Cardinall hath yet brought, there appeares no proofe nor token that <hi>Vigilius</hi> any time after the end of the Councell, either by his publike decree, as the Cardinall boasteth, or so much as by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall profession, consented to the Synod, and the condemning of the <hi>Three Chapters.</hi>

Some would thinke this to be scarce currant dealing with his own witnesse, to make him sometimes more then a thousand, sometimes lesse then a Cypher, but such are almost all the Cardinalls witnesses, they speak not so much for him in one place, as they doe against him in others, nor is he so willing to accept them in one, as he is ready to reject the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in another.

But I will let the words of <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> stand in their best value; and to see the Cardinals deduction the better, wee must consider the whole sentence of <hi>Liberatus,</hi> which is this; <hi>Vigilius</hi> writing these things (to wit, that <hi>hereticall Epistle,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Eutycheanisme</hi>) and that closely, to heretikes; continued sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, (in the See of <hi>Rome</hi>) In whom was fulfilled that testimony of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, they shall eate the fruit of their owne way,</hi> and they shall bee filled with their owne Counsells. <hi>Ab ipsa haeresi afflictus</hi> Vigilius, <hi>nec co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronatus, qualem vitae terminum suscepit, notum est omnibus: Vigilius being afflicted by that heresie, but not crowned, how hee ended his life, every man can tell.</hi> Thus <hi>Liberatus.</hi> In which words as you see, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all either of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his going into banishment, or returning out of banishment, or of his defending the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> or of his condemning the same Chapters, or of the Emperours either casting him into, or releasing him from exile, or of the fift Councell, or of the end thereof; and yet out of these words will <hi>Baronius</hi> like a very skilfull Chymick extract, both that <hi>Vigilius</hi> after the end of the fift Councell was banished for defending the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and after that banishment, consented to the Synod, and to condemne the <hi>three Chapters.</hi> And see I pray you how the Chymick distills this.

Now let any man judge whether <hi>Liberatus</hi> would have said of such an one as hee esteemed an heretike, a condemned heretike, and to dye in heresie, that hee dyed,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7679:143"/>
                  <hi>non coronatus</hi>? would he have minced and extenuated the crime of heresie, of one dying in heresie, would he not much rather have said, he dyed <hi>Damnatus, condemned,</hi> and accursed by the judgement of their owne Synod, and therefore utterly separated from God? Who ever read or heard, that one dying in heresie, was called by so friendly a title as <hi>Non coronatus</hi>?</p>
               <p n="43">43. This will most clearly appeare, if we consider that the Church and Ecclesiasticall Writers doe mention as two sorts, so also two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Catholike and Orthodoxall professors. The one is of those who are couragious and constant in defending the faith, such as joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endure torments, imprisonment, exile, and if need be, even death it selfe rather then they will renounce and forsake the faith, and these are called <hi>coronati.</hi> The other is of those who being timerous, and faint-hearted, yeeld to deny the truth, rather then they will endure torments or death for confessing the same; and yet by reason of that immortall seed which is in their hearts, they returne againe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly professe that truth from which they had before lapsed: and these are called, <hi>Non coronati,</hi> saved by repentance, and returning to the truth; but by reason of their former faintnesse, and lapsing, Not crowned. Both of these are Orthodoxall, and Catholikes, both of them placed in the blessed house of God, but not both in like blessed mansions and chambers of the house of God: <hi>For in my Fathers</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">

                  <hi>differeth from another in glory.</hi> Both of them receive an infinity of glory, but in that infinitie, the weight is unequall, and the one receives but as the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the other as the pound or talent of that glory. Both of them blessed in the Kingdome of God, but the former not blessed onely, but crowned with blessednesse, the later blessed, but not crowned; neither with the Aureall Crowne of Martyrs, nor with the Lawrell garland of Confessors, yet still, whether <hi>coronati,</hi> or <hi>non coronati,</hi> as they both dye in the profession of the Catholike faith, so are they both rewarded with eternall glory for profession of the Catholike faith. As for heretikes such as die in heresie, and out of the Catholike faith, they are to be sorted with neither of these, they have another and a quite different ranke, <hi>Classis</hi> or <hi>Predicament</hi> of their owne. They may not have that honour done unto them, as to be called <hi>non coronati,</hi> which implies that they have a part in felicity, but not the Crowne. As the Church doth justly anathematize and accurse such, so are they to be ranked in the order of those to whom Christ shall say,<note n="m" place="margin">

Hence now it doth clearly appeare, that <hi>Liberatus</hi> in saying that <hi>Vigilius</hi> dyed <hi>Non coronatus,</hi> cannot intend as the Cardinall most ignorantly collecteth, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> returned from the defence of the <hi>three Chapters</hi> to condemne the same; for that being in <hi>Liberatus</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a revolt from the truth, hee thereby had by <hi>Liberatus</hi> beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an heretike, and to dye in heresie, and so had beene in the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7679:144"/>
ranke of those who are <hi>Damnati</hi>; but <hi>Liberatus,</hi> in saying he dyed <hi>non coronatus,</hi> doth directly teach, that he dyed in defence of those <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> (which, with <hi>Liberatus,</hi> is the Catholike faith) from which hee had lapsed, and revolted before; but seeing at the time of the Councell, hee returned againe to that opinion, and therein dyed; hee was saved, (in <hi>Liberatus</hi> judgement) but not crowned: By his peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and returning to the defence of those Chapters, he got glory, but because he had so grievously lapsed before, hee lost the crowne of glory.

               <p n="37">37.

the Councell; for though hee then, by defending the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and publishing his <hi>Apostolicall Constitution</hi> for defence of them, hoped to recover the love and good opinion of the Westerne Churches; yet hee exceedingly failed of that hope. Now hee was in farre worse case than before; On one side he incurred the Emperours just indignation, and made himselfe obnoxious to deprivation, banishment, death, or whatsoever punishments may bee inflicted on pertinacious, and hereticall oppugners of the faith; which, although the Emperour in his lenity did not, nor would inflict upon him; yet what a griefe is it to have all those punishments hanging, like <hi>Damocles</hi> sword, over his head, and sure to fall upon him, if the Emperour at any time listed to breake or cut the haire? What comfort could he have, who held not onely his dignitie, but his liberty, yea, his very life at the will and pleasure of another? On another side he had incurred the heavie and just censure of the holy generall Councell, and of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, being by them adjudged and accursed for an heretike. On a third side the Westerne Churches, and the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> were so farre from honouring him as he expected, that they also, for all that, held him for no other than an unconstant and wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring person, one that turned his faith with every winde and weather: So, whereas at the first hee was beloved and honoured of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Churches, while hee defended the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> as they did; and after that was beloved and honoured of the Emperour, and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Churches, while hee, with them, condemned the <hi>Three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>: when now againe he returned to defend them, hee was contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both of the one sort and the other; they all now esteemed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him than a very Wethercocke. Now whether this, to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe forsaken and contemned by all, both friends and foes, both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and heretikes; whether this might not bee a corrasive to his heart, let any man duly consider with himselfe.

dislike thereof, or a personall consent to the fift Councell, which had decreed the contrary; but pertinaciously persisting in that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, he both lived and dyed an hereticall defender of those <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> At the first he was hereticall in defending them against the Emperours Edict: at the last he was not onely hereticall, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned heretike in defending them against the judiciall sentence of the holy generall Councell. In the middle time he had a fit of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the truth, but that was only in shew, and in appearance, that so he might temporize with the Emperour, in heart hee was (as when the time of tryall came he demonstrated himselfe) an oppugner of the truth, both against the Imperiall Edict, and Synodall judgement: And therefore, as wee found him at the first an heretike; so, for all which <hi>Baronius</hi> hath said, or could say to the contrary, we must leave him for a condemned heretike; even such a one, as not only defended, but, by his <hi>Cathedrall</hi> and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> sentence, defined heresie to be the Catholike faith.

So, by the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these men, there are at once dashed out fourteene of those, which themselves <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Conc. ca.</hi> 5.</note> doe honour by the name of holy generall Councels.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I say more, the expunging of all those fourteene Councels, doth certainly follow upon the Cardinals assertion, though it were granted, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had confirmed this fift, as it is true, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> did: For if it was (as he teacheth) neither a generall nor lawfull Synod, while the Councell continued, and for that whole time while it was an assembly of Bishops; then undoubtedly it never at any time was, nor yet is either a generall or a lawfull Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod: For after the end, and dissolution thereof, it was never extant <hi>in rerum natura</hi> againe; it was ever after that time <hi>Non ens:</hi> and being neither Synod, nor yet so much as <hi>Ens,</hi> it could not possibly be either generall or lawfull. It is a Maxime, <hi>Non entis non sunt Accidentia</hi>; If while it was extant, and while it was an assembly, it was but a conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; if then it was not gathered in Gods name, I pray you, when was
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7679:146"/>
it ever after that, gathered in Gods name? Did <hi>Vigilius, Pelagius,</hi> or <hi>Gregory,</hi> when they made it, by their approbation, a generall and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Councell; did they, like some new <hi>Aeolus,</hi> blow all the Bishops againe to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and assemble them the second time in the Popes name, that so they might be said to be gathered in Gods name? Let their Popes trie, if by all their magicall skill, or omnipotent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they can make any one of those <hi>Africane</hi> Councels under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a Generall; or make the <hi>Arimine, Syrmian</hi>; or second <hi>Ephesine,</hi> a lawfull Councell, and I will instantly yeeld, that hee may doe the like to this fift. If hee cannot doe any of the former, what vanitie was it in the Cardinall and <hi>Binius</hi> to say of this fift, that while it was extant, and <hi>Ens,</hi> it was neither a general nor lawful Councel; but some one, or some twenty yeares after, when it was <hi>non Ens,</hi> the Pope made it, with a word, both a generall and lawfull Councell? <hi>Dixit &amp; factum est:</hi> One word of his mouth makes, or unmakes what he list: Truth is, the Popes, or any other Bishops approbation, or confirmation of a Councell, or any decree thereof, after the Councell is once ended, may perhaps in the opinion of some men, gaine some more liking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Councell, or decree, than before it had, seeing now it hath the expresse consent of those Bishops, whom the other doe much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme: but the after consent, or approbation of all the Bishops in the world, much lesse of the Pope, cannot make that to bee a generall, which before, and while it was extant, was onely Provinciall; or that to be a lawfull, which before, and while it was extant, was an unlawfull Synod: Even as the Pope, and a thousand Bishops with him, cannot now make any of the foure first generall and holy Councels, to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawfull or particular Synods; and yet his power is every whit as great in annihilating that which now is, as in creating that which never was a generall or a lawfull Councell.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Say you that the fift Councell was of no authority till the Pope approved it, and unlesse he should approve it? See how contrary the Cardinals assertion is to the consenting judgement of the whole Church. Begin we with the Church of that age: <hi>Baronius</hi> tels <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 547. <hi>nu.</hi> 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 43.</note> us, <hi>that both the Emperour, the Pope, Mennas, and other Easterne Bishops, agreed to referre the deciding of this doubt about the Three Chapters, to a generall Councell.</hi> Why did none of them reason, as the Cardinall now doth, against the Councell? Why did the Pope delude them with that pretence of a generall Councel? Why did hee not deale plainly with the Emperour and the rest, who made that agreement, and say to this effect unto them? Why will yee referre this cause to the judgment of a Councell, it cannot decide this question otherwise than my selfe shall please? If they say as I say, it shall be a Councell, a lawfull, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, an holy Councell: If they say the contrary to that which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, though they have ten thousand millions of voyces, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree shall be utterly void, their assembly unlawfull, they shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee, nor bee called a generall, nor a lawfull Councell, no nor a Councell neither, but onely a Conventicle, without all authoritie in the world. Had the Emperour and the Church beleeved this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, there had beene no fift Councell ever called or assembled; nay,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7679:146"/>
there never had beene any other holy generall Councell: The Pope had beene in stead of all, and above them all. This very act then of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the judgement in this cause to a generall Councell, witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them all (even the Pope himselfe at that time) to have esteemed the sentence of the Synod to be of authority without the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to be of more authority, in case they should differ (as in this question they did) than the sentence of the Pope. This before the Councell was assembled.</p>
               <p n="6">6. At the time of the Councell, had the Church or holy Synod which represented the whole Church, beleeved their assembly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pope to be no Synod, but a Conventicle; why did they at all come together after their second Session? for they were then assured by the Pope himselfe, that he would neither come, nor send any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties unto them. Or had they beleeved that his definitive sentence would or ought to have overswayed others, so that without his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their judgement should be of no validity, why did they after the fift Session, once proceed to examine or determine that cause? For before the sixt day of their assembling, they received from Pope <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his Cathedrall and <hi>Apostolicall Constitution</hi> in that cause, inhibiting them either to write or speak (much more judicially to define) ought contrarie to his sentence: or if they did, that he by his authority had beforehand refuted and condemned the same. Seeing notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this well knowne unto them, they not onely continued their Synodall assemblies, but judicially defined that cause, and that quite contrary to the Popes judgement made knowne unto them; it is an evident demonstration, that the whole general Councell judged their assemblies both lawfull and Synodall, and their sentence of full autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even as ample as of any generall Councell, though the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his presence to the one, and expressely signified not onely his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but contradiction and condemnation of the other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What can pervicacie it selfe oppose to so cleare an evidence? or what thinke you will the Cardinall or his friends reply hereunto? Will he, or can he say, that these men who thus judged, were heretikes? They were not. The doctrine which they maintained was wholly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, <hi>consonant</hi> (as they <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coll</hi> 8.</note> professe, and as in truth it was) <hi>to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to Fathers, to the foure former generall Councells.</hi> The doctrine which they oppugned, and <hi>Vigilius</hi> then defended, was hereticall, condemned by all the former, Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes then doubtless they could not be; that, like a leprosie did cleave to <hi>Vigilius.</hi> Will he, or can he say that they were Schismatikes? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that true. For they all even then remained in the communion with the Catholike Church: yea they were by representation the true Catholike Church: I say further, they held communion even with Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe, till his owne pertinacy, and wilfull obstinacie against the true faith, severed him both from them, &amp; from the truth. In token of which communion with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> they earnestly <note n="l" place="margin">

sumus, We all doe hold communion with you, and are united unto you.</hi> Schismaticall then they could not be. So the judgement of these men being all Catholikes, and holding the Catholike communion, doth evidently prove the whole Catholike Church at that time, to have beleeved a Councell to be both generall and lawfull, though the Pope dissented from it, and by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority condemned the same, and the decree thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. After the end of the Councell did the Church then think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? Did it then judge the Councell to want authority, while it wanted the Popes approbation, or to receive authority by his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation? Who were they, I pray you, that thought thus? Certainly not Catholikes, and the condemners of these Chapters. For they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Councel and <hi>Decree</hi> thereof during the time of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and while the Pope so far disliked it, that for his refusall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto it, he endured banishment. Neither did the Heretikes who defended those Chapters, judge thus. For they, as <hi>Baronius</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 221.</note>, <hi>persisted in the defence of them, and in a rent from the others, even after Vigilius had consented to the Synod:</hi> yea among them <hi>Vigilius</hi>

So much did they dislike both the fift Councell, and all (though it were the Pope) who did approve it. Now the whole Church being at that time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into these two parts, the defenders and condemners of those Chapters, seeing neither the one nor the other judged the Synod to be generall or lawfull, because the Pope approved it; who possibly could there be at that time of the Cardinals fancie, that the fift Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell wanted all authority till the Pope approved it, and gained autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a generall and lawfull Councell by his approving of it? Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and condemners of those Chapters, embraced the Councell, though the Pope rejected it: Heretikes and defenders of those Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, rejected the Councell, though the Pope approved it. Neither of them both (and so none at all in the whole Church) judged either the Popes approbation to give, or his reprobation to take away au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from a generall Councell. Thus by the <hi>Antecedentia, Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitantia,</hi> and <hi>Consequentia</hi> of the Councell, it is manifest by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church in that age, that this fift Councell was of authority without the Popes approbation, and was not held of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by reason of his approbation.</p>
               <p n="9">9. What the judgement of the Church was, as well in the ages preceding, as succeeding to this Councell, is evident by that which we have already declared. For we have at large shewed <note n="r" place="margin">

                  </note>, that the doctrine, faith, and judgement of this fift Councell, is consonant to all former, and confirmed by all following generall Councells, till that at <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth. Whereupon it ensueth, that this
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7679:147"/>
doctrine which wee maintaine, and the Cardinall impugneth, (that neither the Popes approbation doth give, nor his reprobation take away authority from a Councell,) was embraced and beleeved as a Catholike truth, by the whole Catholike Church of all ages, till that <hi>Lateran</hi> Synod, that is, for more than 1500. yeares together.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And if there were not so ample testimonies in this point, yet even reason would enforce to acknowledge this truth. For if this fift Councell be of force and Synodall authority, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because the Pope, to wit <hi>Pelagius,</hi> approved it; then by the same reason is it of no force or Synodall authority, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because the Pope, to wit <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> rejected it. If the Popes definitive and <hi>Apostolicall</hi> reprobation cannot take away authority from it; neither can his approbation, though <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> give authority unto it. Or if they say that both are true, (as indeed they are both alike true) then seeing this fift Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is both approved by Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and rejected by Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> it must now be held both to be wholly approved, and wholly rejected: both to be lawfull, and unlawfull: both to be a generall Councell, and no generall Councell. And the very same doome must bee given of all the thirteene Councells which follow it: They all, because they are approved by some one Pope, are approved and lawfull Councels: and because they approve this fift, which is rejected by the Pope, they are all rejected, and unlawfull Councells. Such an havocke of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels doth this their assertion bring with it, and into such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable labyrinths are they driven, by teaching the authority of Councels to depend on the Popes will and pleasure.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now though this bee more than abundant to refute all that they can alledge against this fift Councell, yet for the more clearing of the truth, and expressing my love to this holy Councell, to which next after that at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> I beare speciall affection; I will more strictly examine those two reasons which <hi>Baronius</hi> &amp; <hi>Binius</hi> have used, of purpose to disgrace this holy Synod. The former is taken from the assembling; the later, from the decree of the Councell. It was assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, say <hi>Baronius</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sup. hoc cap. nu.</hi> 2.</note> and <hi>Binius, Pontifice resistente &amp; contradicente, the Pope resisting and contradicting it.</hi> Whence they inferre, that it was an unlawfull assembly, not gathered in Gods name. In this their reason, both the antecedent and consequence are unsound and untrue. Did Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> resist this Councell, and contradict the calling or assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thereof? What testimonie doth <hi>Baronius</hi> or <hi>Binius</hi> bring of this their so confident assertion? Truly none at all. What probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties yet, or conjectures? Even as many. Are not these men, think you, wise &amp; worthy disputers, who dare avouch so doubtfull matters, and that also to the disgrace of an holy, ancient, and approved Councell; and yet bring no testimonie, no probabilitie, no conjecture, no proofe at all of their saying? <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> is in stead of all.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But what will you say if <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> will prove the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? If both <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> professe, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did consent that this Councell should be held? Heare I pray you their own words, and then admire and detest the most vile dealing of these men. <hi>Hanc Synodum, Vigilius authoritate pontificia indixit,</hi> saith <hi>Binius</hi>

Councell: We knowing your desire, <hi>praedictis postulationibus annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, have consented to your petitions,</hi> that in an orderly assembly being made, wee may conferre with our united brethren about the three Chapters. I doubt not but upon such faire and undoubted records, every one will now confesse, First, that if to be gathered by the Popes consent and authority, will make a Councell lawfull, (which with them is an authentike rule) then this fift Councell is without question in this respect most lawfull: Secondly, that <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> are shamelesse both in uttering untruths, &amp; in reviling this holy Synod, which they would perswade to be unlawful, because it was assembled, the Pope resisting it; whereas this Councell to have beene assembled, with the consent (yea as they boast with the authority also) of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> not onely other Writers, but the Synodall Acts, the whole generall Councell, the letters of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and the expresse words of <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> themselves doe evidently declare.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Come now to the Consequence. Say the Pope had resisted the assembling of this Councell, was it for this cause unlawfull, was it no generall Councell? What say you then to the second Councell, of which <hi>Baronius</hi> thus writeth <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 2</note>, It was held, <hi>repugnante Damaso, Pope Damasus resisting the holding thereof.</hi> Will they blot that also out of the ranke of generall, and lawfull Synods? If not, why may not this fift also bee a generall and lawfull Synod, though <hi>Vigilius</hi> had with tooth and naile resisted the same? Shall the peevishnesse or pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Pope, or any Bishop hinder the assembling of a generall Councell, and so the publike peace and tranquillity of the whole Church? Open but this gappe, and there never should have been, nor ever shall be any generall Councell.

The saying of Cardinall <hi>Cusanus</hi> is worthy observing to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; <hi>I beleeve,</hi> saith he <note n="m" place="margin">

               <p n="15">15. Had the Cardinall pleaded against this Synod, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had not beene called unto it, hee had spoken indeed to the purpose.

So many wayes is this former objection of <hi>Baronius</hi> vaine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound, when he pretends this Councell to have beene unlawfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Pope resisted it, and the members assembled without their head: for neither did <hi>Vigilius</hi> resist their assembling, but freely and willingly consented unto it; neither was hee excluded from the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, but most undutifully absented himselfe from it: and though the members at that time wanted the Popes head-peece, yet they had his heart, his minde, and his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> direction among them, to bee a Cynosure unto them in that cause, which alone is able to supply both his personall and Legantine absence in any Councel.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The other objection of <hi>Baronius</hi> is taken from the decree of this Synod. The sentence, saith he <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 553 <hi>nu.</hi> 219.</note>, given by it, was <hi>contra ipsius decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, against the decree of Vigilius,</hi> and therefore their assembly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the name of a generall, no nor so much as of a private Synod, it was no Councell at all. Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> explaines this more fully, saying <note n="z" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Conc. ca.</hi> 11. §. <hi>Ac de.</hi>

If this rule be admitted, the Church hath for ever and inevitably lost this fift Councell, and (by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Nicen collection) the sixt, the seventh, and all that follow. And I verily am perswaded, that none can possibly excuse either <hi>Baronius,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine</hi> from this crime of expunging the fift Councell, and all which follow it, from the ranke and number of generall, or approved Councels. For it is as cleare as the sunshine at noone day, that the sentence pronounced by the fift synod was contradictory to the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and <hi>Cathedrall</hi> instruction sent by Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> into them. If
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7679:150"/>
then to define a cause contrary to the Popes instruction be a sure note of a Reprobate Councell, as they teach it to be; farewell for ever this fift, and all that follow it, or approve it: they are all by the rule of these two worthy Cardinals, Reprobated Councels, nay not so much as Councels, but meere Conspiracies or Conventicles.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Besides this, see I pray you the zeale and devotion of these men to the Catholike faith. If this Councell be for this cause a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Councell, because it followed not the instructions of Pope <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> sent unto it, then it should have beene an holy, and approved Councell, if it had followed those instructions of <hi>Vigilius</hi>; that is, if it had condemned the Councells of <hi>Nice, Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> if it had decreed <hi>Nestorianisme</hi> to be the Catholike faith, and Iesus Christ not to be God: for <hi>Vigilius</hi> be decreeing that the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> ought to be defended, instructed them thus to define and judge. Had they thus done, then, because they had followed the instructions of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> the two Cardinalls would have embraced this Councell, with both armes, have applauded, &amp; advanced it to the skies: seeing it did not so, but contradicted the Popes <hi>Apostolicall</hi> instructions at this time; fie on it, it is an unlawfull, a Reprobated Councell, nay it is no Councell at all, nor of any authority. Can any with reason judge these men to be ought else then <hi>Nestorians,</hi> then condemned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and obstinate oppugners of all ancient holy Councells, and of the Catholike faith? See the strange diversity of judgement which is in us and them. They in their hereticall dotage on the Popes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall <hi>infallibility,</hi> teach this fift holy Councell to bee a reprobated synod, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because it followed not the instructions of Pope <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi>; we on the contrary doe constantly affirme it to bee an holy and most approved synod, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because it followed not, but rejected and condemned those <hi>Cathedrall</hi> instructions of <hi>Vigilius</hi>: with us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the sixt, seventh, and all succeeding generall Councells, till that at <hi>Laterane,</hi> all former holy Councells also, to all which this Councell is consonant.

And whether had you rather with these two Cardinalls, account this fift synod an unlawfull assembly, and a reprobate Councell, because it contradicted the hereticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or with such an army of witnesses, honor it for a sacred, Oecumenicall approved Councell, though it not onely wanted the approbation, but had in plaine words the <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation <note n="z" place="margin">

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7679:152"/>
a generall Councell or Canon thereof, to be an approved Councell, or an approved Canon; and for such to bee rightly accounted, is not so easie to explane. This in an other Treatise I have at large handled, to which, if it ever see the light, I referre my selfe; yet suffer me to touch in this place so much as may serve to cleare this, and divers other doubts, which are obvious in their writings concerning this point.</p>
               <p n="25">25.

So cleare it is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever decree is made by any Councell, the same is truly and rightly said to bee confirmed by those very Bishops who make the Decree; confirmed I say, both by their joint consent in making that Decree, and by their subscribing unto it when it is made.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Vpon this confirmation or approbation of any Decree by the Bishops present in the Councell, doth the whole strength and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any Synodall decree rely; and upon no other confirmation of any Bishop whatsoever, when the Councell is generall and lawfull. For in such a Councell, lawfully called, lawfully governed, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully proceeding, as well in the free discussing, as free sentencing of the cause; there is in true account the joynt consent of all Bishops and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7679:153"/>
Ecclesiasticall persons in the whole world. No Bishop can then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that either he is not called, or not admitted with freedome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a Councell, unlesse that he be excommunicated, or suspended, or for some such like reason justly debarred. If all do come, they may and doe freely deliver their owne judgement; and that not onely for themselves, but for all the Presbyters in their whole Diocesse. For seeing the pastorall care of every Diocesse, even from the Apostles time, and by them is committed to the Bishop thereof, (all the rest being by him admitted but onely into a part of his care, and to assist him in some parts of his Episcopall function) he doth, at least (because he should) he is supposed to admit none, but such as hee knoweth to professe the same faith with himselfe: whence it is, that in his voice is included the judgement of his whole Diocesan Church, and of all the Presbyters therein: they all beleeving as he doth, speake also in the Councell by his mouth, the same that he doth. If some of the Bishops come not personally, but either depute others in their roomes, or passe their suffrage (as often they did) in the voice of their Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan, then their consent is expressed in theirs, whom they put in trust to be their agents at that time. If any negligently absent themselves, neither personally, nor yet by delegates signifying their minde, these are supposed to give a tacit consent unto the judgement which is given by them who are present; whom the others are supposed to thinke not onely to be able and sufficient without themselves to define that cause; but that they will define it in such sort as themselves doe wish and desire: for otherwise they would have afforded their presence, or at least sent some deputies to assist them in so great and necessary a service. If any out of stomack or hatred to the truth, do wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to come, because they dissent from the others in that doctrine, yet even these also are in the eie of reason supposed to give an implicit consent unto that which is decreed, yea though <hi>explicitè</hi> they doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from it. For every one doth, and in reason is supposed to consent on this generall point, that a Synodall judgement must bee given in that doubt &amp; controversie, there being no better nor higher humane Court than is that of a generall Councell, by which they may bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. Now because there never possibly could any Synodall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be given, if the wilfull absence of one or a few should bee a just barre to their sentence; therefore all in reason are thought to consent that the judgement must be given by those who will come, or who do come to the Councell, and that their decree or sentence shall stand for the judgement of a generall Councell, notwithstanding their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence who wilfully refuse to come.</p>
               <p n="27">27. If then all the Bishops present in the Councell do consent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any decree, there is in it one of those wayes which we have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, either by personall declaration, or by signification made by their delegates and agents, or by a tacit, or by an implicit consent, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting judgement of all the Bishops and Presbyters in the whole Church, that is, of al who either have judicatory power or authoritie to preach publikely; and therefore such a decree is as fully authorized, confirmed, and approved, as if all the Bishops and Presbyters in the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7679:153"/>
world had personally subscribed in this manner, I confirme this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. Hereof there is a worthy example in the third generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. No Presbyters at all were therein, not in their owne right. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Bishops were personally absent, and present onely by their Legates or Agents; as almost all the Westerne Bishops, and by name <hi>Celestine</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some, no question, upon other occasions neglected that businesse; as, it may be, the Bishops of <hi>Gangra,</hi> and of <hi>Heraclèa</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who were not at this Councell. Divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wilfully and obstinately refused to come to that holy Synod; as by name <hi>Nestorius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople, Iohn</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> and some forty Bishops, who at the same time while the holy Councell was held in the Church at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> held a Conventicle by themselves in an Inne, in the same Citie; and yet notwithstanding the personall absence of the first, the negligent of the second, and wilfull absence of the last, the holy <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist. Conc. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes. ad Imper. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Act. Con.

How was there in that decree the consent of these? Truly because they all (even all the Bishops in the world) did either personally, or by their Agents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse; or else in such a tacit and implicit manner (as wee declared) wrap up their judgement in the Synodall decree made by the Bishops present in the Councell.</p>

they be absent or present, and whether in that particular they consent or dissent. Now because there can bee no greater humane judgement in any cause of faith or ecclesiasticall matter, than is the consenting judgement of all Bishops and Presbyters, that is, of all who have power either to teach or judge in those causes; it hence clearly ensueth, that there neither is nor can be any Episcopall or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call confirmation or approbation whatsoever of any decree, greater, stronger, or of more authority, then is the judgement it selfe of such a generall Councell, and their owne confirmation or approbation of the decrees which they make; for in every such decree there is the consent of all the Bishops and Presbyters in the whole world.</p>

By this now it fully appeareth, what it is which maketh any Synod or any Synodal decree, to be, and justly to be accounted an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Synod, or an approved Synodall and Oecumenicall decree. It is not the Popes assent, approbation, or confirmation, (as they, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ground of truth doe fancy,) which at any time did, or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly can doe this. It is onely the Vniversall and Oecumenicall consent of the whole Church, and of all the members thereof, upon any decree made by a generall Councell, which truly makes that an approved decree; which generall and Oecumenicall consent or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, is shewed partly by the Episcopall confirmation of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, made by the Bishops present therein, wherein there is ever either an expresse, or a vertuall and implicite consent of all the Bishops and Presbyters, and so of all the Clergy in the world; partly by the royall and imperiall confirmation given to that decree by Christian Kings and Emperours, in which there is an implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all Laickes in the whole Church, Kings and Princes assenting not onely for themselves, but in the name of all their Lay subjects, for whom they undertake, that either they shall willingly obey that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or else by severity of punishments, be compelled thereunto. If these two confirmations, or either of them be wanting, the Councell and decree which is supposed to be made therein, is neither an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or confirmed Councell, nor decree, though the Pope send forth ten thousand Buls to approve and confirme the same: But if these two confirmations concurre in any decree of a generall and lawfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, though the Pope reprobate and reject that Councell or decree ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so often, yet is both that Councell an approved generall Councel, and the decree thereof an approved or confirmed Synodall and Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenicall decree, approved I say, and confirmed by the greatest hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority and judgement that possibly can bee, either found, or desired, even by the whole catholike Church, and every member, whether Ecclesiasticall or Laicall, therein: And whosoever after such an ample approbation or confirmation, shall at any time contradict or contemne such a Councell or decree, he doth not, nor can he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by impare the dignity and authority of it, but he demonstrates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be an heretike, or, at least, a contumacious person, insolently, and in the pride of his singularity despising that judgement of the Councell, which the whole Church, and every member thereof, yea, even himselfe also among them, hath approved.</p>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>pa.</hi> 306</note>, <hi>Foure Patriarkes being present, approved the same, and the most religious Emperour sent the Synodall Acts thereof to Ierusalem</hi>; where a Synod being assembled, all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Palestina manibus, &amp; pedibus, &amp; ore, sententiam Synodi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmarunt; they all confirmed the sentence of this Councell, with their hands, with their confessions, and full consent,</hi> except onely one <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Abyles,</hi> who thought the contrary, and therefore was put from his Bishopricke; and comming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> was swallowed up by an earthquake. So their Nicene Synod: By all which it is now cleare, that generall and appoved Oecumenicall Councels, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees thereof, may bee, and, <hi>de facto,</hi> have beene usually approved and confirmed not onely by the Pope, but by other succeding generall Councels, by Provinciall Synods, yea, by particular Bishops, who have beene absent, none of all which gave, or could give more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Councell or Synodall decree thereof, than it had before; and some of them are both in authority and dignity not once to bee compared to those Synods which they doe approve or confirme; and yet not any one of al these confirmations were needlesse, or fruitlesse.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The reason of all which may be perceived by the divers ends of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmations. These use &amp; end of the first confirmation by the Bishops present in the Councell, was judicially to determine and define the controversie then proposed, and to give unto it the full and perfect authority of a Synodall Oecumenicall decree, that is in truth, the whole strength and authority which all the Bishops and Churches in the whole world could give unto it. The use and end of the second confirmation by those Bishops, who were absent, was not judicially to define that cause, or give any judgment therein, (for this was done already, and in as effectuall a manner as possible it could bee) but to preserve the peace of the Church, and unity in faith, which could by no other meanes be better effected, than if Bishops, who had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and therefore did but <hi>implicitè,</hi> or by others, consent to those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees at the making thereof, did afterwards declare their owne expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and expresse consent to the same. Now because the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent that any Bishop was, either for authority or learning, the more likely he was, either to make a rent and schisme in the Church, if hee should dissent, or to procure the tranquility and peace of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7679:157"/>
Church, if hee should consent; hence it was, that if any Patriarke, Patriarchall Primate, or other eminent Bishop were absent at the time of the Councell, the Church and Councell did the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly labour to have his expresse consent and confirmation to the Synodall decrees: This was the cause why both the religious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Theodosius</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sacra Imper. ad Iohan. to.</hi> 5. <hi>Act. Eph. Conc. ca.</hi> 3. <hi>Cyril. Epist.</hi> 38. <hi>ad Dynatum to. eod. ca.</hi> 16.</note>, and <hi>Cyrill,</hi> with other orthodoxall Bishops, were so earnest to have <hi>Iohn</hi> Patriarke of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to consent to the holy <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesine</hi> Synod, which long before was ended; that as he had beene the ringleader to the factious conventicle, and those who defended <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> with his heresie; so his yeelding to the truth, and embracing the Ephesine Councell, which condemned <hi>Nestorius,</hi> might draw many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe the like, and so indeed it did. This was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall reason why some of the ancient Councels, as that by name of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> (for all did it not) sought the Popes confirmation to their Synodall decrees; not thinking their sentence in any cause to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, or their Councell no approved Councell, if it wanted his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or confirmation, (a fancy not dreamed of in the Church in those daies) but wheras the Pope was never personally present in any of those w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they account the 8 general Councels, the Synod thought it fit to procure, if they could, his expresse and explicite consent to their decrees, that he being the chiefe Patriarch in the Church, might by his example move all, and by his authoritie draw his owne Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archall Diocesse (as usually hee did) to consent to the same decrees; whereas, if he should happen to dissent (as <hi>Vigilius</hi> did at the time of the fift Councell) hee was likely to cause (as <hi>Vigilius</hi> then did) a very grievous rent and schisme in the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="37">37. There was yet another use and end of those subsequent confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, whether by succeeding Councels, or absent Bishops: and that was, that every one should thereby either testifie his orthodoxy in the faith, or else manifest himselfe to bee an heretike: For as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the six generall Councels, and their decrees of faith did witnesse one to be a Catholike in those doctrines; so the very refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to approve or confirme any one of those Councels, or their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of faith, was <hi>ipso facto,</hi> without any further examination of the cause, an evident conviction that he was a condemned heretike; such an one, as in the pride and pertinacie of his heart rejected that holy synodall judgement, which all the whole catholike Church, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member thereof, even himselfe also had <hi>implicitè</hi> before confirmed and approved. In which respect an heretike may truly bee called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being convicted and condemned not onely by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth, and by synodall sentence, but even by that judgment which his owne selfe had given <hi>implicitè,</hi> in the decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. The summe is this; The former confirmation by the Bishops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Synod, is <hi>Iudiciall</hi>; the later confirmation by the Bishops who are absent, is <hi>Pacificall.</hi> The former is <hi>authoritative,</hi> such as gives the whole authority to any decree: the later (whether by succeeding Councels, or absent Bishops) is <hi>Testificative,</hi> such as witnesseth them to be orthodoxall in that decree. The former, joyned to the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all confirmation, is <hi>Essentiall,</hi> which essentially makes both the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7679:157"/>
an approved Councel, &amp; all the decrees therof, approved, synodal, and Oecumenicall decrees: the later is <hi>accidentall,</hi> which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Bishop, doth much grace himselfe, but little or nothing the Synod; and being denyed by any, doth no whit at all either disgrace the Synod, or impare the dignity and authority thereof, but doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely disgrace the partie himselfe who denyeth it, and puls downe upon him, both the just censures of the Church, and those civill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which are due to heretikes or contumacious persons.</p>
               <p n="38">38. My conclusion now is this: Seeing this fift Councell was both for the calling generall, and for the proceeding therin lawfull, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; and seeing, although it wanted the Popes consent, yet it had the concurrence of those two confirmations, before mentioned; <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall</hi> and <hi>Imperiall,</hi> in which is included the Oecumenicall approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole catholike Church: it hence therefore ensueth, that as from the first assembling of the Bishops it was an holy, a lawfull, and Oecumenicall Councell; so from the first pronouncing of their sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall sentence, and the Imperiall assent added thereunto, it was an approved generall Councell, approved by the whole catholike Church; and so approved, that without any expresse consent of the Pope added unto it, it was of as great worth, dignity, and authoritie, as if all the Popes since <hi>S. Peters</hi> time had, with their owne hands sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed unto it. And this may suffice to satisfie the fourth and last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which <hi>Baronius</hi> devised to excuse <hi>Vigilius</hi> from heresie.</p>

The first, which concernes the generalitie, is, that the calling and summons to the Councell be generall and Oecumenicall; so that all Bishops be called, and when they are come, have free accesse to the same Councell, unlesse for some fault of their owne, or some just reason, they ought to bee debarred: For if the calling to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Synod bee out of some parts onely of the Church, and not out of the whole, the judgement also of such a Councell is but partiall, not generall, and the Councell is but particular, not Oecumenicall, seeing some of those who have judicatory power are either omitted, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly excluded from the Synod: The want of this was a just exception taken by the Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> against that Councell of <hi>Antioch</hi>

               <p n="10">10. Come we to the times of the Gospell. The power and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority to call Synods was ever in the Emperours and Kings, even in those three hundred years while the Church was in most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous persecution under Heathen Emperours: The right and power was in the Heathen as well as in Christian Emperours; in <hi>Tiberius</hi> as well as <hi>Theodosius</hi>; in <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> as well as in <hi>Constantine</hi> or <hi>Iustinian.</hi> But that power which they rightly had, they did not use aright: not to call Synods to maintaine the faith, but to abolish Synods, Bishops, Christians, and utterly extirpate the Christian faith. Now because Christ had layd an absolute necessity <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.16. Matth. 28.19.</note> upon the Apostles, and their successors, to feed, to teach, and maintaine the doctrine of faith; and seeing they could not doe this with the allowance, or so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence of the Emperours, who in duty should have protected them in so doing, yea have caused them so to doe; this very necessity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced them, and was a lawfull warrant unto them, both to feed the flocke, preach the Gospell, and to hold Synods in the best and most convenient manner that they then could, not onely without, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the will and command of the Emperors, that higher command of Christ over-ruling theirs. Whereby are warranted as lawfull, to say nothing of that Acts 15. those Synods at <hi>Antioch</hi> against <hi>Paulus Samosatenus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> against the <hi>Novatians</hi> in <hi>Africke,</hi> many in the time of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and divers the like.

assembled without Imperiall authority: as the times were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, so their extraordinary assembling was by those times of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity made lawfull. But as soone as Emperours began to professe the faith, and to use their owne, and Imperiall authority, in assembling Bishops for consulting about causes of faith, the Catholike Bishops knowing that from thence that law of Necessity was now expired and out of date, attempted not then to come to Synods uncalled, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to come when they were called; though sometimes they came with an assured expectance of the crowne of Martyrdome before they departed; as in the Councels of <hi>Millane, Arimine,</hi> and <hi>Syrmium,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Arrian Emperour <hi>Constantius,</hi> is most cleare.</p>

               <p n="18">18. Now these eight are all which are accounted by them in the number of generall and approved Councels, for the space of more than a thousand years after Christ: Of al which seeing it is now cleare, that they were both called by Imperiall authoritie, and governed by Imperiall Presidencie, it hence appeareth, that as by the warrant of the Scriptures, and example of the ancient Church before Christ, so also by the continued practice of the whole Catholike Church, for a thousand years together; these rights of calling and ordering gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels doe belong, and were acknowledged to belong onely to Kings and Emperours; they called and commanded the Bishops, the Bishops came at that call and command: they governed the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies in those Councels, all the Bishops (without murmuring or so much as once contradicting) willingly submitted themselves to that Imperiall government. And by this may now easily be discerned wherein the lawfulnesse or unlawfulnesse of any Synod consisteth: For wheresoever to Imperiall calling, and Imperiall Presidencie, there is added the rightfull use of that Imperiall authoritie, in seeing liberty, freedome, diligent discussion of the causes, and all due syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall order preserved in any generall Synod, the fame is, and ought to bee truly called a generall lawfull Councell: But what generall Councels soever have beene heretofore, or shall bee at any time hereafter, either assembled by any other than Imperiall, and regall authority, or governed for the observing of synodall order, by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Imperiall Presidencie, or misgoverned by the abuse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they all are, and are to bee esteemed for no other than generall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Councels.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Suffer mee here to propose some examples of each kinde, partly in the ancient, partly in the later times of the Church: In the order of lawfull generall Councels, principally, and by a certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency above all the rest, are the five first approved Councels to bee reckned: The first at <hi>Nice,</hi> the second at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the third at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the fourth at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the fift at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Iustinian</hi>; unto these the <hi>Sardicane,</hi> and that at <hi>Constantinople</hi> under <hi>Mennas,</hi> are to bee added, like two Appendant Synods; the former to that at <hi>Nice,</hi> the later to that at <hi>Chalcedon</hi>: For the sixt, which was
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7679:164"/>
held at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Constantinus Pogonatus,</hi> I am out of doubt, and doe firmely hold it to have beene both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and lawfull: But I mention it apart by reason of that scruple touching the Canons thereof, concerning which I intend, if ever I have oportunity, to make a severall tract by it selfe. For their second <hi>Nicene,</hi> and the next unto it, to wit, that at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the time of <hi>Basilius</hi> and <hi>Hadrian</hi> the second; besides that there are just excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against their lawfulnesse, in regard of the proceedings used ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it may be justly doubted whether either of them may be esteemed generall: specially considering that the Councell at <hi>Frankford</hi> utterly condemned <note n="p" place="margin">

Now although by the judgements of these two Councels, those other which they reckon for the seventh and eighth be wholy repealed, and that most justly; yet if the authority of these Synods were omitted, there are so many and so just exceptions against the two former, that I am out of doubt perswaded, that neither of them ought to stand in the order of generall lawfull Councels: nor will any, I suppose, judge otherwise, who shall unpartially examine the Acts of them, &amp; compare them with the histories of those times. If any at all after the sixt be to be ranked in the number of generall and lawfull Councells, I would not doubt to make it evident, if ever I should proceed so farre in this argument about Councels, that the Councell held at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the time of <hi>Constantinus Iconoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> (whom they in contempt have with no small token of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty nicknamed <hi>Copronimus</hi>) that this ought to bee judged the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; that at <hi>Frankford</hi> the eighth; and that at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which even now I mentioned, held in the time of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the eighth, (or as some call him, the ninth) the ninth of that order. For both the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of all these three is by the best Writers acknowledged, and all of them were called by Imperiall authority, governed by Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presidency, and that in a lawfull, free, and synodall manner; as, if ever I come to handle the Councels of those times, I purpose to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. This rather for this time I thinke needfull to observe: that as a Councell may be generall, and yet not lawfull, so may one be both generall and lawfull, and yet erroneous in the decrees thereof: which one point rightly observed, shewes an exceeding difference betwixt those five first generall Councels, with the <hi>Sardicane,</hi> and that under <hi>Mennas,</hi> and all the rest which follow the fift Synod. The former which were all held within the six hundred yeares after Christ, in the golden ages of the Church, are wholly, and in every decree and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, orthodoxall, and golden Councells, no drosse, nor dramme of corrupt doctrine could prevaile in any one of them: and so they are, and ever since they were held, were esteemed not onely generall and lawfull, but in every part and parcell of their decrees, holy and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall Councels, approved by all Catholikes, and by the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7679:165"/>
Church. But in all generall Councels which follow that fift, which were held after the 600. yeare, and in those times wherein dross and corruption began to prevaile above the gold, in them all there is some one blot or other wherewith they are blemished, and by reason whereof, although they be both generall and lawfull, yet are they not in every decree holy and orthodoxall, nor approved by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages of the Church. Such in the sixt, is the 2.52. and 53. Canons: in that under <hi>Constantinus Iconomachus,</hi> the 15. and 17. defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: in that at <hi>Frankford,</hi> their condemning of the fact of the <hi>Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clasts,</hi> which (untill the decree for breaking them downe was repealed by the Councell at <hi>Frankford</hi>) was both pious, and warranted by the example of <hi>Hezekias</hi> dealing with the brazen serpent: In that under <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8. their denying of the holy Ghost to proceed from the Son: And these examples which I have now named, are all the examples of generall and lawfull Councels, which as yet have beene held in the Church.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Wee come now to unlawfull Synods: wherein it is very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, that of such as are unlawfull by want of lawfull calling, there is no example in the ancient Church to bee found, nor more than a thousand yeares after Christ. All that time not any generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell assembled without lawfull warrant. The Bishops, no not they of Rome, were as yet growne to bee so insolent and headstrong as to come together without the Emperours <hi>Mandatum.</hi> And the very like might be said of such Synods as are unlawfull by want of Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presidency. During all that time no Bishop, no not he of <hi>Rome,</hi> durst intrude himselfe into that Royalty and Imperiall right. As the Emperour called them all for a thousand yeares, so was he by himselfe or his deputies President in them all. But of such as were unlawfull by abuse of that Imperiall presidency, those ancient times doe yeeld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant examples. Such among many was that at <hi>Millane,</hi> wherein <hi>Constantius,</hi> who should have preserved order in all others, most of all in his owne selfe used such violent and tyrannous dealing, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canon <note n="r" place="margin">

It is the authority by which those Councels were gathered, not by whose consent they were gathered; of which we doe now enquire. The authority whereby they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled was onely in the Pope, though to that authority Emperours and Kings consented: and as they are not a little brag that the Pope could doe such worthy acts by his authority; so are we so farre from denying him to have done this, that wee willingly professe the same: but withall doe affirme, which inevitably ensues thereof, that even for this very cause all those Councels are unlawfull, because they were called by Papall, and not by Imperiall authority. This demonstrates them to have assembled without lawfull authority, to have beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else than so many great Routs and Riots in the Church, so many tumultuous and disorderly Conventicles, so much more odious both in the sight of God and men, as those who tumultuously and without authority convented, should have beene patternes of piety, obedience, and order unto others.</p>

And truly it may bee easily observed by such as attentively reade the Ecclesiasticall stories, that together with the standing or fall of the Empire, either the ancient faith or heresies prevailed in the Church.

                  <hi>Gregorie</hi> the second, <hi>Zachary,</hi> and their succeeding Popes to <hi>Leo</hi> the third, had by most admirable and unexplicable fraud &amp; subtilty, clipt the wings and cut the sinewes of the Easterne Empire; themselves first seizing upon the greatest part of <hi>Italy,</hi> by the meanes of <hi>Pipin,</hi> and then erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new Empire in the West, the Imperiall authority being thus infringed, the Easterne Emperour not daring, the Westerne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the late curtesie received from the Pope, being not willing, and neither of them both being able now to match and justle with the Pope; this which was the great let and impediment to the Popes fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the discovering of the man of sinne being now removed, there was no meanes to keepe out of the Church the heresies which the Pope affected: then the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of heresies being set open, and the depths of the earth, nay of the infernall pit being burst up, heresies rusht in, and came with a strong hand into the Church, and those he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall doctrines which in six hundred yeares and more could never get head, passing as doubtfull and private opinions among a few, and falling but as a few little drops of raine, grew now unto such an height and outrage, that they became the publike and decreed doctrines in the Westerne Church. The Pope once having found his strength in the cause of Images, (wherein the first triall was made thereof) no fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie nor dotage was so absurd for which he could not after that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7679:169"/>
when he listed, the judgement of a generall Councell, Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, Proper Sacrifice, the Idoll of the Masse, (to which not <hi>Moloch</hi> nor <hi>Baal</hi> is to be compared) their Purgatorian fire, their five new-found proper Sacraments, condignity of workes, yea Superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and an armie of like heresies assayled and prevailed against the truth. The Imperiall authority being laid in the dust, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under the sole of the Popes foot, no meanes was left to restraine his enormous designes, or hinder him in Councels, to doe and define even what he listed. And as the Imperiall authority which he so long time had oppressed, is in any kingdome more or lesse restored, and freed from his vassalage; the other heresies which arose from the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and decay thereof, are more or lesse expurged out of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the ancient truth restored therein: Yea and still, though but by insensible degrees, shall hee and his authority wast <note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.8.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, till not onely all the ten <note n="b" place="margin">

You see now how unlawfull those Synods are by reason of the defect of Imperiall presidency: you will perhaps demand whether by the want thereof there happened any particular disorder in them, or ought contrary to freedome and synodall order: whereunto I might in a word answer, that there neither was, nor could there bee ought at all done in any of those ten Synods with freedome and synodall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

But the Imperiall presidency being abandoned, together with it, was all freedome and synodall orders excluded. So that I may truly say both of these <hi>Tridentine,</hi> and their other nine Synods, that as by reason of their want of this Imperiall presidency, they had many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, so by reason they excluded that Presidency, they had, nay they could have nothing in them at all but disorder.</p>
               <p n="40">40. You see now the severall kinds of unlawfull Councells, as well by want of Imperiall calling, or of Imperiall Presidency, as when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is wanting, by the abuse of that Imperiall authority in the Synod. And though the unlawfulnesse of those ten later Synods doth now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be farre greater than of those ancient Councells before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; seeing in all the ancient there was not onely a lawfull calling, but a lawfull presidency also, both which were wanting in the other tenne; besides the unlawfull proceedings which were equally in both, or rather farre worse in the later: yet is there one especiall difference that is principally to be remembred, which issuing from the former diversity of unlawfulnesse, makes a greater oddes than at the first one would imagine: and this it is: When the unlawfulnesse of any Synod ariseth (as in their tenne Synods it doth) from the want of the first condition, that is, of lawfull calling and authority to assemble and judge, be the consultations and proceedings of such Synods otherwise never so orderly, and their resolutions never so just and true, yet for making of any Canon or Decree, or giving any synodall judgement, there is an invalidity in all such Synods, and a meere nullity in all their Decrees, Canons, and Iudgements. They had no authority to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a Synod, much lesse <note n="o" place="margin">

or give judgement in that Synod. That which is invalid in the spring and originall, must needs in all the subsequent actions derived from thence, &amp; depending thereon, retain the same invalidity. And seeing it is neither multitude, nor learning, nor wisdome, but authority which is the fountain and foundation of all Lawes, Canons, and Iudgements, where this authority is wanting in any person or assembly, it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for such a person or assembly to make a law, give any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or pronounce any judiciall sentence, as to erect an house in the ayre, or build without any foundation. And truly this toucheth at the quick all those ten Councels, which wanting authority to assemble them, were no other but tumultuous, seditious, and unauthorized as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies. There was no more strength, validity, or vigour in any of their Decrees to binde as lawes, or synodall judgements, than there was in such Edicts as <hi>Spartacus</hi> and <hi>Catiline</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> in this Kingdome should have published and set forth: specially in that which he like another Pope intended to be his fundamentall law, That all lawes should proceed out of his mouth. Those which they untruly call the Canons, Decrees, or Iudgements of those Synods, are onely the opinions, resolutions, and consultations of so many seditious men which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vened and conspired together in those conjurations: synodall Decrees, or Ecclesiasticall Lawes and Iudgements they were not, they could not be. In the head, they are nipt and tainted with a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of authority, they beare this tainture and nullity throughout eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part and parcell of their determinations.</p>
               <p n="41">41. But when the unlawfulnesse of any Synod ariseth (as in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councels at <hi>Arimine, Millane,</hi> and <hi>Ephesus</hi> it did) from the want of the other condition, that is, of orderly proceedings onely, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops being both lawfully called, and having a lawfull President, the case is here farre different; their acts and sentences though they bee unlawfull, yet are they truly judiciall, and have the authority of syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall judgements, and therefore doe binde others, though not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to accept them as true, yet with patience to submit themselves to their censures, till by like authority they be revoked, and repealed. Even as in civill Courts, though an unjust or partiall Iudge, either for feare, favour, hatred, desire of lucre, or any other perturbation of minde, shall wilfully pervert justice and due proceedings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an unjust sentence: yet is this act judiciall, and stands in force of a judgement, till by the like, or higher authority it be reversed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such an one had authority and rightfull power to judge and give sentence in that cause, though he abused his authority to injustice and wrong: Right so it is in synodall and Ecclesiasticall assemblies, when they are lawfully called and authorized to heare and judge any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, their want of due, orderly, and just proceedings makes their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unjust, and shewes them to be wicked and malicious conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors against the truth, but it doth not make the decree to be no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or no judiciall sentence of a Councell. The corruption is now in the branch, not in the root: the abuse of their authority makes not a nullity in their act: It hinders not them to bee truly and rightfully Iudges, but it demonstrates them not to bee upright, good, and just
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7679:173"/>
Iudges, it shewes their sentence to be wicked and impious, but in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it not to be a judiciall sentence. Whereof that one (among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) in the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Latrociny, is a cleare example. In it <note n="p" place="margin">

Though both be unlawfull, yet in the former there was a binding force for a while, till they were repealed; but in these later there never was any power to binde any, either to accept their Decrees, or to undergoe their censures, because <hi>ab initio</hi> there was a meere nullity in all their Acts. Againe, the inflicting of any punishment upon the judgement of the former, had the warrant, though not of divine, yet of humane authority, and was to bee presumed as just, (the sentence of every Iudge, even <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because he is a Iudge, being to bee presumed just, untill upon evident proofe it bee declared to bee unjust.) But what censures or punishments soever are, or at any time have beene denounced or inflicted on any, upon the warrant or Iudgement of these last ten Synods, they are all <hi>ab initio</hi> meerely tyrannous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, inflicted without any either divine or humane authority, (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Synods had none at all) there is not so much as a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they were or could be just, but for their want of authority in decreeing them, they are (though otherwise equall) presumed to be unjust.</p>

recta dogmata conservant; Iustinian</hi> hath ever done, and as yet doth all things which preserve the holy Church, and the true faith. So the Councell. Is not <hi>Baronius</hi> minde composed of venome and malice, who condemnes and reviles the Emperour, as bringing hellish confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into the Church, by publishing that law, which to have beene an especiall meanes to preserve the Church and Catholike faith, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generall Councell, and all the whole Catholike Church with it proclameth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. See here againe the love and respect which <hi>Baronius</hi> beares to the Imperiall lawes, and to those holy and religious Emperors, which were the nursing fathers of Gods Church, and pillers to uphold the faith in their dayes. There are extant in the Theodosian Code many laws co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Catholike faith; concerning <hi>Bish. Churches,</hi> and <hi>the Clergy</hi>; concerning <hi>Heretikes, Apostates, Monkes, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Samaritanes</hi>; concerning <hi>Pagan sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Temples</hi>; concerning <hi>Religion, Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall judgement, those who flee unto Churches,</hi> and many other of the same kinde: lawes wholesome and necessary for those times. The like titles are extant also in the Code of <hi>Iustinian.</hi> In the Authenticks there are I know not how many lawes in the like causes: Of <hi>the foure Councels, of the Order of Patriarchs, of the building of Churches; of goods belonging to sacred places; Of the holy Communion, of Litanies, of the memorials for the dead, of the Priviledges of Churches, of Patriarchs, of the Pope of old Rome, of Archbishops, of Abbots, of Presbyters, of Deacons, of Subdeacons, of Monkes, of Anchorites, of Synods, of deposing Bishops who fall into heresie, that Patrons who builded Churches, and their heyers shall nominate the Clerks for the same; and in case they name such as are unmeet, then the Bishop to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point who he thinks fit, that Heretikes shall be uncapable of any legacies: and exceeding many the like.</hi> Now such a spite hath the Cardinall to the Emperours, and these their Imperiall lawes, made concerning the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Church, that like some new <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> with one dash of his pen, hee takes upon him to casheire, and utterly abolish those lawes, (five or sixe hundreth at the least, with such care, piety, and prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, set forth by <hi>Constantine, Theodosius, Valentinian, Gratian, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Iustinian,</hi> and other holy and religious Emperours: And when these are gone, whether the Cardinall meant not after them, to wipe away (which with as good reason, and authority he may) all the other lawes, which are in the Digest, Code, and Authenticks, that so his master the Pope may play even another Iack Cade, that all law might proceed out of his mouth, let the judicious consider. This is cleare, that the Cardinals malice is not satisfied with reproofe of the lawes themselves: even these holy Emperors <hi>Constantine, Theodosius</hi> and the rest, are, together with <hi>Iustinian,</hi> for the making of those lawes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ecclesiasticall affaires and persons, reproved, nay reviled by <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> as having beene <hi>presumptuous persons, authors of an hellish confusion in the Church, and for turning heaven into hell.

Hee was poore, yea most poore, Expers penitus literarum,</hi> Vtterly voyd of learning, <hi>not able to reade his very A. b. c. and yet hee would seeme to be more learned than all Bishops: so he was a poore man proud.

                  <hi>The rich man spake, and all held their peace.

               <p n="11">11. Verily I know not where either to begin or make an end in this matter, nor how it is possible for any man with sufficient gravity and severity to castigate the Cardinals insolent, inhumane, unchristian demenour against the most renowned and religious Emperour. Did any of those worthy professours of the civill lawes, but halfe so much abound with leasure, as they doe with excellency of wit and learning, I doubt not but they would (as I doe heartily wish) undertake so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a service, not onely to <hi>Iustinian,</hi> but unto GOD and his Church, as in a just volume to vindicate the Emperours honour from these so many, so malicious, so base &amp; immodest calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nies of this <hi>Rhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secha.</hi> A worke not very laborious, seeing as on the Emperours part there is such abundant store and variety of all vertues and praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy actions to set forth his honour, as no mans stile nor words can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall or come neare the same: so on <hi>Baronius</hi> part, with whom hee is
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7679:178"/>
to contend, there are so many shamelesse and detestable untruths, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther devised, or applauded by him, that <hi>Voraginensis</hi> himselfe may seeme inferiour to him in this kinde; and I much doubt, whether so many voluminous bookes, as might equall any two Tomes of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, could bee able to comprehend them all: Meane while that I seeme not to shuffle this burden from mine own to other mens shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I will, with their good leave, I hope, adde somewhat out of those bookes which concerne my own profession, and out of my shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low reading indeavour to free the Emperour from those most disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable imputations of the Cardinall.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Let us then begin with that which is the substance and ground of this whole accusation, and that is, <hi>The Emperours supposed falling into heresie, and writing that hereticall Edict:</hi> This if we can prove to bee a slander and untruth, all the rest, which the Cardinall builds upon this, and derives from it, will of themselves fall to the ground. First then I doe constantly avouch that imputation of heresie to bee untrue: <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> neither held that fantasticall heresie of the <hi>Aphthardokites,</hi> nor made any Edict for the defence or propagating thereof, nor did hee banish or persecute any Orthodoxall Bishop for contradicting that heresie: All these are slanderous untruths which the Cardinall hath collected out of others, and maliciously uttered in disgrace of the Emperour: And truly, that very contradiction which is not onely in other writers, but in the Cardinall himselfe, in setting downe this narration, is no small presumption of the untruth thereof. <note n="d" place="margin">

                     <hi>An.</hi> 564. <hi>nu.</hi> 1.</note> saying, <hi>Iustinian when he saw his Edict, contemni ab Orthodoxis, &amp; pro nihilo duci</hi>; to bee contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and set at nought by the Orthodoxall Bishops, <hi>then hee raised his persecution.</hi> How could that Edict be contemned, unlesse it had been published &amp; set forth for an Edict? or how could they be banished for gainsaying that Edict, which if it was not published, had not the force of an Edict? Againe, that hee did not publish it, the <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 565. <hi>nu.</hi> 4.</note> Cardinall likewise tels us, <hi>Hee writ indeed, Non tamen promulgavit de haeresi Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> But hee did not publish that Edict. Hee did publish it: hee did not publish it: what truth in those witnesses who thus contradict themselves? If he did publish it, as the Cardinals <hi>Theophanes,</hi> and <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Senensis</hi> affirme, then <hi>Evagrius,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> are not herein to bee credited: If hee did not publish it, how is the Cardinals <hi>Theopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> or <hi>Senensis</hi> herein to be credited? And whether hee did publish it, or not publish it, the Cardinall who teacheth both, is certainly herein not to bee credited. This disagreement of the witnesses one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and of <hi>Baronius</hi> with his one selfe, is no good signe of truth in their Narration.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But that <hi>Iustinian</hi> neither published nor writ any such Edict,

that Faith, Piety, Prudence, Iustice, Clemencie, Bounty, and all other Heroicall and Princely vertues have shined in <hi>Iustinian,</hi> which have beautified any of the most renowned and religious Emperors that the Church hath had.

Now indeed this whole passage might justly be omitted, for, <hi>sublata causa tollitur effectus</hi>; seeing <hi>Iustinian</hi> held no such heresie as hee is slandered withall, there neither was, nor could there bee any effects or consequents of a cause not existent: Yet will I not so sleightly reject the Cardinals calumnie in this point, but fully examine, first the publike, and then the private mischiefes, which hee, without all truth hath fancied, and objected against the Emperour.</p>

                  <hi>beata quiete dignatur,</hi> It placeth <hi>Iustinian</hi> in blessed rest and peace: and againe, <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cum qui in Sanctis est Iustinianum dicunt,</hi> That general Councell ever calleth <hi>Iustinian</hi> one who is a Saint, and among the Saints. Adde to all these, that seeing, by the Cardinals confession, the Epistles of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, In omnibus</hi> (and therefore even in that which he saith of this holy Emperour, <hi>That hee is a blessed Saint, venerable in all Nations</hi>) are to be imbraced as divine Oracles; it may bee truly concluded, that <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> not onely by the testimonies of mortall men, and of all nations, but even by the voyce of God himselfe is blessed, and hath ever since his death, and doth now rest, and raigne with God. When by the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall judgement of S. <hi>Agatho,</hi> of the Romane Synod, of the whole sixt generall Councell, of all Nations, yea, of God himselfe, <hi>Iustinian</hi> is proclamed to be a venerable Saint, now resting &amp; raigning with God in heaven: who is <hi>Baronius,</hi> a man of yesterday, that after a thousand years possession of that heavenly rest, he should unsaint him, dethrone him, and thrust him downe to the lowest pit and most hideous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell? I'st not enough for that <hi>Hildebrandicall</hi> generation to devest Kings &amp; Emperors of their earthly diadems, unless in the pride of their hearts climbing up into heaven, they thrust them out thence also, &amp; deprive them of their crowns of immortality, &amp; eternal glory?</p>
               <p n="43">43. And yet were there neither Historian nor Pope, nor Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, nor Generall Councell, to testifie this felicity of <hi>Iustinian</hi> unto us; that very text, out of which, being maimed, the Cardinall sucked poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and collected <hi>His</hi> death &amp; damnation, doth so forcible prove the beatitude of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> that it alone may bee sufficient in this cause. The Cardinall cites but one part of the text, but the whole doth manifest his fraud and malicious collection. Apoc. 14.13. <hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from hence forth; even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours, and opera illorum sequuntur illos,</hi> their workes follow them: which last words the Cardinall onely alleageth, and applyeth them to <hi>Iustinian.</hi> Now who are Those, that are meant by, <hi>Their works,</hi> and <hi>follow Them?</hi> who are those <hi>Them,</hi> that the Spirit meaneth in that text? Out of al doubt those selfe-same of whom before he spake, <hi>Them, that dye in the Lord, Them, that are blessed, and rest from their labours</hi>; Of <hi>Them,</hi> the Spirit there saith, <hi>Opera illorum,</hi> Their workes follow <hi>Them.</hi> Seeing then the Cardinall confesseth this text to belong to <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and himselfe applyeth it unto him, it certainly hence followeth, that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7679:189"/>
                  <hi>Iustinian</hi> is of their number, who dye in the Lord, and are blessed: for of <hi>Them,</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> onely doth the holy Ghost speake in that text, saying, <hi>They rest from their labours, and</hi> Their <hi>workes follow</hi> Them. So hard it is for the Cardinal to cite or say ought against <hi>Iustinian,</hi> which doth not redound to the Emperours honour, and the Cardinals owne ignominie.</p>
               <p n="44">44. But let us suppose the words to bee generall, as being uttered alone, without any reference to that text, they may bee truly affirmed both of the good &amp; bad: There cannot be found in al Scripture more faire evidence, nor a more authentike Charter for the happy estate of any one in particular that lived since the Apostles times, then is this for <hi>Iustinian</hi>: For what were those <hi>workes which did accompanie and follow Iustinian?</hi> Truely the workes of sincere faith, of fervent zeale to GOD, of love to the Church and Children of God, the workes of piety, of prudence, of justice, of fortitude, of munificence, of many other heroicall vertues: with these, as with a garment and chaine of pure Gold, <hi>Iustinian</hi> being decked, was brought unto the Bridegroom; every decree made, or ratified by him for confirming the faith; every <hi>Anathema</hi> denounced against heresies, &amp; heretiks, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly those against <hi>Vigilius,</hi> &amp; al that defend him, that is, against <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and all who defend the Popes infallibility in defining causes of faith; everie Temple or Church, every Monastery and Hospitall, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City and Towne, everie Bridge, Haven and High-way, every Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, Fort, and Munition, whether made or repaired by him, tending either immediately to the advancement of Gods service, or to the maintaining or relieving of Gods servants, or strengthning the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire against his and Gods enemies: every booke in the Digest, Code, and Authentikes; every Title, yea, every law in any title, whereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Christian faith and religion, or peaceable order and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, have beene either planted, or propagated, or continued, either in the Church or Common-wealth: all these, and every one of them, and many other the like, which I cannot either remember, or recount, are like so many Rubies, Chrysolites, and Diamonds in the costly garment, or so many linkes in that golden chaine of his faith and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Seeing they, <hi>who offer but one mite into the treasury of the Lord,</hi> or give <hi>but one cup of cold water to a Prophet, shall not want a reward</hi>; O! what a weight of eternity and glory shall that troope of vertues and traine of good workes obtaine at his hands, who <hi>rewardeth indeed every man according to their workes,</hi> but withall rewardeth them infinitely above all the dignity or condignity of their workes.</p>
               <p n="45">45. If <hi>Iustinian</hi> and those who are beautified with so many vertues and glorious works, be, as the Card. Judgeth, tormented in hell, belike the Cardinall himselfe hoped by workes contrary unto these, by workes of infidelity, of impiety, of maligning the Church, of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the servants of GOD, of oppugning the faith, of Patronizing heresie, yea, that fundamental heresie which overthroweth the whole Catholike faith, and brings in a totall Apostasie from the faith; by these hee hoped to purchase, and in condignity to merit the felicity of the Kingdome of Heaven: This being the track and beaten path where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

But though she were worthy of blame, was it fit for the Cardinall so basely to revile her, and in such an unseemly and undutifull manner, to disgorge the venome of his stomacke upon an Empresse? <hi>tantae ne animis caelestibus irae,</hi> who would have thought such rancour and poison to have rested in the brest of a Cardinall? But there was, you may be sure, some great cause which drew from the Cardinall to many unseemly speeches against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse; and though hee would bee thought to doe all this onely out of zeale to the truth, which <hi>Anthimus</hi> the heretike oppugned, yet if the depth of the Cardinalls heart were founded, it will appeare, that his spite against her, was for condemning the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> which Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> in his <hi>Constitution</hi> defendeth; <hi>Anthimus</hi> and his cause is but a pretence and colour; the <hi>Apostolicall Constitution,</hi> the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies of the Nestorians, decreed and defined therein, that is the true marke at which the Cardinall aymeth; neither Emperour nor Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, nor Bishop, nor Councell, nor any may open their mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that Constitution, which toucheth them <hi>in capite,</hi> but they shall be sure to heare and beare away as harsh and hellish termes from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> as if they had condemned the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell it selfe.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What thinke you moved the Cardinall to have such an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hatred to this cause, as to wish the condemning, buriall, and utter extinguishing of those controversies? What more hurt did this to the Church, than the question about <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
                  </note>, insued upon this controversie, both in the East and West. True, it did so: and so there did, and far greater and longer about the controversie of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and more againe than that, upon the question whether the <hi>Gospell</hi> or <hi>Paganisme</hi> should prevaile: and yet by moving those controversies was the faith propagated, the truth of Christ spred abroad, the blood of Martyrs was made the seed of the Gospell. No affliction, calamity, or persecution, is a just cause either to wish that there had never beene any such controversie, or to forsake the truth of God, when the controversie is moved. It was an excellent saying of the Aegyptian Bishops in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>

The controversie it selfe, if you well marke it, was very beneficiall to the Church. <hi>Oportet haereses</hi>

by teaching the truth which they doe not know, but by stirring up those who are more carnall Catholikes, to seeke, and those who are more spirituall, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and manifest the truth.</hi> This triall and probation of men (if I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not) was never so great in any controversie or question, as in this of the <hi>three Chapters.</hi> First, it sifted and tryed <hi>Vigilius</hi> to the full, and tryed him to be a wether-cocke in faith, an heretike, and a defender of heresies even by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority. Next, it sifted out divers notable conclusions: as first, that which I think was never before that tryed; that not onely the Pope, but the <hi>Apostolike</hi> See also, to wit, the Romane Church, and with it the Westerne Churches, all at once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to heresie, and forsooke the truth, and that even after it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, and judged by the generall approved Councell; and so it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both Pope and Romane Church to be properly hereticall, the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Churches constantly upholding the truth at that time; it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Catholike faith was tied neither to the Chair, nor Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Another conclusion then tryed, was that either persons, or Churches, may not onely dissent from the Pope and the Romane Church, and that in a cause of faith judicially defined by the Pope with a Synod, but may renounce communion with them, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Catholikes, and in the unity of the Catholike Church; the Pope, the Westerne Church, and all that adheered unto them being then by forsaking the Catholike faith, <hi>Heretikes,</hi> and by forsaking the unity of the Church, <hi>Schismatikes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither onely was this controversie a triall to them in that age, a tryall of their faith, love to God, charity to the Church, obedience to the Emperour, but it is as great a triall even in these our dayes, and ever since that doctrine of the Popes <hi>infallibility</hi> in causes of faith hath beene defined and condemned. By this controversie, most happly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the generall Councell, all that hold the Popes definitions of faith to be <hi>infallible,</hi> that is, all that are Papists, or members of the present Church of Rome, they are all hereby tryed to defend this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Constitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> that is, to maintaine all the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Nestorians, to deny the Catholike faith, the doctrine of the Apostles, of the primative Church, of the fift generall Councell; &amp; so to be not only <hi>heretikes,</hi> but <hi>convicted, anathematized,</hi> and <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned heretikes,</hi> by the judgement of a generall approved Councell, and so by the consenting judgement of the Catholike Church. Further yet there is a tryall of them, whether upon that ground or foundation of the Popes <hi>infallibility,</hi> they will build up and maintaine any other doctrine, or <hi>position</hi> of faith, or religion; if they doe (as indeed every point of the Romish faith and Religion relyeth upon that) they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine hereby tryed to be hereticall, not onely in the <hi>foundation,</hi> but in every <hi>position</hi> and doctrine of their faith and religion, which relyes upon that <hi>foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This was it which netled <hi>Baronius,</hi> and extorted from him those earnest and affectionate wishes, that this controversie had never beene heard of, nor mentioned in the world: he saw what a tryall was like to be made by it of men, of doctrines, of Churches, of the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and their whole Romish Church; and seeing that tryall, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7679:193"/>
ceased to say, that it had beene much better that this controversie had never beene moved, nor spoken of, for so they had avoided this most notable triall. Blessed be God, for that it pleased him in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite depth of his unspeakable wisedome to cause this controversie to be ventilated, and discussed to the utmost; that among many other tryals, this might be one of the <hi>Antichristian Synagogue,</hi> to try them even untill the very destruction of Antichrist. It is for heretikes whose errors and obstinacy is tryed, and discovered to the world; it is for them, I say, to wish that the controversies about Arianisme, Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme, Eutycheanisme, and the like, had never beene moved; they had scaped the just censures and anathemaes by that meanes. But Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes have cause to rejoyce and triumph in such controversies, by which, both the truth which they maintaine, is made more resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and victorious, themselves, and their faith tryed to be like refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned gold, the Church thereby is quieted, the truth propagated, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies confounded, and the glory of Almighty God, much more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and praysed.</p>

                  <hi>plague of the whole Church:</hi> Thus and much more doth <hi>Baronius</hi> utter against <hi>Theodorus,</hi> by whom being so unworthy an author, hee would disgrace the <hi>Edict</hi> it selfe, which he writ, though the Emperour published it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us first begin with that most untrue and malicious calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Baronius,</hi> that the Emperor published his Edict against the <hi>three Chapters</hi> of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Truly the Cardinall should and might most truly have said the quite contrary, that he published his Edict for defence not onely of the <hi>three,</hi> but of every Chapter, of every position, of every decree of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> The <hi>three Chapters</hi> which that Imperiall Edict, and after it the fift Councell, and the whole Catholike Church condemneth, were not Chapters of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> but three impious positions, assertions, or (as they were by an equivalent word called) Chapters, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, specially the Nestorians, collected, and falsely boasted to bee taught by the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; whereas in very truth the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any one of them (much more of them all) is the overthrow of the whole Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> yea of the whole Catholike faith: that Councell contradicteth and condemneth them all, no lesse than the fift Councell, which as <hi>Gregory</hi> truly saith, is <hi>in omnibus sequax,</hi> it doth in every point follow and consent unto the Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The like may be said of that which out of <hi>Facundus, Baronius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth, and citeth as a proofe of his saying, that the Emperours <hi>Edict</hi> is repugnant and contrary to the orthodoxall faith. <hi>Baronius</hi> will still keepe his old wont in applauding <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the defenders of the <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> For if the <hi>Edict</hi> condemning them be contrary, then is the defence of them consonant to the faith, and then not the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Edict of Iustinian,</hi> but the Pontificall <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> must be approved as orthodoxall. And what is this else, but to condemne the judgement of the fift generall Councell, of Pope <hi>Pelagius, Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and all Popes after them, of all generall Councells following it; in a word, to contradict, and utterly condemne the consenting judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church, for the space of 11. hundred yeares? they all approve the determination of the fift Councell, and it so fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth with the <hi>Edict</hi> in condemning the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> that in their definitive sentence they differ very little in words, but in substance and sense nothing at all from the <hi>Emperours Edict,</hi> which caused <hi>Bini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to say, the Edict of the Emperour was approved by the Pope and the Councell: So Catholike and orthodoxall is it, so advisedly and orthodoxally penned. To seeke no further proofe, <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe was so infatuated in this cause, that he oftentimes confuteth his owne sayings: for himselfe gives a most ample and most observable testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this <hi>Edict,</hi> and of the orthodoxy thereof, saying <note n="s" place="margin">

                  </note> are these spoken to <hi>Theodorus</hi>; The booke condemning the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> by their meanes was read in the Kings Pallace, before certaine Greeke Bishops, <hi>à quibus assentationum favorem tuis vocibus exigebas:</hi> What if one should here oppose the Cardinall, and say, <hi>tuis vocibus,</hi> were the Ablative case, and that <hi>Theodorus</hi> had by his words sollicited, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops favorably to consent to the Emperors <hi>Edict?</hi> How will <hi>Baronius</hi> assure us, that they must bee taken in the Dative case; as if <hi>Theodorus</hi> had sollicited them to consent to his words, that is, as the Cardinall supposeth, to the <hi>Edict</hi> which was penned, and written by him, or whereof he was the Author? Sure against this Baronian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, the words of <hi>Liberatus</hi> are very pregnant, seeing <hi>Theodorus,</hi> as hee sheweth, was one who entreated the Emperour to indite or dictate the booke, and the Emperour promised so to doe. If then <hi>Theodorus</hi> sollicited the Bishops to consent to the words of the <hi>Edict,</hi> hee certainly urged them (by this testimonie of <hi>Liberatus</hi>) to consent not to his owne, but to the Emperours words, of whose inditing and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7679:196"/>
dictating the <hi>Edict</hi> was. Admit them to bee the Dative, how knowes the Cardinall, that by [<hi>tuis vocibus</hi>] are ment the words of the <hi>Edict?</hi> might not <hi>Theodorus</hi> signifie to the Bishops his owne great liking of the Emperours <hi>Edict,</hi> and perswade them to the like, to say as he said, to consent to his words in approving the <hi>Imperiall Edict?</hi> The Card<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was too secure &amp; neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in relying on these words [<hi>tuis vocibus</hi>] w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being so ambiguous, receive divers, &amp; those also just exceptions: But yet there is a farre worse fault in this proofe; that the Epistle, whence the Cardinall citeth these words, though it beare the name of <hi>Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> yet is intruth not the Epistle of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but a very counterfeit and base forgery under his name, full of untruths, unworthy of any credit at all; which, besides other proofes, (hereafter to be alleaged) faineth <hi>Mennas</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to be excommunicated, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Theodorus,</hi> by <hi>Vigilius</hi> foure or five yeares after hee was dead, which censure was to stand in force till <hi>Mennas</hi> repented of his contumacie against the Popes Decree, and should be reconciled to him. This lying and base forgery doth <hi>Baronius</hi> bring to prove <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and not <hi>Iustinian</hi> to bee the author of this <hi>Imperiall Edict.</hi> Might not one say here as was said of the Asse, Like lips, like lettuce? Such a writing is a most fit witnesse for <hi>Baronius,</hi> who delighteth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, and not finding true records, to give testimony to them, it was fit hee should applaud the most vile and abject forgeries, if they seeme to speak ought pleasing to the Cardinals pallate, or which may serve to support his untruths.</p>
               <p n="9">9. You see that yet it appeares not that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was the writer or penner of this Decree, none of <hi>Baronius</hi> his witnesses affirming it, and <hi>Liberatus,</hi> who is the best of them all, affirming the contrary. I might now with this answer put off a great part of those reviling spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which <hi>Baronius</hi> so prodigally bestoweth on <hi>Theodorus:</hi> But I minde not so to leave the Cardinall, nor suffer the proud Philistine so insolently to revile and insult over any one of the Israelites; much lesse this worthy Bishop of Cesarea, to whom hee could not have done a greater honor, than in that which he intended as an exceeding disgrace to him, to call and account him the Author and Writer of this <hi>Edict.</hi> It is no small honour, that <hi>Iustinian,</hi> so wise and religious an Emperour, should commit the care of so waighty a matter to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi>; that hee should have him in so high esteeme, as account his word an Oracle, to bee guided and directed by his judgement; so to adhere unto him, as <hi>Constantine</hi> did to that renowned <hi>Hosius,</hi> as to thinke it a <hi>piaculum,</hi> or great offence not to follow his advice in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of so great waight, consequence, and importance. Nay, this one <hi>Edict,</hi> (supposing with the Cardinall <hi>Theodorus</hi> to bee the Author of it) shall not onely pleade for <hi>Theodorus,</hi> but utterly wipe away all those vile slanders of heresie, impiety, imprudency, and the like, so often, and so odiously objected, and exaggerated by the Cardinall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; this writing and the words thereof being (as whosoever readeth them will easily conceive, and if hee deale ingenuously, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) the words of truth, of faith, of sobriety, of profound knowledge, evidences of a minde full fraught with faith, with piety, with the love
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7679:196"/>
of God, and Gods Church, and in a word full of the holy Ghost. As <hi>Sophocles</hi>

Or rather <hi>Theodorus</hi> may answer that <hi>Baronian</hi> slander with the like words, as did S. <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p n="10">10. Now as this may serve for a generall Antidote at once, as it were, to expell all the whole poyson of those Baronian calumnies; so, if we shall descend to particulars, the innocency of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> as also the malice and malignity of <hi>Baronius</hi> will much more clearly appeare. The crimes objected to <hi>Theodorus</hi> by <hi>Baronius</hi> are reduced to three heads; one, his threefold heresie; another, his opposing himselfe to Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or the Decree of Taciturnity, in the cause of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi>; the third, his misleading of <hi>Iustinian</hi> into the heresie of the Aphthardokites, and so causing that great persecution of the Church which thereupon ensued; all the other disgracefull termes are but the superfluity of that malice which the Cardinall beares against all that were opposite to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> Constitution. To begin then with that which is easiest, the two last crimes are not so easily uttered as refuted, they both are nothing else but meere slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and calumnies, without any certaine ground, or probability of truth, devised either by <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe, or by such as he is, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and haters of the truth; and truly for the later, his misleading <hi>Iustinian</hi> into the heresie of the Apthardokites, that is not onely a manifest untruth, (for <hi>Iustinian,</hi> as wee have before <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ca.</hi> 20.</note> proved, did not onely at all hold that heresie) but it is wholly forged and devised by <hi>Baronius,</hi> he hath not any one Author, no not so much as a forged writing to testifie this, no nor any probable collection out of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to induce him to lay this imputation upon <hi>Theodorus</hi>; the world is wholly and soly beholden to the Cardinall for this shamelesse ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny; and yet see the wisedome of <hi>Baronius</hi> herein, hee was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent barely and in a word to taxe and reprove <hi>Theodorus,</hi> (which had beene more than sufficient, having no proofe nor evidence of the crime) but in this passage, as if shee had demonstratively proved <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> to bee guilty hereof, hee rageth and foameth like a wilde Bore against him, calling him a most wicked man, and most vehement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugner of blasphemy, the plague of the whole Church, who with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor affrayed the Emperour like a little Boy from the truth, and led him captive into heresie. Doe you not thinke that the Cardinall nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be sent to <hi>Anticyra,</hi> when he writ this not onely without truth, but without braine and ordinary sense?</p>
               <p n="11">11. The other crime, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> opposed himselfe to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and to the decree of silence, is like the former, save that this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

in the person of this Theodorus they condemne the Epistle of Ibas as hereticall, and by that Epistle condemne the Councell of Chalcedon, à qua suscepta est, by which that Epistle is approved.</hi> Thus <hi>Facundus,</hi> so very heretically, that <hi>Nestorius, Eutyches, Dioscorus,</hi> nor any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned heretike could wish or say more than <hi>Facundus</hi> hath done both for their heresies, &amp; against the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> For the impious Epistle of <hi>Ibas</hi> is wholly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, the approving of it is the overthrow of the whole Catholike faith: and yet <hi>Facundus</hi> not onely himselfe defendeth that impious <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> as orthodoxall, and by it defendeth the person and writing of <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopsvestia</hi> a condemned heretike; but avoucheth the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to approve the same, which condemnes it and every part of it even to the lowest pit of hell.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Here by the way I must in a word put the reader in minde of one or two points which concern <hi>Possevine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> in this passage. If <hi>Facundus</hi> be a condemned heretike for writing in defence of the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> what else can <hi>Possevine</hi> be who praysed those bookes of a condemned heretike? for thus he writeth <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Loco citato.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>Facundus</hi> writ <hi>opus gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de atque elegans, a great and elegant worke,</hi> containing twelve books, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the authorities of the Fathers in defence of the <hi>three Chapters.</hi> Heretike! Is that a brave and elegant booke that defendeth heresie? can heresie be fortified by the testimonies of the holy Fathers? What is this else but to make the holy Fathers heretikes? So hereticall and spitefull is <hi>Possevine,</hi> that together with himselfe he would draw the ancient and holy Fathers into one and the same crime of heresie. The other point concernes <hi>Baronius:</hi> hee sayth <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 547. <hi>nu.</hi> 30.</note> that the controversie or contention about the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> was <hi>inter Catholicos tantum, onely among such as were Catholikes:</hi> doth not he plainly thereby signifie his opinion of <hi>Facundus,</hi> that he was a Catholike? for <hi>Facundus</hi> was as hot, and earnest a contender in that controversie as <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe; he writ in defence of the <hi>three Chapters</hi> twelve whole bookes, elegant and brave bookes, as <hi>Possevine</hi> saith: he bitterly inveighed against the Emperour, against all the condemners of them, against Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe, when hee after his comming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> consented to the Emperor. Seeing this <hi>Facundus</hi> (a convicted and condemned he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hetike) is one of the Cardinals Catholikes, must not heresie and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storianisme bee with him Catholike doctrine? must not the impious <hi>Epistle</hi> be orthodoxall, and the overthrow of the faith and decree of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> bee an Article of <hi>Baronius</hi> faith? even that which he accounted the Catholike faith? But this by the way. We see now what manner of Bishop <hi>Facundus</hi> was, an obstinate heretike, pertinaciously persisting in heresie. What though <hi>Facundus</hi> call <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> of <hi>Caesarea</hi> an Origenist? Did not the old Nestorians call <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and other Catholikes, Apollinarians? of whom it seemes the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>three Chapters</hi> learned to calumniate the Catholikes with the names of heretikes and Origenists, when they were in truth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite to those and other heresies. Can any expect a true testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop, of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> from <hi>Facundus,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Catholikes, from heretikes, their immortall and malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor theirs onely, but enemies to the truth?

small worth is the former witness of <hi>Baronius</hi> in this cause, and against <hi>Theodorus.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Aronius</hi> perceiving right well, that all which heretofore hath beene said either against the Emperour, or the Empresse, or the Edict, or <hi>Theodorus</hi> the supposed author of it, is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in any measure either to defend, or excuse <hi>Vigilius</hi>; in the next place he taketh a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth &amp; unusuall, but a most sure course, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee may not onely weaken, but utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow all that hath or can be said against the Pope in this cause; for the <hi>Acts</hi> of the fift generall Councell being the most authentike records that can bee produced, to prove <hi>Vigilius</hi> and all that defend him, to bee heretikes; the Cardinall, and after him <hi>Binius</hi> will now no longer hacke at this or that person, which were agents in the cause, and but petty branches, but now hee will strike at the very roote, calling into question the Acts and evidences themselves, striving to prove them to bee of no credit; which if hee can doe, all the rest, whatsoever can bee said, will most easily bee rejected. Now because <hi>Baronius</hi> was willing in this passage to shew not onely the utmost sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of his wit, but his exact diligence in picking out every quarrell, that art or malice could suggest against the Acts of this holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, I must intreate the reader not to thinke it tedious (though unto mee this was a matter almost of greatest trouble and difficultie) to heare patiently, and weigh with equity of judgement the manifold exceptions against these Acts, which he hath collected, or rather scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon every occasion which offered it selfe here and there, that by his inculcating, and ingeminating of the accusation he might breed some opinion of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And before I enter into examination of the particulars, let me put the reader in minde of one or two considerations which may in generall concerne them all. The first is, that though the Cardinall, and <hi>Binius</hi> following him, have spared no labour to sift these Acts as diligently as Satan did Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and have objected ten or twelve speciall corruptions in them, yet not any thing which they mention, or against which they except, doth any way so touch or concerne the cause of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> whereof wee have intreated, as either to shew that the Councell condemneth them not, or that <hi>Vigilius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth them not by his definitive &amp; <hi>Apostolical Constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or that the Councell by their Synodall sentence and consenting judgement did not for that cause condemne, anathematize, and accurse for heretikes all that defend them, and so Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> among the rest, and al that defend him or his <hi>Apostolicall Constitution.</hi> All these are matters of so certaine, evident, and undoubted truth, by the Acts, that <hi>Baronius</hi> or
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7679:201"/>
                  <hi>Binius</hi> could finde nothing at all to blemish or darken them. So then, though the Acts were admitted in 100. or 1000. other points to bee corrupted, mutilated, and altered, yet the Cardinall and <hi>Binius</hi> are never a whit the nearer; the maine point at which they aime, is to excuse <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and those that defend him, but notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all that they have said, (and they have said all that industry, having borrowed serpentine eyes, could finde out) both <hi>Vigilius</hi> himselfe, and all who defend him, and those are all who defend the Popes <hi>infallibility in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning causes of faith,</hi> that is, all Papists, remaine still, as convicted, accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and anathematized heretikes, and that by the judgment of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generall Councell, approved by all succeeding, both Popes and Councels, till the time of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The second thing which I observe is, that corruptions which happely may bee crept into some Synodall Acts, or other writings, whether by mutilations, additions, or alterations, are no just cause to reject, as unworthy of credit, all the Acts of that Councell, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the author.

and commentitious writings are inserted by their owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Let <hi>Baronius</hi> answer here his owne question, <hi>Quam fidem rogo?</hi> I pray you then, what credit may bee given to such Canons or Acts as are those of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> of the sixt, seventh, or eighth Councell? they all must by the Cardinals rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be rejected, as Canons and Acts of no worth, of no credit at all: Nor they onely, but all the workes of <hi>Augustine,</hi> of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and almost all the holy Fathers: none of them all by this Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian reason, deserve any credit, for among their writings are inserted many suppositious and factitious tracts, as the book <hi>de variis Quaestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Scripturae,</hi> the Sermon of the Assumption of the blessed Virgin, and many moe <note n="m" place="margin">

Truly, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise what might move the great Card to make such a collection, and reason, as from some corruptions crept into the bookes of fathers, or Acts of Councels, to inferre, that the whole Acts or writings are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any credit, but onely as <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> had a purpose to burne all authentick records and writings of law, that, as hee boasted, all the law might proceed from his own mouth; so the Cardinal intended to play a right <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> with all the ancient Councels and Fathers, that having utterly, though not abolished, yet disgraced, and made them all by this his reason and collection unworthy of any credit, his owne mouth might bee an Oracle to report without controulment all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of ancient matters; and what his Cardinalship should please to say in any matter, or to set downe in his Annals, that all men should beleeve, as if the most authentick Records in the world had testified the same: How much better and more advisedly might the Cardinall have done, to have wished all corruptions to bee removed? whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be certainly proved in any Acts of Councels, or writings of Fathers to be added unto them, that to be quite cut off; whatsoever might bee found wanting, that to bee added; whatsoever to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or perverted, that to be amended, and not in the blindnesse of his hatred, against this one fift Councell, to fight like one of the <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batae,</hi> against al the rest, and with one stroke to cashire all the Acts and Canons of Councels, all the writings of Fathers or Historians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, forsooth, one or some few corruptions have either by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or errour of writing, or by fraud and malice of some malignant hand crept into them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third thing which I observe, is, that whereas <hi>Baronius</hi> so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and so spightfully declameth against the Acts of this Councell, as imperfect and corrupted, this his whole accusation proceedeth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7679:202"/>
to the Councell and these Acts, rather than of judgement or of truth; for I doe constantly affirme, and who so ever pleaseth to peruse the Councels shall certainly finde, (and, if he deale ingenuously, will confesse the same) that as of al the general Councels which go before this fift, for integrity of the Acts, none is better, or any way compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this, save that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>: so of all that follow it none at all is to bee preferred, nor any way to bee counted equall with it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that which they call the sixt Councell, that is, so much of the Acts of that Synod as concerne the cause of the Monothelites, leaving out the <hi>Trullane</hi> Canons: This, whosoever is exercised in the Volumes of Councels cannot choose but observe. The Nicene &amp; Constantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane being so miserably maimed, that scarce wee have so much as a few shreds or chips of the most magnificent buildings of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, which, if they could bee recovered, no treasures are sufficient to redeeme a worke of that worth and value, a worke <hi>non gemmis, neque purpura a vaenale, neque auro.</hi> That of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is a little helped indeed by <hi>Peltanus,</hi> but yet it remaines so imperfect, so confused, and disorderly, that as <hi>Diogines</hi> sought men in the most thronged multitudes of men, so among those very Acts &amp; large Tomes of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, the reader shall be forced to seeke the Acts of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councell. The Acts of the second <hi>Nicene,</hi> and of the next to it, which they call the eighth, are so doubtfull, that not onely this or that part, but the whole fabrick of them both is questionable, whether they were the Synodall Acts, or but a relation framed by <hi>Anastasius,</hi> as hee thought best. Of all the eight Councels, the Acts of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> this fift, and the sixt have beene most safely preserved, and like the river <hi>Arethusa</hi> have strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passed through so many corrupt ages and hands, and yet without tainture of the salt, deliver unto us the cleare and sweete current of antiquity and truth: And verily, when I seriously compare the wrack of other Councels with the entirenesse of these three, I cannot but admire and magnifie with all my might the gracious providence, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and love of God to his Church, for in every one of these there is an unresistable force of truth, against that Antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authority &amp; supremacy which is now made the <hi>foundation</hi> of the Popish faith; the sixt in the cause of <hi>Honorius,</hi> the fift in this cause of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in curbing the Popes Legates, in crossing the decree, and knowne resolution of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and in being a most lively patterne of that rightfull and ancient authority which Emperours then held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Bishops in the Councell; but now the Pope usurpes both above all Bishops, Emperours and Councels. God would by these monuments of antiquity pull downe the lofty Towers, and raze from the very bottome that foundation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> can never be firme and setled; hee would have, besides other particular witnesses, these unconquerable and irresistible forces of these ancient and generall Councels, against which no just exception can be taken: and although I will not excuse the acts of these, nor any of them from all defects and blemishes whatsoever, yet I dare boldly averre, that they are so few, so light, and of so small importance, that the maine controversies handled in them, or relying on them, cannot be prejudicated thereby,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7679:202"/>
they being rather the errours of the Collectors, or of the writers, and exscribers of these Councels, than of the Councels themselves: And particularly for this fift Councell, against which <hi>Baronius</hi> doth so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously declame: I doubt not to make it evident, that all the faults, which, after much prying, hee hath objected unto the Acts thereof, will prove so many evident testimonies of his owne most fraudulent and corrupt dealing, and not the defects or corruptions in the Acts of this Councell. But let us view the particulars.</p>

                  <hi>to note the craft of the Grecians, who, contrary to right and equitie, have corrupted the holy text of the Synodall Acts, by adding unto the Councell of Chalcedon those words, about which there was much contention in the time of Pope Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misda, when certaine suspected of Eutycheanisine, specially some Scythian Monkes, did labour that unto the holy Councell of Chalcedon these words might bee added, Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum unum esse de sancta Trinitate; which when they could not obtaine, because the Synod was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without that addition, here now (in this fift Councell) where the Epistle of</hi> Ibas <hi>is compared with the profession of the Councell at Chalcedon; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite these words of the Synod [Chalcedonensis sancta Synodus in definitione quam de fide fecit, praedicat Deum verbum incarnatum esse hominem] the holy Synod of Chalcedon in the definition which it made of faith, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse God the Word to have beene incarnate and made man</hi>; and they adde unto the words of the Synod, [<hi>qui est Dominus noster Iesus Christus, unus de sancta Trinitate; who is our Lord Iesus Christ, one of the holy Trinitie</hi>;] as if the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> had professed that, whereas they rather would call Christ, <hi>unam personam sanctae Trinitatis,</hi> than <hi>unum de sancta Trinitate.</hi> Thus <hi>Baronius</hi>: In which few words of his there are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so many notable untruths, and hereticall frauds, that without a rare dexterity in that craft, hee could not have easily contrived and couched them in so small a roome.</p>

                     <hi>An. cod. nu.</hi> 102.</note>, that these words, <hi>unus de Trinitate est crucifixus,</hi> are to bee added for the strengthning and explaning of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; which sentence (<hi>unus de Trinitate est crucifixus</hi>) the Legates of the Apostolike Sea, <hi>prorsus reijci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endam esse putarunt, thought to bee such as ought utterly to be rejected,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never used by the Fathers in their Synodall sentences; <hi>latere enim sciebant sub melle venenum, for they knew that poison did lye under this hony.</hi> Now seeing by <hi>Iustinians Edict,</hi> and the Popes confirmation thereof, all, who either refuse, or who will not professe Christ to be <hi>unum de sancta Trinitate,</hi> are accursed, and excluded from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church and communion; <hi>Baronius</hi> cannot possibly escape that just censure, who condemneth that profession as hereticall, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the faith of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Thus while the Cardinall labours to prove by this the Acts of the fift Councell to bee corrupt, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates himselfe to bee both untrue, hereticall, rejected out of the Church, and a slanderer of the holy Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the heresie of <hi>Nestorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, whereas hee saith, that the Scythian Monkes would <hi>inferre verba ista in Synodum Chalcedonensem,</hi> bring or thrust in those words into the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> it is a slander without all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or ground of truth: they saw divers Nestorians obstinate in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this truth, that Chist was <hi>unus de sancta Trinitate,</hi> who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them that these words were not expressed in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; the Monkes and Catholikes most justly replyed, that though the expresse words were not there, yet the sense of them was decreed in that Councell, that this confession was but an expression or explication of that which was truly, implicitely, and more obscurely decreed at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> To falsifie the Acts of that Councell, or adde one syllable unto it, otherwise than by way of explanation or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, the Monks and Catholikes, whom <hi>Baronius</hi> calleth Eutyche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, never sought to doe, as at large appeares by that most learned and orthodoxall booke written by <hi>Iohannes Maxentius</hi> about this very cause, against which booke, and the Author thereof, the more earnestly <hi>Baronius</hi> doth oppose himselfe, and call them hereticall, hee doth not therby one whit disgrace them (his tongue and pen is no slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at least not to weighed) but the more he still intangles himselfe in the heresie of the Nestorians, out of which in that cause none can extricate him, as in another Treatise I purpose God willing, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fourthly, whereas <hi>Baronius</hi> saith, that the Scythian Monkes prevailed not in the dayes of <hi>Hormisda, quod absque additamento Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus rectè consisteres,</hi> because the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was well enough without that addition, hee shewes a notable sleight of his hereticall fraud. That the Synod is well enough without adding those words, as an expresse part of the Synodall decree, or as written <hi>totidem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> by the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> is most true, but nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for neither the Scythian Monks nor any Catholikes did affirme them so to bee, or wish them so to bee added, for that had beene to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7679:204"/>
say in expresse words, wee will have the decree falsified, or written in other words than it was by the Councell: But that the Synod was well enough without this additament, as an explication of it, and declaration of the sense of that Councell, is most untrue; for both <hi>Iustinian</hi> by his Edict commanded, and Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> by his <hi>Apostolike</hi> authoritie confirmed, that to bee the true meaning, both of that Councell, and of all the holy Fathers: And when a controversie is once moved, and on foote, whether Christ ought to bee called <hi>unus de sancta Trinitate,</hi> for a man then to deny this, or deny it to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> or to deny that it ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a true explanation of that Councell, is to deny the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, and the decrees of the soure first Councels; and though one shall say and professe in words, as did <hi>Hormisda</hi> and his Legates, that they hold the whole Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> yet in that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly deny this truth, which was certainly decreed at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> their generall profession shall not excuse them, but their expresse deniall of this one particular shall demonstrate them, both to bee heretikes, and expresly to beleeve and hold an heresie repugnant to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, which in a generality they professe to hold, but indeed and truth doe not. Even as the expresse denying of the manhood, or Godhead of Christ, or resurrection of the dead shall convince one to bee an heretike, though hee professe himselfe in a generality to beleeve and hold all that the holy Scriptures doe teach, or the Nicene fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. If <hi>Baronius</hi> his words, that the Councell is right without that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament, bee taken in the former sense, they are idle, vaine, and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to no purpose, which, of the Cardinals deepe wisedome is not to bee imagined: If they bee taken (as I suppose they are) in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sense, they undeniably demonstrate him to bee a Cardinall Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But leaving all the rest of the Cardinals frauds in this passage, let us come to that last clause which concernes the corrupting of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> This, saith he, which in <hi>Horm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. Yea, but in the Acts those words are cited as the words of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> whose they are not. A meere fancy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of the Cardinall: they are plainly set downe as the words of the fift Synod, whose indeed they are; and it relateth not precisely the words of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> nor what it there expressed, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> but the true summe and substance of what is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.

For thus they say <note n="i" place="margin">

                  </note>, <hi>The holy Synod of Chalcedon in the definition which it made of faith, doth professe God the Word incarnate, to be made man</hi>; this is all they report of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as by the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ibas</hi> his <hi>Epistle</hi> is apparent, wherein they oppose not that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Christ to be one of the Trinity, but that hee called them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes who taught the Word incarnate to be made man. That clause which they adde [That Christ is one of the Trinity] is an addition of the fift Councell it selfe, explicating that of Christ, which the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Edict</hi> bound them to professe, as being the true sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> but not as being word for word set downe in the decree of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> And even as he were more than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, who would accuse one to corrupt the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> for saying they professed Christ to be God and man, who was borne in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and fled from <hi>Herod</hi> into Aegypt; so is the Cardinall as ridiculous in objecting this as a corruption of the Synod, or additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that they say the Councell taught the Word of God to bee man, who is our Lord Iesus Christ, one of the holy Trinity. Both additions are true, but neither of them affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be expresly, and <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> set downe in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Why but looke to the Cardinals proofe; for he would not for any good affirme such a matter without proofe. What? doe yee aske for proofe of the Cardinall? I tell you, it is proofe enough that he sayth it: and truly in this poynt he produceth neither any proofe, nor any shadow of reason to prove either that those words are falsely inserted into the Acts of the fift Councell, or that the fift Councell cited them as the very expresse words of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> all the proofe is grounded on his old Topicke place <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> which is a sory kind of arguing, against any that love the truth: for although against the Pope or their popish cause, any thing which he writeth is a very strong evidence against them, seeing the Cardinall is very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect &amp; wary to let nothing, no not a syllable fall from him which may in the least wise seem to prejudice the Popes dignity, or the cause of their Church, unlesse the maine force and undeniable evidence of truth doe wrest and wring it from his pen: yet in any matter of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherein he may advantage the Pope, or benefit their cause, it is not by many degrees so good to say, the <hi>illustrissimus Cardinalis</hi> affirmes it, which is now growne a familiar kinde of proofe among them <note n="k" place="margin">

A matter utterly incoherent and improbable; for in the synodall decree concerning the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> which they suppose to be made before this cause of <hi>Origen</hi> was either heard or proposed, the Councell had expresly delivered their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and condemned both <hi>Origen</hi> and his impious writings. When they had already condemned both him and his errors, what an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity is it to make the Emperour demand, what they would decree of him and his errours? Or may we thinke that the holy Synod would first condemne <hi>Origen,</hi> and his impious writings as they did, in the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall sentence against the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> and then afterwards examin the matter, and make an enquiry whether <hi>Origen</hi> and his writings were to bee condemned or not? which were to follow that disorder which the Switzers are reported to have used in judgement, (which was most justly called <hi>Indicium vetitum</hi>) to execute a man, and then try and examine whether he ought to be executed or not. Farre be it from any to imagine such injustice and rashnesse to have beene in this holy generall Councell. Seeing then they condemned and accursed <hi>Origen</hi> and all his errours, in that which <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and <hi>Evagrius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the former Session, it is ridiculous to think that either the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

urged, or that they themselves would in the second Session goe Switzer-like to examine the bookes and doctrines of <hi>Origen,</hi> whether he &amp; they ought to be condemned. Some doubt perhaps may arise out of those words in the Councell <note n="d" place="margin">

May no man doubt but that this <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Iustinian</hi> (as it is set downe by <hi>Cedrenus</hi>) was inserted in the Acts of this fift Councell? what proofe hath the Cardinall for this his confident saying? Truly none at all: nor could hee finde any sound proofe, if he had studied for one thirty yeares: for none but a carping <hi>Momus</hi> can, and none at all ought to doubt of the contrary, that this Epistle which is in <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> neither was <hi>Iustinians</hi> Epistle, neither was sent unto the Synod. <hi>Iustinian</hi> indeed sent a very large and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Epistle</hi> to the Bishops of the Synod at their first assembling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining altogether the like effect, (to wit, a history or narration of the foure former Councells, and a declaration of the impieties both of <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopsvestia,</hi> and of the writing of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and of the impious <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Ibas:</hi>) by which he commanded and authorized the Synod to examine and decide that controversie touching the <hi>three Chapters</hi>; and that being the true and authenticall <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> is extant in the Acts <note n="c" place="margin">

The Emperour, and so all the Bishops of the Synod laboured, as much as they could, to draw the whole Church to unity of faith with themselves, especially Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> whose consent might happily draw after it, if not the whole; yet a great part of the Westerne Church, which were most earnest in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters.</hi> They knew that in particular, and by name to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or his <hi>Constitution,</hi> might not only have exasperated, but even utterly alienated the minde of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and made him (and with him his adherents) more obstinate in their heresie. They sought by silence to conceale and by charity to suppresse, as much as they could, that hereticall and disgracefull <hi>Constitution</hi> of his, and by their
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7679:212"/>
lenity and faire meanes, to gaine him, and his consent to them, yea, even to the truth it selfe: for this cause, though they knew full well, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> had set out that decree, yea, though they confuted all the substance thereof, and condemned both it, and him in generalities, yet they forbare at all to name <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or in particular to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion this his decree; that had beene to proclame hostility, and have made an absolute breach betwixt them and <hi>Vigilius</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides this, which was a very just reason, not so much as to publish (as they did not) that <hi>Constitution</hi> in their Synod, the Emperour had alwayes a purpose to have (as in the seventh Collation was done) the Epistles of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to <hi>Rusticus</hi> and <hi>Sebastianus</hi> to <hi>Valentinianus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly read &amp; published in the Councel: In them <hi>Vigilius</hi> by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority decreeth the condemning of the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> what a disgrace had this beene to <hi>Vigilius</hi> to publish first his <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Constitution</hi> in defence, and shortly after, his <hi>Apostolicall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> for condemning the same <hi>Three Chapters?</hi> How justly might this have incensed <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and for ever with-held him from consenting to them; who had proclamed him in their Councell, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded him in their Synodall Acts to bee such a <hi>Proteus?</hi> Nay, this had extenuated and vilified for ever the authority of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> &amp; the holy <hi>Apostolike</hi> See, to record two constitutions, both procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>ex Tripode,</hi> fighting <hi>ex Diametro,</hi> and by an unreconciliable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction opposed the one to the other. Seeing then both the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the Councell meant by their so often expressing the consent of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to them, and by their reciting his <hi>Apostolicall Constitution</hi> for condemning the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> in the seventh Collation, seeing they meant hereby to draw others to the like consent to the truth, by the authority and credit of the Pope and his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> decree: it is not to bee imagined that the Emperour or Councell would at all, either publish in their Synod, or insert among their Acts the contrary <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of <hi>Vigilius</hi> in defence of the <hi>Three Chapters</hi>; in doing whereof they should not onely have for ever disgraced <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but have much impaired the reputation of their owne wisedome, and quite crossed their principall designe: Nay, what will you say if <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe professe the same? See, and wonder to see him infatuated in this point also. <hi>The Bishops,</hi> saith he <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 553. <hi>nu.</hi> 218.</note>, <hi>of this fift Councell, that they might pretend to have the consent of Vigilius to those things which they defined, expressed in their sentence, that Vigilius had before both in writing and by word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned these three Chapters, tacentes omnino quid ab ipso per editum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutum pendente Synodo pro defensione trium Capitulorum decretum esset; wholly concealing, or saying nothing at all of that decree, which in the time of the Synod hee made for defence of those three Chapters: Sicque nullam penitus de Vigilij Constitutione mentionem habendam esse duxerunt, so they thought fit to make no mention at all of the Constitution of Vigilius, wherein he defended the three Chapters.</hi> So <hi>Baronius:</hi> whom, speaking the truth, I gladly embrace, and oppose him to himselfe speaking an untruth in malice to these Synodall Acts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now if none of these reasons, nor yet <hi>Baronius</hi> his owne expresse testimony can perswade, but still the Cardinall or his friends will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

with his <hi>cognoscitur.</hi> It is certainly knowne, that this Papall <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> did belong to this Synod, yea, to the fift Collation thereof; I would gladly intreat some of them to tell us in this, as in the former concerning <hi>Origen,</hi> who was the thiefe, or robber, that cut out, or pickt away <hi>his holinesse</hi> Constitution; a more capitall crime than the expiling of the Delphian Temple, or the house of <hi>Iupiter Ammon.</hi> Touch the Popes owne writings, even his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> decree delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the holy Chaire? what <hi>Clement</hi>? what <hi>Ravailack</hi> might be so impious, so audacious, so sacrilegious? was it some Origenist? no certainly, the <hi>Constitution</hi> defending, <hi>that none after their death might be condemned,</hi> was a shield and safe charter for <hi>Origen</hi> to bring him to heaven. Was it some Monothelite? nothing lesse; they knew that this <hi>Constitution</hi> was the overthrow of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and all the former holy Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, <hi>Hoc Ithacus velit,</hi> they would have wisht the <hi>Constitution</hi> to have stood for ever: whom may we deeme then to have stolne away that Papall decree? Truly by the old Cassian rule, <hi>Cui bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> none else but either some of the Popes themselves, or some of their favourites, who being ashamed to see such an <hi>hereticall</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> stand among the Acts, judged theft and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a lesser crime, than to have the Popes Chaire thought <hi>fallible</hi> and hereticall. Now because I can imagine none to have beene so presumptuous, and such is my charity and favourable opinion of those holy fathers, and their children also, that they would never commit such an hainous crime, as with sacriledge to maime the Acts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Councels; I doe therefore here absolve and acquit them all of this crime, promising against any adversary, be it <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe, to defend their innocency in this matter, untill some of <hi>Baronius</hi> his friends can either bring some further evidence against them, or else prove, which I thinke they will hardly be able, that a decree, which was never extant among the Synodall Acts, can be stolne or cut away out of the Synodall Acts.</p>

Doth the Cardinall know any man to defend as sincere, or justifie one of those corrupted Monothelite copies? If he doe, the sixt Councell is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable record against such; and we will joyne with him in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such audaciousnesse. Or will the Cardinall say, that the Acts of the fift Synod which are now extant, either have those additions, or were written and taken out of those corrupted and falsified copies? It is as cleare as the Sun they are not, for not one of those Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite additions are in these Acts now extant. These Acts, and no other are they which we defend, and which the Cardinall undertooke to disgrace, and prove to bee corrupted, and to have forgeries patched unto them. Against these Acts, the Cardinalls proofe out of the sixt Synod is so idle, and so ridiculously sophisticall, as not disputing <hi>ad idem</hi>; that hee had need to pray that the Sophisters in our Schooles heare not of, and applaud his rare skill in Logicke. If because some copies were corrupted by the Monothelites, those which most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly escaped their hands must bee condemned, then no deed, nor testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though never so truly authenticall, may be trusted, for a forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer may exscribe it, and adde what he pleaseth in his extracted copy; or because the Romane copies of the Nicene Canons were corrupted by <hi rend="sup">l</hi> 
                  <hi>Zozimus, Bonifacius,</hi> or some of their friends, therefore the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke records thereof (the true copies of which the Africane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops with much labour purchased from <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>) must be distrusted: which yet the Africane Synod (Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi> among the rest) so much honoured, that they gave a just check to the Pope, and manifested that blot in him, which all the water in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will never wash away.</p>

Truly I doe verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe, considering both that the sixt Councell was so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vigilant to preserve the true Acts; and also that these which now we have, are so exact, as before I have declared, that these are no other than the copies of those selfe same ancient and incorrupted acts (save some few and light faults, which by the writers thereof have happened) which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> had, and in that sixt Councell were read, and commended to all posterity. And I doubt not but the fraud of heretikes being then so fully and openly discovered, the Church ever since hath most diligently and curiously, not onely carefully, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the same. Which may well be thought to bee the true cause, why of all the eight Councels the Acts of these three last, that at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> this fift, and the other of the sixt, are come most safe and intire unto our hands. Howsoever, certaine it is that the Cardinall and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> doe most childishly sophisticate, in accusing the copies of the Acts now extant, (which onely we defend) to be corrupted, because those three or moe copies of the Acts which were produced in the sixt Synod, (which we detest and condemne much more than the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall) were falsified by the Monothelites, none of those false additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being found in these.</p>

No: the Cardinall was wise enough not to undertake so hard a taske. For it is as evident as the Sun, that the law against <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi> which is in the <hi>Code</hi> was one, and first published; and long after that these which are recited in the Acts.

That in the <hi>Code</hi> was made indeed against the heresies of the Nestorians, but in it none of them were personally &amp; by name condemned, but only <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius,</hi> all the rest who favoured that heresie, were in a generality, not by name condemned; because when that law was made, the Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans honoured, and held <hi>Nestorius</hi> for their chiefest patron, and urged his writings: In these two recited in the Acts, <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Tarsis, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> of <hi>Mopsvestia,</hi> and their writings, are particularly, and by name condemned, as well as <hi>Nestorius:</hi> and in the later the writings also of <hi>Theodoret</hi> against <hi>Cyrill:</hi> for when after that first law set downe in the <hi>Code,</hi> the Nestorians durst not, nor could without danger of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either praise <hi>Nestorius,</hi> or reade, write, or urge his books, which were all by that law condemned: then they began to magnifie <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> of <hi>Mopsvestia,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and the writing of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> all which were as plaine and plentifull for their heresie, as <hi>Nestorius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: but because these were not as yet by name condemned, nor by name prohibited, they presumed more boldly to rely on them. The Catholikes, and specially they of Armenia, as is witnessed <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coll.</hi> 5. <hi>pa.</hi> 542</note> in a letter from them to <hi>Proclus,</hi> seeing this their new device, entreated the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Theodosius</hi> to stop that wicked course, &amp; to condemne by name <hi>Theodorus,</hi> as well as hee had done <hi>Nestorius.</hi> Which though at the first the Emperour did not, yet seeing how insolent the Nestorians grew upon those writings, long after the former, he published these two, condemning now <hi>explicitè</hi> by name, and in particular, <hi>Diodorus, Theodorus,</hi> and the writing of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which before were onely <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitè,</hi> and in a generality condemned. When the lawes, the occasion, the time of promulgation, were all different, was not the Cardinall, thinke you, bereft of judgement, who would prove these later to bee

               <p n="6">6. Doe you not verily beleeve the Cardinall had sent his wit out of the Country, when hee writ that whole part of his Annals, which concernes these <hi>three Chapters</hi>? A little before he professeth <note n="y" place="margin">

                     <hi>an. eod. nu.</hi> 82.</note>, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> seemes to have beene of this minde, (which is noted in this Epistle) <hi>etiam post concordiam,</hi> even after the agreement, union, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord made with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> seeing <hi>Theodoret</hi> so obstinately professeth in his letters, that hee would never assent to the sentence against <hi>Nestorius, Sicque certum est aliquandiu perseverasse, and so it is certaine that Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret continued some while</hi> (after the union) <hi>with an angry minde against Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill.</hi> But now hee will prove the quite contrary, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> for a certainty writ no such things, nor had any fellowship with <hi>Nestorius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the union. So both it is certaine that <hi>Theodoret</hi> writ this, and yet it is certaine he writ it not; certaine that hee writ it after the union, and yet certaine that he writ it not after the union. That is, to speake plainly, it is certaine the Cardinall demonstrates himselfe and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to be false, untrue, and ridiculous, repugnant both to the truth, and to his owne writings.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This might suffice to oppose against whatsoever <hi>Baronius</hi> can produce.

It remaineth now, seeing <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> was an earnest defender of <hi>Nestorius</hi> at the time when he writ this history; and it was written after the yeare 438. that out of all doubt till then hee remained hereticall, and devoted to all the blasphemies and heresies of <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Theodorus,</hi> which in that history he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for most wholsome food, and Catholike doctrine.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But not to stay longer in a matter very cleare, my conclusion of this former point is this; Seeing the Cardinall tels us that from the time of the union <hi>Theodoret</hi> was not onely a Catholike and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall Bishop, but that he did manfully fight for the Catholike faith, it evidently followeth, that in the Cardinals judgment, Nestorianism and those herbes, nay most poysonfull weeds of <hi>Theodorus</hi> are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrines, seeing as now we have proved for many (but of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for seven yeares at least) after the <hi>union,</hi> that doctrine which <hi>Theodoret</hi> embraced, and so earnestly defended, was no other than the

It is demonstrated to be such, because it was written to <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who was dead but 7. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas more than foure times seven yeares, cannot hinder the Epistle of <hi>Theodosius</hi> written to the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> after hee was dead, to be an authentike and undoubted record. This may serve the Cardinall for the first answere, who is now bound in all equity, either to confesse his owne demonstration to be fallacious, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame the Epistle of Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> and the other of <hi>Theodosius</hi> with that whole narration, to be fictitious, and his owne Annals a fabulous legend.</p>
               <p n="5">5. My second answer is, that though <hi>Iohn,</hi> to whom this Epistle is directed, was dead, yet that proves onely the title or inscription to be amisse, or that <hi>Theodoret</hi> writ not this Epistle to <hi>Iohn</hi>; it cannot prove (which the Cardinall undertooke to doe) that the Epistle is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and not written by <hi>Theodoret</hi>: For the Epistle it selfe to bee tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Theodorets,</hi> his owne Sermon publikely preached at <hi>Antioch</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Domnus</hi> after the death of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and mentioned in the Synodall Acts <note n="l" place="margin">

                  </note> next after this Epistle, doth clearly manifest; for the scope and purpose of that sermon is the same which is expressed in the Epistle. In the Epistle <hi>Theodoret</hi> declareth his eagernesse in defending the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and withall rejoyceth and insulteth over <hi>Cyrill</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, who was then the chiefe oppugner of the heresies of <hi>Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> The very same eagernesse for Nestorianisme, and love to his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, as also the like joy for <hi>Cyrils</hi> death doth his sermon expresse more fully, saying, <hi>Nemo neminem jam cogit blasphemare, none doth now</hi> (seeing <hi>Cyrill</hi> is dead) <hi>compell any man to blaspheme,</hi> (so hee cals the Catholike faith.) Where are those (to wit <hi>Cyrill</hi>) who teach that God was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? It was the man Christ, and not God who was crucified: It was the man IESVS that dyed, and it was GOD the Word who raised him from the dead. <hi>Non jam est contentio, Now</hi> (seeing <hi>Cyrill</hi> is dead) <hi>there is no contention; Oriens &amp; Egyptus sub uno jugo est,</hi> the East &amp; <hi>Egypt</hi>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:7679:226"/>
(that is, as well those who are under the Patriarke of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as they who are under the Patriarke of <hi>Antioch</hi>) are all under one yoke; that is, all submit themselves to one faith, that is, to Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Thus preached <hi>Theodoret</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> insulting over him being dead, triumphing that now (seeing <hi>Cyrill</hi> was dead) Nestorianisme did and would prevaile. Who can imagine, but that the Epistle, maintaining the same heresie insulting in the same triumphing manner at the death of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> was written by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> when he publikely in his sermon before a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke, uttered the same matter. Would <hi>Theodoret</hi> feare or forbeare to write that in a letter, which hee neither did feare, nor could forbeare to professe openly in a sermon, and that in so solemne a place and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly? or was <hi>Theodoret</hi> orthodoxall, and a lover of <hi>Cyrill</hi> in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings before the death of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> who was hereticall, and so full with the dregs of Nestorianisme after the death of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that he must vent them, and with them disgorge his malice and spite against <hi>Cyrill</hi> in an open Pulpit, and in the hearing of a Patriarke, and all the people of <hi>Antioch?</hi> It is not the inscription or title of the Epistle, but the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle it selfe which the fift Councell and wee after it doe stand upon. Had not they knowne the Epistle to bee <hi>Theodorets</hi> they needed not by it to have proved that <hi>Theodoret,</hi> after the <hi>union,</hi> yea, after the death of <hi>Cyrill</hi> was eager, violent, yea, virulent also in defence of the heresies of <hi>Nestorius</hi>; that his publike sermon by them cited and preached after <hi>Cyrils</hi> death, and against <hi>Cyrill,</hi> had beene a sufficient proofe and demonstration of that; but because they were sure this was the true Epistle of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> they thought good to testifie that he was in writing the selfe same man as hee was in preaching, that is in both a spitefull maligner of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> in both a malicious and malignant Nestorian, and that long after the <hi>union</hi> made betwixt <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Cyrill,</hi> yea, that even after the death of <hi>Cyrill</hi> he continued both to write and to speake the same.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Observe now by the way the fraudulent dealing of <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> in this cause. This passage taken out of a sermon publikely preached at <hi>Antioch</hi> against <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and in an insulting manner for his death, this they doe not, nor durst they carpe at it. It is testified by all the Bishops of the fift Councell to have beene a part of <hi>Theodorets</hi> sermon: the Epistle which likewise is testified by them all to bee <hi>Theodorets,</hi> containing the same matter with his sermon, that they raile at, and revile both it and the writer of it, because in the inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof they have espyed an errour. It had beene honest dealing in the Cardinall and <hi>Binius,</hi> seeing these are fethers of one wing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have acknowledged both, or denyed both to bee the brood of <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Againe, the Cardinall undertooke to prove, that still after the <hi>union</hi> betwixt <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Cyrill, Theodoret</hi> was a Catholike, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of the Catholike faith, and because the Epistle demonstrates the contrary, he will not allow it to bee <hi>Theodorets,</hi> but a forgery written in his name. Admit it were, yet that part of <hi>Theodorets</hi> sermon is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his, nor doth eyther <hi>Baronius</hi> or <hi>Binius</hi> deny it to bee his. Now by this sermon is <hi>Theodoret</hi> as effectually proved and demonstrated, as by the Epistle to have beene an eager oppugner of the Catholike faith, and an obstinate defender of all the heresies of <hi>Nestorius</hi> after the death of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which was twelve <note n="m" place="margin">

                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 546. <hi>nu.</hi> 10.</note> it is said, that before the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> of <hi>Iustinian</hi> was written, those controversies hapned betwixt <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> (Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi>) and <hi>Pascalis</hi> the Deacon. The Card. might as wel have said, that the <hi>Edict</hi> was never written nor published; for there was never any contention nor controversie betwixt <hi>Pascalis</hi> the Deacon, and <hi>Theodorus</hi>; and I doubt, or rather am out of doubt, that there was never any such contention as the Cardinal dreameth of (the best author for it being <hi>Liberatus,</hi> one heretically affected in this cause, and maliciously bent against <hi>Theodorus</hi>) but if there was any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, it was not betwixt <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Pascalis,</hi> but betwixt <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> and <hi>Pelagius.

Now these foule errours (whereupon is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent that almost all which the Cardinall hath historified for some 10. or 11. yeares is utterly untrue) being extant and recorded in his Annals, though there be violent presumption, to thinke that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall judged some of them to be indeed no errors, neither of his own memory, nor of the writerspen, seeing when he reviewed or retracted his Tomes, and corrected therein small slips, and very motes to such beames as these, as the mistaking of a few months or dayes, or miswri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:7679:230"/>
a word or syllable, and the like; yet hee not once mentioneth any correction in these places, yet am I content to allow these to bee but slips of the writer or Printer, as writing <hi>Theodorus</hi> in stead of <hi>Theodosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Pascalis</hi> for <hi>Pelagius</hi>; from <hi>Hormisda,</hi> for, to <hi>Hormisda</hi>; to <hi>Iustine,</hi> for, from <hi>Iustinian</hi>; and <hi>sexta</hi> for <hi>quinta,</hi> or <hi>eadem quinta</hi>; upon condition that the Cardinall and his friends will in like sort consent, that by an error of some writer of these Synodall acts, the name of <hi>Iohn</hi> is either inserted when there was no name, or written in stead of <hi>Domnus</hi> in that inscription. But if they be obstinate and refuse such a reasonable profer, the Card. and all his friends must be patient to heare, how just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and forcibly his owne demonstation may in his owne words be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted upon himselfe, &amp; these errors of his. Certainly these are patent and manifest lyes and frauds, devised by some hereticall knave or var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, they are such as every man may perceive to be written by him who was not in any measure a lover of Christian piety: <hi>Sed impudentissimi cujuspiam Nestorij sigmentum, but they are the fiction of a most impudent Nestorian forgerer.

                  </note>, not one of all which the Cardinall had the grace to alledge.

               <p n="20">20. His first reason is this; <hi>I have shewed</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Bar. <hi>an.</hi> 444. <hi>nu.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>this apertissimè, that Iohn dyed seven yeares before Cyrill by the Epistle which Theodoret writ to Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus foure yeares since,</hi> (that is, foure before the yeare 444.) <hi>in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of one Felicianus, whose estate Theodoret recommends to Domnus.</hi> Truly the Cardinall hath shewed himselfe an egregious trifler here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: For neither in the 440. nor in any foure yeares either before or after that, doth hee set-downe any Epistle of <hi>Theodorets</hi> to <hi>Domnus,</hi> in the behalfe of <hi>Felicianus.</hi> The Epistle which the Cardinall drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of, is in behalfe of <hi>Celestianus,</hi> and that is indeed expressed <hi>An.</hi> 440 <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>To.</hi> 6. <hi>an.</hi> 440. <hi>nu.</hi> 9.</note>. where note I pray you, that the Cardinall by a slip either of his owne penne or memory, (as I verily suppose) or of his Scribe, names <hi>Felicianus</hi> in stead of <hi>Celestianus:</hi> God even by this, demonstrating how unjustly he carpes at the Synodall Acts, for that very errour or slippe of a penne, which the Cardinall himselfe falls into, even while hee, for the like slippe, declameth against those holy Synodall Acts. And yet there is a worse fault in this reason. For it is no more shewed that <hi>Iohn</hi> dyed before <hi>Cyrill</hi> by that Epistle, than by <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ad Atticum.</hi> That Epistle having neither date, nor any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to induce that, may as well bee written <hi>Anno</hi> 448. as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 440.</p>
               <p n="21">
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:7679:230"/>21. His second reason is this: <hi>There are letters,</hi> saith hee <hi rend="sup">i</hi>, <hi>extant of Theodoret to Domnus the yeare following,</hi> (to wit, <hi>an.</hi> 437.) <hi>and that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Theodoret I will set downe in his due place, anno sequenti, the next yeare.</hi> Now in that next yeare, <hi>viz. an.</hi> 437. there is no Epistle of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> set downe by the Cardinall, nor is either <hi>Domnus</hi> or <hi>Theodoret</hi> so much as named in all his discourse of that yeare. Is not this now shewed <hi>apertissimè</hi>? you may bee sure the Cardinall would not have feared to performe his promise, but that there was somewhat in that Epist. w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> would have bewrayed his lewd dealing in this cause.</p>
               <p n="22">22. His third reason is drawne from the testimony of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> This, saith hee <note n="k" place="margin">

Is not this a worthy proofe to shew <hi>Iohn</hi> to have dyed seven years before <hi>Cyrill,</hi> as the <hi>Cardinall</hi> avoucheth that he did? Or do not you think the Cardinal was in some extasy, to produce <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi> as a witnesse for him, whereas <hi>Nicephorus</hi> (as the Cardinall himselfe also confesseth) gives to <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. yeares, and the Cardinall allowes him but thirteene; and whereas the Cardinall of set purpose refuteth the account of <hi>Nicephorus</hi>?</p>
               <p n="23">23. But will you bee pleased to see how the Cardinall refuteth him? <hi>Domnus,</hi> saith hee <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 436. <hi>nu.</hi> 12.</note>, <hi>was Bishop of Antioch an.</hi> 437. <hi>as is proved by an Epistle of Theodorets written to Domnus in that yeare, which Epistle I will set downe in his due place, to wit; an.</hi> 437.

               <p n="24">24. But see further how the Cardinall is infatuated in this cause: <hi>Iohn,</hi> saith he <note n="p" place="margin">

Why? the Easterne Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops knew right well, that some Canons were concluded both in the Councells of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> not only without, but quite contrary to the minde of the Pope and his Legates, as namely, that about the dignity of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which they, notwithstanding the resistance of the Legates, both approved and knew it to have beene ever held in force by the judgement of the Catholike Church, but specially by the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whose Patriarchall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they ever after the second Councell enjoyed, was both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and confirmed by those Canons. Never did the Easterne Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in those dayes, nor long after, esteeme the Popes owne, much lesse his Legates consent, so necessary to any Synodall Decree, but that without them the same might bee made and stand in force as the judgement of the generall Councell and whole Church. And to goe no further, what an unlikely and uncredible thing is it, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> and the rest in one yeare should make this confession to accept no more of those Synodall decrees, then the Pope or his Legates were pleased to allow; and the very next yeare after, contrary to that their confession, themselves hold a Synod, and make a Synodall decree in this cause of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> not onely without the Popes consent, or presence either of himself or his Legate, but even contrary to his <hi>definitive</hi> sentence made known unto them? the deviser of that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shewes himselfe plainely to have beene some of the Vaticane fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, who living perhaps in the time of <hi>Gregory,</hi> by this intended to infringe the dignity of the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and those Canons which were concluded both in the 2. and 4.

               <p n="5">5. If nothing else, the time when this Confession was made by <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Mennas</hi> demonstrates this. It was made after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree <note n="i" place="margin">

                  </note> assures us, after that <hi>Vigilius,</hi> fleeing the persecution of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> had fled, first, to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> then to the Church of <hi>Enthennia</hi> at <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; yea, after that the Emperour had revoked and abrogated his Edict against the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> and <hi>Vigilius,</hi> at the earnest intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Emperour, was now returned from <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:7679:233"/>
and this was at Nevermasse: neither did <hi>Iustinian</hi> persecute <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> neither did <hi>Vigilius</hi> for feare of his persecution flee either to S. <hi>Peters,</hi> or to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> neither did <hi>Iustinian</hi> intreat him to returne from thence, whither hee fled not at all, nor ever did the Emperour adnull or revoke his <hi>Edict</hi> against the <hi>three Chapters:</hi> then certainly the confession w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> by the Cardinalls own profession &amp; acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followed all these, must needs be like them, a fiction and meere forgery, never really &amp; truly made by <hi>Mennas, Theodorus,</hi> and the rest of those Bishops. Lastly, it was made the next yeare before the fift Councell was held, that is, <hi>anno</hi> 552. which is the twenty sixt of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> as the Cardinall witnesseth <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno illo</hi> 552, <hi>nu.</hi> 19.</note>; before which time it cannot bee imagined to have beene made; for the excommunication of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was published but in that yeare in which <hi>Vigilius</hi> came to <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi>

Now it is a riddle which <hi>Oedipus</hi> cannot dissolve, how <hi>Mennas,</hi> who, as wee have certainly proved by the Acts of the sixt Councell, dyed in the 21. yeare of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> should come now in his 26. yeare, that is, foure or five yeares after his death, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up a supplication to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and aske pardon of him for doing no offence against him. Me thinkes either the Pope should be afrighted with such a gastly sight, or <hi>Baronius</hi> ashamed to applaud such sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish fictions, as is that excommunication of <hi>Mennas</hi> made by <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius:</hi> and the <hi>Encyclycall</hi> Epistle of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> which mentions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves that excommunication, and this forged confession; none of which will suffer the ghost of <hi>Mennas</hi> ro rest, but bring a dead man out of his grave, to heare the Popes sentence thundred out against him, and then come with a bill of supplication to beg forgivenesse of his Holinesse, who had more reason to have prayed pardon of <hi>Mennas</hi> for disquieting and waking him out of that long and sound sleepe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So both the occasion, the contents, and the time, besides other circumstances, doe evidently convince that submission to bee a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. But how comes it then into the Popes <hi>Constitution</hi>? You must enquire this of <hi>Baronius,</hi> or of those who have accesse to the Vaticane whence this <hi>Constitution</hi> was taken: might one have the sight of the Vaticane copy, I doubt not but either there are some evident prints of error, in inserting this confession into it; or which I exceedingly mistrust, <hi>Baronius</hi> hath used a little of the Vaticane art in this matter. Howsoever, certaine it is that this confession hath neither fit cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, nor any dependence at all of ought in the Constitution, but it is both complete and much more orderly, this being wholly expunged, than if so idle a fiction be annexed unto it. But let the Cardinall and his friends looke to this matter by what meanes or whose fraud this was inserted, I thought needfull to admonish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fault, nor for the love and affection I beare to that Constitution of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> could I with silence see and suffer it to be blemished therewith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The second is <hi>Eustathius,</hi> of whom I would have spoken more in this place, but that his fained and fabulous narrations are so clearly discovered before, that I thinke it needlesse to adde ought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, or them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The third writing is a book in very great request with <hi>Baronius,</hi>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:7679:234"/>
and that is, those Epistles which beare the name of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> of which though much hath beene sayd before, yet will I here adde somewhat to manifest them further to bee counterfeit and most false. Among them, two are most eminent; that to <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> and the other to Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> That the former is forged, the other doth demonstrate. For by that to <hi>Dioscorus</hi> which was writ <hi>anno</hi> 444. <hi>Theodoret</hi> is made to say, that he had then beene Bishop 26. yeares <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Apud Bar. an.</hi> 444. <hi>nu.</hi> 23.</note>, whereas by the later writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>anno</hi> 449. it is cleare that in that yeare he had beene Bishop, no more <note n="o" place="margin">

So <hi>vice versa,</hi> that the later is forged is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by the former; for by that to <hi>Leo</hi> written <hi>an.</hi> 449. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> is made to say that he had then beene Bishop just 26. whereas by the other to <hi>Dioscorus</hi> written <hi>anno</hi> 444. it is witnessed that hee had beene Bishop 26. <note n="p" place="margin">

done herein, but make a way, and shew an occasion to carpe at the Synodall Acts of the fift Councell: and had not the Cardinall beene conscious of this fault in this Action, you may be well assured that he would not have omitted so foule an errour in the fift Synod, and the Acts thereof, as to avouch <hi>Domnus</hi> to have beene dead before the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> when hee scraped and raked together all that he could finde (and they are all but motes to this beame) whereby he might disgrace those Acts.</p>

                  <hi>to himselfe how any such Action could be held concerning Domnus, seeing Iustinian testifieth hee was dead before the Councell of Chalcedon, hee answereth, Iustinian was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this Action, and he had some other Action of the Councell of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon touching Domnus, Quam nusquam legimus, Which we no where finde.</hi> So <hi>Baronius:</hi> Who hereby would have it thought, that <hi>Iustinian</hi> and the fift Councell had not the true Copies of the Councell at <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but that these which the Cardinall frameth, they are the onely perfect and entire Acts thereof. Certainly <hi>Iustinian</hi> was ignorant of this Action, and so was the fift Councell. And no marvell, when the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it selfe was ignorant thereof. And whether the Emperour and the whole fift generall Councell, wherein were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent foure Patriarkes, and the Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> also, whether these living about an hundred yeares after that Councell, bee not like to have had more true Copies of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> than <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> living eleven hundred yeares after it, it is not hard to judge.</p>

               <p n="19">19.

                     <hi>Bar. an.</hi> 55. <hi>nu.</hi> 15.22.23.</note>, not onely the Emperour in that yeare revoked his <hi>Edict</hi> against the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> but he with <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and <hi>Mennas,</hi> were all in that yeare reconciled to the Pope, and a perfect peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on all hands before the moneth of Iuly; peace being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Mennas</hi> shortly after dyed. If then as <hi>Binius</hi> glosseth, <hi>Totilas</hi> was slaine <hi>eo anno,</hi> in that yeare wherein <hi>Iustinian</hi> is supposed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called his Edict, then was he certainly vanquished and slaine, not by <hi>Narses,</hi> for he as <hi>Procopius</hi>

It hence clearly followeth, that <hi>Anastasius</hi> can meane no other exile, than such as was inflicted upon him some three or foure yeares before, for the cause of <hi>Anthimus,</hi> and not that which followed the Councell: for the Councell was not held in the seventeenth yeare of the Gothicke warre, or six and twentieth of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> but in the eighteenth of the one, and seven and twentieth of the other, as the Acts doe witnesse:
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:7679:241"/>
or if <hi>Baronius</hi> will needs have the exile following the Councell, to be that from which <hi>Narses</hi> entreated that he might be delivered; then it certainly followeth upon this account of <hi>Binius,</hi> reckoning <hi>Totilas</hi> death to be in the six and twentieth of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> that <hi>Narses</hi> and the Romane Clergy entreated the Emperour to restore <hi>Vigilius</hi> out of exile, before he was cast into exile; nay before the Councell was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, or before <hi>Vigilius</hi> had given any cause why he should be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; which doth not well accord with the wisedome of <hi>Narses</hi> and the Romane Clergy to entreat, nor was it possible for the Emperour to grant. The same is further manifest by the other note of time which <hi>Binius</hi>

But for the truth of the matter, what <hi>Narses</hi> did, <hi>Procopius</hi> doth declare, who thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note n="e" place="margin">

                  </gap>, they who were with <hi>Narses</hi> report, that, <hi>dum precibus divinum numen placeret, while he appeased or pleased God by his prayer, &amp; other offices of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and gave due honour unto him, the Virgin, Mother of God appeared unto him, and plainly set downe the time when he should fight with the enemies, nor fight wth</hi> 
                  <hi>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> til he received a sign from above.</hi> Thus <hi>Evag.</hi> in whose words three things are to be observed: First, that <hi>Narses</hi> used noin vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or prayers to the blessed Virgin, or any other, but only to God, it was <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> numen, the very Godhead,</hi> which hee did in his prayers, &amp; offices of piety adore. Secondly, that <hi>Evag.</hi> mentioneth not either invocation, or adoration, used by <hi>Narses</hi> to the Virgin, or any confidence that hee reposed in her, or that she at al helped him in the battle, but only that she appeared unto him as a messenger, to signifie what time he should fight. Now as the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was no helper to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception of Christ, or in his birth, though, as a messenger from God, hee signifieth them both unto <hi>Ioseph,</hi> (<hi>Ioseph</hi> neither invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating him nor relying on him, but on God, whose messenger he was) even so, admitting the truth of this apparition, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did signifie from God the time when <hi>Narses</hi> should fight, but neither did <hi>Narses</hi> invocate or adore her, nor did shee her selfe more helpe in the battle than the Angell in the birth of Christ; nor did the confidence of <hi>Narses</hi> relie on her, but on God, whose messenger he then beleeved her to be. Let the Cardinall, or <hi>Binius,</hi> or any of them prove forcibly (which they can never doe) out of <hi>Evagrius</hi> any other invocation or adoration used by <hi>Narses</hi> to the blessed Virgin, and I will consent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in that whole point. Thirdly, all that <hi>Evagrius</hi> saith of that apparition of the blessed Virgin, is but a rumour and report of some who were with <hi>Narses</hi>: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, some say, <hi>Evagrius</hi> himselfe doth not say it was so, or that <hi>Narses</hi> either said or beleeved it to be so, but reported it was by some of the souldiers of <hi>Narses,</hi> whether true or false, that must relie on the credit of the reporters. Now for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall to avouch a doctrine of faith out of a rumour or report of how credible men themselves knew not, from such an uncertainty to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that Generals ought to relie on the aide of the blessed Virgin in their battels, and that shee, <hi>interpellata precibus, being invocated by their prayers,</hi> riseth up, and becomes a warrier on their side; this, by none that are indifferent can be judged lesse than exceeding temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:7679:242"/>
and by those that are religious will bee condemned as plaine su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and impiety. But let us returne now to <hi>Anastasius,</hi> whose narration, as it is untrue in it selfe, if the comming of <hi>Narses</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and victory over the <hi>Gothes,</hi> bee referred to that time, when <hi>Totilas</hi> had before wonne <hi>Rome,</hi> so it is much more untrue, if it bee referred, as by <hi>Binius</hi> glosse it is, either to the yeare wherein the Emperour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called his Edict, (which was never) or to the tenth yeare of <hi>Totilas,</hi> which was wholly ended before the comming of <hi>Narses</hi> into <hi>Italie,</hi> and before the fift Councell, and the Baronian banishment of <hi>Vigilius.</hi>

If both were Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or both hereticall, they agreed well enough together. As not Satans, so much lesse is Gods Kingdome devided against it selfe; if the Emperour Catholike, and the Pope hereticall, the worst the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ever did, was but to inflict just punishment on an heretike, the worst the Pope sustained was but a just recompence of his heresie and hatred of truth: The execution of Iustice never did, nor ever can hurt the Catholike Church. If the Emperor were hereticall and the Pope orthodoxal, there was trial of the Popes art &amp; skil in converting such a man to the truth; triall of his constancy and love unto Gods truth, whether by feare or favour he would forsake it: triall of his patience and fortitude in induring all torments, even death it selfe, for his love to Christ. All the hurt which such an Emperour did, or could doe, was to crowne him a glorious Martyr, and in stead of the white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of innocency, to send him in scarlet robes unto heaven; and woe be to that Church which shall thinke Martyrdome an hurt unto it, which was, and ever will bee the glory of the Catholike Church. <hi>Non decet sub spinoso capite membrum esse delicatum,</hi> when Christ, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and glorious Saints, and Martyrs, have gone before upon thornes and briars, wee must not looke to have a silken way, strewed with Roses and Lillies, unto the Kingdome of God.

Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth, that when Popes leave their See, and goe to the Court or Emperours presence, the ship of S. <hi>Peter</hi> is then in great hazzard: If <hi>Agapetus</hi> his comming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> or to the Emperour did not hazzard or endanger the Church, how came it to bee perillous a few yeares after in <hi>Vigilius</hi>? and where were now the most wise exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and the other, who in great wisedome could never be drawne to the East, and from their owne See? how was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church now fixed to <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Agapetus</hi> had it in the greatest majesty and honour at <hi>Constantinople</hi>? perceive you not how these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments lie asleepe in the cause of <hi>Agapetus,</hi> which the Cardinall rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth up when <hi>Vigilius</hi> goes to <hi>Constantinople</hi>? This, <hi>ab adventu,</hi> as all the Cardinals Topicke places, is drawne from the art and authority of Esops Satyr: If they make for the Pope, as the event did in <hi>Agapetus,</hi> then the Cardinall with his Satyrs blast will puffe them up and make
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:7679:245"/>
them swell to demonstrations: But if they make against the Pope, as did the event in <hi>Vigilius,</hi> all arguments in the world drawne from the cause, effect, or any other Topicall or demonstrative place, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall with a contrary breath can turne them al to Sophistications. He is another <hi>Iannes</hi> or <hi>Iambres</hi> of this age, when any argument or Topick place is for the Romish <hi>Pharao,</hi> it shall sting like a Serpent, when it is used against King <hi>Pharao</hi> it shall bee as dull and dead as a stick.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And yet what are those ill events and dangers whereunto the Church was brought by the comming of <hi>Vigilius</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi>? what hurt received it by the presence of the Pope with <hi>Iustinian</hi>? Sure the Cardinall in good discretion should have expressed them, at least some one of them, but hee was too politike to open such secrets of their State; for mine owne part I cannot but first condemne his foule ingratitude in this point. <hi>Vigilius</hi> before hee came to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> was earnest in oppugning the truth, and Catholike faith, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> hee defended them by words, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, by censures, by the utmost of his power: All the hurt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did him was this, that he converted him to the truth, that hee brought him to define, by an <hi>Apostolicall Constitution,</hi> that truth which before hee oppugned, and in this tune the Emperour kept him for five or sixe yeares together, but then when his old fit of heresie came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him againe, when at the time of the generall Councell he forsook the Emperours holy faith, his communion, and, as may bee thought, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his company and presence also, by this absence from the Emperor, he relapsed quite from the Catholike faith, even from that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had defended and defined, so long as hee kept society with the Emperour. When the Emperours presence made hereticall Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> for the space of five or sixe yeares a Catholike Pope, (at least in shew and profession) doe you not thinke <hi>Baronius</hi> to deale unkindly with the Emperour in blaming the time that ever <hi>Vigilius</hi> came to the Emperour, that is in effect to blame, and little lesse than curse the day wherein <hi>Vigilius</hi> renounced heresie, and embraced or made profession of the Catholike faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now as this good redownded to <hi>Vigilius</hi> in particular by his comming to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> so there is another and publike benefit which ensued thence to the whole Church, and that so great and so happy, that if we should (as the Cardinall doth) measure things by the event, the comming of <hi>Agapetus</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> though they glory therein more than in any other example of antiquity, is no way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to this of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> for by this comming of <hi>Vigilius</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by evident experience, that the Pope may say and gainsay his owne sayings in matters of faith, and then define <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> both his sayings, that is, two direct contradictories to be both true, seeing Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> first, while hee temporized with the Emperour defined <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> that the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> ought to bee condemned, and after that, when it pleased him to open the depth of his owne heart, defined the quite contrary <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> that the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> ought to bee defended. By it was further demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Pope may not onely be an heretike, but teach also and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:7679:245"/>
and that <hi>ex cathedra,</hi> an heresie to be truth, and so be a convicted, condemned, and anathematized heretike, by the judgment of an holy generall Councell, and of the whole Catholike Church. These and some other like conclusions of great moment for the instruction of the whole Church of God, are so fully, so clearly, so undenyably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in the cause of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> when he came to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> that had the Cardinall or his favourers (I meane the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Popes infallibility,) grace to make use thereof for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their eyes in that maine and fundamentall point, wherein they are now so miserably blinded, they might have greater cause to thank God for his comming thither, than for the voyage of <hi>Agapetus,</hi> or of any other of his predecessors undertaken in many yeares before.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Where are now the great hurts and inconveniences which the Cardinall fancieth by <hi>Vigilius</hi> his comming to the Emperour? Truly I cannot devise, what one they can finde, but the disgrace onely of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> in that upon his comming he shewed himselfe to be a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizer, a very weather-cocke in faith, a dissembler with God and his Church, pretending for five or six yeares that hee favoured the truth, when all that time he harboured in his brest the deadly poyson of that heresie, which as before his comming he defended, so at the time of the Councell he defined. This blot or blemish of their holy Father, neither I, nor themselves, with all the water in Tiber, can wash or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wipe away. The best use that can be made of it, is, that as <hi>Thomas</hi> distrusted, to make others faithfull and void of distrust; so God, in the infinitenesse of his wisedome, permitted Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> to be not only unconstant, but hereticall in defining causes of faith, that others by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the Popes judgement as infallible, might not be hereticall: and yet even for this very fact, thus much I must needs say, that if the Cardinall thinke it was the place, or the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that wrought this disgracefull effect in <hi>Vigilius,</hi> it may bee truly replyed unto him much like as <hi>Themistocles</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">

The summe then of the Epistle of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> was to signifie to these he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall and deposed Bishops, that himselfe was an Eutychean, as they
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:7679:250"/>
were, the Epistle it selfe, set downe both in <hi>Liberatus</hi> and in <hi>Victor,</hi> clearly testifieth the same, for therein <hi>Vigilius</hi> writeth thus, <hi>eam fidem quam tenetis, Deo adjuvante, &amp; tenuisse me, &amp; tenere significo, I signifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that, by Gods helpe, I have held, and doe now hold the same faith which you doe:</hi> but the Pope adds one clause further for secresie, wel worthy observing; <hi>O portet ut haec quae scribo nullus agnoscat, it is needfull, that none know of these things which I write unto you,</hi> but rather your wisedome must have me in suspition, more than any other, that so I may more easily effect, and bring to passe those things which I have begun. See you not here, as in a glasse, the deep hypocrisie and heresie of <hi>Vigilius</hi>? with what subtilty and closenesse he labours to undermine the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the whole Catholike faith, even then when hee would seeme to favour it, and therefore wisheth the Eutycheans to speake of him as one who they suspected most of all to bee against them. <hi>Liberatus</hi> adds, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> under his Epistle writ a confession of his faith also, <hi>in qua duas in Christo damnavit naturas, wherein hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the teaching of two natures</hi> in Christ: and dissolving the Tome of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> hee said, <hi>non duas Christi naturas confitemur, we doe not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge two natures in Christ,</hi> but one Sonne, one Christ, one Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of two natures, (to wit, two before the adunation) and againe, <hi>qui dicit in Christo duas formas, whosoever saith that there are two formes or natures in Christ,</hi> either working according to his owne property, and doth not confesse one person, one essence, <hi>anathema sit, let such a man be accursed.</hi> Could <hi>Arius, Eutyches,</hi> or any heretike in the world more plainly condemne and accurse the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> yea, the whole Catholike Church, and Catholike faith? It is here a fine sport to see how the two Cardinals, <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> how other pettifoggers, such as <hi>Gretzer</hi> and <hi>Binius,</hi> doe here bestirre themselves to quit <hi>Vigilius</hi> of this blemish, and of the heresie and impiety taught in this Epistle. First, <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ not this Epistle, it is but a counterfeit and forgery: Next, if hee did write it, yet he did it while he was an usurper, not when hee was the true and lawfull Pope. Lastly, hee did not hereby embrace heresie <hi>ex animo,</hi> nor define it as Pope, but onely by an exteriour act hee condemned the faith. Thus they toile themselves to wash the Ethiopian, and turne a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amore into a mike white Swanne.</p>

In his Epistle he professeth to hold the same doctrine of one onely nature in Christ with <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus</hi>; there is little reason then to thinke, that hee did in his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription adjoyned, condemne the professors of that doctrine, of which <hi>Dioscorus</hi> was one of the chiefe, as deepe in that heresie as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches</hi> himselfe: What shall wee say then to <hi>Liberatus,</hi> in whom <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorus</hi> is named?

It was <hi>Nestorius</hi> then not <hi>Dioscorus</hi> whom <hi>Vigilius</hi> accursed; it is but the errour or corrupt writing of <hi>Vigilius</hi> Epistle in <hi>Liberatus,</hi> (which wee also condemne) and not the Epistle of <hi>Vigilius</hi> at which the Cardinall unjustly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relleth.</p>
               <p n="27">27. His third and last shift is worst of all. If <hi>Vigilius</hi> had indeed writ this Epistle, <hi>why then</hi> (saith he <note n="g" place="margin">

vexed him so long; nor by the Emperour Iustinian, when he was furiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged against him; nor by the fift Synod, which was offended with him for refusing to come to the Councell; nor yet by Facundus, when he writ angerly against him?</hi> these were publikely debated, <hi>nec tamen de dicta epistolâ, vel usquam mentio; yet is there not any mention, or light signification of any such Epistle.</hi> Thus the Cardinall. Of whom I againe demand where he learned to dispute <hi>ab authoritate humanâ negativè</hi>; the old and good rule was, <hi>Neque ex negativis recte concludere si vis</hi>; but the Cardinall hath new Analytickes, and new-found rules of Art, <hi>Ex negativis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris concludere si vis.</hi> Himselfe witnesseth <note n="h" place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor <hi>Theodorus,</hi> nor <hi>Iustinian,</hi> nor the fift Councell, nor <hi>Facundus</hi>? that being a publike and knowne censure, had been a matter of farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter disgrace to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> farre more justifiable than the epistle writ pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and secretly to <hi>Anthimus,</hi> and commanded by <hi>Vigilius</hi> to bee kept close that none might know it. See you not how vaine this shift of the Cardinall is? How it crosseth him in his Annals, to slander <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> as symoniacall, as censured by <hi>Silverius,</hi> both which seeing they are not upbrayded to him by the forenamed persons, but set downe in the Cardinals Analytickes, sure they are impostures, and forgeries. What though none of them upbrayded this Epistle unto him? Is it not enough that it is assuredly testified and recorded by S. <hi>Liberatus,</hi> by Bishop <hi>Victor,</hi> two who lived and writ at that same time? what if most of them knew not of this Epistle, which was sent secretly by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and by his advice kept closely by <hi>Anthimus</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi>? what if they all knew it, and yet having other crimes enough to object, thought it needlesse to mention that, as it seemes they did the Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and censure of <hi>Silverius</hi>? what if they were not so spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as the Cardinall is, and therefore would not say the worst they could against his Holinesse?</p>
               <p n="28">28. But see the strange dealing of the Cardinall! How or why should <hi>Theodora</hi> upbrayd this to <hi>Vigilius</hi> for the not restoring of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimus</hi>? that quarrell for the restoring of <hi>Anthimus</hi> (as I have often sayd, and clearly proved) was a meere devise and fiction of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> it was nothing but <hi>Alcibiades</hi> dogs tayle. Or how should <hi>Iustinian</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid it, when he was so enraged against <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and persecuted him for not restoring <hi>Anthimus</hi>? Seeing neither <hi>Iustinian</hi> persecuted <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> nor was enraged against him, but for the space of five of six yeares they both sang one note, they fully consorted together? or how should <hi>Mennas</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> upbraid it, when they were excommunicated by <hi>Vigilius?</hi> Seeing that excommunication, &amp; all the circumstances of it are merely fictitious, as by the death of <hi>Mennas,</hi> (which was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that forged excommunication of him) was demonstrated? Are not these worthy reasons to disprove this Epistle to bee writ by <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> which all relie on fictions, &amp; on most untrue and idle fancies? And
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:7679:254"/>
whether <hi>Facundus</hi> upbraided it or no, may bee questioned, nor will it bee clearly knowne, untill they will suffer <hi>Facundus</hi> to come out of their <hi>Vaticane,</hi> where hee lyeth yet imprisoned. But as for the fift Councell, it was great sillinesse in the Cardinall, once to thinke that they should or would upbraid this Epistle to him, they used the Pope in the most honourable and respectfull manner that could be wished, they uttered no one harsh or hard word against him, but what was rightly said or done by him, as his condemning of <hi>Origen,</hi> his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Three Chapters</hi> before the time of the Councell, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mention and approve it also. They sought by lenity to win the Popes heart to consent unto the truth, which they defended: seeing they could not prevaile with him, yet they would have the whole world to testifie, together with the Popes peevishnesse, their owne lenity, equity and moderation used towards him, and that it was not hatred or contempt of his person, nor any precedent occasion, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the truth and equity of that present cause, which enforced them to involve him (remaining obdurate in his heresie) in that <hi>Anathema</hi> which they in generall denounced against all the pertinacious defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> of which <hi>Vigilius</hi> was the chiefe, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearer to the rest. Did the Cardinall thinke with such poore sleights to quit <hi>Vigilius</hi> of this Epistle? If nothing else, truely the very imbecillity and dulnesse of the Cardinals reasons and demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this point may perswade, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> and none but he was the author of it. <hi>Baronius</hi> was too unadvised without better weapons to enter into the sand, with old Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this cause, who is knowne to bee, <hi>plurimarum palmarum vetus ac nobilis gladiator,</hi> and in this combate with <hi>Baronius</hi> hee hath played the right <hi>Eutellus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Come, let us give to him in token of his conquest, <hi>corollam &amp; palmam,</hi> and let <hi>Baronius</hi> in remembrance of his foile, leave this Epistle to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> with this Impresse,

               <p n="30">30. But because I have no fancy to this Pythagoricall kinde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there are one or two reasons which declare, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ this Epistle after the death of <hi>Silverius,</hi> when he was the onely and true lawfull Pope; for the former is the narration of <hi>Liberatus,</hi> who in a continued story of these matters, after the death of <hi>Silverius</hi> relates how <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ this; <hi>Silverius,</hi> saith he <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gret. loc. cit.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>Liberatus</hi> useth here an anticipation, and sets downe that before which fell out after. Prove that <hi>Gretzer</hi>; Prove it? why, his proofe is like his Masters, It is so, because it is so: Other proofe you shall have none of <hi>Gretzer</hi>: He thought, belike, his words should passe for currant pay, as well as a Cardinals, but it was too foolish presumption in him to take upon him to dispute so <hi>Cardinali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tèr</hi>; that is, without reason; why should it not be thought, seeing we find nothing to the contrary, that <hi>Liber.</hi> in his narration followed the order and sequell of things and times, as the law of an historian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, rather than beleeve <hi>Gretzers</hi> bare saying, that it is disorderly and contrary to the order of the times and event of things?</p>
               <p n="31">31. This will further appeare by the other reason drawne from the time when this Epistle was written: <hi>Baronius</hi> referres it to the yeare 538. wherein <hi>Silverius</hi> was expelled, and saith <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bar. an</hi> 538. <hi>nu.</hi> 14, 15.</note>, that though <hi>Vigilius</hi> had truly writ it, yet it is no prejudice to the <hi>Apostolike</hi> See, <hi>cujus tunc ipse invasor,</hi> of which hee was an invader and intruder at that time when it was written.

time also <hi>Vigilius</hi> had a greater worke, and of more importance to looke unto, than the writing of letters to deposed Bishops, to wit, to provide that <hi>Silverius</hi> should not live, that himselfe should not bee expelled his owne See, and how upon <hi>Silverius</hi> death himselfe might be againe lawfully chosen Pope; none I thinke will suppose that <hi>Vig.</hi> writ this before <hi>Silverius</hi> death in that yeare, but after it, and after all his troubles ended, when hee having quiet possession of the See, had leisure to thinke on such matters.

This was the most Diabolicall plot and project of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> to seeme a Catholike, and openly to professe before <hi>Iustinian</hi> and others the Catholike faith, and while they are secure of him, closely in the meane space to undermine and blow up at once all Catholikes, and with them the Catholike faith. So there is no repugnance, no incoherence at all in these, though contradictory letters of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> both of them, the orthodoxall to <hi>Iustinian, Theodora,</hi> and <hi>Mennas,</hi> the hereticall to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimus, Theodosius,</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> both were writ by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> both by Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> both by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> when he was the onely true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pope; but the former were writ by the personated and visored, the later by the naked and unmasked Pope <hi>Vigilius.</hi>

The third evasion then is this, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> in heart embraced the true faith, and onely fained himselfe in this Epistle to be a favourer of the Eutychean heresie. <hi>Vigilius,</hi> saith the Cardinall <note n="d" place="margin">

Thus farre the Cardinall saith well; but hee is extremely mistaken in one circumstance, in that hee saith, that his open or Catholike profession was mentall, and <hi>ex animo,</hi> and his private and secret detestation of the Catholike faith, was verball and fained.

What thinkes he of <hi>Iudas?</hi> his plotting to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Christ was close and secret, his owne fellow Apostles knew not of it, but sayd, Master, is it I? his friendly conversing with Christ, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at table, and kissing, was open and publike, yet his outward cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, even his kisse was dissembled, and trecherous; his malice, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and murderous affection which were secret and covered under those outward shewes of love, were true and serious. The Powder-plotters dealt closely and secretly, all under boord: their pretended subjection was open, and yet the treason was serious, their obedience but fained. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was but a meere novice in the Romane Court when hee writ this, and imagined that Popes doe not seriously that which they doe secretly.</p>

If they notwithstanding their ambition were (as certainly they were) Arch-heretikes, and taught their heresies with hereticall minds, then not onely the Cardinals reason is inconsequent and ridiculous, but <hi>Vigilius</hi> for all his ambition may not onely write that Epistle with an hereticall minde, but be even an Heresiarch, or rather a Pope heretike.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Againe, did he not write this with an hereticall minde? why did not the Cardinall expresse what that hereticall minde is, which was now wanting in <hi>Vigilius</hi>? An hereticall minde is no other but a minde pertinaciously and obstinately addicted to heresie. It was he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie doubtlesse which he writ, in teaching with <hi>Eutyches</hi> but one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be in Christ. That he writ this obstinately, is cleare, seeing he writ it against the knowne judgement of the holy Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that is, of the Catholike Church; which none can doe but even thereby he shewes an obstinate and pertinacious minde, rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church. If this be not, no hereticke in the world ever had an hereticall minde. If <hi>Arius, Nestorius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> when they writ or taught their doctrines with this minde, were hereticall and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, then most certainly <hi>Vigilius</hi> who writ this Epistle with the like obstinate and pertinacious minde, must needs bee judged to be rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious against the Church, and as heretically affected in minde, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> or <hi>Eutyches</hi> himselfe. Pride and insolency is so farre from excluding an hereticall minde, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would here perswade, that it is even an individuall companion, yea essentiall unto it.

               <p n="39">39. You see now how inconsequent both these reasons of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals are, seeing <hi>Vigilius</hi> might bee hereticall in heart, though both his writings were secret, and his minde ambitious. Let us yet a little further debate this matter with the Cardinall. Say you that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did not write this hereticall Epistle <hi>ex animo,</hi> or from his heart? I pray you when looked your Cardinalship into the heart of <hi>Vigilius</hi>? how know you that he was not an heretike in heart, when he was so hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in profession? or how know you of S. <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> of <hi>Boniface</hi> 8. or of any of all the Popes that lived since their times, that they were not heretikes and plaine Infidels in heart, when their words were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike? I would gladly for my learning be informed how <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or the most acute <hi>Lynceus</hi> of them all do or can know, otherwise than by their outward professions, what any of all the Popes beleeved and thought in their heart. What <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, when he decreed the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:7679:259"/>
doctrine of Transubstantiation: what <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, when he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Luther:</hi> or what <hi>Paul, Iulius,</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their <hi>Trent</hi> Councell? How know you that in their hearts they beleeved those doctrines? or that they did not dissemble and faine, as you say <hi>Vigilius</hi> did? What can you say for <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, which may not be sayd for <hi>Vigilius</hi> also? Doth <hi>Pius</hi> say, he did before, and now doth thinke as the <hi>Trent</hi> masters doe? Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> sayth the like, and most plainly, <hi>Eam fidem quam tenetis,</hi> that faith which you (<hi>Anthimus, Severus,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi>) doe hold, I signifie unto you, that I have held, and that I doe now hold the same. Doth <hi>Pius</hi> call the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers his beloved brethren in Christ? so doth <hi>Vigilius</hi> call those hereticall Bishops his beloved brethren in Christ: nay in <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> he calls them even Christs. Doth Pope <hi>Pius</hi> professe an unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himselfe and them, all making one body of the Church? Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth the like, and he doth it more significantly: We, sayth he, preach this same doctrine that you doe, <hi>Vt &amp; anima una sit &amp; cor unum in Deo; so that there is in you and mee but one soule, and one heart in God.</hi> How can any speech be cordiall, if this testifying himselfe to be one soule and one heart with them, doe not come <hi>à fibris,</hi> but onely <hi>à labris</hi>? Doth Pope <hi>Pius</hi> approve the doctrine of the <hi>Trent</hi> conspirators? So doth Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> the doctrine of those <hi>Eutychean</hi> heretikes? Doth <hi>Pius</hi> condemne and anathematize <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> and all who thinke or teach otherwise than himselfe and his <hi>Trent</hi> Conventicle taught or beleeved? so doth Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> condemne and anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all who deny two natures in Christ, all who beleeve otherwise than himselfe and his <hi>Eutychean</hi> fellow heretikes did. In all these there is as much to be sayd for Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> as for Pope <hi>Pius:</hi> and if you please to adde that one other agreement also, as of <hi>Vigilius</hi> it is sayd, that they knew <hi>crudelitatem fidei</hi>; so may it in like manner bee truly sayd of Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> that this did manifest unto all men, <hi>crudelitatem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei, the cruelty of his and his Trent Councels faith.</hi> If by these outward acts the Cardinall can know <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth to have <hi>ex animo</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their <hi>Trent</hi> heresies, why can he not by the like outward acts know <hi>Vigilius</hi> to have <hi>ex animo</hi> condemned the Catholike faith? If <hi>Vigilius</hi> for all these outward acts, and so many testimonies and evidences of a willing minde did dissemble, and thinke in his heart otherwise than he writ, how will or can the Cardinall prove unto us that <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. and the whole Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> did not dissemble, and both write and speake otherwise than they thought in heart? Hath the Cardinall some windowes to pry into the secrets of the heart of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth and the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell, which are dammed up that he cannot see into the brest of <hi>Vigilius</hi>? If Pope <hi>Pius</hi> upon his word and writing be to be credited, much more is Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> seeing he did not only by words and writing teach this hereticall doctrine, but (which <hi>Pius</hi> did not) he bound himselfe by a sacred oath that hee would teach the same. And which is yet a farre greater evidence, <hi>Vigilius</hi> after this did teach the like hereticall doctrine, to overthrow the same Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the cause of the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> which hee did so unfainedly and so cordially, that for teaching the same he incurred the just indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:7679:259"/>
of the Emperour, the curse of the holy generall Councell, the publike hatred of all Catholikes, and, if wee may beleeve <hi>Baronius,</hi> even exile and persecution also. Why might not the same <hi>Vigilius</hi> from his heart teach <hi>Eutycheanisme,</hi> as well as <hi>Nestorianisme</hi>? The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of those two heresies looke contrary wayes indeed, but their tayles, like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes, are joyned together to undermine the Catholike faith, and the holy Councell of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> Hee who once is proved to be treacherous in this sort, and to doe this once from his heart, <hi>semper praesumitur,</hi> is alwayes to bee presumed treacherous in the same kinde: Hee who did this in the <hi>Three Chapters,</hi> would have done it in <hi>Eutycheanisme,</hi> his heart, his desire, his purpose at both times was the same, the odds was accidental in the oportunity which served bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the one, than in the other; what need they excuse his teaching <hi>Eutycheanisme</hi> to have been only labiall, when it is cleare his teaching of <hi>Nestorianisme</hi> was cordiall? If they cannot excuse Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> for teaching <hi>Nestorianisme</hi> from his heart, which cannot possibly be done, what need they be so nice in denying his teaching of <hi>Eutycheanisme</hi> to have come from the same heart? his fault in them both being alike, one answer will alike serve for them both.</p>
               <p n="44">44. But what, thinke you, meant the Cardinall so to busie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and bee so curious about the heart and secret minde of <hi>Vigilius</hi>? what though hee did not in heart, yet, <hi>exteriori professione,</hi> by his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall writing, by his outward confession, by that <hi>Vigilius</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Catholike faith, as the Cardinall <note n="d" place="margin">

                     <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.39.</note> knoweth and seeth the hearts of all the sonnes of men; let men, who cannot see the heart, looke to his words, to his writings, to that profession, by which hee teacheth others. If that be hereticall, what boots it them though his heart bee orthodoxall? <hi>Confirma fratres, &amp; pasce oves,</hi> are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts, they looke abroad and outwardly, not to the inward and hidden man in the Popes breast. If he think as <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> and teach as <hi>Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Magus,</hi> as <hi>Arius, Nestorius,</hi> or <hi>Eutyches</hi> did, is he not an hereticall teacher, an hereticall Pope, a confirmer of his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in heresie, a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nay, a very prisoner of the sheepe, with worse weeds than the Socraticall Cicuta? If the Pope onely thinke and beleeve heresie, why, thought is free, (to wit, from mans eye, much more from his censure) his thought is for himselfe, that errour is personall, it hurts none but the Pope himselfe. If either by word or writing hee teach heresie, that is Pontificall, it is the fault of his office, of his Chayre, which should have beene infallible, this hurts his sheepe and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Nor skilleth it at all in what manner, whether by word or writing, by what occasion or motive hee teacheth heresie, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all, or upon any occasion hee wittingly and willingly teach it, that is the onely point which is questioned. <hi>Vigilius</hi> condemned the Catholike faith, saith Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

Why not for any like passion of the minde may the Pope condemne the Catholike faith? On what a ticklish the flippery ground doth their whole faith stand, when either the Popes ambition, or feare, or favour, or love, or hatred, or anger, or desire, or a fit of any other perturbation, which disturbeth his minde, may procure, as at this time it did in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius,</hi> an anathema to the Catholike faith? Best it were for them to renew the Stoicall sect and doctrine, and receive it in the Church, that out of those sober and unmoved mindes, as out of an happy Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of Popes, the Cardinals might in the Conclave still elect a Pope voyde of all passions and perturbations, and transplant him out of the Stoicall to their <hi>Apostolicall Chaire.</hi> But sure, so long as they goe no further than the Conclave, they shall never finde any but of the same metall with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> one that may bee tossed every way with ambition, with envy, with love, with hatred, with feare, and every passion of his minde, as a powder-plot to blow up the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith; and when he hath done that by his words, by his writing, by his preaching and teaching, by any of his outward acts whatsoever, Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can excuse it, and wipe away all the disgrace of it, as here hee doth in <hi>Vigilius</hi>; hee did it not with an hereticall minde, for hee did it for ambition, hee did it for feare, hee did it for hatred; hee did it for some other passion, hee did it onely by an exteriour act, and not <hi>ex animo</hi>: But in the meane time whether hee did it <hi>ex ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> or otherwise by his exteriour act, the Catholike faith is blowne up from the foundation thereof, as much by the Popes act, as by the act of <hi>Arius,</hi> of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> or any other heretike; and the Church hath a goodly amends indeed, that the Pope forsooth did not (which is impossible for him or all heretikes in the world to doe) blow it up with an imagination or inward thought, but with an exteriour act of his teaching by word or writing.</p>

               <p n="42">42. The fourth and last Evasion or excuse for <hi>Vigilius</hi> fact in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Epistle, is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> also; <hi>Vigilius,</hi> saith hee <note n="h" place="margin">

                  </note>, did not at that time define any thing against the faith, <hi>tanquam Pontifex,</hi> as hee was Pope. What shuffling and shifting is this in the Cardinall? hee did not define any thing against the faith, as Pope: Hee did then define that which was against the faith, but hee defined it not as Pope, for otherwise it had beene foolish to say, he defined it not as Pope, when hee defined it, neither as Pope, nor as no Pope, when hee defined it not at all. Againe, what a worthy saying is this of a Cardinall? <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> did not at that time define it as hee was Pope; at that time, to wit, while <hi>Silverius</hi> lived and was the onely Pope, at which time, as himselfe in expresse words saith, <hi>Vigilius Papa non erat, Vigilius was not then the Pope.</hi> What needed the Cardinall say hee defined it not at that time as hee was Pope, when at that time he was not Pope? This reduplication, <hi>quatenus Papa,</hi> implies hee was Pope, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pope hee defined it, but hee defined it not as hee was Pope, but as hee was a private man, or some other way: Would not the Cardinall laugh, if <hi>Gretzer</hi> or any such good friend of his should say, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> at that time while hee was at <hi>Ingolstad</hi> writ not his Controversies as he was Pope, or, hee writ them not as he was a Turke, a Iew, or Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane? But leaving these shifts, which demonstrate plainly, that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> had a desire to say somewhat in excuse of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but knew not what, and therefore snatched at this or that, or any thing, though it were never so crosse unto himselfe, and such also as he could not hold. Let us consider the Exception it selfe; <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ this Epistle, that is confessed; hee writ it when hee was the onely true and lawfull Pope, that wee have proved; hee defined heresie in it, and that which is against the faith, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> implyeth; hee condemned in it the Catholike faith, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in plaine words expresseth. Thus far the cause is cleare. Now whether Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> in it defined here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and condemned the Catholike faith, as he was Pope, or no, that is the point here to be debated.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Some may thinke, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by those two reasons drawne from secresie and an ambitious minde, by which he laboured before, to prove, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did not condemne the faith <hi>ex animo,</hi> meant also that he condemned it not as Pope, for it followeth in the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:7679:261"/>
next sentence, <hi>siquidem Epistolam scripsit,</hi> as giving a reason of his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If any like to take <hi>Bellar.</hi> words in that sort, then his reasons are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand refuted; for as <hi>Vigilius</hi> might, <hi>ex animo,</hi> write heretically, both privately and out of ambition, so also might hee, <hi>tanquam Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex,</hi> condemne the faith, notwithstanding both his secrecy and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mind; secrecy and an ambitious mind are no more repugnant to the one, than to the other, they are compatible with them both; the Pope may use his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority in teaching, as wel private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as publikely, as well with <hi>Iudas</hi> in ambition, as with <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> in sincerity of heart. But the Cardinals Apologist, who it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with the Cardinall about his intent herein, doth ease us of those reasons, for hee <note n="i" place="margin">

                  </note> tels us plainly, that from <hi>Vigilius</hi> his desire of secrecie, <hi>nil aliud colligit, Bellarmine collects or proves nothing else,</hi> but this, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did not write his letter from his heart or <hi>seriò,</hi> that hee did it not in earnest. It is but a sport with <hi>Gretzer,</hi> or with the Pope, to condemne the Catholike faith; they doe it, but they doe it not in earnest, they doe it <hi>jocularitèr</hi> not <hi>seriò.</hi> Have ye indeed such May-games &amp; sports at <hi>Rome,</hi> as to condemne the faith, and then say, I was in jest, and in sport?

But let us leave them to their sports, till the fall of their Babylonish house make a catastrophe and dolefull end both of their actors &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators: That which I now note, is, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not in those words, <hi>Siquidem Epistolam scripsit, &amp;c.</hi> from the privatenesse or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy prove any thing else, but that <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ it not <hi>seriò,</hi> in earnest and from his heart; that hee writ it not, <hi>tanquam Pontifex,</hi> this those words prove not, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in those words collects not: So we have now nothing but the bare saying of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> without any proofe, without any reasons, and I must needs confesse, I hold it a most suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient encounter for any man to <hi>Bellarmines ipse dixit,</hi> to oppose, <hi>ipse dico,</hi> yet because I desire rather to satisfie such as seeke the truth, then contend with those who seeke to smother and betray the truth, I will a little further enlarge this point, and see if it may be cleared by evidence of reason, that Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> did not onely condemne the Catholike faith at that time, but that he did it even as hee was Pope, and, <hi>tanquam Pontifex,</hi> condemne the Catholike faith.</p>

If this bee hereticall doctrine, seeing Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> fed them, and confirmed them in this faith, then certainely he taught heresie as Pope; that is, hee exercised his Papall office, even that of feeding and confirming his brethren, which is peculiar to the Pope, as Pope, to the teaching and approving of heresie at this time.</p>
               <p n="46">46. If yet wee shall goe somewhat more precisely and exactly to worke, according to line and measure; those acts of feeding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming doe but in a very equivocall sense (for their doctrine is full of Equivocation) agree to other Bishops, but still a maine difference or odds is to bee observed, betwixt the Popes feeding and confirming, as hee is Pope, and all others; when any other Bishop teacheth heresie, because his teaching is subordinate and fallible, one may, nay, he must doubt or feare to feed on such food, he must still receive it with this caution or <hi>tacit</hi> appeale of his heart, if his holinesse commend it for an wholesome diet of the soule. But if the Pope teach any heresie; if hee say that the Sunne is darke; the left, the write hand; poyson an whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some food; Eutycheanisme or Nestorianisme, the orthodoxall faith; here, because there is no higher judge to whom you may appeale, you are bound upon salvation, without any doubt or scruple at all, to eate and devoure this meate; you may not judge, nay, you may not dispute or aske any man whether it be true or no, the Popes teaching is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and therefore infallible, indubitable; this is to teach, to feed, to confirme as Pope, for none can thus teach or feed, but onely the Pope as Pope. So the same hereticall doctrine, when it is taught by the Pope, as he is a private man, is a private instruction without any publike authority to teach; when by him, as a Presbiter, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction with publike authority to teach, but without judicatory po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to censure the gainsayers; when by him, as a Bishop, it is both with publike authority and judicatory power to censure, suspend, or excommunicate the gainsayers, but yet subordinate and fallible, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:7679:262"/>
a virtuall appeale to the highest tribunall of the Pope, when by him, as Pope, it hath all the former conditions, both publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to teach, and judiciall power to censure, and, which is the Popes peculiar prerogative, as Pope, to doe those with <hi>infallibility</hi> of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>supremacy</hi> of authority, such as none may refuse, or doubt to beleeve and embrace.</p>

But this quirke and subtilty will not helpe their cause, nor excuse the Pope from erring as Pope; for as in this sense no Pope, as Pope, doth erre, because then every Pope should erre in all doctrines which hee teacheth, so neither in the same sense doth any Pope, as Pope, teach the truth, for then every doctrine of every Pope should bee true. Againe, as according to this sense, no Pope as Pope, so no Bishop as Bishop, no Presbyter as Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter doth erre or teach heresie, for did hee in his teaching erre as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop or Presbyter, then every Presbyter and every Bishop, and so even the Apostles themselves should erre in their teaching. But as <hi>Vigilius</hi> or <hi>Liberius</hi> when they taught <hi>Arianisme, Eutycheanisme,</hi> or <hi>Nestorianisme,</hi> did this not simply as Popes, but as persons not knowing as in duty they should, what to teach; or knowing it, but willingly teaching the contrary to their knowledge, which in duty they should not: even so <hi>Nestorius, Macedonius, Arius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Bishop, and Presbyter, when they erred, they erred not simply as Bishops, or as Presbyters, but as persons failing in their Episcopall, or Presbyteriall duties, either not knowing the truth, as by their office they should, or wilfully oppugning and contradicting the truth, as by their office they should not: So by his subtilty, if any applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in it, not only the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> yea, all Bishops and Presbyters in the world shall be as free from errour, as his holinesse himselfe, yea, all professors of any Art, Science, or faculty, shall plead the like Papall exemption from errour; every man shall bee a Pope in his owne faculty; no Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian speaking incongruously as a Grammarian, but as wanting the skil required in a Grammarian; no Iudge giving a wrongfull sentence as a Iudge, no Galenist ministring unwholsome physicke as a Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, no Artificer working any thing amisse in his trade, as an Artificer, but as being defective in the duties either of that knowledge, or of that fidelity which is required in a Iudge, a Physitian, and in every Artificer. If they will exempt all Bishops and Presbyters, all Iudges and Physitians from erring, as they are such Officers or Artificers, we also will in the same sort and sense allow the like immunity to the Pope: If they notwithstanding this subtilty, will admit another Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:7679:263"/>
to erre as Bishop, they must not thinke much if wee exempt not the Pope as Pope: For, to speake that which is the very truth of them all, and exactly to measure every thing by his owne line, a Iudge sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as Iudge doth pronounce a judiciall sentence, as a skilfull and faithfull judge, an upright judiciall sentence; as an unskilful or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudge, an erronious or unjust sentence. A Bishop or Presbyter simply as Bishop or Presbyter, doth teach with publike authority in the Church; as a skilfull and faithfull Bishop or Presbyter he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truth of God; as an ignorant and unfaithful Bishop he teacheth errours and heresies in the Church, the one without, the other with judicall power to censure the gainsayers. The like in all Arts, Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and faculties is to be sayd, even in the Pope himselfe. A Pope sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as he is Pope and defined by them, teacheth both with authority to teach, with power to censure the gainsayers, and with a supremacy of judgement binding all to embrace his doctrine without appeale, without doubt, as an <hi>infallible</hi> Oracle: as a skilfull or faithfull Pope he teacheth the truth in that sort, as an unskilfull or unfaithfull Pope he teacheth errour or heresie with the like authority, power, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, binding others to receive and swallow up his heresies for Catholike truth, and that with a most blind obedience, without once doubting of the same.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Apply this to <hi>Vigilius</hi> &amp; his hereticall Epistle: In a vulgar sense; <hi>Vig.</hi> erred as Pope, because he erred in those very Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifical duties of feeding &amp; confirming, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are proper to his office. In a strickt sense; though hee did not therein erre simply as Pope, but <hi>quatenus talis,</hi> taught onely with a supreme binding authority, yet hee erred as an unfaithfull Pope, binding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others by that his Pontificall and supreme authority to receive <hi>Eutycheanisme</hi> as Catholike truth, without once moving any doubt or making scruple of the same. What may wee thinke will they oppose to this; If they say <hi>Vigilius</hi> doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in this Epistle, that hee writ it by his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority.

The like in many other Epistles of <hi>Leo,</hi> and of other Popes might easily bee observed. Not the tenth part of their decretal Epistles, such as they writ as Popes, have this clause of doing it by their <hi>Apostolicall</hi> authority expressed in them. It is sufficient that this is vertually in them all, and vertually it is in this of Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi>: Yea, but hee taught this onely in a private letter to a few, to <hi>Anthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Severus</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> not in a publike, generall, and encyclicall Epistles, written for instruction of the whole Church. What, is the Pope fallible in teaching of a few, in confirming three of his brethren?

The whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his <hi>Apostolike</hi> authority much shined in this decision, more than in any other, where either his Cardinals or a Councell hath ought to doe: much more was this done by him as Pope, than any of them.

That <hi>Vigilius</hi> had before his eyes at this time, that was in stead of a thousand Cardinals unto him, seeing he as <hi>Ecclesiae Princeps,</hi> defined <hi>Eutycheanisme,</hi> notwithstanding that most holy and generall Synod, yea against that Synod, what could the advice of another, or of a few Cardinals have avayled at this time?</p>
               <p n="50">50. Thus all the evasions which they use, being refuted, it may now be clearly concluded, not onely that <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ this impious and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall Epistle, and writ it when he was the true and lawfull Pope; but that he writ it also <hi>ex animo,</hi> even out of an hereticall heart, and writ it as he was Pope, that is, in such sort as that by his Pontificall and supreme authority hee confirmed that heresie which hee taught therein. And this is the former of his Acts, which as I told you is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable, his purpose and intent therein being the overthrow of the Councell at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and of the whole Catholike faith.</p>

Both w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> because they are hid from mans eyes, the Church leaving the judgement of certainty and verity onely to God, passeth her sentence which is the judgement of charity, by the outward and apparant acts which are open unto them: whomsoever shee seeth not, nor findes by certaine and evident proofe to have manifested the detestation and revocation of their hereticall and impious writings, which before they published and maintained, all those though dead ten, an hundred, or a thousand years before, she by her censure doth, and doth most justly condemne, accurse, and anathematize, as by her sentence against <hi>Theodorus</hi> of Mopsvestia, dead an hundred yeares before, is most evident, whose condemnation and anathema pronounced by the fift Councell, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by all succeeding generall Councels, by all Catholikes, and even by the whole Catholike Church. Not will I here dispute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a sentence doth not sometimes passe, <hi>errante clave,</hi> the party having repented, whom they not having proofe of his repentance, thought to dye impenitent; but howsoever that fall out, none may justly complaine of the Churches judgement as unjust or unequall herein; for besides that it is presumed, that those who so notoriously and publikely by their hereticall writings doe scandalize the Church and people of God, if they had seriously repented would have expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some publike and outward testimony of the same; the Church would by this severity of her censure, teach all men a lesson which is very hard to learne; first, that they should not have such an itch and ambitious desire to write or utter those detestable heresies which lurk within their breasts; or if they cannot observe that, yet at least to learne to be so lowly and humble in heart, as to revoke their impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and blasphemies, although to some blemish and disgrace of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet to the great honour of Gods truth, and the satisfaction and edification of the holy Church, which they had scandalized. If in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition they will first oppugne the truth, and then in a worse pride of heart, not be reclamed to the truth, nor shew their love unto it, why should not the Church by her most charitable judgement shew her open detestation of their persons, who in the insolency of their hearts will not shew any open detestation of their heresies? That <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ a papall Constitution in defence of heresie, it is apparent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable: that he at any time revoked that writing, I wish it were, but it is not yet evident. The like may be sayd of <hi>Baronius,</hi> of <hi>Pighius,</hi> of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:7679:265"/>
                  <hi>Eccius,</hi> of the <hi>Laterane, Florentine,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> conspirators, of all who have whet their tongues against other truth, and specially to uphold that fundamentall heresie of the Popes <hi>infallibility.</hi> Their writings for heresie are evident, that they ever reclamed those writings, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident: and if ever they and their cause come to bee tryed, in such a free, lawfull, and oecumenicall Councell as was this fift under <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> they may justly feare, and certainly expect from the Church, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the disclaming of their writings may by certaine proofe be made knowne) the very like sentence, though a hundred yeares after theirs, as passed upon <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopsvestia</hi> an hundred yeares after his death. And because the houre-glasse for repentance in runne out to the former, all that we can doe, is (which I seriously now doe from my heart) to cry amaine unto others, to admonish, exhort, yea even pray and entreat them by the mercies of God, and by the love of their owne soules, first that they keepe their tongues and pennes from once uttering any heresie; or (if they have not done that) with the same hands to give the medicine, wherewith they gave the wound, and as openly, nay much more openly to disclame than they have ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed their impious and hereticall doctrines.</p>
               <p n="53">53. You have now some view both of the life and death of <hi>Vigilius.</hi> The exact pourtraiture of the Popes lives, <hi>Baronius</hi> had beene able to set forth if he had listed; but he addeth such <hi>fucos,</hi> and so many sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall colours, that indeed scarce you shall see any one of them in his Annals set out in his native and naturall habit. If ought be amisse in this our description, and not set forth according to the lively linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his impieties, the equall reader will not too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously censure the same.
