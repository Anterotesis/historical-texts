            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>I </hi>Received a Booke directed to me from your Ladiſhip, with intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſhould expreſſe my ſenſe of it: I acknowledge, Madam, the favour you have done me in ſending it; but the return you expect hath its diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: the Book being now paſt the Preſs, and of ſuch an argument, had I ſeen it before it was publique, I ſhould have ſaid it was not likely to pleaſe, &amp;c. but that is nothing to me; your deſire I ſuppoſe is to know how I like it. I conceive your Ladiſhip is not ſo far a ſtranger either to the Booke which you ſent, or to me, whome you are pleaſed thus to owne, but that you take me to be of a different judgement from the Author in this his forme, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning State or Church. And it may be your Ladiſhip did therefore call me
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95233:4"/>
to ſpeak as one that would be leſſe partial. Give me leave then Madam in plain Engliſh to ſay, that albeit the Author hath ſhewn good ſufficiency of parts, and taken much pains in order to his deſign; yet I conceive, Firſt, that he is not a little miſtaken in thinking the Iſrael-Common-wealth or Government under<hi> Moſes </hi>ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable unto his purpoſe as he would make it. Next, that when the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion 'twixt his form and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical is diſputed over and over again, reaſon and experience will ſtill plead for the latter. Nor can the ballance he pretends ſtand ſo ſteady in his form, as in a well tempered Monarchie, by reaſon the temptations of advancing are more like to ſway with many in a Common Weal, then with one, &amp;c. in the height of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Next, When I conſider ſuch a change by this Modell from what was ever in, &amp;c. And that the<hi> Agrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95233:5"/>

            <p>THe Doctor's letter though it be ſcandalous (for to charg a writer of little things, poor miſtakes, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down by ignorance, or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without proof, is no better) was yet but private; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may be aſked why I would make it publique? whereunto I anſwer, That what a Divine will have to be true, is no leſſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique then if it were printed; but more, for he will Preach it; and Preaching communicates unto more then can read: Alſo his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Doctrines are exceeding dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. For in government that is caſt upon Parliaments or popular elections, as ours hath ever been
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95233:6"/>
and is, <hi>to take wiſe men, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and known among their Tribes to be Rulers over them,</hi> hath ever (except where the people were not free in their elections) been, and muſt ever be, the certain and infallible conſequence. Now wiſe men, and underſtanding, and known among their Tribes, muſt needs be (at leaſt for the greater part) of that rank which we now call the Ariſtocracy or Gentlemen. Whence the Senate in every well ordered Commonwealth hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of the Ariſtocracy or Gentry. And that the Senate ever had the ſupreme Authority, as well in matters of Religion as State, is not only clear in all other popular Governments, but in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; which alſo is confirmed by our Saviour in the New, <hi>Mat. 23. 2. The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes</hi>'s <hi>ſeat, and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they bid you obſerve,</hi> (both He
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95233:6"/>
and His Apoſtles obſerved the national Religion) <hi>obſerve and do;</hi> for the liberty of conſcience or prophetick right in the Common-wealth of Iſrael, as in others was ſuch, as by which Chriſtianity not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the national Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might grow. But <hi>do not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>after their works, for they ſay and do not.</hi> In their inquiry after <hi>John, Joh.</hi> 1. they ſeem to imply or ſay, that if he were <hi>that Prophet,</hi> there was nothing in the Law why he might not introduce his <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and therefore why he might not gather Churches, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people in his way. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe when they come to doing, they <hi>kill the Prophets, and ſtone them.</hi> This indeed Chriſt blameth, being the abuſe of their power. But whereas the ſupreme Authority of the Senate, whether in matters of Religion or State, is confirmed by all divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95233:7"/>
prudence; and the Senate is the more peculiar Province of the Gentry: The Doctor ſaith that <hi>Lamentable it is to ſee ſo many,</hi> (not only men of ſuch parts or quality as the people in their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not likely to look upon) <hi>but eſpecially Gentlemen of good parts</hi> (then which the people upon like occaſions have no other refuge) <hi>ſo opinionate, ſo boldly medling in matters of Religion, as if they had forgot or did not underſtand their Article of the Catholique Church.</hi> Now where ever the Clergy have gained this point, namely, that they are the Catholique Church, or that it is unlawful for Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, either in their private capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to diſcourſe, or in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique to propoſe, as well in the matter of Church as State Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, neither government nor Religion have fayled to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into meere Prieſt-craft.

                     <hi>I </hi>Received your Paper wherein you are pleaſed to propound Quaeries, and ſay an obligation now lies upon me to render my reaſons of diſſenting, or to anſwer the Interrogatories. But you muſt give me leave to ſay, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation ſtill ariſeth from my reſpect to my Lady and your ſelf, not from the matter or manner (as you ſeeme to imply) of the delivering my former judgement. For I could not conceive that by the favour and honour my Lady did me in ſending the Book, I had loſt my freedome, and ſtood bound either to complye, or be challenged as an Adverſary to try out the difference.

            <p>The Doctor hath written hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the Politicks; Then this among the occaſions or ſubjects of writing, there is none of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er moment. I am a beginner in this art, and have no deſire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon any man; but if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not teach him, to learn of him. But my Senior in it contradicts me, and gives me no reaſon. Now to contradict a man and give him no reaſon, is to give him an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; and to demand reaſon in ſuch a caſe, that is, for ſuch an affront to ſend ſuch a challenge, as provoketh unto no other conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then that for truth, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto Scripture, and not againſt Laws, concerns a mans
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95233:9"/>

                  <p>I Have reaſon ſtill to think and ſay, The Government or Common-wealth (as you call it) of the<hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, </hi>was of all other leſſe applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your form, which ſuppoſes a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95233:10"/>
Senate debating, propoſing, and the people reſolving, chooſing, as<hi> page 15. </hi>To which there was nothing like in that Government. You find indeed princes and Heads of the Tribes, and may call them a Senate, and read of the Aſſemblies of the people, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch power or authority, Both of them receiving Laws by the hand of<hi> Moſes </hi>without any debate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. And 'tis in a manner confeſſed,<hi> page 18. </hi>where you ſay the function of that Senate was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive only, the Laws being made by God. And if we look to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeventy, we find it was upon the advice of<hi> Jethro, </hi>and that not to be as a Councel to<hi> Moſes, </hi>but as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Judges for his caſe in the Adminiſtration of the Laws, which rather ſutes with the condition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Min ſters of Juſtice under a Monarch, Gods Vice-gerent on earth, as all Kings are in a more large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as<hi> Moſes </hi>was more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95233:10"/>
in that Theocracy. Therefore I did not a little wonder at your aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inferences,<hi> Pag. 16, &amp; 17. </hi>Where you ſpeak of their making God their King, their power of rejecting and depoſing him as their civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the harſhneſſe of the phraſe may be mollified, but the thing aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I ſuppoſe cannot be defended<hi> (viz.) </hi>any ſuch power in the people to God-ward; your inference alſo ſeems ſtrange and infirm, that they had power to have rejected any of thoſe Laws. What you aſſert in the<hi> 17. page </hi>of all the Laws given by Covenant, is true in a ſober ſenſe, but the inference ſtrange, that only which was reſolved (or choſen) by the People of<hi> Iſrael </hi>was their Law. This is ſo far from good Logick, that it falls ſhort of good divinity; for it muſt ſuppoſe God and the People on equall termes at their entring that Convenant; whereas God often (eſpecially in<hi> Deut.) </hi>ſhews his right of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95233:11"/>
and enforces their obedience to his commands upon antecedent obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; his being the Lord their God, his chooſing them out of all Nations to be a peculiar People, his bringing them out of the Land of<hi> Egypt: </hi>Much more might be ſaid to ſhew theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the People receiving laws from God (in which they were onely paſſive) are far from proving any power in the People as to God-ward, or from concluding generally the power in the People of reſolving and chooſing Laws; and therefore this Common-wealth of<hi> Iſrael </hi>not appliable to your purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>IN my Book I call the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereupon we are diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but though I think I did not much amiſs, I am the firſt that ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it ſo, and you make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95233:11"/>
in your firſt Letter to ſpeak after me: But when I come to call it, as all they doe that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon it, then you begin to doubt, and it is <hi>the Commonwealth (as I call it) of the Hebrews,</hi> whence you will be more then ſuſpected, not to have read any of thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. And yet how confidently is it laid to me in your firſt Letter, that <hi>I am not a little miſtaken in thinking the Iſraelitiſh Commonwealth or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under</hi> Moſes <hi>to be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to my purpoſe, as I would make it?</hi> Nevertheleſs when you come in Anſwer unto this Quaere to give your Reaſons, you bring this for one, that <hi>Page 18. I ſay the function of the Senate was onely executive, the Laws being made by God;</hi> Where Firſt the word <hi>onely</hi> is not mine, but of your impoſing; Secondly, when you ſhould ſhew that I am miſtaken in thinking the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo appliable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95233:12"/>
to my purpoſe as I would make it, you ſhew that I make it no more appliable to my purpoſe than it is: Which is not fair, eſpecially when I gave you ſo cleer a Reaſon, that albeit the Authority of propoſing laws appertain unto every Senate (as ſuch) yet the Laws of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of the Hebrews ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been all made by an infallible Legiſlator, even God himſelf, the Senate had no Laws in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to propoſe, but came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to propoſe, when thoſe laws given in the beginning came to need addition; for if you find the Kings upon ſuch occaſions as <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 7. 2. and <hi>Hezekiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 30. propoſing, and the People reſolving, was this likely to have been introduced by them? or if the People had the reſult in the Monarchy, muſt they not much more have had it in the Commonwealth? Wherefore the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95233:12"/>
Authority of propoſing unto the people, as will better appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, was derived by the King from the Judge, by the Judge from the Sanhedrim, by the Sanhedrim from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>Moſes</hi> from God: As <hi>(Exod.</hi> 19. 5.) where God giveth him inſtructions for a Propoſition unto the People; <hi>Thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and tell the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ye have ſeen what I did unto the</hi> Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, <hi>&amp;c. Now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed, and keepe my Covenant, then you ſhall be unto me</hi> a Kingdome of Prieſts: If you will (not whether you will or no) you ſhall be (which relates unto the future) unto me a Kingdome; that is, I will be your King. God having given theſe inſtructions unto his ſole Legiſlator, <hi>Moſes came</hi> (accordingly) <hi>and called for the Elders of the People, and laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faces all theſe words that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95233:13"/>
the Lord had commanded him. And all the People anſwered together</hi> (gave their ſuffrage, Nemine contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente) <hi>and ſaid, All that the Lord hath ſpoken we will doe: And</hi> Moſes <hi>returned the words</hi> (that is, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, or reſult) <hi>of the People unto the Lord.</hi> Wherefore God was King in <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Covenant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Himſelfe or his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> and reſolved by the People: Now that he was afterwards reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the People (when they choſe another King) <hi>that he ſhould not reign over them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7. are his own words: And if in theſe words he ſhew plainly that the People had power to reject a Law that was not onely propoſed unto them, but reſolved by them, then muſt it needs be included even in Gods own words, that the People muſt have had power to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected any thing that was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and not confirmed by them:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95233:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And yet you tell me, <hi>that this is ſo far from good Logick, that it falls ſhort of good Divinity;</hi> And why? becauſe <hi>it muſt ſuppoſe God and the People on equal termes at their entring that Covenant.</hi> Then that a King either cannot covenant (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) with his Chandler to ſerve him with Wax, or that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler was upon equal Terms, or Hail-fellow well met with the King, at their entering that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, comes up to good Divinity. Such is the Logick which you chop with me, for you are beyond my underſtanding! But the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt part of Logick I underſtand well enough, not to envy them that ſeem to have more.</p>
                  <p>For if by the Word <hi>Terms</hi> you underſtand the Conditions of the Covenant, it is fair: as to theſe indeed, the parties covenanting are ſo far equal, that they may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually will or chooſe; elſe it were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95233:14"/>
a Precept or Command, not a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but if by the Word <hi>Terms</hi> you underſtand the dignity or power of the parties, it is not fair, but an equivocation; for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the Parties in that ſenſe is nothing at all unto the equality of the Covenant; wherefore the impiety you would fix upon me, is your own, and ariſeth from your want of diſtinguiſhing between the Almighty Power of God in which he is above all things, and his infinite love whereby he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Heavens, and deſcendeth unto his poor creatures; in the former regard to talk of electing or depoſing God <hi>(who is King, be the Heathen never ſo unquiet)</hi> were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, impious; but in the latter it is moſt certain, that He ruleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong no other than a conſenting, a reſolving, a willing People; Or tell me whether the reign of God on the neck of the Turks be the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95233:14"/>
ſame with that in the hearts of his elect, or wherein conſiſts the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? Moreover to what I have ſaid, and more than what I have ſaid for the debate that was in the Senate, and the reſult that was in the People of <hi>Iſrael, Grotius</hi> hath ſummed up the Talmudiſts in this Note upon the Tenth Verſe of Deu. 18. <hi>Notandum praeterea ſcita Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus nonnull a ſive legi interpretandae ſive praemuniendae fact a evanuiſſe, non modò ſi Senatus ante receptum ubi<expan>

and imperious through the long rule of their father, was the true cauſe why the people choſe to have a King, and ſo fell into Monarchy, under which they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red worſe; for though there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to come with a great deal of coſt, as in the War with <hi>Saul,</hi> a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to be defended, yet by another War againſt his ambitious ſon, and after him a <hi>Solomon;</hi> in the next generation the Tribes rent in ſunder, and beſides the execrable wickedneſſe of the moſt of their Kings (the like whereunto was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known,) gave not over hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, till <hi>Iſrael</hi> firſt, and then <hi>Judah</hi> fell into miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captivity.

And this is another of thoſe things which you have the confidence to call Notions, albeit in ſo doing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95233:33"/>
you muſt needs ſin againſt your own conſcience: but what is that to Intereſt? if this place be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Ordination is reſtored unto the People; and ſo Divines loſing it, there is an end of Prieſt-craft, as by telling the ſtory of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, (though in brief) will better appear. Ordination in the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being primarily nothing elſe but Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Magiſtrates; was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſuffrage of the people, or (as is ſhewn by the Talmudiſts upon <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. in <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad)</hi> by the balot. Nor was it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe till the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> got a whim of their own, without any precept of God, to Ordain their Succeſſors by the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> or Impoſition of hands, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being ſo ordained calld <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> became capable of being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into the Judicatories, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cheating the People of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95233:33"/>
right of electing their Magiſtrates: the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> inſtituted the firſt Presbyterian Government; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs this Form as to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, was not alwaies held ſo neceſſary among the Jews, but if the party were abſent it might be done by letter, and ſometimes though he were preſent it was done by verſe or charme only. But whereas the Senate, if not every Senator, by this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had right to Ordain; by <hi>Hilel</hi> High Prieſt and Prince of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi> (who lived ſome three hundred yeares before Chriſt) means was found to get the whole power into his hand, which being of ſuch conſequence, that no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate could thenceforth be made but by the High Prieſt, it changed this ſame firſt Presbytery (the High Prieſts becomming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Monarchs,)</hi> as I may ſay, into the firſt <hi>Papacy;</hi> for this track
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95233:34"/>
was exactly troden over again by the Chriſtians; firſt, to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, from thence to the Biſhop, and that by means of the ſame <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> or Impoſition of hands taken up from the Jews; and out of this <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſtept up the <hi>Pope,</hi> and his Seventy Cardinals, anciently the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or Seventy Elders of <hi>Rome</hi> in imitation of thoſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Moreover it is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good Divines, as <hi>Bullinger, Muſculus, P. Martyr, Luther</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton,</hi> that this <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of hands is not neceſſary, for that the Apoſtles took up ſome things from the Jews, as commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of goods, which are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, you will not deny: and if this were not of that kind, then wherefore in the place alledged, where the <hi>Chirotonia,</hi> prayer and faſting, as all things neceſſary unto Ordination are mentioned, is the <hi>Chirotheſia</hi> omitted even by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95233:34"/>
themſelves? Nor can you find that it was otherwiſe than ſparingly uſed by them in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> or ſuffrage of the people; and perhaps there onely where the people had not the Civil right of any ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, by which where it was, they Ordained <hi>Elders in every Church.</hi> And in this place comes that of your Anſwer unto the <hi>7th Quaere,</hi> Namely, <hi>That the Church acted three hundred years before the Civil Power became Chriſtian,</hi> to be very queſtionable. For that <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> a City of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> was ſo free, that <hi>Paul,</hi> being a Native thereof, claimeth the right of a <hi>Roman,</hi> is clear in Scripture; Nor is it more obſcure in ſtory, that the people in the Cities of <hi>Lycia, Pamphylia, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caonia,</hi> or <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> in which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ordained Eccleſiaſtical El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by the <hi>Chirotonia</hi> of the Church or Congregation, had not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95233:35"/>
only the Ancient right but cuſtom of electing their civil Elders in the ſame manner: and where was the neceſſity, or ſenſe that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to convert them unto the Chriſtian Religion, ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to depoſe them, than which nothing could have cauſed a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter jealouſie, obſtruction, or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal upon their Doctrine? But if the Apoſtles uſed the words <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> and <hi>Chirotonia</hi> in theſe places according unto the right of the people, and the known ſenſe (in which they had been alwaies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) then acted not the Church three hundred years nor halfe a hundred years before the Civil Power became Chriſtian: And if the Biſhops, when the Emperors became Chriſtian, made no bones of receiving their Mitres from the Civil Magiſtrate, they muſt have done ill, had they known or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Church in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt

times had waved the Civil Magiſtracy. <hi>Paul</hi> arriving at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> converts <hi>Dionyſius</hi> one of the Senators, and ſome others unto the Chriſtian faith: Suppoſe he had converted the whole S<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But he converted but a few; wherefore as he had no aid, ſo he had no hinderance from the Magiſtrate; This, then, was a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd Church, I think, or what was it? If the <hi>Prophets</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> went up and down preaching unto the people, by whom they were followed; and if ſome of theſe that were thus followed were true, and more of them falſe, the people that followed them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95233:36"/>
could not be all of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, though it is like that no man would follow ſuch an one as he was not perſwaded was true. But the people chooſing at their own diſcretion whom they would follow, how could theſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations be leſſe gathered than theſe when the people were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three ſects, <hi>Phariſees, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi> and <hi>Eſſcans,</hi> which could be no other? Nor doth the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi> though they had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſending unto <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt (John</hi> 11. 25.) to know who he was, and why he baptized, refuſe him the like <hi>Prophetick right,</hi> uſed by him firſt, and afterwards by our Saviour and the Apoſtles, without the Authority of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim;</hi> Nor doth <hi>Paul</hi> blame the Congregations of <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas (1 Cor.</hi> 1.) in that they were gathered, but in that they put too
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95233:36"/>
much upon them that gathered them: How then doth it appear that my Inference for gathered Congregations <hi>now,</hi> is a little thing or poor miſtake below a Gentleman of parts; when I ſay no more than that gathered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were in uſe both before and after Chriſt, notwithſtanding the National Religion that was then ſettled? and therefore ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Congregations for any thing in the Old or New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I can find to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, might be <hi>now,</hi> though a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion were ſettled. And if this be not true, the Teſtimony, which you bear in your preſent practice, is againſt your ſelf; for what elſe are your Congregations <hi>now,</hi> that will uſe none other then the Common-prayer, but gathered?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95233:37"/>
To conclude, it ſhould ſeem by you, that if the National Religion were ſo ſettled, that the meddling with holy things by any other than a Divine, might be reſolv'd as boldly (and to uſe a fine word) opinionately done, as if it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Article of our Creed; you would be pleaſed. But the National Religion and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience ſo ordered in <hi>Oceana,</hi> that neither the Intereſt of the Learned, nor the Ignorance of the unlearned can corrupt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (in which caſe though there might, yet there is no probability, that there would be any gathered Congregations, this being the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Remedy for that which you hold a diſeaſe) you are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed: for thus you Conclude,</p>
