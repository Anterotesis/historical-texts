            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Humble and Modest
PROPOSALS
For Uniting the
PROTESTANT INTEREST
IN THIS
NATION.</head>
            <p>I Doubt not but every pious and sober Protestant of this
Nation is now in great grief and anguish of heart to
observe the passionate Differences and unchristian Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which dayly increase amongst Christians united in
one and the same Doctrine of their Religion, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from the Errours and Superstition of the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> which cannot but oblige every serious man who wisheth
Peace and Prosperity to the Kingdom he lives in, to consider
what should be the occasion of those unhappy and ruinous Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
we have so long suffered under, and to offer probable means
for the composing of them.</p>
            <p>As to their first rise, I doubt not but they owe their Original
to the <hi>different manner of the Reformation, and the establishing of the
Orders which each Church did think fit and convenient for it self,</hi>
(as the Reverend and Pious Mr. Hooker acquaints us) <hi>which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105557:3"/>
were so peremptorily established under that high commanding Form,
which rendered them to the People as things everlastingly required by
the Law of that Lord of Lords, against whose Statutes there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to be taken; by which means it came to pass, that one Church
could not but accuse and condemn another of disobedience to the Will
of Christ,</hi> in those things where manifest difference was between
them: <hi>Whereas the self-same Orders allowed, but yet established in
more wary and suspense manner, as being to stand in force till God
should give the opportunity of some general Conference what might be
best for them afterwards to do; This, I say, had both prevented all
occasion of just dislike which others might take, and reserved a greater
liberty unto the Authors themselves of entering into farther consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
afterwards; which, though never so necessary, they could not
easily now admit, without some fear of derogation from their Credit:
<hi>And</hi> therefore that which once they had done, they became for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
resolute to maintain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we consider the shortness of that time wherein our
first Reformation continued under <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and the
necessity of many learned and pious Ministers of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> to flee into foreign Countries (as <hi>Strasburgh, Geneva,</hi>
&amp;c.) in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, for the preservation of their lives,
where they frequently conversed with those eminent Divines, who
were the great Reformers there; 'tis no wonder that some of
them should return better pleased with their Discipline than their
own, especially considering that several of them had intimate
Acquaintance and Conversation with one of the Reformers,
whom the Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> thought <hi>incomparably the wisest
man that ever the French Church did enjoy since the hour it enjoyed
him.</hi> In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, King <hi>Iames,</hi> and our late Soveraign's
Reigns, 'tis well known how our Differences still increased, until
that unhappy War broke out, by which the Non-conforming
Interest prevailed, so that the Presbyterian Discipline was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to be fixed as the established Form of Government in
this Nation; our Universities, Preachers, Writings, Education,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were generally modelled thereto: by which means the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number of the Trading part of the Kingdom, many of the
Gentry, and some few of the Nobility (observing the Precepts
and Practices, Lifes and Deaths of most of that Clergy to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105557:3"/>
pious and exemplary) joyned with men of this or the like Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.
Since which time it pleased God to restore our present
Soveraign to his Throne, and the Wisdom of the Nation thought
it convenient to establish the same Discipline which our first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
judged prudential; not abating or leaving indifferent
those Ceremonies, which unhappily have occasioned those hither-to-irreconcilable
Differences between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and
the Dissenters in it, and have been matter of dispute between the
Reformers, even from the first Reformation from Popery: Upon
which account many of the Non-conforming Divines laid down
their Livings, and the old Disputes began afresh to be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and so are like to be continued, until we be either ruined
by Popery, or healed by Moderation, which is the onely Salve to
cure the Churches wounds, and that admirable Weapon-Salve for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
proposed to the wisdom of Superiours by the Reverend
Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> who having highly commended the <hi>prudence
and temper of the French Churches in composing their publick Forms
of Prayer, that they were so far from inserting any thing controversial
into them, that Papists themselves would use them.</hi> And saith he,
<hi>The same temper was used by our Reformers in the composing our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
in reference to the Papists, to whom they had an especial eye, as
being the onely Party then appearing, whom they desired to draw into
their Communion, by coming as near them as they well and safely could.
And certainly those holy men who did seek by any means to draw in
others at such a distance from their Principles as the Papists were,
did never intend by what they did for that end to exclude any truly
tender Consciences from their Communion. That which they had laid
as a Bait for them, was never intended by them as a Hook for those of
their own Prefession; but the same or greater Reason which made
them at that time yield so far to them then, would now have perswaded
them to alter and lay aside those things which yield matter of offence
to any of the same Profession with themselves now: For surely none
will be so uncharitable toward those of his own Profession, as not to
think there is as much reason to yield in compliance with them, as with
the Papists. And it cannot but be looked upon as a Token of God's
severe displeasure against us, if any, though unreasonable Proposals of
Peace between us and the Papists, should meet with such entertainment
among many, and yet any fair offers of Vnion and Accommodation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our selves be so coldly embraced and entertained.</hi> Thus far our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105557:4"/>
Reverend and Learned Dean of <hi>Pauls.</hi> Upon these and some
other like Considerations, I should humbly propose to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of this present Parliament, some probable means to put an
end to our present Differences, and to Unite us for the future;
that so we may become a flourishing Nation, free from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Divisions of former Ages.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>For the First.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>I Humbly propose, That the Ceremonies at present enjoyned
by Law, might be left to the liberty of the Clergy to use
or lay aside; and that because the Dissenters on the one hand do
declare that their conformity to them would be sinful, and the
Church of</hi> England <hi>on the other hand hath not onely declared
upon our first Reformation in the account she hath given of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
why some be abolished and some retained, That</hi> as those
Ceremonies were taken away which were most abused, and did burden
mens Consciences without any cause; so the other that remain are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for a Discipline and Order, which <hi>(upon just cause)
may be altered</hi> and <hi>changed. <hi>But since his Majesties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,
the Church of</hi>
                  </hi> England <hi>hath again declared in her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to the Common-Prayer,</hi> That the particular Forms of Divine
Worship, and the Rites and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> appointed to be used, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things in their own nature <hi>indifferent and alterable,</hi> and
so acknowledged; it is but reasonable that upon weighty and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Considerations, according to the various exigency of times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
such changes should be made therein, as to those that are in
place of Authority should from time to time seem either necessary or
expedient. Accordingly we finde that in the Reigns of several Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of blessed memory since the Reformation, the Church upon just and
weighty consideration her thereunto moving, hath yielded to make such
Alterations in some particulars, as in their respective times were
thought convenient. <hi>Thus far the Church of</hi> England. <hi>And of
late I finde, that a very eminent Member thereof, the Reverend
Dean of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>hath acquainted us in a publick Sermon prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by him at the</hi> York-shire-<hi>Feast,</hi> That though it was not for private
persons to undertake in matters of publick concernment, yet he thought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105557:4"/>
he had no cause to doubt but the Governours of our Church (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the advantages of Authority and Reason too, as they
thought, on their side) were persons of that Piety and Prudence, that
for Peace sake, and in order to a firm Vnion amongst Protestants, they
would be content, if that would do it, not to insist upon little things,
but to yield them up, whether to the infirmity or importunity, or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
in some very few things, to the plausible exceptions of those that
differed from them.</p>
               <p>Now seeing the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath once and again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
her excellent temper and moderation for the preservation
of Peace and Unity in the Church, the great end and designe of
all Church-government, we have little reason to question her
readiness <hi>(at such a time as this is)</hi> to comply with so
modest a Proposal as a liberty of using or refusing those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which she saith, <hi>In their own nature are indifferent and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and upon weighty and important considerations, may be changed,</hi>
&amp;c. especially considering that by this condescention of hers, she
will certainly bring into her Communion a great number of the
pious, moderate, and more considerative Non-conformists:
Which will not onely adde strength to her self, but give a great
joy and content to all those who have wish'd well to the Peace,
Unity, and Prosperity of this our Church and Nation; and have
long made it the subject of their Prayers, that they might live
to see those days in <hi>England,</hi> wherein <hi>Iudah</hi> might not vex <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi>
nor <hi>Ephraim</hi> envy <hi>Iudah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I would likewise humbly propose, That the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Dissenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> might be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by Act of Parliament, provided they neither Preach'd, Wrote,
nor discours'd against the Doctrine or Government of the Church
as by Law established; and that, because Charity, which is kinde,
and thinks no evil, would oblige a sober and indifferent person to
believe that the reason of their Separation from our Church, did
onely proceed from a tenderness of Conscience (impressed upon
them by the force of their Education, Study, Conversation, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
lest in complying with the present established Form of Worship, they
should sin against God, and wound the peace of their own Souls:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105557:5"/>
for otherwise their own present quiet and interest must necessarily
have obliged them to a different Practice, they having been under
a continual danger and hazard of the execution of the Laws at
present established against them; whereby they have been not
onely deprived of that Maintenance which by the countenance of
Authority they might otherwise have expected and publickly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
but exposed to many wants, difficulties, and sufferings.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>As to the Vniting of us for the future,</head>
               <p>I humbly propose to the wisdom of this present Parliament,
That an Act might be passed, whereby every person (after a
limited term of years) intending to take holy Orders, should be
incapacitated for any Church-preferment, or for a License to
preach in private Congregations, who could not give a satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
account of his proficiency and ability in Church-History and
Primitive Learning, whereby he might be able to give a clear
and plain account of what Discipline and Order were used in the
Church of God nearest our Saviour's and the Apostles days,
when Differences and Errours in Doctrine or Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began first to spring up; with the Authors, occasion, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof. The Advantages which must necessarily attend the
making of such a Law, would be very great both to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Church and State; amongst which I beg leave to name
the following.</p>
               <p>1. We might hereby (for the future) more assuredly hope
for, and expect Peace and Union amongst our Ecclesiasticks;
they having been all well acquainted with Primitive practice, and
therein with the rise and growth of all Heresies, Schisms, and
Divisions in the Church, and with the fatal consequences that
have attended them; whereby in all probability they would not
more rationally than unanimously make choice of one and the
same Form of Worship and Discipline, but most heartily unite
in their affections to one another, endeavouring with all their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
strength to maintain the Church in Peace and Purity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105557:5"/>2. By this means we might be assured to enjoy the most
Learned Clergy that ever this Nation brought forth, who would
not onely prove a greater Bulwark against Popery on the one
hand, but Schism and Faction on the other; and being so well
accomplished for the Ministerial Function (before they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it) might much more assuredly engage the affection and hearts
of their people, by spending in private the greatest part of the
Week in instructing them in the Principles, and encouraging them
in the Practice of the Christian Religion; a Duty, alas, too much
neglected in our days.</p>
               <p>3. By this means we might be sure of Preferments to answer
every mans merit, especially if the Parliament should think it
prudential to raise a sum of Money for the purchasing all Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
and Advowsons, the latter of which to be annexed to
the several Colledges in both Universities; one of the principal
reasons we can give at present why we have more Clergy-men
than Livings, being this, That a great number of ordinary
Country-men and Trades-men, out of an ambitious designe to
make their Children Gentlemen, do send them to the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
though they be not able to maintain them above three or
four years: Whereas were there such a Law (as I proposed)
once established, they would be willing to bring them up to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Professions and Trades, much more suitable for them; and
persons of better Estate and Quality would be encouraged to bring
up their Children in the Universities, and continue them there
until they were arrived to that pitch of Learning, which would
not onely render them honourable to foreign Nations, and highly
serviceable to their own, but would capacitate them for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of a Preferment suitable to their Parents charge, and

               <p>In short, I heartily wish that we might often and seriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
our blessed Saviours Prediction, that <hi>a Kingdom divided
against it self, cannot stand;</hi> and likewise consider that fate which
attended the Faction and Division of the <hi>Iews;</hi> which grew to
that height, that they could not forbear destroying each other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
when their declared Enemies the <hi>Romans</hi> were coming to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
their City. <hi>From which, good Lord deliver us.</hi>

            <p>UPon some Considerations, I thought it would
not be unacceptable to print the Speech of that
wise and great General and Emperor <hi>Vespasian,</hi> to his
Roman Officers; who seeing the <hi>Iews</hi> at great variance
and civil discord amongst themselves, pressed <hi>Vespasian</hi>
their General not to lose this opportunity, affirming that
it was Gods providence (who fought for them) that
the <hi>Iews</hi> should be at civil discord among themselves;
and that therefore he should not over-slip so good an
occasion, lest the <hi>Iews</hi> should quickly be friends again
one with another, either by the weariness of Civil
Wars, or else repenting themselves of that which they
had done. To whom <hi>Vespasian</hi> thus answered:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they were ignorant what was to be done, and
desirous rather, as it were in a Theatre to shew their
forces and strength, than with him to consider what
was profitable and expedient.</hi> For <hi>(said he)</hi> if we
presently assault them, our coming will make concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our Enemies, and so we shall bring upon our
selves their forces yet firm and strong; but by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
a little while, we shall have less ado to conquer
them, their chiefest forces being destroyed by their own
Civil War. God is more our Friend than you are aware
of, who without any labour and pain will deliver the
<hi>Jews</hi> into our hands, and will give us the Victory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
endangering our Army. Wherefore it is rather our
part to be beholders of the Tragedy, than to fight against
men desirous of death, and troubled with the greatest
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105557:6"/>
evil possible, to wit, <hi>Domestical Sedition and Civil
War.</hi> And if any think that the Victory is not so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
because gotten without fight, let him know and
consider the uncertain events of War; and that it is
better, if it be possible, to get a Victory without bloodshed,
than therewith to hazard a Defeat: For they who by
counsel and advice do any act, deserve no less praise
than they who by force of Arms atchieve a Victory. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
in the mean time that the Enemies destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
our Souldiers may take rest, and so be stronger and
better able to fight when need shall require. Besides, it
seems not that there is much haste required to get the
Victory; for the <hi>Jews</hi> neither prepare Arms nor Engines
of War, nor levie any Forces, nor seek for Aid; and so
by delay no damage can ensue, but they will plague one
another more by Civil War, than our Army by attacquing
their City. And therefore whether we consider Prudence
or Glory, we have nothing to do but let them ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for in case we should even at this present make
our selves Masters of that great City, so it would be justly
said, that the Victory was not to be imputed to us, but to
their Discord.</p>
