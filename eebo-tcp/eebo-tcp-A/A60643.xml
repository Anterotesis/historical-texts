            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

when <hi>Prosperity</hi> encreased, you grew fat, and stood puffed up, and had no regard unto the poor, but walked in the steps of those that went before you, and handed forth <hi>as bitter a Cup to others</hi> who were tender in their Consciences, and could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to your Inventions, <hi>as they had done unto you,</hi> whom the Lord <hi>removed</hi> because <hi>of Oppression</hi>; and your <hi>little finger</hi> became a heavier weight <hi>upon many,</hi> than the <hi>Loyns</hi> of such as went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; and then you began with your <hi>Laws</hi> to persecute such as could not bow to your <hi>Image,</hi> and it is just with the Lord to bring those over you whose Necks was once put under you, that you may consider what you have done, and repent before it be too late: For the Lord doth not forget the poor, which by you is oppressed, and shamefully entreated, who this day suffers in prison by your <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Oppression</hi>: Oh! what <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> hath been in the bottom of you, and how deceitful and <hi>unfaithful</hi> have you been unto God! who appeared for you, and gave you ease from your Burdens, and relieved you when you were afflicted under the Yoak that lay upon your necks, and raised you up, and set you over your Oppressors; and when Power was given into your hands, you turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Feet into the same <hi>Path,</hi> and set your selves up in their <hi>Places,</hi> and exercised <hi>LORDSHIP</hi> and <hi>DOMINION</hi> over others; and as much <hi>Cruelty</hi> was manifest from you, as from those that you destroyed; And so you <hi>killed</hi> and took <hi>Possession,</hi> and lived in the height of Pride and Vanity: Doth not the Lord behold you and your Doings?

so you carry on your <hi>practise in words,</hi> and set up your <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in words</hi>; but you want <hi>the Power</hi>; and <hi>the Flesh</hi> never came <hi>into subjection</hi> to learn <hi>silence,</hi> but <hi>speak,</hi> though it be <hi>not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>: And thus do you run in the many things, and cumber your selves with them, and labours to set them where they ought not to be; you would set the <hi>Words</hi> above the WORD, and give <hi>them</hi> the Name of the WORD, and call them the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and in this <hi>you erre,</hi> and knows not the <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor the Power of God; for CHRIST is the WORD of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Name</hi> is called <hi>so, Rev.</hi> 19.

And though you read of such things which the Saints performed, and in which they were accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if you want their Life, and make the thing to your selves, you are found Transgressors of the Law, and comes under Reproof for doing that in your Corruptible Wills, which they had peace in, as they performed it in the Incorruptible Life, and yet in the appearance no difference found in what is done: So you read that after they received the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>believed,</hi> they went <hi>into the Water,</hi> and were <hi>baptized</hi>; and you come to observe and do the same, because you read that some of <hi>them</hi> walked in such <hi>a practise</hi>; and you say you believe <hi>in Christ,</hi> and you receive <hi>his Word,</hi> and you go <hi>into the water,</hi> and are <hi>washed,</hi> and call it <hi>Baptism</hi>: And here is no difference found <hi>in the Likeness</hi> of the thing, but yours appears <hi>the same</hi> as <hi>theirs did,</hi> in the outward practise. But come up to tryal, the Light makes all things manifest as they are, and doth not judge according to the appearance, but judges righteous Judgemment; they did receive <hi>the Word,</hi> and they <hi>did believe</hi>; and some of them <hi>went into the water,</hi> and <hi>were baptized</hi> unto <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptism,</hi> and after that <hi>were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus, Acts</hi> 19.

            <p>HEar, Oh ye people! <hi>BABYLON</hi> must be <hi>destroyed,</hi> and and all <hi>the Pride</hi> of her glory <hi>must be spoyled,</hi> the Lord God hath so determined, and no part of her Countrey must be spared; for the Scourge is to pass thorough her Land, and to find out <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low, rich</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> who inhabits within her Borders, and to smite them and spoil them, that a dreadful cry will be heard amongst them, all slying for their lives, and none able to escape the severity of God's Judgement.</p>
            <p>Therefore all Arise, come out, make haste, who desires to live; for destruction comes as a <hi>VVhirl-wind,</hi> and there will not be a hiding place found in BABYLON; for strong is the Lord that judgeth her, and in one day will Judgement fall upon her, and the Lord will make a full end concerning her.</p>

And have not the Nations received it at thy hand, and drunk so deep of it, until they have been made drunk? What is this that thou hast done, thou MOTHER of HARLOTS?

I tell thee yea, for he is just that will render unto thee a recompence; and though thy Kingdome seem <hi>to be strong,</hi> and thy City <hi>to be walled,</hi> and thou enriched therein <hi>with the best things of the Earth</hi>; all this will not save thee from the hand of him that pursues thee swiftly in Judgement: And though thou hast gathered Nations <hi>unto thee,</hi> and hast many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that <hi>trade in thee,</hi> and they all with their strength joyn together to save thee, yet thou must fall, and all that strive to uphold thee; for <hi>thy Ruine is near to come,</hi> and the wrath is kindled <hi>against thee,</hi> and ready to take hold <hi>upon thee,</hi> and to destroy thee <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> that thy place will be no more found; and it is the Lords long-suffering and patience that hath spared thee from utter Ruine untill this day, and hath not as yet out thee off in the fierceness of his wrath, with all those that are Inhabitants in thee: It is not for thy sake that the stroak hath been kept off, but for his own Name sake, who delights to save in his Mercy, that some of thy Inhabitants might behold his patience and his goodness, and thereby come to repentance, as some of them have done who <hi>were once</hi> in the <hi>midst of thee</hi>; but his own arm reached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and hath gathered them out of thee, and <hi>hath brought his Sons from far,</hi> &amp; <hi>Daughters from the Ends of the Earth</hi>; yea, from

all quarters of thy Dominion, hath the Righteous God brought up a <hi>Remnant,</hi> who in thy Kingdome were once scattered and dispersed, and were amongst thy <hi>various Observations,</hi> and thy <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Traditions,</hi> where they could not finde a Resting-place; and there is yet a <hi>Remnant</hi> that God will not destroy with thee, who sit by thy Rivers, and <hi>weep</hi>; and it is for his <hi>Chosen sake</hi> that thou art spared unto this day; but God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king haste, the work to finish, and is opening the Eyes of many, who yet remain within thee, <hi>thy filthiness to see,</hi> and <hi>thy abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> and <hi>wickedness to loath and abhor</hi>; and many will the Lord gather out of thee, who now sit in sorrow within thee, and wait to be delivered by the Arm of his Power; such doth he reach unto in his Mercy, and is drawing them out with the Cords of his Love.</p>
            <p>So all people hear and consider, from the highest to the lowest, and let not this seem small in your eyes, though your wisdome may account it so, and sleight it, and reject it as a tale that is told, and still make your necks stiffe, and your hearts hard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord, yet shall you all one day know that the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
            <p>And all you tender ones that breathes after God, under what <hi>Form</hi> soever you do yet abide, or in what part of <hi>BABYLON</hi> soever your habitation is; Arise, come forth, do not delay, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look behinde you, but make haste to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Refuge,</hi> that you may live; for the Lord with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>holds in pity towards you, and long hath he striven with many of you, but you have been slack in your obedience, and have not regarded the Lords Visitation, and yet doth he wait upon you, that he may save you, and shew mercy to you; and though you trifle and put off from day to day, yet is he striving with you, that you may not perish in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon's Ruine</hi>: Oh! do not delay any longer, lest he leave you, and depart from you, and you continue touching the unclean thing, and will not be separated from it; then he will certainly smite you, and none will be found to heal you: Therefore give up to the Lord freely; obey, beleeve, and follow the Light, that out of <hi>Babylon</hi> you may clearly come, and leave not a <hi>Hoof</hi> behinde you, and <hi>stick</hi> not in any part or place of <hi>her,</hi> though it seem never so glorious, for <hi>
