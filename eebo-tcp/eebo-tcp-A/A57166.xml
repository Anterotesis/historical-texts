            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Preached before you
in order to the Peace
and Vnity of the
Church of God
amongst you: and I presume in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the same good end I was by
You pressed to the publishing of it.
Which motion I have the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

unto so necessary a duty,


<pb facs="tcp:49141:3"/>
which I found prevalent with you
then, might he always at your hand,
to revive in you the same affections.
And truly those many men in all
parts of this Nation, who, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
plausible and specious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
have given entertainment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
novel opinions, (never before
these loose times heard of in the
Church of God) and thereupon do
forsake the Assemblies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
the peace of an Orthodox
and Reformed Church, little consider
the advantage they give the Common
Adversary: who no doubt rejoyceth
to see us break one another with our
own hands, whom they with theirs
hither to have not been able to harm;
As <hi>Vespasian</hi> is observed by <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
to have done in the siege of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:49141:3"/>
not choosing to storme
the Jewes by any hostile assault,
while they were destroying one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
by their Intestine confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Certainly what ever prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
weak and credulous men may
have their eyes dazled withall, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and Contentions in the Church
have alwayes fleshly lusts at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of them, as the Apostle assureth
us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. Nor are they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fruits of sinne in men, but evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of wrath in God, and sad
symptomes of his further displeasure.
When <hi>Manasse</hi> is against <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai 9. 21.</note>
and <hi>Ephraim</hi> against <hi>Manasse,</hi>
and both against <hi>Judah,</hi> it is a sign
that Gods anger is not turned away,
but that his hand is stretched out still.

which threaten speedy and extremest
danger. And therefore all who wish
well to Sion should listen unto Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in so important a businesse, as the
Peace and prosperity of the Church,
any secular designes, single, or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Interests, carnal animosities, or
perverse disputes, to embitter their
spirits or alienate their affections
from other their brethren, heirs of
the same common salvation: or to
draw them away from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Church, from whose breasts
they have often sucked the sincere milk
of the word, and in whose fellowship
they may still undoubtedly partake
of all the means of Salvation. The
Lord grant that all of us in all places

the Peace of the Church. That
Ministers by sound and wholesome
doctrine, which cannot be disproved
by holy, humble, prudent, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Lives, and by unwearied dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and fidelity in their Callings,
may stop the mouthes, and winne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the affections of their Gain-say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
and that the People may not
lean on their own wisdome, nor be
carryed away blind-fold with uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
prejudices, or with every
winde of doctrine, but may yeild
themselves to the guidance of their
faithfull Pastors, and be swift to

Staves of BEAUTY and BANDS

and Welfare thereof might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.
When in this place he assumed
his <hi>Pastoral</hi> Office to Govern and guide

Ends</hi> of that Service; The Restoring

of <hi>Unity</hi> to his Church divided; Of
both which we shall, by Gods Assistance,

               <hi>very good</hi> when the Lord took a view of

upon which to bestow more abundant
Glory. It is called a <hi>Land of Ornament,</hi>
Dan. 11. 16. <hi>A land of Desire,</hi> Jer. 3. 19.
in the building whereof the Lord is said
to <hi>appear in his Glory,</hi> Psa. 102. 16. The

with his Love and Grace: in the <hi>World</hi>
we have the foot-prints of his Greatness,
but in the <hi>Church</hi> we have the Image of
his Holiness: The <hi>World</hi> was made by
him, the <hi>Church</hi> like him; the <hi>World</hi>
to shew forth his Glory, the <hi>Church</hi> to
enjoy it; the <hi>World</hi> a <hi>Tenement</hi> for his

<hi>Rest</hi> for ever. Above all Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<hi>Holiness</hi> is the <hi>Beauty</hi> of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and therefore the Angels, who
excell in all created perfection, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other Appellations honoured
with the name of <hi>Saints</hi> Deut. 33. 2.
they differ not in nature from Devils, in
<hi>Holinesse</hi> they do. Derived Holiness
consisteth in conformity to primitive ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
The Lord is most holy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and our holiness standeth in his
<hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeness,</hi> so far forth as he
hath by an holy Law made his Holiness
a pattern for ours. And when we
threw away that Image of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our created Holiness consisted, and
the Lord was pleased in any of us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
it again; he did it by the <hi>pattern</hi>
of his beloved <hi>Son,</hi> who is the<note n="i" place="margin">Col. 1. 15. Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Image of
the invisible God,</hi> and the Character of his
person, full of Grace and Truth. Now
then according to the Excellency of the
pattern, we are to measure, and take
an estimate of that Beauty, wherein


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49141:11"/>
we are conformable unto that pattern;
and what pattern more glorious then
the blessed God, and the Holy Son of
God, the chiefest of ten thousand?
unto whom therefore the conformity
of a Creature must be its chief and
principal Beauty.</p>
            <p>There are several <hi>Attributes</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
whereby the Excellency of this
Beauty may be further discovered.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Light</hi> and Luster; for as a great part
of the Corporal Beauty is in the life and
vigour of the eye, so of spiritual Beauty
in the clarity and brightness of the <hi>mind;</hi>
when the Lord,<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 4 6</note> who commanded the
Light to shine out of Darkness, shineth
in our Hearts, <hi>to give the light of the
knowledge of the Glory of God in the face
of Jesus Christ;</hi> as the Sun is the greatest
Beauty of the visible world, so Christ,
as a<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4. 2.</note>

of his knowledge, is the <hi>glory</hi>
and beauty of the invisible.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Rectitude</hi> &amp; Straitness; the wise man
thus expresseth our primitive Beauty,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49141:12"/>
that<note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 7. 29.</note> 
               <hi>God made man perfect;</hi> and we

               <hi>guil,</hi> and perverseness of

            <p>3. <hi>Integrity</hi> and<note n="h" place="margin">Col. 2. 10.</note> Compleatness;
when all the parts and members of the

               <hi>fulness</hi> of Christ, <hi>Grace

must be the<note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 4. 13, 16.</note>

            <p>4. <hi>Symmetry</hi> and an exact proportion
of parts, and equal temperament of

regard of Spiritual Beauty is called by
<note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 5. 15.</note>the Apostle <gap reason="foreign">

but that there is an equal<note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 119. 6.</note>

Gods Commandments,</hi> and such a supply
and accurate distribution of vital influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
unto every member of the new

5. <hi>Growth</hi> and Progress in these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions;
for while we are in this world,
we are still in our Minority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must still be contending towards
perfection. To be a man in years, and
a child in stature, is an unbeautiful thing.
Christ hath no Dwarfs in his body;
though one man attain greater degrees
of perfection then another, yet all are
in a growing condition: the life of
Christ in us being a<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 10. 10.</note> 
               <hi>life that abounds;</hi>
and his Grace like the<note n="b" place="margin">Ezek. 47 3, 4, 5.</note> waters of the
Sanctuary rising up higher and higher.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Indeficiency,</hi> wherein spiritual
Beauty surpasseth all other; for<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 31. 30.</note> 
               <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
favour is deceitful, and Beauty vain,</hi>
it runneth all at last into wrinkles and
deformity; but as Christ himself<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 2. 31. 13. 35.</note> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw Corruption, no more doth the
Beauty that he brings to the Soul with
him. They<note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 92. 13, 14.</note> who are planted in the
Lords house, do flourish in his Courts,
and are fat and fruitfull in their old age.
As we may truly say of sin in a wicked
man, <hi>Concupiscenti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ends of the Ordinances do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
further evidence this Beauty of
theirs unto us: For they are by Christ
intended for such purposes as these.</p>
            <p>1. To Quicken us, and to fashion
him in us. By nature we are<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 2. 1, 4, 5</note> dead
in trespasses and sins, and death ever

               <hi>Temples</hi> of the Holy Ghost,

whom Christ hath purified<note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 4. 3. 135. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 148 14. Isa. 43. 21. Lev. 20. 26.</note> unto

For as<note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> without Holiness no

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49141:17"/>

Beloved to do in my house,</hi> saith the Lord,
<hi>seeing she hath wrought lewdness?</hi> The
Lord will be sanctified in all that draw
nigh unto him.</p>
            <p>We should thereforeall in our several
places, especially those unto whom the
Pastoral Dignity and Trust doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
use our utmost care to preserve
the Church of God amongst us in that
honour and beauty which belongs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
not corrupting the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
thereof, or obtruding any meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical,
much less false and unsound
positions of our own, upon the faith of
our Hearers; not corrupting the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
thereof either with superstition, or
irreverence, not suffering either the
meer <hi>Form</hi> of Godliness to swallow up
the <hi>power,</hi> or the pretence of <hi>power</hi> to
shut out the <hi>Form,</hi> but to give the Lord
both that inward and outward Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which is due to his holy name in
all our solemn Attendances upon him;
not corrupting the <hi>sanctity</hi> thereof either


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49141:17"/>
with Hypocrisie or Prophaness, with
meer specious Pretences of Holiness on
the one hand, or with open and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Contempt thereof on the other.
Lastly, Not corrupting the <hi>Decency</hi> and
Order thereof; either by burthening
Gods Service with an excessive number
of needless Observances; or on the
other side censuring and deserting the
Communion of a Sound and Orthodox
Church, because the Order thereof doth
not in every particular please us. Thus
is the Church to be fed and Ruled with
the former of our Prophets Staves, <hi>The
Staff Beauty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ, as the chief She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherd,
by his Spirit and Power, and
his Under-Officers, by their Ministery
and Service, do feed and rule his Church
by his <hi>Staffe</hi> called <hi>Bands,</hi> procuring
and advancing the <hi>Unity</hi> thereof, and
gathering together into one all the
members belonging thereunto, that the
whole body may be <hi>fitly joyned together


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49141:18"/>
and compacted</hi> without <hi>Schisms</hi> and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
which is a singular and eminent
Blessing of God thereunto. God made
man at the first after his own Image, so
that as the Lord is wholly one and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
in himself, no dissonancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
any of his Attributes, Decrees,
or Counsels; so in man as he came out
of Gods hands, there was an exact har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and agreement; his Affections
consonant unto his Will, his Will to
his Reason, and his Reason to God.
And being thus perfectly <hi>One</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he could not but be one likewise
with others, who were perfectly like
himself, as finding nothing more in
them, from the which to differ, then
in himself. But when sin came into the
world, it brake the <hi>bond of Union</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and man, making us<note n="u" place="margin">Col. 1. 21. Rom. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>

<note n="w" place="margin">Isa. 59. 2.</note>
               <hi>separating</hi> between him and us, and
<hi>hiding</hi> hie face from us. It brake the
<hi>bond of Union</hi> between a man and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the Will rebelling against the


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49141:18"/>
Mind, the Sensitive part against the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,
one<note n="x" place="margin">Jam. 4. 1.</note> lust warring against another,
and all against the Soul. It brake <hi>the
bond of Union</hi> between man and man,
between one wicked man and another,
upon the ground of <hi>different Interests,</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Tit. 3. 3.</note>hateful and hating of one another;

us to the consideration of a threefold
Unity in the Church. 1. An <hi>Unity</hi> by

            <p>There is then in the Church 1. An

            <p>In answer hereunto we say, That all
this is accidental to the Gospel; it is no
fault in the Sun, if shining on a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill
a stinking vapour be exhaled; nor
is it the fault of the Gospel, if by
occasion thereof, the proud lusts of men
be exasperated and enraged. When the

is the Gospel at all prejudiced by any
such commotions, as through the lusts
of wicked men, are meerly <hi>per accidens</hi>
and occasionally stirred up by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Church.</p>
               <p>And here it cannot be denyed, but
that in all ages of the Church, there
have been, and still are like to be, <hi>Varieties
of Judgement</hi> among the Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For 1. The best Proficients<note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>know
but in part, and Prophesie but in part.</hi>
2. There are many things very abstruse
and difficult in the disquisition of divine
Truth; Religion hath its<note n="s" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16. Heb. 5. 11.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, things
hard to be understood, as well as other
Sciences. 3. There is in many men much
<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 14. 1.</note>weakness of Judgement, to make


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49141:37"/>
search and enquiry into these things, or
to discover <hi>veritatem in puteo latentem.</hi>
4. There is much carelesness of heart
in many men to try the spirits, and to
prove all things; they<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 13. 21</note> 
                  <hi>sleep</hi> while the
enemy soweth Tares. 5. There is in
many men a Levity, Lubricity and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composedness
of mind whereby they are
apt to be<note n="w" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 14. Rom. 16. 18 Col. 2. 4 1 Reg. 13. 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>carried away with every wind
of Doctrine,</hi> and out of Simplicity and
Credulity to be wrought upon by the
cunning of those who are skilful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
6. Some have<note n="x" place="margin">2 Tim 4. 3, 4 Jud. v. 16</note> 
                  <hi>itching ears,</hi> heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
always after <hi>new</hi> things, whom
Manna will not please without Quails,
who have some particular <hi>mens persons
in admiration,</hi> and give up themselves by
a blind obedience and implicite Faith,
into their hands, to be led by them into
novel and singular Opinions. 7. Prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Lust and domestical Interest, doth
in many men darken their mind, and
entangle their Judgements, and betray
them unto that sad condition of being
<note n="y" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 10, 11. 1 Tim. 6. 10</note>
                  <hi>given over to strong Delusions to believe


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49141:38"/>
Lyes.</hi> Upon these and such like Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
there have been always Differences
in the Church: We find a contention
between<note n="z" place="margin">Acts 15. 39. Gal. 2. 11, 13 1 Cor. 1. 12, 12</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> We find some for
<hi>Paul,</hi> others for <hi>Apollo,</hi> and some for
<hi>Cephas,</hi> and others for none of them all,
but for Christ without them; we find
some<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> building upon the foundation <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
and <hi>gold,</hi> and others <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>stubble.</hi>
We read of great differences between
the Eastern and Western Churches,
touching the Observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> and
between the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the matter of <hi>Rebaptization;</hi>
of many sharp Dissentions between sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
great and famous Bishops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of the antient Churches. To say
nothing of the present sad experience
which we may everywhere observe of
the same Truth, the<note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 18. 17. 1 Cor. 11. 19</note> Scripture hath
foretold it, and it cannot be otherwise,
that <hi>there must be Heresies and Offences;</hi>
nevertheless we must not hereby be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from using all pious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

Endeavours for pacification of the
persons so dissenting; concerning which
Accommodation we are to distinguish;</p>
               <p>1. Of <hi>Opinions,</hi> whereof some are in

                  <hi>Foundation,</hi> in those primitive Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

which do not overturn the Edifice,
nor endanger the Vitals of Religion:
such were in the<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 14. 5, 6. 1 Cor. 8. 8, 9</note> Apostles time, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
touching Meats, and Drinks, and
Days, and Things indifferent; wherein
though men abound in their own sense,
yet it must ever be with Meekness, and
with humble submission to the Spirits
of the Prophets, and to the Judgement,
Order and Peace of the Church.</p>
               <p>2. Of <hi>Persons;</hi> Some are<note n="g" place="margin">Ephe. 4. 14. Esay 3. 12 Jer. 23. 16, 26, 32. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, Some are men of meek, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
peaceable and quiet spirits; amongst
whom though there be differences of
Judgement, yet they do upon common

in love, and joyn in pursuing the same

judging, or despising the other, neither

are men of turbulent, seditious and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuating
Dispositions, who love to
kindle flames, to foment Divisions, to
make Sides and Factions, that they
may fish in troubled waters; these


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49141:39"/>
things being premised, we may touching
Accommodations thus conclude.</p>
               <p>1. There can be no Syncretism, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
where the Differences
are in points destructive to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Religion, and against the very
Essentials of Faith, Worship and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
there can be no reconciliation
<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 10 21. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 17 Gal. 1. 8, 9</note>between Christ and <hi>Belial,</hi> between

the spirit of<note n="m" place="margin">2 Tim. 2 25, 26.</note> meekness to be instructed,
and if possible to be restored, and won
unto the Truth, and delivered from the
snare of the Devil.</p>
               <p>2. Though the Differences at first
view be not so pernitious and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
yet if it be evident that they be
purposely sowed by men of turbulent
and ungracious spirits, meerly to kindle
flames, to foment Seditions, to lay the


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49141:40"/>
of perpetual Divisions or Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Church or State, to gratifie the
common enemy, and to be subvervient
unto such Ends and Designes, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Truth and Holiness is endangered;
in this case the Apostle hath taught us,
both by his <hi>Example</hi>

are safe, and on all sides unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
embraced, and the differences
purely <hi>problematical,</hi> and such as do not

               <p>6. To be of a meek, humble and

Some men are so hot, so opinionative,
so contentious, so wedded to their
own conceits, so impatient of dissent,
that none can have Peace with them,
who will not mancipate and render up
their Reason and Judgement into their
hands. But though it be our Duty to
<hi>try all things, and hold fast Truth,</hi> when


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49141:44"/>
we have found it, yet we must hold it
with a Spirit of <hi>Meekness.</hi> Meekness
is the fittest disposition to receive truth;

                  <hi>Receive,</hi> saith the Apost. <hi>with meekness

                  <hi>In

                  <hi>Long-Suffering

Self-willedness and hastiness of Passion,
are Obstructions unto the progress of
Truth; else the Apostle would not have
entred a Caveat against them in a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:
for, saith he,<note n="y" place="margin">Tit. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>a Bishop must be

               <p>7. To be of a <hi>candid</hi> Judgement; not
to widen, but as much as may be to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Differences, and to reduce Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
to as near an Agreement, as
is possible; and in the managing of them,
to retain <hi>Suavity</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity;</hi> not to
infer without undeniable Evidence, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and <hi>invidious consequences</hi> from
those Doctrines of our brethren, which


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49141:44"/>
we our selves dislike; but to believe
other men as perspicacious to discern,
and as tender to decline such desperate
Rocks as we our selves. It argues great
want of Charity towards others, and of
Humility in our selves, when by our
perverse Disputings, we go about to
charge such opinions upon others, as
from their own mouths we are assured,
and therefore should in Charity believe,
that they do detest. Pride in our selves,
and Prejudice against others, are Two
great Impediments to the healing of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.</p>
               <p>I shall shut up all with one observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

That what Christ in the beginning of

never undertook more in a way of <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
