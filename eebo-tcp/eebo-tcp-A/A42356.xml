            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALthough we are not ignorant, that mockers of all sorts may take occasion by this Acknowledgment of the Sins of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to strengthen themselves in their prejudices at our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Callings, and turn this unto our reproach, and that some may misconstrue our meaning therein, as if we did thereby intend to render the Ministery of this Church base and contemptible, which is far from our thoughts, We knowing and being perswaded in our selves, that there are many able, godly and faithful Ministers in the Land; yet being convinced that we are called to humble our selves, and to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Lord in all the contempt that he hath poured upon us: That they who shall know our sins, may not stumble at our judgments: We have thought it our duty to publish this following Discovery and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the corruptions and sins of Ministers, That it may appear how deep our hand is in the Transgression, and that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of <hi>Scotland</hi> have no small accession to the drawing on of these judgments that are upon the Land.</p>
            <p>Only in this following Acknowledgment we desire it may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That there are here enumerated some sins, whereof there be but some few Ministers guilty, and others whereof moe are guilty, and not a few, which are the sins of these whom the Lord hath keeped from the more grosse corruptions herein mentioned; And that it is not to be wondered at, if the Ministery of <hi>Scotland</hi> be yet in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure unpurged, Considering that there was so wide a door opened for the entering of corrupt persons into the Ministery, for the space of above thirty years under the tyranny of Prelats, and that also there hath been so many diversions from, and interruptions of endeavours to have a purged Ministery in this Land.</p>

            <p n="1">1. LIghteness and prophanity in conversation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable to that holy Calling which they did intend, not throughly repented of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Corrupt education of some in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall and Arminian way, whereby their corruptions and errors were drunken in, and abilities improven, for strengthening and promoving the same, not repented of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Not studying to be in CHRIST, before they be in the Ministery; nor to have the practicall knowledge and experience of the Mystery of the Gospel in themselves, before they preach it to others.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Neglecting to fit themselves for the Work of the Ministerie in not improving prayer and fellowship with God, education at Schools and opportunities of a lively Ministery, and other means, and not mourning for these neglects.</p>

         <div type="part">
            <head>Secondly, in entering.</head>
            <p n="1">1. CArnall, corrupt and crooked wayes for entering to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, such as bribing in the time of Prelacie, soliciation of friends and the like; whereby many have not entered by the door, but did climb up another way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Entering to the Ministery by an implicite, execrable, Canonicall Oath and subscription given to the Prelats for acknowledging them, and advancing their corruptions introduced and to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Entering to the Ministery without tryals, and receiving ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either from the Prelat, or by a recommendation from him to the Presbyterie, and sometimes without or against the minde of the Presbyterie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Entering either only by Presentations, or by purchased Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations from the plurality of the Parochiners, without or against the consent of the godly in the Parioch.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Entering to the Ministery without respect to a Commission from Jesus Christ, by which it hath come to passe, that many have run unsent.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Entering to the Ministery not from the love of Christ, nor from a desire to honour God in gaining of souls, but for by-ends, for a name, and for livelyhood in the World, notwithstanding solemne declaration to the contrary at admission.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Some offering themselves to tryall without abilities, and study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conceal and hide their weaknesse, by making use of the help and pains of some friend and acquaintance, or other mens Papers, in severall parts of the tryall; and some authorized to preach, and others admitted to the Ministery, who have little or no ability for performing the duties thereof.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Too much weighed with inclination to be called to the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a place where we have carnall relation.</p>

            <head>Thirdly, After entering, which is first in their private condition and conversation.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IGnorance of God, want of nearnesse with him, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up little of God in reading, meditating, and speaking of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Exceeding great selfishnesse in all that we do, acting from our selves, for our selves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Not caring how unfaithfull and negligent others were, so being it might contribute a testimony to our faithfulnesse and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: but being rather content, if not rejoycing at their fault.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Least delight in these things wherein lyeth our nearest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, great inconstancie in our walk with God, and neglect of acknowledging of him in all our wayes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In going about duties, least carefull of these which are most remote from the eyes of men.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Seldome in secret prayer with God, except to fit for Publick performances, and even that much neglected, or gone about very superficially.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Glad to find excuses for the neglect of duties.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Neglecting the reading of Scriptures in secret, for edifying our selves as Christians, only reading them in so far as may fit us for our duty as Ministers, and oft-times neglecting that.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Not given to reflect upon our own wayes, nor suffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to have a through work upon us, deceiving our selves by resting upon abstinence from, and abhorrencie of evils, from the light of a naturall conscience, and looking upon the same as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a reall change.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Evill guarding of, and watching over the heart, and careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in self-searching, which makes much unacquaintednesse with our selves, and estrangednesse from God.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Not guarding nor wrestling against seen and known ills, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially our predominants.</p>
            <p n="12">12. A facilite to be drawn away with the temptations of the time, and other particular temptations, according to our inclinations and fellowship.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Instability and wavering in the wayes of God through the fears of persecution, hazard, or loss of esteem, and declining duties,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40951:4"/>
because of the fear of jealousies and reproaches.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Not esteeming the Crosse of Christ and sufferings for his Name honourable, but rather shifting sufferings from self-love.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Deadnesse of spirit after all the sore stroaks of God upon the Land.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Little conscience made of secret humiliation and fasting by our selves apart, and in our Families; that we might mourn for our own and the Lands guiltinesse and great back-slidings, and little applying the Causes of publick humiliation to our own hearts.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Finding of our own pleasures, when the Lord cals for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Not laying to heart the sad and heavy sufferings of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God abroad, and the not thriving of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the power of godliness among them.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Refined hypocrisie, desiring to appear what indeed we are not.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Studying more to learn the language of Gods people not their exercise.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Artificiall confessing of sin without repentance, professing to declare iniquity, and not resolving to be sory for sin.</p>
