            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O how little does the power of Grace and true Godlineſs ſhine amongſt this ſort! what formality and lukewarmneſs is there in theſe days, amongſt ſuch who are called Saints and holy Brethren!

For the <hi>Jews</hi> were his <hi>floor,</hi> in which was abundance of <hi>Chaff;</hi> and now Jeſus Chriſt was come with his <hi>fan</hi> in his hand, to purge this floor; and evident it is, <hi>his holy Doctrine</hi> ſevered, or ſeparated the <hi>Wheat</hi> from the <hi>Chaff;</hi> and by this means was the <hi>Wheat gathered into Chriſts Goſpel-Garner,</hi> and the <hi>Chaff</hi> blown away: for as <hi>Chaff</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the wind of the <hi>fan,</hi> ſo could not thoſe unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jews,</hi> and hypocritical <hi>Phariſees,</hi> endure Chriſts holy and heavenly Doctrine. See Joh. 6. 52. to v. 60. <hi>How can this Man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> They thought he ſpake of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eating of his fleſh, as we eat the fleſh of Beaſts or Fiſh: His Doctrine was not underſtood by them. <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, except you eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you,</hi> ver. 53.</p>
               <p>Now the eating of Chriſts fleſh, and drinking of his blood, is no other thing than the receiving Jeſus Chriſt by Faith for Righteouſneſs and eternal Life: <hi>Believing in Chriſt, coming to Chriſt, looking to Chriſt, leaning, truſting, or ſtaying on Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>eating of Chriſt,</hi> imply one and the ſame thing: It is our going out of our ſelves to him, or feeding by faith on him, or reſting, or relying on his Merits, on his Obedience in his Life, and in his Death, for Juſtification and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, without any Works done by us, or any Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought in us, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. <hi>But to him that</hi>

perſonal and inherent Righteouſneſs was that by which they muſt be juſtified, accepted, and eternally ſaved: they had meat of their own to eat; and therefore ſaw no need to go to their Neighbours door for it; <hi>they were full,</hi> and <hi>increaſed in Goods,</hi> and thought they <hi>had need of nothing:</hi> And hence the Doctrine of Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone was rejected by them, it was not underſtood by them; that <hi>Chriſt's fleſh ſhould be Meat indeed, and his blood Drink indeed,</hi> was a ſtrange Doctrine in their apprehenſions; they could not conceive how ſuch things could be, (as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſpake of Regeneration.) Nor can any Man whatſoever who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <note place="margin">Joh. 3 9.</note> no point of Faith, but what his natural reaſon can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; and thus this Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus was a <hi>Fan</hi> in his hand, and it fanned away all the <hi>Chaff</hi> of that mighty <hi>Jewiſh floor,</hi> even all that received not that Doctrine, or who believed not in Chriſt, received not Chriſt by Faith for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and eternal life: Nay it was ſuch a <hi>Fan</hi> that it <hi>fann'd</hi> away ſome of Chriſts Diſciples, (not ſuch who were his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples indeed,) but many that followed him, and who are ſaid to believe on him; they believed he was the true <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> had ſome kind of faith, tho' not the Faith of Gods Elect: <hi>Many of his Diſciples when they heard this, ſaid, This is a hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

                  <hi>who can bear it?</hi> It ſeemed hard to them, becauſe they could not comprehend it by their own carnal reaſon: <hi>From that time many of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> Such a <hi>Fan</hi> was this Doctrine then, and ſuch a <hi>Fan</hi> it is now, <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 66.</note> that it may be ſaid to make a diſcrimination between the pure <hi>Wheat</hi> and the <hi>Chaff:</hi> for no doubt all that receive not this holy.

The diſpenſation of God's Providence;</hi> for this was as a <hi>Fan</hi> in Chriſt's hand, by which he <hi>fann'd away</hi> thoſe unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo <hi>purged his floor:</hi> I mean, the time was now come, that their <hi>national,</hi> legal and external Church-State muſt be pulled down and diſſolved; the Diſpenſation was changed, the Prieſthood changed, and right of Church-memberſhip changed; they having <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, or being the Seed of profeſſing Parents, would do them no good, nor avail them any thing. Becauſe the Covenant of Peculiarity God made with him and his natural ſeed as ſuch, as to the Date of the Duration thereof, was now <hi>run out</hi> and expired, <hi>the Ax being now laid to the root of the Tree, ver. 10th.</hi> So that unleſs they receive Chriſt, believe in Chriſt, and are found gracious perſons, fit <hi>Wheat</hi> for Chriſts ſpiritual Garner, or Goſpel-Church (which is built up of lively ſtones) as <hi>Chaff</hi> the Goſpel-diſpenſation like a <hi>Fan purges</hi> them out; as indeed it did, and blew them all away: And we are not alone in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this great Truth, for many of our worthy Brethren (who in ſome things differ from us) aſſert the ſame: particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> who ſpeaking of this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 10. ſaith, <q>The <hi>firſt</hi> is the root of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant, which this people much truſted upon, and of that it is which <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the root of the Tree, think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our Father;</hi> ſo that all their confidence that they had in <hi>Abraham's Covenant, Temple and Tabernacle,</hi> and ſuch things, are burnt up, and ſo they have no Root left them to ſtand upon, and this is one thing intended by the <hi>Root.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is (ſaith he) ſomething more in it; the Lord by the power of his Spirit doth cut us off from any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our natural Gifts and Parts, and ſpiritual Gifts alſo, or from any Confidence of our own ſufficiency; the Lord hath cut us off from hope in the Righteouſneſs of our Parents, and from boaſting of Ordinances. And again he ſaith, This we read of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 1. It is ſpoken of the Miniſtry of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> which did <hi>burn as an Oven,</hi> againſt all the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> and left them neither the Root of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant, nor the Branch of their own good Works: He cutteth them off from the Covenant of <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> And by cutting them off from the Root, he leaveth them no ground to truſt on.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> on <hi>The Covenant,</hi> p. 177, and <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22. Now evident it is, that nothing but the diſpenſation of God's


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98170:8"/>
Providence, or the Expiration of that period of Time deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Almighty for the ſtanding of the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> could cut the <hi>Jews</hi> off as a Nation, from being a Church and peculiar People unto God; I mean in reſpect of that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Covenant. I deny not but that the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with his true ſpiritual Seed, ſtands firm for ever and ever, and none in that Covenant can be cut off, nor fanned away: for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſthood, Church-ſtate and Church-memberſhip, and all their Church-priviledges, were to remain until Chriſt came, or until the time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; that is, till the Goſpel-days and Goſpel-diſpenſation took place, and no longer: But now that time being come, and they not ſeeing an end put to the old Covenant-Church, as it was made with the natural Offspring of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that their right to legal Ordinances, and Church-memberſhip, could not give them any right to Goſpel Ordinances, nor Goſpel-Church-memberſhip, and they not believing in Chriſt, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Terms of the Goſpel, were all of neceſſity purged out or <hi>fanned away,</hi> by the <hi>Fan</hi> of the New Teſtament-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and ſo were no longer a people in any ſenſe in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt hath alſo another <hi>Fan</hi> in his hand, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Fan</hi> of Church-Diſcipline. And many perſons falling into ſin are purged like <hi>Chaff</hi> out of his <hi>floor.</hi> Hereby,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes ſome evil and corrupt Perſons, who get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong God's people (or into his Church) and paſs a while for <hi>Wheat, i. e.</hi> for gracious Perſons, yet in time God ſuffers them to fall into one Temptation or another, by which means they are <hi>fann'd away,</hi> the Holy Jeſus by his wiſe Providence make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſcovery of them, and their evil Tempers and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. May be ſome glorious Truths, or Truth of Jeſus Chriſt, is revealed, or cleared up to his Church in General, to which ſeveral Perſons of the ſame Congregation may not only want Light in, but may be filled with Prejudice againſt, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Truth, but againſt the Church or Miniſter for ſeeking to bring it in; and this may riſe to ſuch a height, through their Pride and Stubborneſs, that they will not abide any longer Members thereof, but violently rend themſelves by Schiſm, and ſo are purged out. Tho' (as 'tis obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Husband-man) ſome <hi>light Corn,</hi> may be good <hi>Wheat,</hi> may be <hi>fanned out</hi> with the <hi>Chaff,</hi> which he knows how


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98170:9"/>
to recover by fanning the Chaff alſo afterwards. And thus it was with ſome of thoſe who were called Chriſt's Diſciples, they could not, would not endure that bleſſed Truth Chriſt <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 60. 66.</note> preached to them, of <hi>Eating of his Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. but cried out, <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> and ſo <hi>went away and walked no more with him.</hi> O ſee what the Effects of preaching ſome Truths may be! how many are there who cannot bear in this day ſound Doctrine, but deſert his People, and ſome Truths of Chriſt, and ſeem to ſhut their eyes againſt them, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Error and falſe Doctrine, and what not? And this way God takes (in his wiſe Providence) to purge out ſome rotten Members, which poſſibly were a repoach to his People: And altho' may be ſome <hi>Wheat,</hi> may by this means through Satans Temptations, and Corruptions of their own hearts, and their great Ignorance, be <hi>fanned</hi> out with the <hi>Chaff,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried away by the Craftineſs and Subtlity of ſuch whom Chriſt hath a mind to ſever from the Body; yet he knows how to gather up the <hi>Wheat again,</hi> as the Husbandman doth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others, whom Chriſt would have purged out of his Church, may be ſuffered to ſuck in ſome evil, corrupt and dangerous Principles, or Errors in Fundamentals, like that of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe Errours being diſcovered, were purged out. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Alſo others fall into notorious and ſcandalous Sins, and ſo are purged out.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some who are <hi>Chaff,</hi> or unſound Chriſtians, may be ſuffered to take up undue offences againſt the Church, or Churches to whom they belong, and by giving way to Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they may become unreconcileable, magnifying their own Wiſdom and Self-conceitedneſs, and ſo by a ſecret hand of God be diſcovered and purged out: But it muſt be conſidered that the uſe and exerciſe of the Keys, or Rules of Church-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, is appointed by Chriſt, as the proper <hi>Fan</hi> by which thoſe ſorts of Perſons laſt mentioned, and ſome others, are to be purged out of the Church or Congregations of the Saints. Now the <hi>Fan of Diſcipline</hi> is two-fold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Act of Excommunication: <hi>In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gathered together, with my Spirit, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi>

                  <hi>ſuch a one unto Satan, for the Deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Chriſt by this <hi>Fan</hi> of Diſcipline purges out, are of three ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98170:9"/>
1. All groſs and ſcandalous Perſons, who are Guilty of any Act or Acts of Immorality, as <hi>Theft, Swearing, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Uncleanneſs, Covetouſneſs, Lying,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe being publick and reproachful Crimes, the Offender ought forthwith (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clear proof) to be purged out, that the Name of the Lord may not be expoſed to contempt, and his People villified by the ungodly World; and time given to him for the proof and Trial of the ſincerity or Truth of his Repentance; which in part will be manifeſted by his Carriage and Behaviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Puniſhment; I mean the Righteous Cenſure of the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second ſort</hi> that this <hi>Fan</hi> of Diſcipline takes hold of, are ſuch that ſuck in <hi>Hereſies</hi> or <hi>Capital Errors;</hi> theſe <hi>after</hi>

               <p>As to ſuch who rend themſelves from a Church, or violate their ſacred Covenant by irregularly withdrawing themſelves, they ought to be <hi>marked, and ſolemnly in the publick Congregation</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath alſo another <hi>Fan</hi> in his hand to purge his floor, or cleanſe his Wheat from the Chaff, filth and defilement of Sin, namely, the Holy Spirit; and by this means he cleanſes and Purifies in a gracious manner the Souls of his own People: <hi>Suoh were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are Sanctified, but ye are Juſtified in the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 12.</note> If it be terrible to have a finger, a foot, or a hand to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, or to have the whole body caſt into a Furnace of boyling Oil, (as ſome of the holy Martyrs were) how then can ſinners, who are as <hi>chaff,</hi> bear the Thoughts of Gods wrath and vindictive Vengance, which is far more intollerable than any fire into which any Mortal was ever caſt? For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Other fire burns only the external part, or temporal, or corporal matter, but the fire of Gods wrath burns and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Spirit, the Soul, the inviſible part.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The fierceſt fire that ever was kindled hath been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and by Engines or Inſtruments put out, but the fire of Gods Wrath when kindled, and the Soul thrown into Hell, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be put out, nor be extinguiſhed, 'tis unquenchable fire.

that in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and ſome other places? are not theſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tokens and Signs of Gods Wrath and Indignation? are they not Harbingers and Preſages of what is coming upon the World, and of the end thereof?

O what will you do in the day of Gods Wrath if ye are Chaff, or but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Chriſtians? if not ſincere? if not in Chriſt? <hi>thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord with Earthquakes and a great noiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 6.</note> Great Changes, Commotions, Mutations and Revolutions, will ſuddenly come from the Lord of Hoſts: <hi>He will make the earth empty, and turn it upſide down, and it ſhall be as with the people ſo with the prieſt:</hi> He will fan, ſhake and tumble the People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <note place="margin">Iſa. 24. 1.</note> you will find Diſtreſs of Nations, and Perplexity with a witneſs in a ſhort time; nay, no doubt but the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and End of the World, or Coming of Chriſt is very near; for he hath foretold as Signs thereof, <hi>that there ſhall be great</hi>

If you be Chaff among the Wheat, you ſpoil the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glory of the Wheat; you bring a reproach upon the Saints and upon the Church; the ways of God are evil ſpoken of thro' your means; your Pride, your Covetouſneſs, your Back-biting and detracting Tongue, and Unjuſt Dealing, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the propagation of the Goſpel; your formality, deadneſs, ſlighting and neglecting of the Worſhip of God, and want of Zeal, and Love to Chriſt and to his people, hath bitter effects on the unbelieving World, as well as it will have on your own Souls.</p>

3.

O Take heed for your Souls ſake, that you reſt not upon a bare Profeſſion, or on a name of Chriſtians!</p>
               <p>This may inform us alſo, that Chriſt hath a gracious end in bringing Perſecutions and Trials on his People; it ſhews us why he uſes the <hi>Fan of ſevere Providences, Judgments and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions:</hi> It is, you have heard, to purge, to purifie them, and to ſeparate the Chaff from them.

                  <hi>Motives,</hi> 1. O how far may men go, and yet be but almoſt Chriſtians! Remember this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many when Chriſt comes ſhall have great Confidence, and go forth to meet him, and yet be found fooliſh ones: Some deceive their own Hearts, and others have Hearts that deceive them, by truſting in them, and never examine how matters are between God and their own Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Men may Preach and Propheſie, yea, ſpeak as if they had the Tongue of Men and Angels, and Caſt out Devils in Chriſts <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 1, 2.</note> Name, and yet he nothing; they may Preach, no doubt, to the Converſion of others, and yet may not be Converted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Wheat is commonly weighed,</hi> to know the goodneſs of it; ſo God weighs Men, he weighs the Actions of Men: <hi>Thou art weighed in the ballance, and art found wanting:</hi> Weighed in a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance alluding to the weighing of Gold or Goods exactly in Scales. God tries Men and Women, that all may know he will proceed Juſtly and Righteouſly with them; he weighs them <hi>in the ballance of the ſanctuary,</hi> or trys them by the Touch-ſtone of his Word, and if found <hi>full weight,</hi> or <hi>pure Gold,</hi> then he declares that they are his, and he owns them


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98170:21"/>
as his People, as his <hi>Wheat;</hi> but if too light, or not hold weight, but are greatly wanting, there being no worth in them, but are Droſs, Chaff, light and empty Perſons, unſound and unſanctified ones, then he rejects them as none of his, but are as reprobate Silver, falſe Coin, People of no value with him.</p>
               <p>As he weighs Men, ſo he weighs their Works, their Graces, their Gifts, their Duties, to ſee whether they hold weight, whether true and righteous or not; whether the Grace be true Grace, ſpecial Grace, not common Grace, and their Gifts not Counterfeit Gifts, or meer Natural Gifts, or only humane and acquired Gifts: Some <hi>boaſt of falſe Gifts,</hi> which as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, is <hi>like Clouds and Wind without rain:</hi> What a ſtir doth a vain Perſon make of a ſtrong Memory, crying it up as if it was a Spiritual Gift, and as if none were true Miniſters but ſuch who have a great Memory, and can deliver all they have got by their Study, by the ſtrength of their Memory; alas, all men of any ſenſe know, that is but a Natural Gift, which ſome wicked men have as well as ſome good men; but let him know, God knows what mens Hearts are, what their Ends <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 3.</note> and Deſigns are, what their Gifts are, and what their Duties are, as well as what the matter of their Worſhip is, which they perform to God; that is, whether it hath his Image <hi>ſtampt upon it;</hi> or is of his <hi>Authority,</hi> his own Appointment, <hi>his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or but <hi>Humane Inventions;</hi> he alſo weighs the manner how they perform all Divine Worſhip towards him, from what <hi>Principle, Life, Power, End</hi> and <hi>Deſign;</hi> whether 'tis from a <hi>changed Heart, from unfeigned Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to Chriſt, in <hi>ſincerity,</hi> with <hi>Zeal,</hi> and to <hi>glorify God;</hi> if not, he will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, weigh them, and they will be found wanting, and be found no better than <hi>Chaff</hi> at laſt: Though they may ſeek ways to hide and cover their Wickedneſs, and falſe Spirits, and baſe deſigns, yet let them know, he <hi>that weighs the hill in ſcales, and the mountains in balances,</hi> doth and will weigh them, and find out all their Curſed Deeds, their Pride, their Malice, and put a rebuke upon their back-ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>detracting Tongues: Talk</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hannah) no more ſo exeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proudly, let not arrogancy come out of thy mouth for God is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed:</hi> 
                  <q>Thou <hi>Peninnah</hi> (as our Aunotators note) ſpeak no more ſo inſolently and reproachfully of me as thou haſt done; he knoweth thy Heart, and all that Pride, Envy and Contempt of me, which

thy own Conſcience knows, and thy perverſe Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me: God pondereth, and tryeth all mens Thoughts and Actions, as a Juſt Judge, to give to every one according to their works.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Oh what a Motive ſhould this be to us all; God weighs our Perſons, our Graces, our Gifts, our Dutys, and all our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, in Scales: Take heed you are not found too light, found wanting, as be ſure you will if you be found Chaff, when put into the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direction.</hi> 1. If you would not be found Chaff, try and weigh your Spirits, your Perſons, your Faith, your Love; ſee if it holds weight by the Kings ſtandard, ſee on what Foundation you are built; have you <hi>dugg deep, and laid your foundation on a Rock?</hi> what Love have you to Chriſt? is he precious to your Souls, the chiefeſt of ten thouſand? what Love have you to the Children of God? how do you carry it at home and abroad? do you feed the Hungry, Viſit the Sick, and Cloath the naked? is Chriſts Family, Chriſts Servants, Chriſts Poor, more in your eſteem, love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, than Sons and Daughters, than Brethren and Siſters, that are not his Children? if you do not love Chriſt more than <hi>Father and Mother, more than Son or Daughter,</hi> you may juſtly fear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are <hi>Wheat</hi> or no: And if it be ſo, that you do ſo Love him, and his Saints, Miniſters and People, it will appear whilſt you live; and when you come to die, you will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Chriſt then, his People and Intereſt then: O think on this!</p>
               <p n="2">2. And to you Sinners, if you would be found <hi>Wheat</hi> in the day of Chriſt, then receive Chriſts true Doctrine, labour to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Error; beware of that ſtrange and new Scheme that darkens the Free-Grace of God, and tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Covenant of Grace: Remember to exalt Chriſt alone in your Salvation. How do ſome turn the Goſpel of Gods Free-Grace into a Law, by the performance of which, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Life and Juſtification tell thee, thy Salvation doth depend. See what ſubtle Oppoſers (of the cleareſt Goſpel) are riſen up amongſt us, and labour to avoid them, though their Tongues ſhould ſeem to be tipp'd with <hi>Silver,</hi> yet their Doctrine is <hi>Copper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſure Build on Chriſt alone, and ſee that that Faith thou haſt in him, be <hi>the Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> which ſanctifies both Heart and Life, and is attended with Good Fruits; you muſt work from Life, and not for Life.</p>

                  <hi>Conſolat.</hi> 1. <hi>Laſtly, By way of Comfort and Conſolation:</hi> Be not afraid, O Child of God, tho' thou art in Chriſt's <hi>Fan,</hi> and art toſt up and down with Temptatious, Trials and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Know that his Deſign is wholly herein for thy good, it is but to purge out thy Chaff, that thou as pure <hi>white Wheat</hi> may'ſt ſhine the more bright and clear in Grace and Goſpel-Holineſs, for Sin and Corruption ſpoils thy Beauty to all that behold thee. No Doctrine tends to promote Goſpel Holineſs like the Doctrine of Gods Free-Grace: <hi>Shall we ſin becauſe grace hath abounded? God forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. O what a Mercy of Mercies it is that Gods Wrath is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed towards you: Chriſts blood has quenched this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fire, as to you who believe, and indeed nothing elſe could do it; O bleſs God for Chriſt, and for that River of Water which proceeds from him, to the extinguiſhing this flaming Fire; he hath born it, and allay'd it, nay, quite put it out, ſo that you ſhall never feel the burning or tormenting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof.</p>

            <p>And to proceed, it is neceſſary to note to you in the firſt place, (as I before hinted) that the Wrath of God may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under a twofold Conſideration: As it is manifeſted,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Internally or Externally, taking hold of, and ſeizing upon ſome ungodly perſons here, whilſt in this World. <note place="margin">Gods Wrath opened.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As it is Eternal, ſeizing on and taking hold of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done and loſt Sinners hereafter.</p>
            <p>Sin is the cauſe of Gods Wrath and Vengance, both of that which is felt here and ſhall eternally be felt and undergone hereafter; the word (as the learned note) which is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Wrath,</hi> comes from a <hi>Root</hi>

               </gap> that ſignifies <hi>heat,</hi> or to be <hi>hot,</hi> and hence 'tis compared to <hi>fire;</hi> an <hi>angry Man</hi> we ſay is a <hi>fiery Man,</hi> a Man that hath much <hi>fire</hi> or <hi>fury</hi> in him; the Wrath of man is <hi>hot,</hi> but the Wrath of God is much <hi>hotter: Becauſe there is Wrath, beware.</hi> Sirs, there is Wrath in the Heart of <note place="margin">Job 36. 18.</note> God againſt Sinners, there his anger is kindled; there is


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98170:23"/>
Wrath alſo in his <hi>Decree,</hi> and in his <hi>Threatnings,</hi> his Wrath continues on all Unbelievers: <hi>He that believeth not, the Wrath of God abideth upon him.</hi> Tho' many of them do not feel it, they <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> have not the ſenſe of it, but ſhall have one day; yet there are ſome that God lets out his Wrath upon to ſuch a degree here, that they do feel it, and cry out under the ſenſe and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror thereof in a fearful manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Wrath of God, as it is compared unto fire, <note place="margin">External wrath opened.</note> is oft-times let out to conſume men in divers reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes by <hi>Poverty,</hi> as by a flame he conſumes in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret way their outward ſubſtance; <hi>there is a Curſe upon their eſtates,</hi> which dries up their Riches in which they Truſted, and ſet their Hearts upon, forgetting God their Maker, their <hi>Chief Good</hi> and Laſt End.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes he <hi>Conſumes</hi> their <hi>Honour,</hi> Reputation and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, they falling by their Iniquity into diſgrace, after they have made a Profeſſion of Religion, and have been in the Love and Eſteem of good Men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes alſo by Sickneſs as by a flame he conſumes their Health; and thus he threatned the People of <hi>Iſrael, The Lord ſhall ſmite thee with a Conſumption, and with a Feaver, and with an Inflamation, and with extream Burning.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Alſo his Wrath oftentimes breaks out like fire on ſome Men by ſuddain Death, in a ſtrange and unuſual manner, as in the caſe of <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, and of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu; and there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before</hi>

               <hi>the Lord.</hi> This was ſo amazing, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Aron</hi> and unto <hi>Eleazor,</hi> and unto <hi>Jthamar, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your cloaths, leaſt ye die, and leaſt Wrath come upon all the People; but let your brethren, the whole houſe of Iſrael bewail the burning</hi>

            <p n="5">5. Moreover God many times lets out his Wrath by <hi>War;</hi> and the <hi>Sword conſumes and devours much people:</hi> As alſo by <hi>Famine</hi> and by the <hi>Peſtilence.</hi> The Wrath of God, as it is let out in this World is as a <hi>drying, ſcorching</hi> and <hi>devouring fire:</hi> The flame of Gods Diſpleaſure puts all into a flame; as at this day, all the Earth ſeems to be on a fire, God is now a burning up, and conſuming the Nations; <hi>Therefore he hath poured upon</hi>

                        <p>David <hi>was Elected and dearly Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and tho' he fell, yet God took not utterly away his holy Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was heard when he prayed,</hi>

                           <hi>But I am in another Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever accurſed from the preſence of God; neither can I pray as he did, becauſe the Holy Spirit is quite gone, and cannot be recalled,—</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>MR. <hi>John Child</hi> was a Preacher, and when he was young a very zealous Aſſerter of the Doctrine of Gods Free-Grace; Namely, of Perſonal Election, and of the Saints final Perſeverance; and was a man of conſiderable Natural Parts and Ability, being much followed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he preached, both in the City and Countrey, yet ſeemed to be of a haughty Spirit, loving Applauſe and Popularity, which it may be feared was the Cauſe of his Fall, and may be a Warning to all how they have mens Perſons in Admiration. But he had not many years aſſerted the Doctrine before mentioned, before he changed his Judgment, and turned to be a grand <hi>Arminian;</hi> which Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he maintained with great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and was ſo conceited of his Abilities, that he ſeared not to Diſpute with any Man, charging the Doctrine of Perſonal Election at a ſtrong man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if the Aſſerters of it rendered God cruel, and worſe than the worſt of Mortals: In his Judgment he was a Baptiſt, <hi>being againſt Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and for the <hi>Baptiſm of Believers;</hi> for many years he lived in <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-ſhine,</hi> near me, I being intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted wth him for near 30 years; but a little before the laſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Diſſenters he removed his Dwelling, and came to <hi>London,</hi> and lived near to my Habitation, in <hi>Pauls Shadwel;</hi> now the firſt time I came to fear him, was through ſome Words he uttered to me, which was to his effect; <hi>I have,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſeriouſly conſidered whether there be any thing in Religion worth ſuffering for:</hi>


                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:98170:26"/>
Which Words I wondred at, from ſuch a one as he; but ſoon after he Conformed, (Troubles riſing high,) and then wrote a Curſed Book, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Diſſencers, eſpecially the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> very odious; caſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon their faithful Miniſters, becauſe ſome of them were not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, I mean with the Knowledge of the Tongues; and quickly after this he fell under fearful Deſpaira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I was one of the firſt Men that he ſent for, and I found him in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal State and Condition, being filled with Horror, ſaying, <hi>he was damned,</hi> and crying out againſt himſelf for Writing that Book; ſaying, he had touched the Apple of Gods Eye; I ſaid all I was well capable to ſpeak, to Comfort him, but all in vain; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time he ſaid, <hi>Mine iniquities are great and many, old ſins as well as of a late date come to mind; Wrath is come upon me to the utmoſt, God hath forſaken me, good Men are my Enemies; I hate my ſelf, I am afraid and aſhamed to go abroad, and am confuſed and diſtracted at home; the Scriptures look dreadfully upon me, I have raiſed Reproach, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Reproach, and by it wronged mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,—I am afraid to live, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to dye; Judgment I fear will be terrible in this World, and more in the World to come; I cannot give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Actions to Men, how much leſs to God! my Heart condemns me, and he is greater, and knows more: I think I have not only out done</hi> Cain, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, <hi>and</hi> Judas, <hi>but ſome of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O I cannot Repent, I cannot Repent! I ſhall go to Hell! I am broken in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; When I think to Pray, either I have a fluſhing in my Face as if I were in a flame, or I am dumb, I cannot ſpeak; all the ſigns of one whom God hath left, forſaken and hardened—If I was in Heaven, it could not relieve me, for I ſhould behold the Face of God and holy Saints, as now I behold the Face of good Men upon Earth, with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Face—and then again ſaid, Wrath is come upon me to the utermoſt—I am one of the greateſt Hypocrites that ever lived upon the Earth, and ſhall be ſo accounted: God hath and will do his will upon me—Oh he thunders upon me! ſhould God let out the ſence of my ſins on me, (as he will) I ſhould howl like a Dog, roar like a Lyon, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low like an Ox; mine inward parts would melt within me, as braſs melts in a flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire; I ſhall lye lower than</hi> Judas, <hi>I have ſinned worſe then</hi> Judas<hi>—he quoting thoſe words in</hi> Heb. 10. 2, 6. <hi>If we ſin willfully, after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the truths, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> &amp;c. he ſaid, <hi>when I am faint and low, I take ſome refreſhments, but in Hell, there is no refreſhment, not a drop of Water to cool my Tongue.</hi>

                           <hi>and if I were in the place of God, I ſhould meet the ſame meaſure that God doth to me: My Calamity is even at the door, and all men in a little time will juſtifie Gods dealing with me: The Wrath of God is kindled, and burns in me; it is impoſſible for you to imagin my torment, and this is but an Earneſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my Eternal Damnation.</hi> Said a godly man, this is a humbling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation that you are exerciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<hi>—A humbling diſpenſation, ſaid he, do you call it? I tell you, it is an hardening diſpenſation, and I feel it to be ſo:</hi> Said his Friend, I hope there is mercy yet reſerved for you; to whom he replyed, <hi>I know I ſhall have ſuch Mercy as the Damned have; I do highly juſtifie God in his dealings with me—</hi>at another time, <hi>I once thought, ſaid he, that there was a power in man, but now I find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for I cannot Pray—I have no deſire after any thing that is good; I cannot Repent.</hi> His Viſitors asked him if they ſhould Pray for him? he ſaid, <hi>No, No.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One ſaid to him, the Learned Dr. <hi>Twiſt</hi> in his <hi>Vinditiae Gratiae</hi> confeſſeth there were Depths in the Controverſie between the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> yet he believed the Truth againſt the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Child</hi> replyed, <hi>I thought I could have dived to the bottom of it by my parts, but I ſee I cannot;</hi> and then, and many other times ſaid, <hi>I am bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Judgment—</hi>One of his Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſaid, you are obliged to ſtoop to the Soveraignty of God; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Oh I cannot!

I ſhall be an eternal Monument of the Wrath of God—Pride and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs hath ruined me, it hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done me; I have been too much influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereby: I have been a Hypocrite, I am ſo now: I ſeem to repent, I do not, I cannot repent:</hi> And walking to the end of the room, turned back with a very ſtern Countenance, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Hand on his Breaſt, ſaid, <hi>No Sir, I cannot pamper this Body, for God will have it made a remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to this Generation.</hi> He cryed out againſt himſelf for charging thoſe that hold the Doctrine of Perſonal-Election with Conſequences beyond the Senſe of their Minds or Principles; <hi>I have,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>made this World my God, I have been guilty of Idolatry, I have been guilty of Pride, endeavouring to run eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man down in Diſpute; I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhake the Croſs off my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; how deplorable a thing is this, that I that have preached ſo much of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of another World, ſhould now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it all: You will as ſurely ſee me damned, as you now ſee me ſtand here.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To others he ſaid, <hi>I have trifled in Religion, trifled, trifled—I am loſt, there is no Hope, no Hope:</hi> At another time he ſaid, <hi>The black Tokens of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation are upon me:</hi> He ſaid to Mr. <hi>Plant,</hi> ſmiting on his Breaſt, <hi>Sir, I am Damn'd, I am Damn'd; it is ſo moſt certainly: My day is over; O that it was with me as in days paſt! but it is too late, the Decree is gone forth, it is Sealed in Heaven, and it is irreverſible.

                           <hi>he cannot Mediate for me, I have ſo much offended him, in malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abuſing of his People: O what a Wretch was I! what a Spirit was I led by!

I can neither Pray, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire others to pray for me; my Heart is perfectly hardened; how ſhould I, when I cannot deſire Jeſus Chriſt to pray for me;</hi> flouds of Tears flowing from him, <hi>Dear bought Experience,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath taught me, that it is no ſmall thing to trifle with him in the great things of Religion and Eternity,</hi> &amp;c. In one of his Letters ſent to Mr. <hi>James Jones</hi> are theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, viz. <hi>Being poſſeſſed with Doubts, Fears and Tremblings, night and day, the ſad ſavour of Gall and Wormwood, an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Reliſh of Gravel-ſtones, the ſad Apprehenſions of Curſes, Blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Mildew—the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſound of the mad Prophets words,</hi> I ſhall ſee him, but not now, I ſhall behold him, but not nigh<hi>—had I been a Backſlider of an ordinary ſize—I have a Voice behind me, or dire Texts—to love and make a Lye is a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for the Lake.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His poor Wife, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, intimated to me, that the very Ends of the Halr of his Head in the Night-ſeaſon did ſtand in Drops thro' the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his Soul.</p>
                        <p>Thus he continued for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Months under moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful horror and fearful deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, until the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1684. when to put an end to <note place="margin">The Narrative concerning Mr. <hi>Child</hi> is Sold by <hi>Tho. Fabian</hi> at the <hi>Bible</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and worthy it is, <hi>Reader,</hi> of thy peruſal.</note> his miſerable Life, he hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in his own hired houſe, in <hi>Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> near <hi>Spitle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, London,</hi> leaving a ſorrowful Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and ſeveral Children: But ſhe poor Woman lived not long after. 'Tis to be noted, that there was a ſtrange blaſt upon his Eſtate, for tho' I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by a Friend that was intimate with him, he was little before his fall worth near a thouſand pounds, yet I can hear but of a little left to his Chidren, his Eldeſt Son being but in a low and mean Condition. I take not upon me to paſs Judgment upon this miſerable Man, not knowing how God might deal with him, whoſe Mercy is Infinite, for I do not believe Self-murther is an unpardonable ſin; for if ſo, there is more Sins unto Death than one; certainly it is a <hi>Sin againſt the Father and the Son,</hi> and not againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and therefore may be forgiven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>


                           <pb n="52" facs="tcp:98170:28"/>
                           <hi>men,</hi> who may before their Life is quite gone have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance given to them. But I am of the Opinion, (with a worthy Miniſter that viſited him) that if any <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in the World who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known this man, and had converſed with him in his bitter Agonies, he would have ſeen ſufficient Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations to have convinced him that there is a dreadful God, or a Power beſides and above Nature, who can touch, ſhake, and diſorder, and turn into Confuſion the ſtrongeſt conſtitution of body, by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring and faſtning terrible things upon the Soul; and as he ſaith, let this <hi>Pillar of Salt</hi> tend to warn and ſeaſon the People of this preſent and future Ages, of the danger of ſinning againſt the light of their underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it doth I am ſure ſerve with a witneſs to prove, and fully to demonſtrate the truth of that Propoſition I am upon, <hi>viz. That God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times let out his Wrath on the Conſciences of ſome men, for their horrid evil in this World, which ſeems intollerable and hard to be born or undergone by any Mortal.</hi> But,</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To proceed, by <hi>buring up the Chaff with unqueneba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire,</hi> or by the Wrath of God in this place, our Bleſſed <note place="margin">The fire of Gods eternal wrath opened.</note> Saviour doth intend, <hi>caſting the wicked into Hell it ſelf:</hi> Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable it is, that no leſs than four or five times the Lord Chriſt poſitively affirms in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. that the fire of Hell into which Body and Soul of wicked men ſhall be caſt, cannot be quenched; <hi>where the worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched,</hi> &amp;c. Why repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Mark 9. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.</note> ſo often? is it not to aſſure all ungodly perſons of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it? Men are not willing to believe this great truth, they are too ready to think that it is inconſiſtent with infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to inflict ſuch Puniſhment on his Creatures, but alas, they forget that there is an infinite perfection in every one of the Divine Attributes, and that as Gods mercy is infinite, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, and unconceivable, ſo is his wrath and fury; none are able to conceive, much leſs to declare, what pain and anguiſh the damned undergo. What torments like fire? and what fire is ſo hot and ſo tormenting as Hell-fire? ſad it is to burn half an hour in an <hi>Elementary fire,</hi> yet the Martyrs have endured that for Chriſts ſake; God made it eaſie to ſome of them: But alas, who can bear the burnings of Hell-fire, when wrath ſhall be let out upon the Soul to the utterermoſt?</p>
            <p>O Sirs, what a fearful thing will it be to be found <hi>chaff,</hi> and falſe hypocritical Reaſons! ſuch cannot eſcape the damnation of Hell;


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98170:28"/>
No, nor can any ſinner whatſoever, <hi>except they believe, repent,</hi> or are <hi>born again;</hi> there is no avoiding being caſt into unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, I ſhall now endeavour to prove the point,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Wrath of God in Hell is intollerable, and far greater than any Wrath let out here, either on the Bodies or Souls of men;</hi> which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider theſe particulars following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The extremity of their Torment will appear, upon the Conſideration that it is inconceivable, beyond all mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; <note place="margin">Pſa. 90. 11.</note> 
               <hi>who knoweth the power of thy Anger?</hi> who can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <note place="margin">Tormens of Hell inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</note> it, or is rightly and duely affected therewith? we can conceive of all bodily pain, or external Torment, but cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Nature of infinite Wrath, no more than we can conceive or apprehend the Nature of infinite Love and Goodneſs.</p>

Wrath bears proportion unto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fear of it, nay, doth far exceed the fear thereof, and what prepared Plagues, infinite pains, intollerable anguiſh, have ſome ſelf-accuſed, and ſelf-condemned mortals feared and looked for? what is the nature of that <hi>certain fearful looking for of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

1. Theſe may be but the Fatherly Rebukes and Chaſtenings of the Almighty; not from a Sin-revenging hand, but a Sin-correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of God; not in Wrath, but in Love; but if his Anger be ſo terrible when he chaſtizes as a compaſſionate Father, what is his fury when he puniſhes as a ſevere Judge? if he deals thus ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thoſe he loves, what will their portion be whom he hates? if his Wiſdom leadeth him forth thus to corect in mercy, what will be the ſtrokes of his Juſtice and incenſed Wrath and Fury?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Miſeries of this preſent Life are abated, or mitigated with the mixture of ſome Sweet: None are ſo univerſally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, ſo deplorable, but ſome thing remains to eaſe their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and tormenting pains: Judgments are tempered with Mercys.

Pitty is the cheap and ſmalleſt relief any here can meet withal in miſery, not denyed to the moſt guilty notorious Criminal, but yet this is not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the damned; all their bitter Crys cannot move the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of God nor the Bleſſed Angels or Saints in Heaven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, for they are not Objects of Compaſſion, their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries being the juſt puniſhments of an offended God, whom they wilfully and of their own choice contemned, thro' love to Sin and this preſent World; beſides, in Hell all humane affections are extinguiſhed for ever. Ah, this is the quintiſence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Miſery, the exceſs of Anguiſh and Sorrow, to be deprived of all good things pleaſing to our deſires, and to ſuffer all evils from which we have the deepeſt averſation and

abhorrence; for as in Heaven all Good, all Felicity, all Joy, is inconceivable, ſo in Hell all evil is felt and endured to the higheſt degree, and nothing but what is evil.</p>
            <p>Some of the greateſt miſeries that Mortals have met with here in this World, have been inflicted upon them by the hand of Man, (whoſe power is but little, and oft-times reſtrained and mittigated by the Lord) as in the caſe of the poor <hi>Martyrs:</hi> But in Hell the pain and puniſhment the of damned will be from the immediate hand of Almighty God, whoſe power is Infinite; nay, and it ſhall be according to <hi>his glorious Power,</hi> or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power; <hi>Who knows the power of thine anger?</hi> When <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1. 9.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Torments of the damned will be diſmal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable <note place="margin">The damned caſt into a laye of fire.</note> and amazing, becauſe they ſhall be <hi>caſt into a lake of fire,</hi> or be tormented with fire.

               <hi>it.</hi> It is mingled with the moſt tormenting Ingredients, and not

a <hi>little</hi> of it, but a <hi>River;</hi> this ſerves ſo Illuſtriouſly to ſet it forth, that as one hints, as ſome of the Ancient Fathers expreſſed it, <hi>if one of the damned might paſs out of Hell flames into the fierceſt fires here, it were to exchange a torment for a refreſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It will be intolerable, becauſe the puniſhment of Hell <note place="margin">Hell Torments can never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Divine Juſtice.</note> is to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, to pay the juſt Debt owing to God for the breach of his holy Law; true, becauſe ſin is an infinite wrong, and the Creature is but finite, they can never pay the Debt, nor make a ſatisfaction for the injury done to God, therefore they muſt ſuffer eternally; they are always a paying, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fully pay what they owe, Juſtice requiring the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 26.</note> Nothing can ſurely ſet forth the diſmalneſs of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than this. Oh take a view of Divine Wrath in the ſufferings of our Bleſſed Saviour, when he ſtood in our ſtead, and was to ſatisfie for the Sins of all the Elect, how did it bring him down proſtrate to the ground, and made him <hi>ſweat great drops of blood,</hi> and to Cry out, <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto Death!</hi> Tho' he was God as well as Man, and had the Strength of the infinite Deity to ſupport him: Ah Sirs, this wrath laid upon finite Creatures, will ſink them down to the loweſt Hell, and grind them to Powder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It will be Wrath-amazing, and very terrible Wrath, <note place="margin">The Torments of Hell ſeize on the Souls of the damned.</note> becauſe it will ſeize <hi>on the Soul</hi> of the Sinner, it will <hi>put the Soul into the fire:</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> hath <hi>been the chief</hi> ſinner here, and therefore ſhall be <hi>the chief ſufferer</hi> in thoſe Regions of Sorrow; and how unſupportable is that Wrath which is let out on the Soul or Spirit of man, you have had a taſte in <hi>Spira</hi> and <hi>Child.</hi> If, Sirs, a ſpark of Divine Diſpleaſure, when it falls upon the guilty Conſcience, tears it to pieces, what will be thoſe floods of Divine Wrath poured forth in Hell on the Souls of Men and Women? who can ſtand here whilſt in this World before an Angry God, or encounter with Offended Omnipotency? ſuch is the ſharpneſs of his Sword, the heavineſs of his <hi>Rod,</hi> when laid on by the <hi>hand of his Wrath,</hi> that every <hi>ſtroak is deadly,</hi> and no doubt Satan greatens the wounds on the Conſcience, he charges the guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Spirits with all the Soul-killing aggravations, and ſtrives to hide Divine Mercy, and Rob the Soul of the precious Blood of Chriſt, the only lenitive and choice balm to heal a wounded Spirit. O what viſions of horror, what ſence of fear, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, were preſented to the diſtreſſed minds of theſe two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creatures before mentioned! the guilty Conſcience turns all Joy into Sorrow, all Light into Darkneſs, the ſweet Promiſes


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98170:30"/>
of the Goſpel, that aſſure of favour and pardon to believing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, afford no relief, but are turned into arguments of Deſpair, by reflecting on their former Iniquities and abuſe of Mercies, ſo that Chriſt himſelf they ſee is become their Accuſer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whatever the wounded Sinner ſees and hears (ſaith a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miniſter) afflicts him, whatever he thinks of, torments him; all the diverſions in the World, Buſineſs, Pleaſures, Merry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, Comedies, are as ineffectual to give him freedom from thoſe ſtings and furies in his breaſts, as the ſprinkling of holy Water is to expel the Devil from a poſſeſſed Perſon; thoſe who in their Pride and Jollity have deſpiſed ſerious Religion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a fond Tranſport and Extaſie, or a dull Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly and Dejection about the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet when God has ſet their ſins, with all their killing circumſtances, before their Eyes, how changed, how confounded are they at that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition! how reſtleſs in the dreadful expectation of the doom that attends them!</q> But alas, alas, what is internal Wrath let out on the Soul in Hell, as he notes? for the Aprehenſions of the Soul will be enlarged, and their ſpirits work with the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt activity: Here tho' they have no hope at preſent, yet they know not what God may do in a moment to turn their Sorrow into Joy, and their Night into Noon-day; here are many things to divert their thoughts, and they meet with ſome intermiſſion of their horror and perplexity, as Mr. <hi>Child</hi> intimated, but in Hell there's none of this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It will be intolerable miſery, becauſe it ſhall be Torments on the Body and Soul too, not on the Soul only, <note place="margin">Body and Soul both ſhall be tormented in Hell.</note> but on both. O it will be a diſmal Meeting, when they two old Companions meet together at the laſt day, I mean the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Soul and Body of a wicked man, at the Reſurrection, and hear the doleſom Sentence, <hi>Go ye curſed. Spira</hi> and <hi>Child</hi> had diteful Sorrow and Anguiſh in their Souls, but their Bodies were not much tormented, they both being in a ſtate of Health as to the outward man; but the fire of Gods Wrath will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to and ſeize upon the Body as well as on the Soul in that day; every Faculty of the Soul and Member of the Body which have been Inſtruments of Sin, ſhall then be in Pain, and under fearful Torture and Miſery: Now the <hi>Spirit of a man may</hi> ſupport <hi>or ſuſtain</hi> his bodily <hi>Infirmities</hi> and Afflictions, but in Hell the Spirit cannot afford any Relief to the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot ſuſtain its own miſery, both muſt and ſhall ſuffer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98170:31"/>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> All the Perplexing <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> will then be let out upon the wicked, beyond whatever they have been here whilſt in this World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Conſcience in a fearful manner ſhall torment the damned:</hi>

The meer fear of Hell is not ſufficient to Convert the Souls of men, tho' it may ſtop them in their way, and prevent great Abominations in the groſs acts thereof, yet does not, cannot renew their Nature, regenerate and make holy their hearts and lives; that Religion that is the meer effect of fear will be according to the nature of its principle, even legal, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and inconſtant; yet the fear of Hell may awaken the ſinner, and in ſome ſence prepare for Grace: When the Soul is ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the terror of Wrath, and the fear of Hell has made a breach, Divine Grace enters, but it is the Love of God and hopes of Heaven that works ſpiritual affections, (as the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that flows therefrom is Evangelical, free and voluntary, from the entire conſent of the Soul) and are abiding.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be content with your Condition, tho' poor in this World, remember <hi>Lazarus,</hi> how much better was his ſtate than the Rich Glutton's? O do not envy the wicked that are Rich, they will pay dear for their Wealth when they come to Hell, which they with greedy covetous minds heap up. I remember a Paſſage which is related in Hiſtory: A General with an Army paſſing through another Princes Countrey, gave ſtrict Order that no Perſon ſhould offer to touch the leaſt thing which belong'd to the Inhabitants; but nevertheleſs one Souldier as they were upon their March, ſtole a Bunch of Grapes, which the General being informed of, gave Order that he ſhould immediately be put to Death; as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Execution, he tell a eating his Grapes, and ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons looking greedily on him, he obſerving them, ſaid, <hi>Do not envy me my Grapes, for they coſt me dear, they coſt me my Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it appear to all that you do love Jeſus Chriſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the honour of God and his intereſt above all things in this World; let the main end and deſign of your Souls in deſiring Grace, Gifts, Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in all you act and do in his Service, be, that you may advance his Glory.</p>
               <p>Sirs, the time is hear when it will be known who are Chriſts <hi>Wheat,</hi> true Chriſtians, and who are not; but let all that are but Chaff tremble, for Hell is prepared for them: <hi>He will gather the Wheat into his garner, but the Chaffs he will burn up with unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable fire.</hi>
