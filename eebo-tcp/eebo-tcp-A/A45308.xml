            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have been, and ſtill continue to be ſo much engag'd, in Reviewing ſome Accounts and Papers of Moment, that I could find no Leiſure to Copy thoſe looſe Papers, that contain my Project for a <hi>well Regulated Militia,</hi> which I promis'd to put in Your Hands in the <hi>Eaſter-Week:</hi> And this <hi>Seſſion</hi> draws ſo near a Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the <hi>Militia-Bill</hi> now before the <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe,</hi> being ready to paſs the Third Reading; I ſee no room for admitting my Papers to be heard in a Committee, if I had 'em ready for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, Fears and Jealouſies; becauſe I meet with a great many People every-where, that are apt to fancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We ſhould be in a very unprovided Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if 30 or 40000 Diſciplin'd Men ſhould Land upon us, now the Regular Troops are reduc'd to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94496:3"/>
7000 Men, and the Invaders would meet with no Body to oppoſe 'em, but a <hi>Raw <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexperienced Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> and they not to be drawn into any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Body under a Month or Six Weeks. This I aſſure you, is a mighty uneaſie reflection to many good Men, and they begin with Impatience to deſire Your Bill may paſs out of Hand, that purſuant to the Model of it, We may be ſo well prepar'd, that no Foreign State may <hi>dare</hi> to think of Invading us. For my part, I ſhould be very ready to have no great Opinion of any State but ours, that conſiſted in a Body of about 1,500,000 Men, capable of bearing Arms, and they poſſeſs'd a Large, Fruitful, Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Country, of above Thirty Millions of Acres; and yet, upon a Rumour of an Enemy of 30 or 40000 Men approaching their Frontiers, ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fall into a Great and General Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently run into ſuch Confuſion, as to be incapable of making any Oppoſition; but <hi>ſcour away</hi> like a <hi>terrify'd Mob,</hi> or <hi>fly like a Flock of Sheep.</hi> And yet 'tis no Wonder, that a Populous Country, and a Generous Free People, as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> are, ſhould be Alarum'd, when they have a Fertile Soil, Great and Valuable Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and many Thouſand Lives to loſe; if they can truſt to nothing but a <hi>Country Rabble,</hi> or a <hi>Giddy Multitude,</hi> for their Preſervation. I am therefore of Opinion, 'tis the happieſt Policy, that any State can practice, ſo to model its Subjects, and their Eſtates, that in Caſes of extreme Publick Danger, the whole united Power of both may be ſo readily collected,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94496:4"/>
as to make the braveſt Defence <hi>with their own Hands,</hi> without ſending to <hi>Foreign Countries</hi> for <hi>Aſſiſtance;</hi> which every Body, that has read our Chronicle knows, has been often Fatal to <hi>England:</hi> And I am ſure it remains an <hi>Indelible Reproach</hi> upon Our Anceſtors, that their Diſcord was ſo Notorious, and Government, at ſome times, was ſo Imprudent and Impotent, that when they were Invaded by one Neighbour, they were often oblig'd to ſend to others, and give them an Invitation to Invade 'em, to ſave their Liberties; and when they have ſo done, pay their Saviours with an abſolute Surrender of the Liberties they came to redeem. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or the Inhabitants of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> were often in this Humour, and as often ſmarted for it before the Times of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the Firſt, and hardly ever ſucceeded, but in the Caſe of <hi>William</hi> the Third, a <hi>Prince of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nparalell'd Virtues, and an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nalterable Friend to Liberty.</hi> The petty Princes and States of <hi>Itály</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but ſmall Territories, and few Subjects are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put upon this Shift: Some Potent Neighbouring Princes are choſen their Protectors; and becauſe they cannot ſubſiſt alone, they admit Foreign Troops into their Garriſons, to ſecure their Towns and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>But <hi>England</hi> certainly is a Countrey of ſo large an extent, and ſo well fill'd with <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Able Men,</hi> and thoſe Men are of ſo true a <hi>Natural Courage,</hi> that 'tis impoſſible for us to want help from <hi>Abroad,</hi> in any occaſion whatever, if our own Countrymen are but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94496:4"/>
well Arm'd and Diſciplin'd <hi>at Home;</hi> and 'tis our own fault if we either have not been, or are not ſo <hi>now;</hi> and the fear of an Invaſion is juſtly Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon our ſelves, if we are not ſo well prepar'd, as to let all the World know <hi>they may come if they dare.</hi> For who <hi>durſt</hi> think of ſuch an Enterprize, if he were ſure to be receiv'd at his Landing with <hi>Sixty Thouſand Brave Fellows,</hi> under good Diſcipline, and skilful Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, ready to Cut the <hi>Invaders in pieces,</hi> and force <hi>'em into the Salt Water?</hi> The Thirteen Cantons of <hi>Switzerland</hi> poſſeſs a Tract of Land, that in Value and Number of People, I dare ſay, don't exceed the Three Counties of <hi>Kent, Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Surry;</hi> and tho' the Countrey makes a very rude and troubleſome March<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the Militia is ſo well Order'd, that upon occaſion they can bring into the Field, in Ten Days time, a compleat Army of Fifty or Sixty Thouſand Men; and ſooner too, if we may believe thoſe who have been there. Now if the People here were as well Diſciplin'd as the <hi>Switzers</hi> are, or according to the Model I have drawn: I ſee no manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt, that ſhould an Enemy of Twenty or Thirty Thouſand Men Land in any part of <hi>Kent</hi> or <hi>Suſſex;</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And our <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> would then <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe</hi> thoſe very Forces, of which a <hi>great many Men</hi>

amongſt us now ſeem to be <hi>afraid.</hi> But ſhould any one of our Neighbours, <hi>deſtitute of Faith and Truth,</hi> make an Attempt upon us at this preſent Juncture, the fitteſt Expedient that I can think of, is, That by a Reſolve of the Houſe, His Majeſty may immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſue a Proclamation, to all Officers and Soldiers that have Serv'd in the late War, to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſuch a Day, at ſuch a Place, where they ſhall have ſuch Encouragements, as, Two Shillings <hi>per diem</hi> for a Foot Soldier, Four Shillings <hi>per diem</hi> for a Dragoon, and Six Shillings <hi>per diem</hi> for an Horſeman, during the Expedition, a <hi>Gratuity</hi> of the Rebels Eſtates, when the Service is over, and a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Families of thoſe who fall in the Service;</hi> join with theſe the Militia of <hi>London,</hi> and of the neareſt Counties, to the place of Invaſion; and I would hope theſe might ſerve our turn for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if occaſion be, which God forbid: And for the future, I hope we ſhall be put in ſo good a Poſture by the <hi>preſent Parliament,</hi> as to make all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours utterly deſpair of ever ſucceeding in any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Invaſion of <hi>England.</hi>
