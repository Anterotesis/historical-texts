            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBEDIENCE Due to the Preſent KING, Notwithſtanding our OATHS To the FORMER.</head>
            <p>1. THE Oath of Allegiance is the Expreſſion of our <hi>Natural</hi> Duty to the King (as the Coronation-Oath is of the <hi>Regal;</hi> which in Nature is antecedent to<note place="margin">He muſt be King before we can be bound to him as ſuch.</note> it) 'tis eſpecially ſignified in theſe Words, <hi>I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Majeſty, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and him and them will Defend against all Attempts, which ſhall be made againſt his or their Perſons, their Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If the King do manifeſtly ſeparate his <hi>Perſon</hi> from, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it againſt his <hi>Crown and Dignity;</hi> ſo that we cannot Defend
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61721:3"/>
them both: I mean, if his Perſonal Actions, contrary to Law, do directly and openly tend to the prejudice and ſpoiling of his <hi>Crown and Dignity,</hi> by his voluntary ſubjecting them to a <hi>Foreign</hi> Power, contrary to the plain and primary intention and Letter of the <hi>Oath;</hi> ſubverting the Legal Conſtitution, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervating the very <hi>Laws</hi> by which his Crown is ſupported, his Prerogative is meaſured, and the Dignity of the King, as ſuch, hath its very being, as well as the ſafety of his People is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; certainly, in <hi>ſuch</hi> a Caſe, none can be bound by this, or any other Oath, to Defend the King's <hi>Perſon,</hi> in attempts ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the very <hi>Reaſon</hi> and End of all Government, with the neglect of the other part of our Duty, which is to Defend his <hi>Crown and Dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> ſeems to direct us more clearly in this difficulty; the words are, <hi>I ſhall bear Faith and true Allegiance to the King's Highneſs;</hi> but how? it follows, <hi>and to my Power ſhall Aſſiſt and Defend all Juriſdictions, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Preheminences and Authorities, Granted</hi> or belonging to the King, or annex'd and united to the Imperial <hi>Crown</hi> of this Realm; that is, <hi>thus</hi> we are to bear Faith and Allegiance to the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. For if we ſhould be bound to <hi>Aſſiſt and Defend his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when</hi> it is, and <hi>as</hi> it is engaged againſt his <hi>Crown</hi> and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we ſeem bound, <hi>toto poſſe &amp; totis viribus</hi> (ſo far De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is expounded) to Aſſiſt and Contribute to the Ruine both of our King and Country, and perhaps to the cutting of our own Throats.</p>
            <p>5. If any ſhould imagine, That the Oath will not ſuffer us to conſider the Perſon and Crown of the King thus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but that it binds us to aſſiſt and defend them together: 'tis true, while they are kept together. But if the <hi>King</hi> himſelf divide them, and 'tis become impoſſible for us to Aſſiſt his Perſon but we muſt Betray his Crown; nor Defend his Crown without forbearing to aſſiſt his Perſon; to ſay, now we are bound to Aſſiſt and Defend both, makes a plain Repugnancy in the Oath, and in our Duty (to do and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61721:3"/>
not to do the ſame thing) and conſequently the Obligation ceaſeth.</p>
            <p>6. That we are bound by our <hi>Allegiance</hi> to Aſſiſt the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the King, to the prejudice of his Crown and People, ſeems not only to be againſt the light of Nature, the <hi>primary</hi> End of it being the ſafety of his Kingdom, and the ſafety of the King but the <hi>ſecondary</hi> end of it; but moſt agreeable to the ſenſe of our Ancient and Learned <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and alſo, of<note place="margin">Br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> the plain acknowledgment and profeſſion of Ancient <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> I. five Hundred Years agone, told the Pope, Whilſt I live, the <hi>Authorities and Uſages of the Kingdom ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be diminiſhed:</hi> But if I <hi>would</hi> ſo <hi>Debaſe my ſelf</hi> (which <hi>God forbid) Magnates mei &amp; totus Angliae populus nullo modo pateren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> The Lords and People of <hi>England</hi> would by no means ſuffer it. And <hi>Edward</hi> I. wrote himſelf to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Beſides, with his conſent, the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament, in their Letter to the <hi>Pope,</hi> have theſe Words, <hi>We do not permit, or in the leaſt will permit (ſicut nec poſſumus nec debemus)</hi> though our Soveraign Lord the <hi>King</hi> do, or in the leaſt wiſe <hi>attempt</hi> to do any of the Premiſes (by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes Authority touching his Right to <hi>Scotland</hi>) ſo ſtrange a thing, ſo unlawful, prejudicial, and otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of, <hi>though the King himſelf would.</hi> Once more, on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Fourth of <hi>Henry</hi> III. the Commons Declare, <hi>Si Dominus Rex &amp; Regni majores hoc vellent (Adomer</hi>'s Revocation upon the Popes Order) <hi>Communitas tamen ipſius ingreſſum in Angliam, nulla tenus ſuſtineret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what's the meaning of all this? but that the King's <hi>Perſonal</hi> Will, contrary to Law, however expsreſſed (for it muſt be ſignified by his Words or Actions) if the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it would prejudice his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. Much leſs are we bound by our <hi>Allegiance</hi> to Aſſiſt or Defend him in ſo doing, in <hi>Reaſon, Law,</hi> or the ſenſe of our Ancient <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61721:4"/>
               <p>Objection. <hi>But we Swear to Defend, not only the</hi> King, <hi>but his</hi> Heirs <hi>and</hi> Lawful Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. True, but <hi>Haeres non eſt viventis,</hi> and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, in Law and Common Senſe, is the <hi>Perſon</hi> that doth <hi>actually</hi> ſucceed, or is in poſſeſſion. Now if the <hi>actual</hi> Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor be the <hi>Lawful</hi> Succeſſor, we are bound by our Oaths to Defend him; but if he be not the <hi>Lawful</hi> Succeſſor, none elſe is ſo, becauſe none elſe is the <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo far the <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of our Oaths ceaſing, our <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> by them ceaſeth, and we are bound to none beſides the Perſon in Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis farther remarkable, That though the word <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> be once in the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> 'tis only <hi>there,</hi> where we Swear Faith and Allegiance in <hi>General;</hi> but, as if it were intended, that the Subject ſhould not trouble himſelf about the <hi>Title</hi> of the King in <hi>being,</hi> where that Allegiance is explain'd with reſpect to Practice, the word <hi>Lawful</hi> is left out in that Oath. It follows there in theſe Words,—<hi>Shall Aſſiſt and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all Juriſdictions,</hi>—Granted or belonging to the Kings Highneſs, his Heirs and <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> without the word <hi>Lawful.</hi> And agreeable hereunto, we find the word wholly left out in the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> both in the ſame place, where we Swear Allegiance in <hi>General,</hi> as well as in the other place of our more particular Duty; and it looks as if this was done <hi>de Induſtria,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, namely, that ſuch as take the Oaths might not think themſelves bound thereby to be <hi>Sollicitous</hi> about the <hi>Title</hi> to the Crown.</p>
               <p>3. The Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſeem not to involve the Conſciences of <hi>private</hi> Chriſtians about <hi>Princes Titles;</hi> but expreſly require their Subjection to the <hi>Powers that are,</hi> as a great and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary inſtance of that Humility and <hi>peaceable</hi> Behaviour which their <hi>Religion</hi> teacheth them.</p>
               <p>4. In the ſame Holy Books, we are further moſt plainly admoniſh'd, that (by what means ſoever obtained) 'tis <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61721:4"/>
                  <hi>that putteth down one, and ſetteth up another;</hi> and upon that<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> ground too, we are ſtrictly charg'd to <hi>Submit</hi> to the <hi>Powers that are,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>Ordain'd of God.</hi> And tho' the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> uſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I think, none can imagine he intended by it, to determine the lawfulneſs of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Title, who was admitted by the <hi>Senate;</hi> but rather, to inforce that Obedience that he preſſeth the Chriſtians to yield, by this Conſideration,<note place="margin">Imperatores Rom. fatendum eſt, non optimo Jure Imperium adeptos. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>all Authority</hi> is from <hi>God;</hi> and in its true <hi>Nature</hi> and by God's <hi>Ordinance,</hi> intended for our <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The known <hi>Statute</hi> of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. is of the ſame import, and grounded, we find, upon the like <hi>Reaſon</hi> and H. <hi>Scripture,</hi> it gives us way to this plain inference, that the <hi>ſame duty</hi> which we owe to a <hi>lawful</hi> King, is to be performed to the <hi>King in being;</hi> that is, to the King in <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> and that no other <hi>King</hi> or future <hi>Parliament</hi> can in <hi>Reaſon, Law,</hi> or <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> upon any pretence of Uſurpation in the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of the Crown, or any <hi>Diſloyalty</hi> in the Subject, charge us with guilt, for <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> or defending the King in Poſſeſſion. The Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, might lawfully fight for him, and conſequently take the Military Oath; in <hi>Reaſon</hi> (by the Law of <hi>Nature</hi>) in <hi>Law,</hi> by the Law of the Land; in all <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> that is, by the Law of God, in the H. Scriptures.</p>
               <p>6. Hereupon, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s words are notable: This <hi>Act,</hi> ſaith he (meaning 25 <hi>Ed. 3. about Treaſon</hi>) is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown and Kingdom: for if there be a <hi>King Regnant</hi> in Poſſeſſion, altho' he be <hi>Rex de facto</hi> and <hi>non de jure,</hi> yet is he <hi>Seignior le Roy,</hi> within the <hi>purview</hi> of this Statute; and the <hi>other,</hi> that hath <hi>Right</hi> and is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,</hi> is not <hi>within this Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, ſaith he, if <hi>Treaſon</hi> be committed againſt a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and <hi>non de jure,</hi> and after the King <hi>de jure</hi> come to the Crown, he ſhall <hi>puniſh</hi> the Treaſon done to the King <hi>de facto;</hi> and a <hi>pardon</hi> granted by a King <hi>de jure,</hi> that is not alſo <hi>de facto,</hi> is void, <hi>Inſt. 3. l. p.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Now if by the Law of the Land, which I think is our only guide in ſuch Caſes, Treaſon may be committed againſt a <hi>King</hi>

               <p>But as to the Argument from <hi>Gratitude,</hi> when we ſeriouſly reflect upon our <hi>late</hi> forlorn and <hi>ruinous</hi> Condition both in Church and State; when we call to mind that all our Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations were put out of courſe, and our Pillars even broken by the late King's own ill-guided hands; and that the <hi>Heroick Prince</hi> hath been at ſo great <hi>Expence,</hi> and expoſed himſelf to ſo many <hi>hazards,</hi> in his own <hi>Country,</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> and here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in Compaſſion both to our <hi>Miſeries</hi> and <hi>Infirmities;</hi> when our <hi>Land</hi> was <hi>weak,</hi> and all the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> thereof in an utter <hi>diſability</hi> to reſcue or ſave themſelves; and none under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, within the reach of humane apprehenſion, beſides that one Prince, could poſſibly effect it; that glorious Inſtrument under God, put his hand to ſupport and ſtrengthen, and <hi>bear up our Pillars:</hi> to Redeem and Secure our <hi>Religion, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Liberties;</hi> and when our late King, either for fear of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or rather of the Iſſue of Affairs in our <hi>Re-eſtabliſhment,</hi> had <hi>deſerted</hi> or <hi>abdicated his Kingdom,</hi> and left us in Confuſion to ſhift for our Selves; whoſe return now cannot be thought of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Horrour: and the preſent <hi>King and Queen,</hi> being therefore firſt Petitioned, to take the Government, have graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it, upon <hi>terms</hi> anſwering all mens deſires or <hi>intereſts.</hi> I ſay, when all this is well pondered, the Ground and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for our quiet and chearful ſubmiſſion, taken from <hi>Gratitude,</hi> is indeed <hi>too big</hi> to be contained in a <hi>ſheet</hi> or two of Paper, or the <hi>mind of Man:</hi> and Prodigious, beyond the credit of <hi>Poſterity.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, One would think there was no place left for any further Scruple.
