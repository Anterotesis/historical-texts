            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherfore, I haue now at last condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to the generalty, and doe here present your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship these <hi>Wittes, Fittes,</hi> and <hi>Fancies,</hi> a large and vniuersall matter, which were they not fronted and suffused with an honest blush of Honour and Wisdome (your owne proper Cullours) I would not haue aduentured in so high a place: And if besides therin be any absurditie escaped, vnanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to so great worth and Noblenesse as is in your L. I hope the generaltie of the matter, ioint that the Author is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, will, if not priuiledge such amisse, yet at least wise holde it excused in your fauour. It seemeth the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for his part (for so he was) did not baselie conceipt this matter, that did dare direct it to so high a State as <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> his Lieges brother. But how ere it were blameworthy or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

in him I recke not, neither yet force I howe <hi>Don Iohn</hi> conceipted it, so your Lordship daigne it in gree. I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende it to your late sea-voyage, to the ende it might haue pleased you to passe away therwith some vnpleasant houres. But as it was not ripe ynough for that season, so now I pray God it come in due season to your good liking. Diuers of them are of mine own inserting, &amp; that without any iniury I hope to my Authour: the which are easily to be discerned from his, for that they taste more Englishlie: Neither haue I vsed his Methode therein, but haue set downe one of mine owne, which I take to be better: Which both methode and matter, if I shall once perceiue your L. to daigne it in your fauour, I will not feare that any Gentleman will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie disgrace it, to whome next vnder your Lordship, I wish it currant and well accepted: For such (I knowe) is generally their deuotions to your woorth, that whatsoeuer matter, (all were it guilt it selfe) that is once refuged to your Vertues shrine and Sanctuarie, they will not rashlie rauish it to arraignment, and publike shame.</p>
            <p>As for my <hi>Loues Owle</hi> in the latter ende, the trueth is, I can pretend it no outlandish priuiledge to your Honours fauour, and therefore doe rather leaue it to your pardon then good liking, as a follie of an idle vaine: Vpon which your said pardon of the one, and good liking of the other presuming; I will endeuour according to my euer vowed and bounden dutie to your L. to serue you (God willing) in some better worth hereafter. Hoping that what I haue heer done, may at least wise serue to put better wittes in minde to honour your Noblenesse aswell with their peacefull pens as others doe with their sea-paines.</p>

            <p>GEntlemen: these <hi>Wittes, Fittes and Fancies</hi> are of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to admit no eloquence wherewith to delight yee, as also manie of them to seem barren at the first sight, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles to the second eie may minister content and merriment: Vnderstand yee therefore, that I direct them not to the sullen and moodie person, who happily in his austeritie will befoole a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of them before euer hee read them, as matter either differing from his soure disposition, or perhaps aboue his wit. Neither doe I professe them as regular Methodes or deepe grounded Axiomes of Logicke certaintie, but as certaine free Offals and presidents of <hi>Wits</hi> wandering variety. <hi>Momus</hi> (Gentlemen) I confesse, were able to make a foule wracke among them, were he as precise as he is malicious; Wherefore, my desire is they come not vnder his Rauin, nor yet vnder <hi>Minos</hi> heauie censure: But vvhosoeuer is Gentle merrie-wittie, he take all.

Pleaseth your Maiestie, the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> hath not forborn any rapine that euer he could attaine vnto, either vpon your Graces proper goods, or any of your subiects, and wil your Maiesty then daigne to deale thus ciuilly with him? Whereunto the King answered: All that I desire of my Nephew of <hi>Portugall,</hi> is but to take away the bad conceipts and opinions of his will, and not the attires of his person.</p>
               <p>A Portugall deliuered a Forte to the foresaid <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and being shortly after with the King in other seruice against his Countrimen (who very brauely defended their holde) hee saide vnto him, And it like your Maiestie, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>A Portugall</hi> Gentleman besought his King of a protection against certaine his enemies, who had vowed his death: The King thereunto condiscended, and gaue it him. Shortly after he came againe vnto the King, and complained to him of the

               <p>A Moore-King of <hi>Granada,</hi> called <hi>Chiquito,</hi> yeelded the said towne to <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> vppon composition, and being marched away with his troops a mile or two fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence made a stande, and from a high hill turned backe to viewe the towne, as his last farewell thereunto: and beholding it, he fell a weeping, &amp; said: Better had I lost my life then so faire a towne. His Mother hereunto answered: You doe well (son) to weepe like a woman, seeing you did not defend it like a man.</p>
               <p>A Moore King shewing his Nobles much treasure, and a great heap of iewelles, they all commended his Maiesty for so rich spoiles ouer his enemies. And one amongst the rest saide.

                  <hi>Salladine</hi> the Moore, that last of all won <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from the Christians dying, commanded a winding sheet to bee borne in pompe at his funerall vpon the point of a Launce, and a Herald to pronounce aloud these wordes <hi>Salladine</hi> great Lord of <hi>Asia,</hi> of all his wealth and glory, only this winding sheete he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away with him.</p>

affaire, and the Queene bespake the King to choose some fitter person, namely one of a better sight: The King would not, but imployed him, who very happily effected the affaire. Shortly after, the King vsing him in another peece of seruice, it was the Gentlemans chaunce to succeed il therein: Wherupon at his succeslesse returne, the Queene commaunded her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer to giue him two hundred poundes for his paines. The Treasurer maruelling why her Maiesty was so bountifull to one, whome she so ill conceited, and had so ill deseru'd. The Queene said: As for his former seruice, in that he did it wel, he did it out of kind, but now that he hath failed herein, I tel you, he hath duly done his kind, and fitted my expectation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isabell</hi> Queene of <hi>Spaine,</hi> willed a Gentleman to buy her a Nagge of such a proportion, and of such a collour: The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman not finding any such, presented her with a most good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly horse and a mare, but she still demanding the aforesaid Nag, at last he answered.

Not so (said the Pope) rather are they right necessarie (in my opinion) for without them the world would increase so fast, that one could not liue by an other.</p>
               <p>An olde seruitor of a Pope besought him of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of <hi>Sylence</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Serdinia,</hi> the said suppliant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a verie talkatiue and prating man: Wherunto the Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: Trust me, you haue no reason to craue that Sea of all others, beeing it will euermore approue you a lyar.</p>
               <p>A Cardinall complained vnto Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth, how one <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> his painter in a picture which he had drawne of Dooms-day in S. <hi>Peters</hi> chappel at <hi>Rome,</hi> had ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in figured him in hell amongst the damned, beseeching him to bid it be altered to some other fauour: Whereunto the Pope answered: Well you wot, I can release a soule out of <hi>Purgatory</hi> but not out of hell.</p>

               <p>A Cardinall passing along the street, and being saluted by a band of souldiours with much shot, so as the smoke was verie thick &amp; vnsauory: one of his Gent. besought him to hasten som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what faster fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out that fume: Oh no (answered the Cardinal) this is the sent that pleaseth me aboue al the incense in the world.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>Symenes</hi> being deputed high gouernour ouer all <hi>Spaine</hi> in the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> his absence, &amp; vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding at last, that the Emperour was now landed againe on the coast: At this present newes he disposed all the treasure he then had in his handes to the Colledge of <hi>Alcala,</hi> and to other Church v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as though that <hi>Spaine</hi> nowe needed no treasure for her defence, so long as the Emperour was there arriued in person.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11550:28"/>
And as concerning the saide treasure he said, that if an Angell from heauen should haue told him before the Emperours lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that his Maiestie would not rid him therof at his arriual, he would haue thought him some deuill in an Angels shape: And that now no lesse would he think him a Deuil that should come and tell him that the Emperour would not acquite him thereof, hauing dispos'd it to so good vses.</p>
               <p>The foresaid Cardinall neuer bestowed benefice vpon any that came to beg it at his hands: It chanced on a time that a priest hearing of a rich benefice that was newly fallen in his countrey, and being verie liquorish thereof came vnto him, and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spake him: Most reuerend Sir, forasmuch as well I wot your Grace neuer bestowes benefice vpon any that craues it at your handes, I giue you to vnderstand that in my country there is a benefice fallen into your graunt, which would very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed me, by reason it is neer the place where I was borne. Now I humblie beseech your Graces good aduise how I may come by it. Well (answered the Cardinall) you shall haue it, &amp; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he commanded his Secretarie to draw him out a faire col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which was done, and he had it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall <hi>Don Pedro Gonzales de Mendoza</hi> vpon a Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas morning offred at a Masse an entier Altar-suit, so rich, as it was valued at eighteen thousand Crownes, and after his saide Offertorie ended, kneeling downe before the Altar, hee there remained a good space in humble prayer and teares: Which the Marques of <hi>Cenete</hi> seeing, came to him, &amp; said: Reuerend Father, I beseech you weepe no more, for I'le vndertake to get you the whole suite restor'd you againe.</p>
               <p>The said Cardinall seeing a Priest carying a cudgell vnder his gowne, said vnto him: It yll beseemes your habit to beare a weapon about you: Wherunto the Priest answered and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, that hee bare it not in quarrell against any Christian crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world, but only to defend himselfe against the dogges of that towne, which he found to be fierce and angrie curres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The Cardinall <hi>Don Alonso Manrique</hi> spent much, and ow'd much: There was in his Church a Channon, who was so good a fellow that he seldome eat at home, &amp; yet neuertheles retain'd a Steward in continuall standing wages: Wherupon the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall vpon a time merrily asking him what he meant to keep a Steward, hauing so little vse to put him to: The Channon no lesse merrilie answered: Your Grace hath great reason, for in sooth (my Lord) my Steward and your Treasurer may very well be whipt at a Carts tayle for vagabondes.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman of Cardinall <hi>Wolsey</hi> making way before his Lord as he passed through the church, &amp; seeing a poore priest kneeling at his prayers in the way, raised him vp, saying: Room for my Lord Cardinalls Grace: Whereupon the priest rose vp and said: Will his Grace (trow ye) supplie my place?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Don Alonso Cartillio,</hi> a Spanish Archbishop, his housholde expence was so excessiue, that on a time his Stewarde telling him, that except he tooke some more moderat course of liuing his rents could not possiblie maintaine it: Wel, (answered the Archbishop) set me downe then what meane you would haue me obserue in this matter: Whereunto the steward replying, that it might please his Grace to put away all idle persons, and retaine only necessarie ones: Wel (reply'd the Prelate) but giue me then a note of such as you judge necessarie, and another of the vnnecessarie. The steward did so: Then the morrow after the Bishop commanding all his houshold before him into his

great hall, will'd his steward to set his necessary seruants in a row by themselues on the one side, and the vnnecessary ones likewise seuerall by themselues on the other side; which being done, he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> said vnto his steward: These necessarie ones which you haue heer placed, I haue need of them all, &amp; these others (I tell thee) they haue all need of mee: Wherefore necessary and vnnecessary, I will still retaine them all.</p>
               <p>A poor widow that had her only daughter to bestow, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly besought the aforesaid Archbishop of his bountie towards her preferment. The Bishop was content, and calling for pen and inke, wrote a warrant downe into the country to his ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to deliuer her fiftie pounds, thinking indeed he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but fiue pounds: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the steward saw the bill, he straight tooke horse and rode vp to the Bishop, and told him: Your Grace hath awarded yonder poore widow fifty poundes for her daughter, and so it is that I haue not so much in hand. No (said the Bishop) what not poore fiue pounds? Yes fiue, and like your Grace (answered the steward) but your assignation is fifty pounds: Be it fiftie pounds then (reply'd the Bishop) for sure not I, but God or some of his good Angels set it down so: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more adoe, let her haue it. With that the steward was faine to borrow it, and she had it.</p>
               <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> riding along the plaine all roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about with men of warre, &amp; himselfe most brightly glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Armes: A Swaine ploughing therabouts laughed to see him so: Which the Prelate perceiuing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him straight before him, and asked him why hee laughed so: Mary I laugh (answered the Pesant) to see an Archbishop so souldiourly gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. Why sirrha (said the Bishop) I am thus as a Duke, not as an Archbishop or a priest: Euen so Sir (reply'd the swaine) now I pray then, crack me this nut, Were my L.

               <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Granada,</hi> saying to the Archbishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> that he much maruelled he being so great a State would

visit Hospitals, and performe to the sick and needie such a deale of drudgerie as daylie he did. Maruell not hereat (answered the good Bishop) but rather well weighing with your selfe, what is the true dignitie and dutie of a pastor, woonder at the manie good duties I doe omit.</p>
               <p>A Spanish Bishop riding on the way saw a shepheard sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe vnder a banke, and thus he bespake him: I maruel much (shepheard) that shepheardes now a daies are not like as they were in times past, when there were of them great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and great kinges in the world, and to them it was that the Angel first denounced the natiuitie of our sauiour Iesus Christ afore all others. Oh Sir (answered the shepheard) neither are Bishops nowe a dayes like to those good ones of olde time at diuers of whose deathes the belles did ring of themselues, and nowe can scarce be made to tolle but with many mens strength.</p>
               <p>A Bishop sent halfe a dozen of Capons to an Abbot, and the bearer eat one of them to his dinner by the way: Now when th' Abbot had red the Bishops letter, which certified that he had sent him sixe Capons, he then said vnto the messenger.

               <p>In a solemne festiuitie which was holden at <hi>Guadalajara</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> two Gentlemen appeared to the multitude in Clergie attire, to discharge vnto them some Church-merriment, and being demaunded in a Bishops name, who was there present,

Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Asse died also: Then the olde womans sonne (who had a colt of the aforesaid asse) finding that the Asse at her death time had left behind her a good quantity of her allowance in oates vnspent, which he lawfully demanding of the Executors, they denyed to deliuer him: He thereupon came to a graue Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in law to haue his aduise in the case: Whereunto the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in full notice of all the matter, thus resolu'd him. viz.

Then hee proceeded, and said: Nay, by Gods death then you are all to be saued, &amp; no otherwise: They all answered againe: Oh sweare not. Then he adjoyn'd: Yes, by Gods wounds, and his passion only you are to be saued, and if you think otherwise you lie, &amp; are deceiued: And therfore tell not me of swearing, for I tell ye againe, and again, that by Gods death, Gods blood, his wounds, and his passion only, and no otherwise, ye are to be saued.
