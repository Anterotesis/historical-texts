            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whence came it else to be so lately looked on as the way to <hi>advance Religion,</hi> to <hi>banish Peace,</hi> and to <hi>reform mens manners by taking away their lives?</hi> whereas in those pure and primitive times when <hi>Religion</hi> did truly <hi>flourish,</hi> it was accounted the greatest <hi>instance</hi> of the piety of Christians <hi>not to fight but to dye for Christ.</hi> It was never thought then that <hi>Bellona</hi> was a <hi>nursing Mother to the Church of God,</hi> nor <hi>Mars a God of Reformation.</hi> Religion was then propagated, not by Christians shedding the blood of others, but by laying down their own. They thought there were other wayes to a <hi>Canaan</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi> besides the passing through a <hi>Wilderness</hi> of <hi>Confusion,</hi> and a <hi>red Sea</hi> of <hi>blood. Origen</hi> could say of the Christians in his time, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. They had not yet learnt to make way for Religion into mens mind, by the dint of the sword, because they were the Disciples of that Saviour who never <hi>pressed</hi> Followers as men do <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but said, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him take up his Cross</hi> (not his sword) <hi>and follow me.</hi> His was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his very commands shewed his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; his Laws were sweet and gentle Laws; not like <hi>Draco's</hi> that were writ in blood, unless it were his own that gave them.</p>
            <p>His design was to ease men of their former burdens, and not to lay on more; the duties be required were no other
<pb facs="tcp:100525:6"/>
but such as were necessary, and withall very just and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. He that came to take away the insupportable yoke of Iewish Ceremonies, certainly did never intend to gall the necks of his Disciples with another instead of it. And it would be strange, the Church should require more then Christ himself did; and make other conditions of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, then our Saviour did of Discipleship. What possible reason can be assigned or given, why such things should not be sufficient for Communion with a Church, which are sufficient for eternal salvation? And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly those things are sufficient for that, which are laid down as the necessary duties of Christianity by our Lord and Saviour in his Word. What ground can there be why Christians should not stand upon the same terms now which they did in the time of Christ and his Apostles? Was not Religion sufficiently guarded and fenced in them? Was there ever more true and cordial Reverence in the Worship of God? What <hi>Charter</hi> hath Christ given the Church to bind men up to, more then himself hath done? or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude those from her Society, who may be admitted into Heaven? Will Christ ever thank men at the great day for keeping such out from Communion with his Church, whom he will vouchsafe not onely Crowns of Glory to, but it <hi>may</hi> be <hi>aureolae</hi> too, if there be any such things there? The grand Commission the Apostles were sent out with, was onely to <hi>teach what Christ had commanded them.</hi> Not the least intimation of any Power given them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose or require any thing beyond what himself had spoken to them, or they were directed to by the immediate guidance of the Spirit of God. It is not, Whether the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and required be lawfull or no? It is not, Whether indifferencies may be determined or no? It is not, How far Christians are bound to submit to a restraint of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty? which I now inquire after, (of those things in
<pb facs="tcp:100525:6"/>
the Treatise its self); but, Whether they do consult for the Churches peace and unity who suspend it upon such things? How far either the example of our Saviour or his Apostles doth warrant such rigorous impositions? We never read the Apostles making Lawes but of things supposed necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When the Councel of Apostles met at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for deciding a Case that disturbed the Churches peace, we see <hi>they would lay no other burden</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>besides these necessary things,</hi> Acts 15. 29. It was not enough with them that the things would be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary when they had required them, but they looked on an <hi>antecedent</hi> necessity either absolute or for the present state, which was the onely ground of their imposing those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon the Gentile-Christians. There were after this great diversities of practice and varieties of Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations among Christians, but the Holy Ghost never thought those things fit to be made matters of Lawes to which all parties should conform; All that the Apostles required as to these, was mutuall forbearance and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension towards each other in them. The Apostles valued not <hi>indifferencies</hi> at all, and those things it is evident they accounted such, which whether men did them or not, was not of concernment to Salvation. And what reason is there why men should be so strictly tied up to such things, which they may do or let alone, and yet be very good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians still? Without all Controversie, the main in-let of all the Distractions, Confusions, and Divisions of the Christian World, hath been by adding other conditions of Church-Communion then Christ hath done. Had the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> never taken upon her to add to the Rule of Faith, nor imposed Idolatrous and superstitious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, all the injury she had done her self had been to have avoyded that fearful Schisme which she hath caused throughout the Christian World. Would there ever be the
<pb facs="tcp:100525:7"/>
less peace and unity in a Church, if a diversity were allowed as to practices supposed indifferent? yea there would be so much more as there was a mutual forbearance and condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension as to such things. The Unity of the Church is an Unity of love and affection, and not a bare uniformity of practice or opinion. This latter is extreamly desireable in a Church: but as long as there are several ranks and sizes of men in it, very hardly attainable, because of the different perswasions of mens minds as to the lawfulness of the things required; and it is no commendation for a Christian to have only the civility of <hi>Procrustes,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate all other men to the <hi>bed</hi> of his <hi>own humour and opinion.</hi> There is nothing the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> deserves greater imitation by us in, then in that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temper, moderation, and condescension which was used in it, towards all the members of it. It was never thought worth the while to make any standing Laws for Rites and Customs that had no other Original but Tradition, much less to suspend men her his communion for not observing them.<note place="margin">Hist. Eccl. l. 7. c. 19.</note>

               </gap>, as <hi>Sozomen</hi> tells us. <hi>They judged it, and that very justly, a foolish and frivolous thing, for those that agree in the weighty matters of Religion, to separate from one anothers communion for the sake of some petty Customs and Observations.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:100525:7"/>
               <hi>the Sabbath, and receiving the Eucharist after dinner.</hi> This admirable temper in the Primitive Church might be largely cleared from that liberty they allowed freely to dissenters from them in matters of practice and opinion: as might be cleared from <hi>Cyprian, Austine, Ierome</hi> and others; but that would exceed the bounds of a Preface. The first who brake this Order in the Church, were the <hi>Arrians, Donatists</hi> and <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> while the true Church was still known by his pristine Moderation and sweetness of deportment towards all its members. The same we hope may remain as the most infallible evidence of the conformity of our Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not so much <hi>in using</hi> the same <hi>rites</hi> that were in use then, as in <hi>not imposing them,</hi> but leaving men to be won by the observing the true decency and order of Churches, whereby those who act upon a true Principle of Christian ingenuity may be sooner drawn to a complyance in all lawfull things, then by force and rigorous impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which make men suspect the weight of the thing it self when such force is used to make it enter. In the mean time what cause have we to rejoyce, that Almighty God hath been pleased to restore us a <hi>Prince</hi> of that <hi>excellent Prudence</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> who hath so lately given assurance to the World, of his <hi>great indulgence towards all that have any pretence from Conscience to differ with their Brethren!</hi> The onely thing then seeming to retard our peace, is, the <hi>Controversie</hi> about <hi>Church-Government,</hi> an unhappy Controversie to us in <hi>England,</hi> if ever there were any in the World. And the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, in that our contentions about it have been so great, and yet so few of the multitudes engaged in it, that have truly understood the matter they have so eagerly contended about. For the state of the controversie, as it concerns us, lyes not here, as it is generally mistaken, <hi>What Form of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100525:8"/>
               <hi>Government comes the nearest to Apostolical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> but, <hi>Whether any one individual form be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so upon Divine Right, that all Ages and Churches are bound unalterably to observe it?</hi> The clearing up of which by an impartial inquiry into all the grounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for it, being of so great tendency to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our present differences, was the only motive which induced me to observe <hi>Aristotles</hi> wild <hi>Politicks,</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing this deformed conception to the entertainment of the wide World. And certainly they who have <hi>espoused</hi> the most the <hi>interest</hi> of a <hi>jus divinum,</hi> cannot yet but say, that if the opinion I maintain be true, it doth exceedingly conduce to a present settlement of the differences that are among us. For then all parties may retain their different opinions concerning the Primitive form, and yet agree and pitch upon a form compounded of all together as the most suitable to the state and condition of the Church of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: That so the peoples interest be secured by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and suffrage, which is the pretence of the congregational way, the due power of Presbyteries asserted by their joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concurrence with the Bishop, as is laid down in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent model of the <hi>late incomparable Primate of Armagh:</hi> and the just honour and dignity of the <hi>Bishop</hi> asserted, as a very laudable and ancient constitution for preserving the Peace and Unity of the Church of God. So the Learned <hi>Is.

<pb facs="tcp:100525:8"/>
the greatest correspondency to the Primitive Church, and be most advantagiously conduceable to the peace, unity and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of our divided Church. I plead not at all for any abuses or corruptions incident to the best form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through the corruption of men and times. Nay I dare not harbour so low apprehensions of persons enjoying so great dignity and honour in the Church, that they will in any wise be unwilling of themselves to reduce the Form of Church Government among us to its Primitive state and order, by retrenching all Exorbitances of Power, and restoring those Presbyteries which no law hath forbidden, but onely through disuse have been laid aside. Whereby they will give to the world that rare example of <hi>self-denial</hi> and <hi>the highest Christian prudence,</hi> as may raise an honourable opinion of them even among those, who have hitherto the most slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so ancient and venerable an Order in the Church of God, and thereby become the repairers of those, otherwise irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, breaches in the Church of God. I conclude with the words of a late <hi>learned, pious</hi> and <hi>moderate Prelate</hi> in his <hi>Via media; I have done, and now I make no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but that it will fall out with me, as it doth commonly with him that offers to part a fray; both parts will perhaps drive at me for wishing them no worse than peace. My ambition of the publike tranquillity shall willingly carry me through this hazzard: let both beat me, so their quarrel may cease: I shall rejoyce in those blows and scars which I shall take for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es safety.</hi>

                  </gap>erning the manner of the thing whose substance is determined by the Law of nature, must be obeyed by vertue of the obligation of the natural Law. 4. Things, undetermined both by the natural and positive laws of God, may be lawfully determin'd by the supream authority in the Church of God. The Magistrates power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, largely asserted and cleared. The nature of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in actions stated. Matters of Christian liberty are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to restraints, largely proved. Proposals for accommodation as to matters of Indifferency. 5. What is thus determined by lawful authority, doth bind the Consciences of men subject to that authority; to obedience to those determinations. 6. Things thus determined by lawful authority, are not thereby made unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, but may be revoked, limited, and changed by the same authority. <hi>p. 27</hi>

               <item>HOW far Church Government is founded upon the Law of nature. Two things in it founded thereon. 1. That there must be a Society of men for the Worship of God. 2. That this Society be governed in the most convenient manner. A Society for Worship manifested. <hi>Gen, 4. 26.</hi> considered. The Sons of God and the sons of men who? Societies for worship among Heathens evidenced by three things, 1. Solemnity of Sacrifices; sacrificing how far natural.

                  </gap>crecy and solemnity of their mysteries. This further proved from mans sociable nature, the improvement of it by Religion, the honour redounding to God by such a Society for his Worship. <hi>p. 72</hi>

               <item>THE second thing the Law of Nature dictates, that this Society be maintained and governed in the most convenient manner. A further inquiry, what particular Orders for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church come from the Law of Nature. Six laid down, and evidenced to be from thence. First, a distinction of some persons, and their superiority over others, both in power and order, cleared to be from the Law of Nature. The power and application of the power distinguished; this latter not from any Law of Nature binding, but permissive: therefore may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained. Peoples right of chosing Pastors considered. Order distinguished from the form and manner of Government: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Natural, the other not. The second is, that the persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Service of God, should have respect answerable to their imployment, which appears from their Relation to God as his Servants; from the persons imployed in this work before positive Laws. Masters of Families the first Priests. The Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the first-born before the Law discussed: The Arguments for it answered.

And we have nothing but general Rules which are appliable to several Forms of Government. The Office of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> What it proves in order to this question; the lawfulness of Episcopacy shewed thence, but not the necessity. A particular form how far necessary, as Christ was Governour of his Church; the Similitudes the Church is set out by, prove not the thing in question. Nor the difference between civil and Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor Christ setting Officers in his Church, nor the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the Churches power in appointing new Officers.

The opinions of <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Aerins</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. The name of Presbyters and Bishops explained. Three general considerations touching Apostolical practice. 1. That we cannot attain to such a certainty of Apostolical practice, as thereon to ground a divine right. The uncertainty of Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal practice as to us fully discovered, 1. From the equivalency of the names which should determine the controversie. 2. In that the places in controversie may without incongruity be understood of the different forms. 3. From the defectiveness, ambiguity, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and repugnancy of the Records of Antiquity, which should inform us what the Apostolical practice was. These fully discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon. The testimonies of <hi>Eusebius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, Ierom,</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> discussed; and these two last proved not to contradict each other. Episcopacy owned as a humane Instituiion by the sense of the Church. 2. Consideration. That in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the Apostles did not observe any one fixed course of settling Church Government; but settled it according to the several cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of time, places, and persons. Several things premised for clearing it. This Opinion, though seemingly New, is proved at large to be most consonant to antiquity, by the several Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Clemens Rom. Alexandrinus, Epiphanius</hi> (whose Testimony is corrected, explained, and vindicated) <hi>Hilary</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others.

               <item>THE Churches Polity in the ages after the Apostles consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Evidences thence that no certain unalterable Form of Church-Government was delivered to them. 1. Because Church Power did inlarge as the Churches did. Whether any Metropolitan Churches established by the Apostles. Seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> whether Metropolitical; Philippi no Metropolis either in Civil or Ecclesiastical sense. Several degrees of inlargement of Churches. Churches first the Christians in whole Cities, proved by several arguments; the Eulogiae an evidence of it. Churches extended into the neighbour territories by the preaching there of City Presbyters; thence comes the subordination between them. Churches by degrees inlarged to Diocesses; from thence to Provinces. The Original of Metropolitans and Patriarches. 2. No certain Form used in all Churches. Some Churches without Bishops, Scots, Goths. Some with but one Bishop in their whole Countrey Scythian, Aethiopian Churches how governed. Many Cities without Bishops. Diocesses much altered. Bishops discontinued in several Churches for many years. 3. Conforming Ecclesiastical Government to the civil in the extent of Diocesses. The suburbicarian Churches what. Bishops answerable to the civil Governours. Churches power rises from the greatness of Cities. 4. Validity of Ordination by Presbyters in places where Bishops were.

The former can never be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any thing which is a matter of Controversie among men, who have not wholly forgot they are Reasonable Creatures, by their bringing probable arguments for the maintaining one part of an opinion as well as another. In which case, though the Arguments brought be not convincing for the necessary enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining either part to an unbiassed understanding, yet the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their Opinions is Argument sufficient, that the thing contended for is not so clear as both parties would make it to be on their own side; and if it be not a thing of necessity to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it gives men ground to think, that a final decision of the matter in controversie, was never intended as a necessary means for the Peace and Unity of the Church of God. For we cannot with any shew of reason imagine, that our Supreme Law giver and Saviour, who hath made it a necessary duty in all true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church, to endeavour after the Peace and Unity of it, should suspend the performance of that duty upon a matter of Opinion, which when men have used their utmost endeavors to satisfie themselves about, they yet find, that those very grounds which they are most inclinable to build their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon, are either wholly rejected by others, as wise and able as themselves; or else, it may be, they erect a far different Fabrick upon the very same foundations. It is no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Wisdom of Christ in founding his Church, and providing for the Peace and Settlement of it, to leave it at the mercy of mens private judgments, and apprehensions of things, than which nothing more uncertain, and thereby make it to depend upon a condition never like to be attained in this world, which is the agreement and Uniformity of mens Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100525:16"/>
For as long as mens faces differ, their judgements will. And until there be an <hi>Intellectus Averroisticus,</hi> the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in all persons, we have little ground to hope for such an Universal Harmony in the Intellectual World; and yet even then the Soul might pass a different judgement upon the colours of things, according to the different tincture of the several Optick-Glasses in particular bodies, which it takes a prospect of things through. Reason and Experience then give us little hopes of any peace in the Church, if the unity of mens judgements be supposed the condition of it: the next inquiry then is, how the Peace of the Church shall be attained or preserved, when men are under such different perswasions; especially if they respect the means, in order to a Peace and Settlement. For the ways to Peace, like the fertile soils of <hi>Greece,</hi> have been oft-times the occasion of the greatest quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels. And no sickness is so dangerous as that when men are sick of their remedy, and nauseate that most which tends to their recovery. But while Physitians quarrel about the Method of Cure, the Patient languisheth under their hands; and when men increase Contentions in the behalf of Peace, while they seem to Court it, they destroy it. The only way left for the Churches Settlement and Peace under such variety of apprehensions concerning the Means and Method, in order to it, is to pitch upon such a foundation, if possible to be found out, whereon the different Parties retaining their private ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, may yet be agreed to carry on the same work in common, in order to the Peace and Tranquillity of the Church of God. Which cannot be by leaving all absolutely to follow their own ways; for that were to build a <hi>Babel</hi> instead of <hi>Salem, Confusion</hi> instead of <hi>Peace;</hi> it must be then by convincing men, that neither of those ways to peace and order, which they contend about, is necessary by way of Divine Command, (though some be as a means to an end) but which particular way or form it must be, is wholly left to the prudence of those in whose Power and Trust it is to see the Peace of the Church be secured on lasting Foundations. How neerly this concerns the present Debate about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, any one may quickly discern. The main Plea for Forms of Government in the Church, is their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100525:17"/>
necessity, in order to its Peace and Order, and yet nothing hath produced more disorder and confusion then our Disputes about it have done. And our sad experience still tells us, that, after all our Debates, and the Evidences brought on either side, men yet continue under very different apprehensions concerning it. But if we more strictly enquire into the causes of the great Distances and Animosities which have risen upon this Controversie, we shall find it hath not been so much the difference of Judgements concerning the Primitive Form of Government, which hath divided men so much from one another, as the prevalency of Faction and Interest in those whose Revenues have come from the Rents of the Church, and among others of greater Integrity it hath been the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Hypothesis which men are apt to take for granted, without proving it; <hi>viz.</hi> that it is in no case lawful to vary from that Form, which by obscure and uncertain conjectures, they conceive to have been the Primitive Practice. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men look upon themselves as obliged by an unalterable Law, to endeavour the Establishment of that Idea of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which oft-times Affection and Interest, more then Reason and Judgement, hath formed within them; and so likewise bound to over throw any other Form not suitable to those Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencies which they are already engaged to maintain. If this then were the Cause of the Wounds and Breaches this day among us, the most successful Weapon-salve to heal them, will be, to anoint the Sword which hath given the Wound, by a seasonable inquiry into the Nature and Obligation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Forms of Government in the Church. The main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject then of our present Debate will be, Whether any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Form of Church Government be setled upon an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Divine Right; by virtue whereof all Churches are bound perpetually to observe that Individual Form? or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be left to the Prudence of every particular Church to agree upon that Form of Government which it judgeth most conducible within its self to attain the end of Government, the Peace, Order, Tranquillity, and Settlement of the Church. If this latter be made fully appear, it is then evident that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mens judgements may differ concerning the Primitive Form of Government, there is yet a sure ground for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100525:17"/>
men to proceed on in order to the Churches Peace. Which one Consideration will be motive sufficient to justifie an attempt of this Nature, it being a Design of so great Importance, as the recovery of an advantagious piece of ground, whereon Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parties may with safety not only treat, but agree in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a speedy Accommodation.</p>
                  <p>We come therefore closely to the business in hand, and, for<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> the better clearing of our passage, we shall first discuss the Nature of a Divine Right, and shew whereon an unalterable Divine Right must be founded, and then proceed to shew how far any Form of Government in the Church is setled upon such a Right.

The opening of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note place="margin">Etymol. l. 5. cap. 3.</note> of these two, and the different influences they have upon persons and things, is very useful to our present purpose: <hi>Ius</hi> then is first that which is <hi>justum;</hi> so <hi>Isidore, Ius dictum quia justum est.</hi> So what ever is just, men have right to do it:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100525:18"/>
Now a thing may be said to be just either more generally, as it signifies any thing which is lawful, or in a more restrained sense, when it implies something that is equal and due to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So <hi>Aristotle</hi> distributes <gap reason="foreign">

In order to this we are to observe, that an express Positive Command is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make a thing lawful, but a non-prohibition by a Law is sufficient for that. For it being the Nature of Laws to bound up mens Rights, what is not forbidden by the Law is thereby supposed to be left in mens power still to do it. So that it is to little purpose for men to seek for Positive Commands for every particular action to make it lawful; it sufficeth to make any action lawful, if there be no Bar made by any direct or consequential prohibition; unless it be in such things whose lawfulness and goodness depend upon a meer Positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. For in those things which are therefore only good, because commanded, a Command is necessary to make them lawful, as in immediate positive acts of Worship towards God; in which nothing is lawful any further then it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Divine Command. I speak not of Circumstances belonging to the Acts of Worship, but whatever is looked upon as a part of Divine Worship, if it be not commanded by God himself, it is no ways acceptable to him, and therefore not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.<note place="margin">Mat. 15 9.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cy and Order in the Church of God, or in any other civil action of the lives of men, it is enough to make things lawful, if they are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. But against this, that a Non-prohibition is warrant enough to make any thing lawful, this Objection will be soon leavied, that it is an Argument <hi>ab authoritate negativè,</hi> and therefore is of no force: To which I answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Rule, if taken without limitation, upon which this Objection is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not true; for although an Argument <hi>ab authoritate nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> as to matter of Fact avails not, yet the Negative, from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as to matter of Law and Command, is of great force and strength. I grant the Argument holds not here; we do not read that ever Christ or his Apostles did such a thing, therefore it is not to be done; but this, we read of no Law or Precept commanding us to do it, therefore it is not unlawful not to do it; and we read of no Prohibition forbidding us to do it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be lawfully done; this holds true and good, and that upon this two-fold Reason. First, From Gods Intention in making known his Will; which was not to record every particular fact done by himself, or Christ, or his Apostles, but it was to lay down those general and standing Laws, whereby his Church in all Ages should be guided and ruled: And in order to a perpetual obligation upon the Consciences, there must be a sufficient promulgation of those Laws which must bind men. Thus in the case of Infant-Baptism, it is a very weak unconcluding Argument to say that Infants must not be baptized, because we never read that Christ or his Apostles did it; for this is a Negative in matter of Fact; but on the other side, it is an Evidence that Infants are not to be excluded from Baptism, because there is no Divine Law which doth prohibit their admission into the Church by it; for this is the Negative of a Law; and if it had been Christs intention to have excluded any from admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Church, who were admitted before as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants were, there must have been some positive Law whereby such an Intention of Christ should have been expressed; For nothing can make that unlawful which was a duty before, but a direct and express Prohibition from the Legislator himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100525:19"/>
who alone hath power to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cind as well as to make Laws. And therefore Antipaedobaptists must, instead of requiring a Positive Command for baptizing Infants, themselves produce an express Prohibition excluding them, or there can be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Reason given, why the Gospel should exclude any from those priviledges, which the Law admitted them to. Secondly, I argue from the intention and end of Laws, which is to circumscribe and restrain the Natural Liberty of man, by binding him to the observation of some particular Precepts. And therefore where there is not a particular Command and Prohibition, it is in Nature and Reason supposed that men are left to their Natural freedom; as is plain in Positive Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws; wherein men by compact and agreement for their mutual good in Societies, were willing to restrain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from those things which should prejudice the good of the Community; this being the ground of mens first inclosing their Rights and common Priviledges, it must be supposed, that what is not so inclosed, is left common to all as their just Right and Priviledge still. So it is in Divine Positive Laws, God intending to bring some of Mankind to happiness, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his own appointing, hath laid down many Positive Precepts, binding men to the practise of those things as duties which are commanded by him. But where we find no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for performance, we cannot look upon that as an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate duty, because of the necessary relation between Duty and Law; and so where we find no Prohibition, there we can have no ground to think that men are debarred from the liberty of doing things not forbidden. For as we say of Exceptions, as to General Laws and Rules, that an Exception expressed <hi>firmat regulam in non exceptis,</hi> makes the Rule stronger in things not expressed as excepted; so it is as to Divine Prohibitions; as to the Positives, that those Prohibitions we read in Scripture make other things not-prohibited to be therefore lawful, because not expresly forbidden. As Gods forbidding <hi>Adam</hi> to taste of the fruit of one Tree, did give him a liberty to taste of all the rest. Indeed, had not God at all revealed his Will and Laws to us by his Word, there might have been some Plea why men should have waited for particular Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to dictate the goodness or evil of particular actions, not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100525:19"/>
determined by the law of nature; but since God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his will, there can be no reason given why those things should not be lawful to do, which God hath not thought fit to forbid men the doing of. Further we are to observe, that in these things which are thus undetermined in reference to an obligation to duty, but left to our natural liberty as things lawful, the contrary to that which is thus lawful, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made unlawful. But both parts are left in mens power to do, or not to do them; as is evident in all those things which carry a general equity with them, and are therefore consonant to the Law of Nature, but have no particular obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as not flowing immediately from any dictate of the natural Law. Thus community of goods is lawful by the law and principles of nature; yet every man hath a lawful right to his goods by dominion and propriety. And in a state of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it was the right of every man to impropriate upon a just equality, supposing a preceding compact and mutual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whence it is that some of the School-men say, that although the Law of Nature be immutable, as to its precepts and prohibitions, yet not as to its demonstrations (as they call them;) as, <hi>Do as you would be done to,</hi> binds always indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably; but, <hi>that in a state of nature all things are common to all,</hi> This is true, but it binds not men to the necessary observance<note place="margin">

These which they call Demonstrations are only such things as are agreeable to nature, but not particularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by any indispensable precept of it. Thus likewise it is agreeable to nature, that the next of the kindred should be heir to him who dies intestate; but he may lawfully wave his interest if he please. Now to apply this to our present case; According to this sense of <hi>jus</hi> for that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, those things may be said to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> which are not determined one way or other by any positive Law of God, but are left wholly, as things lawful, to the prudence of men to determine them, in a way agreeable to natural light, and the general Rules of the Word of God. In which sense I assert any particular form of Government agreed on by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, consonant to the general Rules of Scripture, to be by Divine Right, <hi>i. e.</hi> God by his own Laws hath given men a power and liberty to determine the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100525:20"/>
form of Church-Government among them. And hence it may appear, that though one form of Government be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word, it doth not follow that another is not; or, because one is lawful, another is unlawful: but one form may be more agreeable to some parts, places, people and times, then others are. In which case that form of Government is to be setled which is most agreeable to the present state of a place, and is most advantagiously conducible to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ends of Church-Government in that place or Nation. I conclude then according to this sense of <hi>jus,</hi> that the <hi>Ratio regiminis Ecclesiastici</hi> is <hi>juris divini naturalis,</hi> that is, that the reason of Church-Government is immutable, and holds in all times and places, which is the preservation of the peace and unity of the Church; but the <hi>modus regiminis Ecclesiastici,</hi> the particular form of that Government is <hi>juris divini permissivi,</hi> that both the Laws of God and Nature have left it to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of particular Churches to determine it. This may be cleared by a parallel Instance. The reason and the Science of Physick is immutable, but the particular prescriptions of that Science are much varied, according to the different tempers of Patients. And the very same reason in Physick which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes one sort of Physick to one, doth prescribe a different sort to another, because the temper or disease of the one calls for a different method of cure; yet the ground and end of both prescriptions was the very same, to recover the Patient from his distemper. So I say in our present case; the ground and reason of Government in the Church is unalterable <hi>by divine right;</hi> yea, and that very reason which determines the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar forms: but yet, these particular forms flowing from that immutable reason, may be very different in themselves, and may alter according to the several circumstances of times, and places, and persons, for the more commodious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the main end of Government. As in morality there can be but one thing to a man <hi>in genere summi boni,</hi> as the chief good, <hi>quò tendit &amp; in quod dirigit aroum</hi>—to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all other things; yet there may be many things <hi>in genere boni conducentis,</hi> as means in order to attaining that end. So though Church-Government vary not as to the ground, end, and reason of it; yet it may, as to the particular forms of it:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100525:20"/>
As is further evident, as to forms of Civil Government: though the end of all be the same; yet Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, are in themselves lawful means for the attaining the same common end. And as <hi>Alensis</hi> determines it, in the case of Community of goods by the Law of Nature, that the same reason of the Law of Nature which did dictate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of goods to be most suitable to man in the state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, did in his faln estate prescribe a propriety of goods, as most agreeable to it; so that herein the <hi>modus observanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> dissered, but the <hi>ratio praecepti</hi> was the same still; which was mans comfortable enjoyment of the Accommodations of life: which in Innocency might have been best done by Community; but in mans degenerate condition, must be by a Propriety. So the same reason of Church-Government may call for an Equality in the persons, acting as Governours of the Church in one place, which may call for Superiority and subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in another.</p>
                  <p>Having now dispatched the first sense of a Divine Right,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> I come to the other, which is the main seat of the Controversie, and therefore will require a longer debate. And so <hi>jus</hi> is that which makes a thing to become a duty: so <hi>jus quasi jussum,</hi> and <hi>jussa jura,</hi> as <hi>Festus</hi> explains it, <hi>i. e.</hi> that whereby a thing is not only <hi>licitum,</hi> in mens lawful power to do it or no, but is made <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bitum,</hi> and is constituted a duty by the force and virtue of a Divine Command. Now mans obligation to any thing as a duty, doth suppose on the part of him from whose authority he derives his obligation, both <hi>legislation</hi> and <hi>promulgation.</hi> First there must be a <hi>Legislative Power</hi> commanding it; which if it respects only the outward actions of a man in a Nation imbodied by Laws, is the supreme Magistrate; but if the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation respect the consciences of all men directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, then none have the power to settle any thing by way of an universal standing Law, but God himself: Who by being sole Creator and Governour of the World, hath alone absolute and independent Dominion and Authority over the souls of men. But besides Legislation, another thing necessary to mans obligation to duty, is, a <hi>sufficient promulgation</hi> of the Law made; Because though before this there be the ground of obedience on mans part to all Gods Commands, yet there
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100525:21"/>
must be a particular Declaration of the Laws, whereby man is bound in order to the determination of Mans duty. Which in Positives is so absolutely necessary, that unless there be a sufficient promulgation and declaration of the will of the Law-giver, mans ignorance is excusable in reference to them; and so frees from guilt and the obligation to punishment. But it is otherwise in reference to the dictates of the natural Law, wherein though man be at a loss for them, yet his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted pravity being the cause of his blindness, leaves him without excuse. Hence it is said with good reason, that though man under the Moral Law, was bound to obey Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-precepts, as to the reason and substance of the duties by them commanded, as Faith, Repentance from dead works, and New Obedience; yet a more full and particular revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Gospel was necessary, for the particular determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the general acts of obedience, to particular objects under their several Modifications expressed in the Gospel. And therefore Faith and Repentance under the Moral Law, taken as a transcript of the Law of Nature, were required under their general notion as acts of obedience, but not in that particular relation which those acts have under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. Which particular determination of the general acts to special objects under different respects, some call New Precepts of the Gospel, others New Light; but taking that light as it hath an influence upon the consciences of men, the difference is so small, that it deserves not to be named a Controversie.</p>
                  <p>But that which I am now clearing is this, that whatsoever binds Christians as an universal standing Law, must be clearly revealed as such, and laid down in Scripture in such evident terms, as all who have their senses exercised therein, may discern it to have been the will of Christ, that it should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually oblige all believers to the Worlds end, as is clear in the case of Baptism, and the Lords Supper. But here I shall add one thing by way of caution; That there is not the same necessity for a particular and clear revelation in the <hi>alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of a <hi>Law unrepealed</hi> in some circumstances of it, as there is for the establishing of a <hi>New Law.</hi> As to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the change of a standing Law as to some particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100525:21"/>
a different practice by persons guided by an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible spirit is sufficient; which is the case as to the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords day under the Gospel: For the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand standing in force as to the Morality of it, a different practice by the Apostles may be sufficient for the particular determination of the more ritual and occasional part of it, which was the limitation of the observation of it to that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day. So likewise that other Law standing in force, that persons taken into Covenant with God should be admitted by some visible sign, Apostolical practice, clearly manifested, may be sufficient ground to conclude what the mind of Christ was, as to the application of it to particular persons; and what qualifications are requisite in such as are capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as in the case of Infants. Whereby it is clear why there is no particular Law or command in reference to them under the Gospel, because it was only the application of a Law in force already to particular persons, which might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered sufficiently from the Apostles practice, the Analogy of the dispensation, the equal reason of exclusion under the Law, and yet notwithstanding the continual admission of them then into the same Gospel-Govenant; Circumcision being<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 8.</note> the Seal of the Righteousness of Faith. But this by the way, to prevent mistakes. We must now by parity of reason say, that either the former Law, in those things wherein it was not typical, must hold in reference to the form of. Government in the Church of Christ; or else that Christ by an universal Law hath setled all order in Church Government among the Pastors themselves; or else that he hath left it to the prudence of every particular Church, to determine its own form of Government, which I conceive is the direct state of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion about Divine Right, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the particular form of Government in the Church be setled by an universal bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law or no?</p>
                  <p>But for a further clearing the state of the Question, we<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> must consider what it is that makes an unalterable Divine Right, or a standing Law in the Church of God: for those who found forms of Government upon a Divine Right, do not plead a Law in express terms, but such things from whence a Divine Right by Law may be inferred. Which I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100525:22"/>
now come to examine; and that which I lay down as a <hi>Postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum,</hi> or a certain conclusion according to which I shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssertions concerning Divine Right, is, That nothing is founded upon a Divine Right, nor can bind Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians directly or consequentially as a positive Law, but what may be certainly known to have come from God, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to oblige Believers to the worlds end. For either we must say, it binds Christians as a Law when God did not intend it should; or else Gods intentions to bind all Believers by it, must be clearly manifested. Now then, so many ways and no more as a thing may be known to come from God with an intention to oblige all perpetually, a thing may be said to be of an unalterable Divine Right; and those can be no more then these two; Either by the Law of Nature, or by some positive Law of God: Nothing else can bind universally and perpetually but one of these two, or by virtue of them, as shall be made appear. I begin with the Law of Nature. The Law of Nature binds indispensably, as it depends not upon any arbitrary constitutions, but is founded upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal nature of good and evil in the things themselves, antecedently to any positive Declaration of Gods Will. So that till the nature of good and evil be changed, that Law is unalterable as to its obligation. When, I say, the Law of Nature is indispensable, my meaning is, that in those things which immediately flow from that Law by way of precept, as the three first Commands of the Moral Law, no man can by any positive Law be exempted from his obligation to do them; neither by any abrogation of the Laws themselves, nor by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from them, nor interpretation of them, nor change in the object, matter, or circumstance, whatsoever it be. Now although the <hi>formal reason</hi> of mans obedience to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of this Law, be the conformity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded have to the Divine Nature and goodness, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>the efficient cause</hi> of mans <hi>obligation</hi> to these things, is to be fetched from the Will, Command, and Pleasure of God: Not as it is taken for an arbitrary positive will, but as it is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive of Divine purposes, and as it ingraves such a Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of men. For notwithstanding mans Reason, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in it self, be the chiefest instrument of discovery what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100525:22"/>

For the sanction of this Law of Nature, as well as others, depends upon the Will of God, and therefore the obligation must come from him, it being in the power of no other to punish for the breach of a Law, but those who had the Legislative Power to cause the obligation to it. It appears then from hence, that whatever by just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence can be deduced from the preceptive Law of Nature, is of Divine Right, because from the very nature of that Law (it being indispensable) it appears that God had an intent to oblige all persons in the world by it.</p>
                  <p>The second way whereby we may know what is of Divine<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Right, is by Gods positive Laws; for God being the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour of the World, hath the Legislative Power in his hands, to bind to the performance of what duties be please, which carry no repugnancy in them to his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Goodness.

This was that which the Jews stumbled at so much, and do to this day; because they are assured their Law came once from God, therefore it must of necessity have a perpetual obligation: as may be seen in their two great Doctors <hi>Maimonides</hi> and <hi>Abarbinel,</hi> who both of<note place="margin">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100525:23"/>
commanded; others commanded, and therefore good. In which latter, if the reason of the Command ceaseth, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand its self obligeth no longer. As the Ceremonial Law was to be their <gap reason="foreign">

This being then the office of the Law, when the Church was now entred into Christs School, the office of this Paedagogue then ceased. And so the Ceremonial Law needed no abrogation at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exspiring of its self at Christs coming, as Laws made for the times of war do when peace comes. Only because the Jews were so hardly perswaded that it should exspire (the believing Jews conceiving at first the Gospel came rather to help them to obey the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> then to cancel the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of it) therefore it was necessary that a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable burial should be given to it, and the Apostles should <hi>pro rostris</hi> declare more fully that believers were freed from that yoke of Ceremonies, under which the neck of their fore-fathers had groaned so long.

                     </gap>ay down these following. First, when the same reason of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand continues still, then we cannot conceive how that which was instituted upon such an account as remains still, should not have the same force now which it had at first. That po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Law under which <hi>Adam</hi> was in his state of Innocency touching the forbidden fruit, did not bind any longer then his fall; because the reason of the Command ceased, which was the tryal of mans obedience: For which, God made choice of a very facile and easie Command, according to that rule of Politicians <hi>In minimis obedientiae periculum faciunt Legislato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> of which they give this rational account, <hi>Quia legislato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100525:24"/>
                     <hi>ad obedientiam obligantis potius habenda est ratio, quàm rei de quâ lex est lata:</hi> thence arose that Law of the <hi>Ephori</hi> at Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, <hi>barbam tondere,</hi> to which no other reason was annexed but this, <hi>obtemperare legibus,</hi> to learn them to obey the Laws. This was Gods aim in that easie Command given to <hi>Adam,</hi> to make thereon an experiment of mans willingness to obey his Maker, and wherein man soon lost that <hi>Obsequii gloria,</hi> as he in <hi>Tacttus</hi> calls it, which, as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, is <hi>in to major quod quis minus velit.</hi> But had this Law been a standing Law for all mankind, it would have continued its obligation still; but since, we see that it was only a personal, temporary, probative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; for no sooner was man fallen but its obligation ceased. So likewise those precepts of the Judicial Law which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately respected the Commonwealth of the Jews as such, their obligation reacheth not to Christians at all, nor (as it is generally conceived) to the Jews themselves, when out of the Consines of their own Countrey, because the reason of those Laws doth neither descend to Christians, nor did travel abroad with the Jews. But those judicial Laws which are founded upon common equity to bind still, not by virtue of that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> but by virtue of common principles of equity, which certainly in the present shortness of humane reason cannot be fetched from a clearer Fountain then those Laws which once came from the Fountain of Goodness: none of whose consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions can any ways be supposed to deviate from the exactest rules of Justice and Equity. And upon this very ground too, some part of the fourth Commandment is abrogated, and the other continues to bind still; For the reason of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and occasional part is ceased, and the reason of what was Moral, continues. Therefore the School-men say right of the Sabbath day, <hi>Cultus est à naturâ, modus à lege, virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> à Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ.</hi> Nature dictates that God should be worshipped, the Law informs what day and time to spend in his worship, Grace must enable us to perform that worship on that day in a right manner. And because the same reason for Gods Worship continue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> still, therefore it is a Precept of the Natural Law, that God should be worshipped. What time precisely must be spent in Gods Worship (as one day in seven) though the reason be evident to nature of it when it is made known; yet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100525:24"/>
it is hard to conceive that Nature could have found out the precise determination of the time. Although I must confess the general consent of Nations, as to the seventh part, (if it were fully cleared) would speak fair to be the voice of Nature, or at least a tradition received from the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> which, if so, will be an evidence of the observation of the Sabbath before the Children of <hi>Israels</hi> being in the Wilderness. But granting that the seventh part of time was a positive Law of God, yet I say it binds immutably, because there is as strong a reason for it now as ever, and <hi>Ratio immutabilis praecepti, facit praeceptum immutabile.</hi> This I take to be the sense of those who distinguish between <hi>morale positivum,</hi> and <hi>morale natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale, i. e.</hi> that some things are so moral, that even Nature its self can discover them, as that God should be worshipped. Other things are so moral, that though the reason of them be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Nature, yet there wants Divine Revelation to discover them to us; but when once discovered, are discerned to be very agreeable to common principles of reason: And these when thus discovered, are as immutably obligatory as the other, because the reason of them is immutable. And of this nature, is the determination of the particular time for Gods worship, and limitation of it to one day in seven. But what was in that Precept meerly occasional, as the first and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ground of its limitation to the seventh in order, <hi>Gods resting on that day from the work of Creation,</hi> and the further<note place="margin">Gen. 22. Deut. 5. 15</note> ground of its inforcement to the Jews, viz. <hi>their deliverance out of Egypt;</hi> these being not immut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble, but temporary and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional, may upon as great ground given, and approved of God for that end (as is evident by the Apostles practice) be sufficient reason of the alteration of the seventh day to the first day of the week. By this may briefly be seen how irrationally those speak, who say we have no further ground for our observation of the Lords day now, then for other arbitrary Festivals in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tradition of the Church of God. I grant, the Tradition of the Church doth acquaint us with Apostolical practice, but the ground of our observation of the Lords day, is not the Churches Tradition, but that Apostolical practice conveyed by Universal Tradition (which setting aside the Festivals observed upon the Lords days, can very hardly be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound for any other.) But supposing Universal Tradition
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100525:25"/>
for other Festivals; I say, here Tradition is not only used as a testimony and instrument of conveyance, as in the other case of the Lords day; but is it self the only argument, and the very ground of the original observation: Between which two, what a wide difference there is, let any rational man judge. But for a further clearing this observation, we must consider, that the reason of the Command, which we say is the measure of its obligation, must not be fetched from mens uncertain conjectures (among whom dreams often pass for reasons) but it must be either expressed in the Law its self, or deducible by apparent and easie collection from it; as is plain in the Decrees of the Apostles about <hi>things strangled,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act 15. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>and offered to Idols,</hi> where the reason of the Command is plainly implied, to wit, for present compliance with the Jews; and therefore no sooner did the reason of the Command cease, but the obligation of it ceased too: but of this more afterwards. This is one way then to discern the difference between positive Laws, as to the obligation of them, by the ground and reason of the Command. And therefore it is well observed by Divines (which further confirms what I now prove) that no Command doth bind against the reason of the Command; because it is not the words, but the sense and reason of a Command which hath the greatest obligatory force. Therefore <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, that the <hi>ratio juris &amp; legislatoris con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Another way to know when Positive Laws are<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> immutable, is, when Gods Will is expresly declared that such Laws shall bind immutably. For it being granted on all hands, that God may bind us to those things which are left indifferent by the Law of Nature, and likewise for what term he please; the only inquiry left, is to see in his Word whether he hath so bound us or no; and, if he hath, whether he hath left it in mans power to revoke his Laws. For as to Positive Laws expresly laid down in Scripture, the ground of which is only as the Jews speak <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the will of the King, i. e.</hi> Gods own pleasure, without any reason or occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it else expressed, or necessarily implied; these do bind immutably, unless the same Power which commanded them,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100525:25"/>
doth again revoke them. For we cannot in any wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the wise God should after the declaring his own will, leave it in the power of any corrupt fallible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Being to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, or dispence with the obligation of his own Laws. Which to do, and instead of them to enforce others imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Consciences of men, as standing Laws, is an attempt beyond that of the Gyants against heaven (or the men at <hi>Babel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>) that being only an affectation of reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heaven, but this an actual usurpation of Gods supreme and legislative power and authority. But though man hath nor, God alwayes reserves to himself a power to relax, interpret, and dispence with his own positive Laws, which imply no repugnancy to his own nature. And this power is alwayes to be understood in all Laws to be reserved to God, where he hath not himself declared that he will not use it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is done either by the annexing an Oath on a Promise, which the Apostle calls the <hi>two immutable things in which it is impossible</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>for God to lie.</hi> For though God be free to promise, yet when he hath promised, his own nature and faithfulness binds him to performance; in which sense I understand those who say, God in making promises is bound only to himself, and not to men; that is, that the ground of performance ariseth from Gods faithfulness. For else if we respect the right coming by the promise, that must immediately respect the person to whom it is made, and in respect of which we commonly say that the promiser is bound to performance. But the case is otherwise in penal Laws, which though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> never so strict; do imply a power of <hi>relaxation</hi> in the Legislator: because pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Laws do only constitute the <hi>debstum poenae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and bind the sinner over to punishment, but do not bind the Legislator to an actual execution upon the debt. Which is the ground that the person of a Mediator was admittable in the place of faln man, because it was a penal Law, and therefore relaxable. But because the debt of punishment is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately contracted upon the breach of the Law, therefore satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was necessary to God as Law-giver, either by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son himself, or another for him; because it was not consistent with the holiness of Gods nature and his wisdom as Governor, to relax an established Law, without valuable consideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100525:26"/>
Now for the third kind of Gods Laws, besides promissory and penall, <hi>viz</hi> such as are meerly positive respecting duties, which become such by vertue of an express command: these, though they be revocable in themselves, yet being revocable only by God himself, and his own power, since he hath already in his Word fully revealed his Will, unlesse therein he hath declared when their obligation shall cease, they continue irreversible. This is the case as to the Sacraments of the New Testament, which being commands meerly positive, yet Christ command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christians as Christians to observe them, and not as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of the first and second Ages of the Church, his mind can be no otherwise interpreted concerning them, then that he did intend immutably to bind all Christians to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of them. For al though the <hi>Socinians</hi> say, that Baptism<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Catech. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cov. cap.</hi> 4.</note> was only a Rite instituted by Christ for the passing men from Judaism and Gentilism to Christianity, yet we are not bound to look upon all as reason that comes from those who professe themselves the admirers of it. For Christs Command no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where implying such a limitation; and an outward visible profession of Christianity being a duty now, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant entred into by that Rite of initiation, as obligatory as ever, we have no reason to think that Christs command doth not reach us now, especially the promise being made to as many as God shall call, and consequently the same duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired<note place="margin">Acts 3. 38.</note> which was then in order to the obtaining of the same ends. A third way to discern the immutability of positive Laws, is, when the things commanded in particular are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the being, succession, and continuance of such a Society of men professing the Gospel, as is instituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Christ himself. For Christ must be supposed to have the power himself to order what Society he please, and appoint what Orders he please to be observed by them; what Rites and Ceremonies to be used in admission of Members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church, in their continuing in it; in the way, means, manner of ejection out of it; in the preserving the succession of his Church, and the administration of Ordinances of his appointment. These being thus necessary for the maintaining and upholding this Society, they are thereby of a nature as unalterable, as the duty of observing what Christ hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100525:26"/>
is. How much these things concern the resolution of the Question proposed, will appear afterwards. Thus we have gained a resolution of the second thing, whereon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Divine Right is founded; <hi>viz,</hi> either upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the Law of Nature, concurring with the rules of the written word; or upon express positive Laws of God, whose reason is immutable, or which God hath declared shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, as necessary to the being of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The next thing is to examine the other pretences which are<note place="margin">§ 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note> brought for a Divine Right; which are either <hi>Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> or <hi>Divine acts,</hi> or <hi>Divine approbation.</hi> For <hi>Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examples:</hi> First; I take it for granted on all hands, that all Scripture examples do not bind us to follow them; such are the Mediatory acts of Christ, the Heroical acts of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary persons, all accidentall and occasionall actions. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doth not bind us as an example; for then all examples are to be followed, and so we shall of necessity go, <hi>quà itur, non quà eundum,</hi> walk by the most examples, and not by rule. There is then no obligatory force in example it self. Secondly, there must be then some rule fixed to know when examples bind, and when not; for otherwise there can be no discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation put between examples which we are to follow, and which to avoid. This rule must be either immediately <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> making it a duty to follow such examples, or else <hi>directive,</hi> declaring what examples are to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ollowed: And yet even this latter doth imply, as well as the former, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these examples thus declared, is become a duty. There can be no duty without a Law making it to be a duty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, it is the Law making it to be a duty to follow such example, which gives a Divine Right to those examples, and not barely the examples themselves. We are bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christs example, not barely because he did such and such things, (for many things he did we are not bound to follow him in) but because he himself hath by a command made it our duty to follow him in his humility, patience, self-denyal,<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 21. 1 John 2. 6. 1 Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in whatever things are set out in Scripture for our imitation. When men speak then with so much confidence, that Scripture-examples do bind us unalterably, they either mean that the example it self makes it a duty, which I have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100525:27"/>
shewn already to be absurd; or else that the morall nature of the action done in that example, or else the Law making it our duty to follow the example, though in its self it be of no morall nature. If the <hi>former</hi> of these two, then it is the morality of the action binds us, without its being <hi>incarnate</hi> in the example: For the example in actions not morall, binds not at all, and therefore the example binds only by vertue of the morality of it; and consequently, it is the morality of the action which binds, and not the example. If the <hi>latter,</hi> the rule making it our duty, then it it is more apparent that it is not the example which binds necessarily, but that rule which makes it a duty to follow it; for examples in indifferent things do not bind without a Law making it to be a duty: And so it evidently appears, that all obligatory force is taken off from the examples themselves, and resolved into one of the two former, the morall nature of the action, or a positive Law. And therefore those who plead the obligatory nature of Scripture-examples, must either produce the morall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of these examples, or else a rule binding us to follow those examples. Especially, when these examples are brought to found a New positive Law, obliging all Christians necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to the end of the world. Concerning the binding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Apostolicall practice, I shall discourse largely after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The next thing pleaded for a Divine Right, is by <hi>Divine Acts.</hi> As to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t is again evident that all Divine Acts do not constitute such a Right; therefore there must be something expressed in those Acts when such a Divine Right follows them; whence we may infallibly gather, it was Gods intention they should perpetually oblige: as is plain in the cases instanced in the most for this purpose; as Gods resting on the seventh day making the Sabbath perpetual: For it<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 2.</note> was not Gods resting that made it the Sabbath, for that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed as the occasion of its institution; but it was Gods sanctifying the day, that is, by a Law setting it apart for his own service, which made it a duty. And so Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was not it which made the Lords day a Sabbath of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right; but Christs resurrection was the occasion of the Apostles altering only a circumstantiall part of a morall duty already; which being done upon so great reasons, and by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100525:27"/>
persons indued with an insallible spirit, thereby it becomes our duty to observe that morall command in this limitation of time. But here it is further necessary to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween acts meerly <hi>positive,</hi> and acts <hi>donative</hi> or <hi>legall.</hi> The former con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er no right at all, but the latter do; not barely as acts, but as legall acts, that is, by some declaration that those acts do conserr right. And so it is in all donations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Law the bare delivery of a thing to another doth not give a legall title to it, without express transferring of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and propriety with it. Thus in Christs delivering the Keys to <hi>Peter</hi> and therest of the Apostles, by that act I grant<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 19. 18. 18.</note> the Apostles had the power of the Keyes by Divine Right; but then it was not any bare act of Christ which did it, but it was only the declaration of Christs will conferring that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon them. Again, we must distinguish between a <hi>right</hi> confer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'d by a <hi>donative act,</hi> and the <hi>unalterable nature</hi> of that Right; for it is plain there may be a Right <hi>personall</hi> as well as <hi>successive, derivative,</hi> and <hi>perpetuall.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not enough to prove that a Right was given by any act of Christ, unless it be made appear it was Christs intention that Right should be perpetuall if it oblige still. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <hi>extent of the Apostolical Commission the power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles,</hi> as well as <hi>the power of the Keyes</hi> (whether by it we mean a power declarative of duty, or a power authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and penall) must continue still, if a difference be not made between these two; and some rule sound out to know when the Right conferr'd by Divine Acts is personall, when successive. Which rule thus found out, must make the Right unalterable, and so concerning us, and not the bare donative act of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it is evident, they were all equally conferr'd upon the Apostles by an act of Christ: and if some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still, and others do not, then the bare act of Christ doth not make an unalterable Divine Right. And so though it be proved that the Apostles had superiority of order and jurisdiction over the Pastors of the Church by an act of Christ; yet it must further be proved, that it was Christs intention that superiority should continue in their successors, or it makes nothing to the purpose. But this argument I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I see not how those who make a necessary Divine Right
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100525:28"/>
to follow upon the acts of Christ, can possibly avoid the force of. The last thing pleaded for Divine Right, is <hi>Divine approbation;</hi> but this least of all constitutes a Divine Right: For if the actions be extraordinary, Gods approbation of them as such, cannot make them an ordinary duty. In all other actions which are good, and therefore only commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they must be so, either because done in conformity to Gods revealed Will, or to the nature of things good in themselves. In the one, it is the positive Law of God, in the other the Law of Nature, which made the action good, and so approved by God, and on that account we are bound to do it. For God will certainly approve of nothing but what is done according to his Will revealed, or natural; which Will and Law of his, is that which makes any thing to be of Divine Right, <hi>i. e.</hi> perpetually binding, as to the observation of it. But for acts of meerly positive nature, which we read Gods approbation of in Scripture, by vertue of which approbation those actions do oblige us; in this case, I say, it is not Gods meer approbation that makes the obligation, but as that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, so recorded in Scripture, is a sufficient testimony and declaration of Gods intention to oblige men: And so it comes to be a positive Law, which is nothing else but a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient declaration of the Legislators will and intention, to bind in particular actions and cases. Thus now we have cleared whereon a necessary and unalterable Divine Right must be founded; either upon the Law of Nature, or some positive Law of God, sufficiently declared to be perpetually binding.</p>

Whatever positive Law is then made directly infringing and violating natural principles, is thereby of no force at all. And that which hath no obligation in it self, cannot dissolve a former obligation. Secondly, the indispensablenesse of the obligation of the Law of Nature, appears from the end of all other Laws, which are agreed upon by mutual compact, which is, the better to preserve men in their rights and priviledges. Now the greatest rights of men, are such as flow from Nature its self, and therefore, as no Law binds against the reason of it, so neither can it against the common end of Laws. Therefore, if a humane positive Law should be made, that God should not be worshipped, it cannot bind, being against the main end of Laws, which is to make men live together as reasonable creature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Again, it overturns the very foundation of all Government, and dissolves the tye to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, if the Law of Nature doth not bind indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: for otherwise, upon what ground must men yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to any Laws that are made? Is it not by vertue of this Law of Nature, that men must stand to all compacts and agreements made? If Laws take their force among men from hence, they can bind no further then those comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Positive Laws may restrain much of what is only of the permissive Law of Nature (for the intent of positive Laws, was to make men abate so much of their naturall freedom, as should be judged necessary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of humane Societies) but against the obligatory Law of Nature, as to its precepts, no after-Law can derogate from the obligation of it.

though God be omnipotent, yet it follows not that he can therefore dissolve the obligation of the preceptive Law of nature, or change the natures of good and evil.

to bind indispensably, but these latter are subject to positive Laws. For our better understanding the obligation of these (which is more intricate then the former) we shall consider men under a double notion, either in a state of absolute liberty, which some call a state of Nature; or else in a state wherein they have restrained their own liberty by mutual compacts, or are determined by a higher Law. These things premised, I lay down these Propositions.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>In a state of absolute liberty, before any positive Laws were superadded to the naturall, Whatsoever was not necessarily determined by the obligatory Law of Nature, was wholly left to mens power to do it or not, and belongs to the permissive Law of Nature.</hi> And thus all those things which are since determined by positive Laws, were in such a supposed state, left to the free choyce of a mans own will. Thus it was in mens power to joyn in civil Society with whom they pleased, to recover things, or vindicate injuries in what way they judged best, to submit to what constitutions alone they would themselves, to choose what form of Government among them they pleased, to determine how far they would be bound to any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity chosen by themselves, to lodge the legislative and coercive Power in what persons they thought fit, to agree upon punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments answerable to the nature of offences. And so in all other things not repugnant to the common light of reason, and the dictates of the preceptive part of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>A state of absolute liberty, not agreeing to the nature of man considered in relation to others; it was in mens power to restrain their own liberty upon compacts so far as should be judged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the ends of their mutuall Society.</hi> A state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I look upon only as an imaginary state, for better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the nature and obligation of Laws. For it is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the greatest Assertors of it, that the relation of Parents and Children cannot be conceived in a state of natural liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Hobs <hi>de civ. cap.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </note> because Children assoon as born are actually under the power and authority of their Parents. But for our clearer apprehending the matter in hand, we shall proceed with it. Supposing then all those former rights were in their own power, it is most agreeable to natural reason, that every man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100525:31"/>
may part with his right so far as he please for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Here now, men finding a necessity to part with some of their Rights, to defend and secure their most considerable Ones, they begin to think of Compacts one with another (taking this as a Principle of the Natural Law, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Society, That all Covenants are to be performed:) When they are thus far agreed, they then consider the terms upon which they should enter into Society one with another. And here men devest themselves of their original liberty, and agree upon an Inclosure of Properties, and the Fences of those Properties; I mean, upon living together in a civil state, and of the Laws they must be ruled by. This is apparently agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Natural Reason, the things being in their own power, which they agree to part with.</p>

                     </gap> who do legally protect them. But the further prosecution of these things belongs to another place to consider of; my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose being to treat of Government in the Church, and not in the State. The sum of this is, that the Obligation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what things are determined (which are of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive Law of Nature) by Positive Laws, doth arise from the Obligatory Law of Nature. As the Demonstration of the particular Problemes in the Mathematicks, doth depend upon the Principles of the Theoremes themselves; and so whoever denies the truth of the Probleme, deduced by just Consequence from the Theoreme, must consequentially deny the truth of the Theoreme its self: So those who violate the particular Determinations of the Permissive Law of Nature, do violate the Obligation of the Preceptive part of that Law: Obedience to the other being grounded on the Principles of this.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>God hath Power by his Positive Laws to take in and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine as much of the Permissive Law of Nature as he please, which being once so determined by an Universal Law, is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawful to be done, that the doing of them by those under an Obligation to his Positive Laws, is an offence against the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Law of Nature.</hi> That God may restrain mans Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Liberty, I suppose none who own Gods Legislative Power
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100525:32"/>
over the world can deny: especially considering that men have power to restrain themselves; much more then hath God, who is the Rector and Governor of the World. That a breach of his positive Laws is an offence against the common Law of Nature, appears hence; because man being Gods creature, is not only bound to do what is in general sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the principles of reason in flying evil, and choosing good; but to submit to the determinations of Gods will, as to the distinction of good from evil. For being bound univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally to obey God, it is implyed that man should obey him in all things which he discovers to be his will: whose determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must make a thing not only good, but necessary to be done, by vertue of his supreme authority over men. This then needs no further proof, being so clear in its self.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Lastly, What things are left undetermined by divine posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws, are in the Churches power to use, and practise according as it judgeth them most agreeable to the rule of the Word.</hi> That things undetermin'd by the Word are still lawfull, evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: because what was once lawfull, must have some posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law to make it unlawfull, which if there be none, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains lawfull still. And that the Church of God should be debarr'd of any priviledge of any other Societies, I understand not; especially if it belong to it as a Society considered in its self, and not as a particular Society constituted upon such accounts as the Church is. For I doubt not but to make it evident afterwards, that many parts of Government in the Church belong not to it as such in a restrained sense, but in the general notion of it, as a Society of men imbodyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by some Laws proper to its self; Although it subsist upon a higher foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> of divine institution, and upon higher grounds, reasons, principles, ends; and be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by other Laws immediately then any other Societies in the World are.<note place="margin">§. 4.</note>

                  <p>The third Hypothesis is this; <hi>Where the Law of Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the thing, and the Divine Law determines the manner and circumstances of the thing, there we are bound to obey the divine Law in its particular determinations, by vertue of the Law of Nature in its general obligation.</hi> As for instance, the Law of Nature bindeth man to worship God; but for the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100525:33"/>
way, manner, and circumstances of Worship, we are to follow the positive Laws of God: because as we are bound by Nature to worship him, so we are bound by vertue of the same Law to worship him in the manner best pleasing to himself. For the light of Nature, though it determine the duty of worship, yet it doth not the way and manner, and though acts of pure obedience be in themselves acceptable unto God, yet as to the manner of those acts, and the positives of worship, they are no further acceptable unto God then commanded by him. Because in things not necessarily determined by the Law of Nature, the goodnesse or evill of them lying in reference to Gods acceptance, it must depend upon his Command, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing positive Laws to be at all given by God to direct men in their worship of him. For supposing God had not at all revealed himself in order to his worship; doubtlesse it had been lawfull for men not only to pray to God, &amp; express their sense of their dependance upon him; but to appoint waies, times and places for the doing it, as they should judge most convenient &amp; agreeable to natural light. Which is evident from the Scripture its self as to places: for as far as we can find, sacrificing in high places,<note place="margin">Judg. 6. 18 1 Sam. 7. 1, 4. 16. 9. 10. 3. 2 Sam. 15. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Indeed after the place was setled by Gods own Law, it became wholly sinfull: but if so before, we should not have read of Gods accepting sacrifices in such places as he did <hi>Gedeons,</hi> nor of the Prophets do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>David</hi> did. It is a disputable case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Sacrifices, Whether the offering of them came only from natural light, or from some express command: the latter seems far more probable to me, because I cannot see how naturall light should any wise dictate that God would accept of the blood of other creatures as a token of mans obedience to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.<note place="margin">Exerci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hings of which the substance depends on a natural Law, men are as well bound to the observation of them after their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as the other before. The one being a Testimony of their obedience to God as clear and full as the other; yes, and so much the clearer evidence of obedience, in that there could be no argument for the performing of those things but a divine Command. And even in doing things intrinsecally good, the ground of purely religious obedience is, because God commands men to do those things more then that they are good in themselves: Doing a thing because most suitable to nature, speaking morality; but doing because God commands it, speaks true Religion and the obedience of Faith. For as the formal reason of the act of Faith is a divine Testimony discovered to our understandings, so the formal principle
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100525:34"/>
of an act of spiritual obedience is a divine Command inclining the will, and awing it to performance. So far then as divine Law determines things, we are bound to observe them from the dictates of the natural Law.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Hypothesis: <hi>In things which are determined both</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>by the Law of Nature, and divine positive Laws, as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and morality of them, but not determined as to all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances belonging to them; it is in the power of Lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church of God to determine them, so far as they judge them tend to the promoting the performance of them in due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> So that not only matters wholly left at liberty as to the substance of them are subject to humane Laws and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but even things commanded in the divine Law, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the manner of performance, if undetermined by the same Law, which enforce the duty. Thus the setting apart some time for Gods Worship, is a dictate of the natural Law: that the first day of the week be that time, is determin'd under the Gospel; but in what places, at what hours, in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, decency and solemnity this Worship shall be then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, are circumstances not determined in Scripture, but only by general Rules; as to these then so they be done in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to those Rules, they are subject to humane positive determinations. But this is not an <hi>hypothesis</hi> in the Age we live in to be taken for granted without proving it: some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Magistrate any power at all in matters of Religion; others granting a defensive, protective power of that Religion which is professed according to the Laws of Christ, but denying any determining power in the Magistrate concerning things left undetermin'd by the Scripture. This <hi>Hypothesis</hi> then hath landed me into a Field of Controversie, wherein I shall not so much strive to make my way through any opposite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as endeavour to beget a right understanding between the adverse parties, in order to a mutual compliance; which I shall the rather do, because if any Controversie hath been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaser and fomenter of heart-burnings and divisions among us, it hath been about the determination of indifferent things. And, which seems strange, the things men can least bear with one another in, are matters of <hi>liberty:</hi> and those things men have divided most upon, have been matters of <hi>uniformity,</hi> and wherein they have differed most, have been pretended
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100525:34"/>
things of <hi>Indifferency.</hi> In order then to laying a foundation for peace and union. I shall calmly debate what power the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate hath in matters of Religion, and how far that power doth extend in determining things left undetermin'd by the Word. For the clear understanding the first of these, we shall make our passage open to it by the laying down several necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry distinctions about it, the want of considering which hath been the ground of the great confusion in the handling this Controversie. First then, we must distinguish between a power <hi>respecting Religion in its self,</hi> and a power <hi>concerning Religion as it is the publick owned and professed Religion of a Nation.</hi> For although the Magistrate hath no proper power over Religion in its self, either taking it <hi>abstractly</hi> for the Rule of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or <hi>concretely</hi> for the internal acts of Worship; for he can neither add to that Rule nor dissolve the obligation of it; nor yet can he force the consciences of men, (the chief seat of Religion) it being both contrary to the nature of Religion its self, which is a matter of the greatest freedom and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty, and it being quite out of the reach of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates Laws, which respect only external actions as their proper object; for the obligation of any Law can extend no further then the jurisdiction and authority of the Legislator, which among men is only to the outward actions. But then, if we consider Religion as it is publikely owned and professed by a Nation, the supreme Magistrate is bound by vertue of his office and authority, not only to defend and protect it, but to restrain men from acting any thing publikely tending to the subversion of it, So that the plea for liberty of conscience, as it tends to restrain the Magistrates power, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> both irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and impertinent; because liberty of conscience is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mens judgements, which the Magistrate cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of. For men may hold what opinions they will in their minds, the Law takes no cognizance of them: but it is the liberty of practice and venting and broaching those opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which the Magistrates power extends to the restraint of. And he that hath the care of the publike good, may give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to, and restrain liberty from men, as they act in order to the promoting of that good; And as a liberty of all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions tends manifestly to the subverting a Nations peace, and to the embroyling it into continual confusions, a Magistrate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100525:35"/>
discharge his office unlesse he hath power to restrain such a liberty. Therefore we find plainly in Scripture that God imputes the increase and impunity of Idolatry as well as other vices to the want of a lawful Magistracy, <hi>Iudges</hi> 17. 5, 6. where the account given of <hi>Micahs</hi> Idolatry was, because there was no King in Israel; which implies it to be the care and duty of Magistrates to punish and restrain whatever tends to the opposing and subverting the true Religion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I cannot find any reason pleaded against the Magistrates power now, which would not have held under <hi>David, Solomon, Asa, Iehosophat, Hezekias, Iosias,</hi> or other Kings of the Jews, who asserted the publike profession, to the extirpation to what opposed it. For the plea of Conscience (taken for mens judgements going contrary to what is publikely owned as Religion) it is indifferently calculated for all Meridians, and will serve for a Religion of any elevation. Nay, stiff and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious Infidels or Idolaters may plead as highly (though not so truly) as any, that it goes against their judgements or their conscience to own that Religion which is established by authority. If it be lawfull then to restrain such notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this pretence, why not others, whose doctrine and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the Magistrate judgeth to tend in their degree (though not so highly) to the dishonouring God, and subverting the profession entertained in a Nation? For, a mans own cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and confidence that he is in the right, can have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Magistrate judging otherwise; only if it be true, it wil afford him the greater comfort and patience under his restraint; which was the case of the primitive Christians under persecutions: The Magistrate then is bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, protect, and maintain the Religion he owns as true, and that by vertue of his office, as he is <hi>Custos utriusque tabulae;</hi> The maintainer of the honour of Gods Laws, which cannot be if he suffer those of the first Table to be broken without any notice taken of them. Were it not for this power of Magistrates under the Gospel, how could that promise be ever made good, that <hi>Kings shall be nursing Fathers to the Church of God?</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 23.</note> they mean such Nursing Fathers as <hi>Astyages</hi> was to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or <hi>Amulius</hi> to <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> who exposed their nurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to the Fury of wild Beasts to be devoured by them. For so must a Magistrate do the Church, unlesse he secure it from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100525:35"/>
the incursion of Hereticks, and the inundation of Seducers. But so much for that which is more largely asserted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by others. The Magistrate then hath power concerning Religion, as owned in a Nation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We must distinguish between an <hi>external</hi> and <hi>objective</hi> power, about matters of Religion; and an <hi>internal formal</hi> power, which some call an Imperative and Elicitive power, others a power of Order, and a power of Jurisdiction, others <hi>potestas Ecclesiastica,</hi> and <hi>potestas circa Ecclesiastica,</hi> or, in the old distinction of <hi>Constantine,</hi>

                        <hi>Euseb. vit: Constant. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note> a power of things within and without the Church; the sense of all is the same, though the terms differ. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, formal, Elicitive power of Order, concerning things in the Church, lies in authoritative exercise of the Ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Function, in preaching the Word, and administration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; but the external, objective, Imperative power of Jurisdiction, concerning the matters of the Church, lies in a due care and provision, for the defence, protection, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Religion. The former is only proper to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, the latter to the Supreme Magistracy: For, though the Magistrate hath so much power about Religion, yet he is not to usurp the Ministerial Function, nor to do any proper acts belonging to it. To which the instance of <hi>Uzzias</hi> is perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently applied. But then this takes nothing off from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates power; for it belongs not to the Magistrate <hi>impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta facere,</hi> but <hi>imperare facienda,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> truly observes,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>, are conversant several wayes about the same thing; but the Functions of both of them must be distinguished: For the Pastors of the Church are not to administer Justice, but it is their duty to declare how Justice should be rightly administred, without partiality, or oppression. So, on the other side, the Magistrate must not preach the Gospel, nor administer Sacraments; but however, must take care that these be duly done by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hose to whose
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100525:36"/>
Function it belongs: But for a clearer making it appear, these things are to be considered; both in a Magistrate, and Minister of the Gospel. In a Magistrate, the <hi>Power it self,</hi> and the <hi>Person bearing that Power:</hi> The power it self of the Magistrate is no ways subordinate to the Power of the Ministry: Indeed, if we consider both Powers, in reference to their objects, and ends, there may be an <hi>inferiority of Dignity,</hi> as <hi>Chamier</hi> calls<note place="margin">

But still the person of the Magistrate, though he is not subject to the power of the Ministers, yet both as a Christian, and as a Magistrate, he is subject to the Word of God, and is to be guided by that in the Administration of his Function. So on the other side, in a Minister of the Gospel, there are these things considerable; the Object of his Function, the Function its self, the Liberty of exercising it, and the Person who doth exercise it. As for the <hi>Object of this Function,</hi> the Word and Sacraments, these are not subject to the Civil Power, being setled by a Law of Christ; but then for the <hi>Function its self,</hi> that may be considered, either in the <hi>Derivation</hi> of it, or in the <hi>Administration</hi> of it. As for the derivation of the power and authority of the Function, that is from Christ, who hath setled and provided by Law, that there shall be such a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Function to the end of the world, with such authority belonging to it: But for the Administration of the Function, two things belong to the Magistrate: <hi>First,</hi> to provide and take care for <hi>due administration</hi> of it; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

power, though a right to exercise it be derived from the same power from which the Authority belonging to the Function was conveyed. And then lastly, as to <hi>the persons exercising</hi> this Function, it is evident, As they are members of a Civil Society as well as others, so they are subject to the same Civil Laws as others are.

And upon these grounds, I suppose, <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Erastus</hi> may, as to this, shake hands; So that the Magistrate do not usurp the Ministerial Function,<note place="margin">De Episcop.

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we distinguish between an <hi>absolute Architectoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§ 7.</note> and <hi>Nomothetical Power,</hi> independent upon any other Law, and a <hi>Legislative Power, absolute</hi> as to <hi>persons,</hi> but <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi> by a <hi>Higher Law.</hi> The former we attribute to none but God; the latter belongs to a Supreme Magistrate, in reference to things belonging to his power, either in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. By an Architectonical, Nomothetical Power, we mean that power which is distinguished from that which is properly call'd Political. The former lies in the making Laws<note place="margin">

Ethic. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> for the good of the Commonwealth; the latter in a due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and administration of those Laws for the Common Good. This we have asserted to the Magistrate already: We now come to assert the other; where we shall first set down the bounds of this power, and then see to whom it belongs. <hi>First,</hi> then we say not, that the Magistrate hath a power to revoke, rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al, or alter any Divine positive Law; which we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100525:37"/>
have already shewn. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we say not, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate by his own will may constitute what new Laws he please for the Worship of God. This was the fault of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> who made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, and therefore by the Rule of Reason must be supposed to sin more himself: So likewise <hi>Ahab, Ahaz,</hi> and others. Religion is a thing setled by a Divine Law; and as it is taken for the Doctrine and Worship of God, so it is contained in the Word of God, and must be fetched wholly from thence. But then <hi>thirdly,</hi> The Magistrate by his power, may make that which is a Divine Law already, become the Law of the Land. Thus Religion may be incorporated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our Laws, and the Bible become our <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> So the first Law in the <hi>Codex Theod.</hi> is about the believing the Trinity, and many others about Religion are inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Now as to these things clearly revealed in the Word of God, and withall commanded by the Civil Magistrate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>primary obligation</hi> to the doing them, is from the former determination by a Divine Law; yet the Sanction of them by the Civil Magistrate, may cause a <hi>further obligation</hi> upon Conscience then was before, and may add punishments and rewards not expressed before. For although when two Laws are contrary the one to the other, the obligation to the Higher Law takes away the obligation to the other; yet when they are of the same Nature, or subordinate one to the other, there may a New Obligation arise from the same Law, enacted by a New Authority. As the Commands of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue brought a New Obligation upon the Consciences of the Jews, though the things contained in them, were commanded before in the Law of Nature: And as a Vow made by a man, adds a new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ye to his Conscience, when the matter of his Vow is the same with what the Word of God commands; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing our Covenant with God after Baptism, renews our Obligation: So when the Faith of the Gospel becomes the Law of a Nation, men are bound by a double Cord of duty to entertain and profess that Faith. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in matters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by the Word, concerning the External Polity of the Church of God, the Magistrate hath the power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining things, so they be agreeable to the Word of God. This last Clause is that which binds the Magistrates power, that it is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100525:37"/>
not absolutely Architectonicall, because all his Laws must be regulated by the generall rules of the Divine Law- But though it be not as to Laws, yet I say it is as to persons; that is, that no other persons have any power to make Laws, binding men to obedience, but only the civil Magistrate. This is another part of the Controversie between the Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Power, about the power of determining matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Churches Government: But there is here no such breach between those two, but what may be made up with a distinction or two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We distinguish then between a <hi>power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative,</hi> of the obligation of former Laws; and a <hi>power autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative,</hi> determining a New Obligation; between the <hi>office</hi> of <hi>counselling</hi> and <hi>advising</hi> what is <hi>fit to be done,</hi> and a power <hi>determining what shall be done;</hi> between the Magistrates <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>consulting,</hi> in order to the doing it, and his <hi>deriving</hi> his <hi>authority</hi> for the doing it. These things premised, I say: <hi>First,</hi> that the power of declaring the obligation of former Laws, and of consulting and advising the Magistrate for setling of New Laws, for the Policy of the Church, belongs to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Governours of the Church of God. This belongs to them, as <hi>they are commanded to teach what Christ hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>them;</hi> but no authority thereby given to make new Laws to bind the Church; but rather a tying them up to the commands of Christ already laid down in his Word. For a power to bind mens consciences to their determinations; lodged in the Officers of the Church, must be derived either from a Law of God giving them this right, or else only from the consent of parties. For any Law of God, there is none<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> produced with any probability of reason, but that, <hi>Obey those that are over you in the Lord.</hi> But that implies no more then submitting to the Doctrine and Discipline of the Gospel, and to those whom Christ hath constituted as Pastors of his Church, wherein the Law of Christ doth require obedience to them, that is, in looking upon them, and owning them in their relation to them as Pastors. But that gives them no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make any new Laws or Constitutions, binding mens consciences any more then a Command from the Supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that inferiour Magistrates should be obeyed, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any power in them to make new Laws to bind them. But
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100525:38"/>
thus far I acknowledge a binding power in Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, though they neither bind by virtue of the matter, nor of the authority commanding (there being no legislative power lodged in the Church) yet in respect of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and the end, they should be obey'd, unlesse I judge the thing unlawfull that is commanded, rather then manifest open contempt of the Pastors of the Church, or being a scandall<note place="margin">

But as to the other power, arising from mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual compact and consent of Parties, I acknowledge a power to bind all included under that compact, not by vertue of any Supream binding power in them, but from the free consent of the parties submitting; which is most agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Church-power, being not coactive but directive; and such was the confederate discipline of the primitive Church, before they had any Christian Magistrate: And thence the decrees of Councils were call'd <hi>Canons,</hi> and not Laws. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Though it be the Magistrates duty to consult with the Pastors of the Church, to know what is most agreeable to the Word of God, for the settlement of the Church; yet the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate doth not derive his authority in commanding things from their sentence, decree, and judgement; but doth by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his own power cause the obligation of men to what is so determin'd, by his own enacting what shall be done in the Church. The great use of Synods, and Assemblies of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of Churches, is to be as the Council of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, in matters belonging to the Church, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is for matters of civil concernment. And as the King, for the settling civil Laws, doth take advice of such persons who are most versed in matters of Law; so by proportion of reason, in matters concerning the Church, they are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Council, who have been the most versed in matters imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately belonging to the Church: In the management of which affairs, as much, if not more prudence, experience, judgement, moderation, is requisite, as in the greatest affairs of State. For we have found by dolefull experience, that if a fire once catch the Church, and <hi>Aarons</hi> Bells ring backward, what a Combustion the whole State is suddenly put into, and how hardly the Churches Instruments for quenching such fires, <hi>lachrymae &amp; preces Ecclesiae,</hi> do attain their end. The

                        </gap>urare debet ut omnes officium faciant.</hi> (But for the judgement of the reformed Divines about this, see <hi>Vedelius de Episcopatis Constant. M— &amp; Officium Magistratus Christiani, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to Grotius de Imper. &amp;c.</hi>) I therefore proceed to lay down the reason of it. <hi>First,</hi> That whereby we are bound either to obedience, or penalty upon disobedience, is the ground of the obligation; but it is upon the account of the Magistrates power that we are either bound to obedience, or to submit to penalties upon disobedience. For it is upon the account of our general obligation to the Magistrate, that we are bound to obey any particular Laws or Constitutions: Because it is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100525:39"/>
not the particular determinations made by the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, which do immediately bind Conscience, but the general Law of Scripture requires it as a duty from us, to obey the Magistrate in all things lawfull. Obedience to the Magistrate is due immediately from Conscience; but obedience to the Laws of the Magistrate comes not directly from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science but by vertue of the general obligation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore disobedience to the Magistrates Laws is an immediate sin against Conscience, because it is against the general obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but obedience to particular Laws ariseth not immediately from the obligation of Conscience to them in particular, but to the Magistrate in general. So that in things left lawfull and undetermin'd by the Word, where there ariseth no obligation from the matter, it must arise from our subjection and relation to the Magistrate; and what is the ground of obedience, is the cause of the obligation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath only the power of obligations who hath the power of making Sanctions to those Laws. By Sanctions, I mean here, in the sense of the civil Law, <hi>eas legum partes, quibus poenas constituimus adversus eos qui contra leges fecerint;</hi> those parts of the Law which determine the punishments of the violaters of it. Now it is evident that he only hath power to oblige who hath power<note place="margin">

                           </gap>ic. l.</hi> 3. <hi>ep.</hi> 23.</note> to punish upon disobedience. And it is as evident, that none hath power to punish but the civill Magistrate; I speak of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall penalties which are annexed to such Laws as concern the Church. Now there being no coercive or coactive power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church as such, all the force of such Laws as respect the outward Polity of the Church, must be derived from the civill Magistrate. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He who can null and declare all other obligations void, done without his power, hath the only power to oblige. For whatsoever destroys a former obligation, must of necessity imply a power to oblige, because I am bound to obey him in the abstaining from that I was formerly obliged to: But this power belongs to the Magistrate. For suppose, in some indifferent Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the Church representative, that is, the Governors of it <hi>pro tempore,</hi> do prescribe them to be observed by all, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rbids the doing of those things, if this doth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100525:39"/>
not null the former supposed obligation, I must inevitably run upon these absurdities. First, that there are two supreme powers in a Nation at the same time. Secondly, that a man may lie under two different Obligations as to the same thing; he is bound to do it by one power, and not to do it by the other. Thirdly, the same action may be a duty and a sin; a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in obeying the one power, a sin in disobeying the other. Therefore there can be but one power to oblige, which is that of the Supreme Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far asserted the Magistrates due power and<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> Authority, as to matters of Religion; we proceed to examine the extent of this power, in determining things left at liberty by the Word of God, in order to the Peace and Government of the Church. For our clear and distinct proceeding, I shall ascend by these three steps: First, to shew that there are some things left undetermined by the Word. Secondly, that these things are capable of positive Determinations and Restraint. Thirdly, that there are some bounds and limits to be observed in the stating and determining these things. <hi>First,</hi> That there are some things left undetermined by the Word: By Determining here, I do not mean determining whether things be <hi>lawful</hi> or no; for so there is no Rit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or Ceremony whatsoever, but is determined by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in that sense, or may be gathered from the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of particular actions, to the general Rules of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: but by Determining, I mean, whether all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Churches Polity and Order be determined as <hi>Duties</hi> or no: <hi>viz.</hi> that this we are bound to observe, and the other not. As for instance, what time, manner, method, gesture, habit, be used in preaching the Word; whether Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism must be by dipping or sprinkling; at what day, time, place, the Child shall be baptized, and other things of a like Nature with these. Those who assert any of these as duties, must produce necessarily the Command making them to be so: For Duty and Command have a necessary respect and relation to one another. If no Command be brought, it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that they are left at liberty. So as to the Lords Supper <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, whether the Communicants take the Bread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100525:40"/>
or receive it being given them; whether they should<note place="margin">

But that Honourable person clearly runs upon a double mistake. First, that Indifferency is a <hi>medium participationis</hi> of both extremes, and not only <hi>negationis,</hi> viz. that, as intermediate colours partake both of black and white, and yet are neither; so in morality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and bad, there is an intermediate entity, which is neither, but indifferent to either: Whereas the Nature of Indifferency lies not in any thing intermediate between good and bad, but in some thing undetermined by Divine Laws, as to the necessity of it; so that if we speak as to the extremes of it, it is something lying between a necessary duty, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal evil. The other mistake, is, that throughout that Discourse he takes Indifferency as Circumstantiated in Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual actions, and as the morality of the action is determined by its Circumstances; whereas the proper notion of Indifferency lies in the Nature of the action, considered in its self abstractly; and so these things are implyed in an indifferent action. First, absolute undetermination; as to the general nature of the act by a Divine Law, that God hath left it free for men to do it or no. Secondly, that one part hath not more propension to the Rule then the other; for if the doing of it comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the rule then the omission; or on the contrary, this action is not wholly indifferent. Thirdly, that neither part hath any repugnancy to the Rule; for that which hath so, is so
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100525:40"/>
far from being indifferent, that it becomes unlawful: So that an indifferent action is therein like the Iron accosted by two Loadstones on either side of equal virtue, and so hovers <hi>in medio,</hi> inclining to neither; but, supposing any degree of virtue added to the one above the other, it then inclines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it: or as the Magnetical <hi>Needle</hi> about the <hi>Azores,</hi> keeps its self directly parallel to the <hi>Axis</hi> of the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out variation, because it is supposed then to be at an equal distance from the two Great Magnets, the Continents of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and <hi>America:</hi> But no sooner is it removed from thence, but it hath its variations. So indifferency, taken <hi>in specie,</hi> as to the Nature of the act, inclines neither way; but supposing it lye under Positive Determinations, either by Laws or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, it then necessarily inclines either to the Nature of Good or E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>il.</p>
                  <p>Neither yet are we come to a full understanding of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of indifferent actions; we must therefore distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween indifferency, as to goodness, <hi>necessitating</hi> an action <hi>to be done;</hi> and as to goodness, <hi>necessary</hi> to an action <hi>to make it good:</hi> For there is one kind of goodness <hi>propter quam fit actio,</hi> in order to which the action must necessarily be done; and there is another kind of goodness <hi>sine quâ non benè fit actio,</hi> necessary to make an action good when it is done. As following after peace hath such a goodness in it, as necessitates the action, and makes it a necessary duty: but handling a particular Controversie is such an action, as a man may let alone without sin in his course of studies; yet when he doth it, there is a goodness necessary to make his doing it a good action, <hi>viz.</hi> his referring his study of it to a right end, for the obtaining of truth and peace. This latter goodness is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either <hi>bonitas directionis,</hi> as some call it, which is, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the action to its true end; in reference to which, the great Controversie among the Schoolmen, is about the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of particular actions, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a particular dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a mans intention to the ultimate end, be not so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to particular actions, as that, without that, the action is of necessity evil, and with it good; or whether without that an<note place="margin">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100525:41"/>
                     <hi>Durandus;</hi> but we assert the necessity of at least an habitual direction, to make the action <hi>in individuo</hi> good, and yet the act in its self may notwithstanding be indifferent, even <hi>in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduo,</hi> as there is no antecedent necessity lying upon mens Consciences for the doing of it; because men may omit it, and break no Law of God. Besides this, to make an action good, there is necessary a <hi>bonitas Originis,</hi> or rather <hi>Principii,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> good Principle, out of which the action must flow; which must be that Faith, which whatsoever is not of, is sin; as the Apostle tells us. Which we must not so understand, as though in<note place="margin">Rom 14. 23.</note> every action a man goes about, he must have a full perswasion that it is a necessary duty he goes about; but in many actions that Faith is sufficient, whereby he is perswaded upon good ground, that the thing he goes about is lawful; although he may as lawfully omit that action; and do either another, or the contrary to it. There may be then the necessity of some things in an action when it is done to make it good, and yet the action its self be no ways necessary, but indifferent, and a matter of Liberty. This may be easily understood by what is usually said of Gods particular Actions, that God is free in himself either to do or not to do that action (as suppose the Creation of the World) but when he doth it, he must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily do it with that goodness, holiness, and wisdom, which is suitable to his Nature: So may many actions of men be in themselves indifferent, and yet there must be a concomitant necessity of good intention and Principle to make the action good. But this concomitant necessity doth not destroy the Radical Indifferency of the action it self; it is only an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent necessity from the obligation of the Law, is that which destroys indifferency. So likewise it is as to evil; there is such an evil in an action, which not only spoils the action, but hinders the person from the liberty of doing it, that is, in all such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are intrinsecally evil; and there is such a kind of evil in actions, which though it spoils the goodness of the action, yet keeps not from performance; which is such as ariseth from the manner of performance, as praying in hypocrisie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doing a thing lawful with a scrupulous or erring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. We see then what good and evil is consistent with indifferency in actions, and what is not. And that the Nature
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100525:41"/>
of Actions, even <hi>in individuo,</hi> may be indifferent, when as to their Circumstances they may be necessarily determin'd to be either good or evil. As Marrying, or not Marrying, as to the Law of God, is left at liberty, not making it in its self a necessary duty, one way or other; but, supposing particular Circumstances make it necessary, <hi>pro hîc &amp; nunc,</hi> yet the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it remains indifferent st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll; and supposing Marriage, it is necessary it should be in the Lord, and yet it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to make choice of this person rather then of that, so that not only the absolute indifferency of the action is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with this concomitant necessity, but the full liberty, both of <hi>contradiction,</hi> and <hi>contrariety.</hi> Again, we must distinguish between an <hi>Indifferency,</hi> as to its <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Indifferency,</hi> as to its <hi>use and end;</hi> or between an indifferency as to a <hi>Law,</hi> and indifferency as to <hi>order and peace:</hi> Here I say, that in things wholly indifferent in both respects, that is, in a thing neither commanded nor forbidden by God, nor that hath any apparent respect to the Peace and Order of the Church of God, there can be no rational account given, why the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of such indifferencies should be alter'd by any Humane Laws and Constitutions. But matters that are only indifferent as to a Command, but are much conducing to the Peace and Order of a Church, such things as these, are the proper mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Humane Constitutions concerning the Churches Polity: Or rather, to keep to the words of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> it self, where any things are determin'd in general by the Word of God, but left at Liberty, as to manner and Circumstances, it is in the power of Lawful Authority in the Church of God to determine such things, as far as they tend to the promoting the good of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And so I rise to the second step, which is, That matters of<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> this Nature may be determin'd and restrained. Or, that there is no necessity, that all matters of Liberty should remain in their primary indifferency. This I know is asserted by some of great Note and Learning; that in things which God hath left to our Christian Liberty, man may not restrain us of it, by subjecting those things to Positive Laws; but I come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, with what strength of reason this is said, that so we may see, whether men may not yield in some lawful things
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100525:42"/>
to a restraint of their Christian Liberty, in order to the Peace of the Church of God: Which I now prove by these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>First,</hi> What may be lawfully done when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, may be so far lawfully commanded, as it is a thing in it self lawful; but matters of Christian Liberty may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done when they are commanded to be done, though it were lawful not to do them before that Command. The truth of the Proposition appears, because Lawful Authority may command any thing that may be lawfully done. Because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can exempt from obedience to a lawful Magistrate, but the unlawfulness of the thing commanded; and therefore nothing can debar the Magistrate from commanding these things; for nothing can hinder him from Commanding, but what may hinder the Subject from Obedience. I grant in many cases it may be lawful to obey, when it is very inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Magistrate to command: but inconveniency and unlawfulness are two things; nay, and in some cases a man may lawfully obey when he is unlawfully commanded; but then the matter of the Command it self is unlawful. As in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting an unjust Sentence, granting that a Princes Servants may lawfully do it, especially when they know it not; yet in that case, the ground of their lawful obedience, is the ground of the Magistrates lawful Command, which is the supposed Justice of the Execution. But that which makes the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Command unlawful, is the intrinsecal evil of the thing its self. So for unlawful Wars, though the Subjects may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obey, yet the Prince sins in commanding, not but that he hath right to command so far as they are bound to obey, which is only in things lawful: but that which in this case alters the matter, is, the Princes knowing his cause to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just. So that however the Proposition holds in things not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly unjust. But however this be, it is hereby granted, that the things may be lawfully done, when they are restrained by the Magistrates Command: and by that it appears, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty may be restrained, else it could not be lawful to act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that restraint, not as it respects the things themselves, but under that formality, as they are the restraint of that which ought to be left free. The Restraint however then is lawful, as to the persons acting under Authority, who are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100525:42"/>
of this liberty, though it were granted unlawfull as to the authority doing it. Which former is sufficient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christian liberty, as to the subjects of it, may be lawfully restrained. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A lesser duty ceaseth to be a duty, when it hinders from the performance of greater; but the preserving Christian liberty is a lesser duty, which may hinder the peace of the Church, which is a greater; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that case it may be restrained. The <hi>Major</hi> is granted by Divines and Casuists; when duties stand in competition, the lesser ceaseth to bind, as is evident, in that God will have mercy rather then sacrifice. Positives yield to morals and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals. Thence the obligation of an Oath ceaseth, when it hinders from a natural duty; as the <hi>Corban</hi> among the Jews<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grat. de jure belli &amp; pacis. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap</hi> 13. <hi>sect.</hi> 7.</note> from relief of Parents. And therefore <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, that an Oath taken concerning a thing lawfull, if it doth hinder <hi>majus bonum morale,</hi> the obligation of that Oath ceaseth. Now that preserving-liberty is a lesser duty then the looking after the peace of the Church, is evident, because the one is only a matter of liberty, and left undetermin'd by the Word; and the other a matter of necessity, and absolutely, and expresly required of all, as a duty as much as possibly lyes in them to endeavour after. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If an occasional offence of weaker Brethren may be a ground for restraining Christian liberty; then much more may commands from lawfull authority do it; but the offence of weaker Brethren may restrain Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as to the exercise of it, as appears by the Apostles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 21. The reason of the consequence lies here, that a case of meer offence, which is here pleaded towards weak Brethren, cannot have that obligation upon Conscience, which a known duty of obeying lawfull Authority, in things in themselves lawfull, hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay further, insisting only on the Law of scandall, I would fain know, whether it be a greater offence and scandall to Christians consciences, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the lawfull authority of the Magistrate, and to deny obedience to his commands, in things undetermin'd by the Law of God; or else to offend the Consciences, that is, go against the judgements of some well-meaning, but less-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christians. Or thus, whether in the matter of scandall, it be a greater offence to go against the judgements of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100525:43"/>
weaker and more ignorant, or the more knowing and able; when the one have only their own weak apprehension to by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asse them, the other are backed by and grounded upon an established Law. And whether it be not a greater scandall to Religion to disobey a Christian Magistrate, then it is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend some private Christians. Let these things be examined, and then let us see whether the argument will not hold <hi>à ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jori;</hi> if the Law of scandall as to private Christians may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain liberty, then may a command from the Magistrate do it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I argue thus, If the nature of Christian-liberty may be preserved under the restraint of the exercise of it, then it is not against the nature of Christian-liberty to have the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise restrained; but the former is true; and therefore the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now that the nature of Christian-liberty may be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the restraint of its exercise, I prove by these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because the nature of Christian-liberty is founded<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> upon the freedom of judgement, and not the freedom of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. The case is the same in moral and natural liberty as in Christian. Now we say truly, that the radical liberty of the soul is preserved, though it be determined to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action. For the liberty of the Will lying in the <hi>power</hi> of determining its self either way (as it is generally thought) the actuall determination of the Will doth not take away the internal power in the soul; and in that respect there may be a <hi>potentia faciendi</hi> where there is not <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilit as effectûs,</hi> a power of doing when there is no possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the thing should be done, when the event is otherwise determined by a divine decree, as in breaking the bones of Christ upon the Crosse. So it is in reference to Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; though the exercise of it be restrained, yet the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remains: because Christian-liberty lyes in the freedom of judgement; <hi>that is,</hi> in judging those things to be free which are so; so that if any thing that is in its self free, be done by a man with an opinion of the necessity of doing it ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the Law commanding it, or without any Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing it, thereby his Christian liberty is destroyed; but if it be done with an opinion of the freedom and indifferency of the thing it self, but only with a consequential necessity of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100525:43"/>
doing it, supposing the Magistrates command, he retains the power of his Christian-liberty still, though under the restraint of the exercise of it. And therefore it would be well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the opinion of the necessity of any one thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by Scripture, destroys Christian-liberty more then a Magistrates command doth. And by this reason, they that hold any one posture at receiving the Lords Supper necessary (as sitting, leaning, kneeling) do all equally destroy their own Christian-liberty as to these things which are undetermined by the Word. So a Magistrate when commanding matters of Christian-liberty, if in the preface to the Law he declares the thing necessary to be done in its self, and therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, he takes away as much as in him lyes our Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberty. And in that case we ought to hold to that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rule of the Apostle, <hi>Stand fast therefore in the liberty</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>wherewith Christ hath set you free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bondage.</hi> But if the Magistrate declare the things to be in themselves indifferent, but only upon some pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent considerations for peace and order, he requires persons to observe them, though this brings a necessity of obedience to us, yet it takes not away our Christian-liberty. For an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent<note place="margin">D. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> de ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. cons. prael. 6. s. 5.</note> necessity expressed in the Law (as a learned and excellent Casuist of our own observes) doth not necessarily require the assent of the practical judgement to it; which takes away our liberty of judgement, or our judgement of the liberty of the things; but a consequentiall necessity upon a command supposed, doth only imply an act of the Will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the freedom of judgement and conscience remaining, it is inclined to obedience to the commands of a superior Law. Now that liberty doth lye in the freedom of Judgement, and not in the freedom of Practise, and so is consistent with the restraint of the exercise of it; appears both in the former case of scandall, and in the actions of the Apostles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians complying with the Jews in matters of liberty; yea which is a great deal more, in such ceremonies of which the Apostle expresly saith, that if they observed them, Christ<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note> would profit them Nothing; and yet we find <hi>Paul</hi> himself circumcising <hi>Timothy</hi> because of the Jews. Certainly then<note place="margin">Acts 16. 3.</note> however these ceremonies are supposed to be not only
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100525:44"/>
                     <hi>mortuae</hi> but <hi>mortiferae</hi> now the Gospel was preached, and the Law of Christian-liberty promulged; yet <hi>Paul</hi> did not look upon it, as the taking away his liberty, at any time when it would prevent scandall among the Jews, and tend to the furtherance of the Gospel, to use any of them. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the opinion of the necessity of them was it which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed Christian-liberty; and therefore it is observable, that where the opinion of the necessity of observing the Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Rites and Ceremonies was entertained, the Apostle sets himself with his whole strength to oppose them, as he doth<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 9, 10, 11. Coloss. 2. 16, 18, 19.</note> in his Epistles to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Colossians.</hi> Whom yet we find in other places, and to other Churches, not leaven'd with this doctrine of the necessity of Judaicall Rites, very ready to comply with weak Brethren, as in his Epistles to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Corinthians.</hi> From which we plainly see, that it was<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 3, 6, 21. 1 Cor. 10. 24.</note> not the bare doing of the things, but the doing them with an opinion of the necessity of them, is that which infringeth Christian-liberty, and not the determination of one part above the other by the Supream Magistrate, when it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to be for any opinion of the things themselves as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, but to be only in order to the Churches peace and unity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appears that Liberty is consistent with the restraint of the exercise of it; because the very power of restraining the exercise of it, doth suppose it to be a matter of liberty, and that both antecedently and consequentially to that restraint. <hi>Antecedently,</hi> so it is apparent to be a matter of liberty, else it was not capable of being restrained: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially,</hi> in that the ground of observance of those things when restrained, is not any necessity of the matter, or the things themselves; but only the necessity of obeying the Magistrate in things lawfull and undertermin'd by the Word: which leads to another argument. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mens obligation to these things, as to the ground of it, being only in point of contempt and scandall, argues that the things are matter of liberty still. I grant the Magistrates authority is the ground of obedience, but the ground of the Magistrates command is only in point of contempt and scandall, and for preserving order in the Church: For I have already shewed it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, either to command or obey; in reference to these
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100525:44"/>
things, from any opinion of the necessity of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the only ground of observing them, is to shew that we are not guilty of contempt of the power commanding them, nor of scandall to others that are offended at our not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them. <hi>Tota igitur religio est in fugiendo scandalo &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>contemptu,</hi> saith our learned <hi>Whitaker:</hi> All our ground of obedience is the avoiding scandall and contempt of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

                     <hi>contemptus &amp; scandalum:</hi> So that non-observance of indifferent things commanded, when there there is no apparent contempt or scandall, do not involve a man in the guilt of sin: as suppose a Law made that all publike prayer be performed kneeling, if any thing lies in a mans way to hinder him from that posture, in this case the man offends not; because there is no contempt or scandall: So if a Law were made that all should receive the Lords Supper fasting, if a mans health calls for somwhat to refresh him before, he sins not in the breach of that Law. And therefore it is observable which <hi>Whitaker</hi> takes notice of in the Canons of the Councils of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, that though they did determine many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the externall Polity of the Church, yet they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served this difference in their Censures or Anathema's; That in matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now from this, we may take notice of a difference between Laws concerning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencies in civill and Ecclesiastical matters: That in civils the Laws bind to indifferencies without the case of contempt or scandall, because in these the publike good is aimed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, of which every private person is not fit to judge, and therefore it is our duty either to obey or suffer; but in Ecclesiasticall constitution, only peace and order is that which is looked at, and therefore, <hi>Si nihil contra</hi>

                     <hi>feceris, non teneris illis,</hi> is the rule here. If nothing tending to apparent disorder be done, men break not those Laws: For the end and reason
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100525:45"/>
of a Law is the measure of its obligation. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Mens being left free to do the things forbidden, either upon a repeal of the former Laws, or when a man is from under obligation to that authority which commands them, argues them still to be matters of liberty, and not matters of necessity. That Laws respecting indifferent things may be repealed, I cannot imagine that any have so little reason as to deny, upon a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent state of affairs from what it was when they were first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted; or when they cannot attain the ends they are designed for, the peace and order of the Church, but rather tend to imbroil it in trouble and confusion: And that when men are from under the authority imposing them, men are at their own liberty again, must necessarily be granted, because the ground of restraint of that liberty was the authority they were under; and therefore the cause being taken away, the effects follows. Therefore for men to do them when autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth not impose them, must imply an opinion of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the things themselves, which destroyes Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberty.<note place="margin">

                     </gap> with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the necessity of it, doth immediately destroy that Christian-liberty which men are necessarily bound to stand fast in, and not be intangled with any yoke of bondage.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That nothing be required, nor determin'd, but what is sufficiently known to be indifferent in its own nature. The former proposall was in reference to the manner of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, this respects the nature of the things themselves. The only difficulty here is, How a thing may be sufficiently known to be indifferent; because one man looks upon that as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which another doth not. The most equal way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this Controversie, is to make choyce of such Judges as are not interested in the quarrel: And those are the <hi>sense of the Primitive Church</hi> in the first 4 Centuries, who were best able to judge whether they looked upon themselves as bound by any command of Scripture or no; and withall the Judgement of the Reformed Churches: So that what shall be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be left indifferent, by both the sense of the Primitive Church, and the Churches of the Reformation, may be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter determinable by Law, and which all may be required to conform in obedience to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That whatever is thus determined be in order only to a due performance of what is in general required in the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100525:47"/>
Word of God, and not to be looked on as any part of Divine Worship or Service. This is that which gives the greatest occasion of offence to mens Consciences, when any thing is either required; or if not, yet generally used and looked on as a necessary part or concomitant of Gods Worship, so that without it the Worship is deemed imperfect. And there is great difference to be made between things indifferent in their own nature, and indifferent as to their use and practise. And when the generality of those who use them do not use them as Indifferent, but as necessary things, it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, whether in this case such a use be allowable till men be better informed of the nature of the things they do. As in the case of the Papists about Image-worship, their Divines say, that the Images are only as high teners of Devotion, but the worship is fixed on God; but we find, it is quite otherwise in the general pract<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se of people who look at nothing beyond the Image. So it may be, bating the degrees of the offence, when matters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in themselves are by the generality of people not looked on as such, but used as a necessary part of divine Service. And it would be considered whether such an abuse of matters supposed indifferent being known, it be not <hi>scandalum datum</hi> to continue their use without an effectual remedy for the abuse of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That no Sanctions be made, nor mulcts or penalties be inflicted on such who only dissent from the use of some things whose lawfulnesse they at present scruple, till sufficient time and means be used for their information of the nature and indifferency of the things, that it may be seen whether it be out of wilfull contempt and obstinacy of spirit, or only weaknesse of Conscience and dissatisfaction concerning the things themselves that they disobey. And if it be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be out of contempt, that only such penalties be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted as answers to the nature of the offence; I am sure it is contrary to the Primitive practise, and the Moderation then used, to suspend or deprive men of their ministerial function for not conforming in Habits, Gestures, or the like. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Habits, <hi>Walafridus Strabo</hi> expresly tells us, There was no<note place="margin">

whole Chapter to that purpose; as, in the observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> some on the fourteenth day of <hi>April,</hi> others only upon the Lords Day, but some of the more Eastern Churches differed from both.

                     </gap>; for against either of these no Humane Law can bind the Conscience: For if there be any moral evil in the thing Commanded, we are bound to obey God rather than men; in which case, we do not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly disobey the Magistrate, but we chuse to obey God before him. And, as we have already observed, a former Obligation from God or Nature destroys a latter; because God hath a greater Power and Authority over mens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, then any Humane Authority can have: And my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Magistrate being founded upon a Divine Law, it must be supposed my duty to obey him first, by virtue of whose Authority I obey another; then, the other whom I obey, because the former hath commanded me. If I am bound to obey an Inferiour Magistrate, because the Supreme requires it; if the Inferiour command me any thing contrary to the Will and Law of the Supreme, I am not bound to obey him in it, because both the derives his Power of Commanding, and I my Obligation to Obedience, from the Authority of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, which must be supposed to do nothing against it self.

Thus then, as those things which are either of Natural or Christian Liberty, are subjected to Humane Laws and restraints, so those Laws are not irreversible; but if the Fences be thrown down by the same Authority which set them up, whatever was thereby inclosed, returns to the Community of Natural Right again.

                  <argument>
                     <p>How far Church Government is founded upon the Law of Nature. Two things in it founded thereon. 1. That there must be a Society of men for the Worship of God. 2. That this Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be governed in the most convenient manner. A Society for Worship manifested, Gen. 4. 26. considered. The Sons of God, and the Sons of Men, who? Societies for Worship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Heathens evidenced by three things. 1. Solemnity of Sacrifices; Sacrificing how far Natural; the antiquity of the Feast of first-fruits, largely discovered. 2. The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Festivals for the Honour of their Deities. 3. The Secrecy and Solemnity of their Mysteries. This further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Mans Sociable Nature, the improvement of it by Religion, the Honor redounding to God by such a Society for his Worship.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving now laid our Foundation, we proceed to raise<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> a superstructure upon it. And we now come closely to inquire how far Government in the Church is founded upon an unalterable Divine Right? That we have found to be built upon a double Foundation, <hi>the Dictates of the Law of Nature, and Divine Positive Laws.</hi> We shall impartially inquire into both of them, and see how far Church-Government is setled upon either of these two. I begin then with the Law of Nature. Two general things, I conceive, are of an unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Divine Right in reference to this: First, <hi>That there be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and joyning together of men for the Worship of God:</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That this Society be governed, preserved, and maintained in a most convenient manner. First,</hi> That there must be a Society of men joyning together for the Worship of God. For the Dictate of Nature being common to all, that God must be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Nature requires some kind of Mutual Society for the joynt performance of their common duties. An Evidence of which Dictate of Nature, appears in the first mention we find of any Publick Society; so that a Society for Religious Worship was as ancient as the first Civil Societies we have any Records of. Nay, the very first Publick Society we read of, was gathered upon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100525:51"/>
this account. For we read in the early days of the world that the Charter for this Society was soon made use of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. <hi>In the days of</hi> Enosh <hi>men began to call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> Now <hi>Enosh</hi> was <hi>Seths</hi> Son, whom <hi>Adam</hi> had given to him in the place of <hi>Abel;</hi> and assoon as the number of men did increase, that men grew into Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they then had their publike societies for Gods Worship. For we cannot understand that place absolutely, as though God had not been called on before, but now he was called on more signally and solemnly; when men were increased that they began to imbody themselves into Societies, <hi>Coepit congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare populum ad tractandum simul Dei cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For as there certainly were many bad of <hi>Seths</hi> Posterity, because the flood destroyed all of them, <hi>Noah</hi> only and his Family excepted: so there might be some good of the other, vice being no more enta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>from the dayes of</hi> Enosh. But the words will scarce bear this construction, as <hi>Vossius</hi> upon him observes; and besides, there is no mention at all of the name of any false Gods, but only of the true one.

Such a Diocess we might be content to allow him that pleads for the same Office, and derives his Title somewhat higher then <hi>Adam;</hi> For Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth proved there must be but one chief Priest, and so one Pope, because it is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. That God created the world <hi>in Principio,</hi> not <hi>in Principiis;</hi> mark the number; therefore there must be but one beginning, and so one Bishop, and not many. What excellent Disputants an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chair makes men! Much good may his argument do him.</p>
                  <p>As a further evidence, How much Nature dictates that such a Society there should be for Divine Worship, we shall<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> inquire into the practise of men in their dispersion after the Flood. And what we find unanimously continued among them, under such gross Idolatry as they were given to, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100525:52"/>
which did arise not from their Idolatry as such, but from the general nature of it as a kind of Worship, we have reason to look upon as one of those planks which hath escaped the common shipwrack of humane nature by the fall of man. And so though that argument from the generall consent of Nations owning a way of Worship though a false one, in order to the proving the existence of God be slighted by some, yet<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Socinus prael. cap.</hi> 2.</note> there is this double evidence in it to prove it, more then is generally taken notice of, and beyond the bare testimony its self given by that consent. <hi>First,</hi> From mens being so easily imposed upon by false Religions, in that they are so soon gull'd into Idolatry; it argues there are some Jewels in the World, or else men would never be deceived with counterfeits; It argues that a Child hath a Father, who is ready to call every one that comes to him, Father; So it argues there is some naturall instinct in men towards the Worship of God, when men are so easily brought to worship other things instead of God. We see no other creatures can be so imposed upon; we read of no Idolatry among the Brutes, nor that the Bees though they have a King and honour him, did ever bow their Knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> or worship the Hive instead of him. If men had no journeys to go, others need not be sworn as the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were, not to put them out of their way. If there were no inclinableness to Religion, all cautions against Idolatry were superfluous: there is then from mens proness to error, as to the person and object of Worship, an evidence of naturall <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an instinct within towards the act of Worship; And as when I see sheep flock together, even in their wandrings, I may easily gather that though they are out of their proper pastures, yet they are of a tame and sociable nature; So when we see Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Worship were preserved among men after they were degenerated into Idolatry; it is an evident argument that such associating together for the generall nature of the act, doth flow from the nature of man. <hi>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> All mens agreeing in some kind of Worship, though differing as to the object and manner of it, is an evidence it comes from Nature, because it plainly evinces it could be nothing taken up out of design, received by custome, nor convey'd by tradition, because even among those whose interests and designs have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100525:53"/>
to one another, and could have no mutuall compacts to deceive their people, have all agreed in this thing, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all other things they have strangely differ'd. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Customs and Traditions, are either changed, or lost among severall Nations; as the rude barbarous Northern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that in their inrodes and incursions upon other places, have left in process of time, almost all other customs but only their Religion behind them. This sticks closer then <hi>Saladines</hi> black shirt, or the old <hi>Monks</hi> cloathes, which they put not off till they dyed, Nay even those Nations, who openly, and as by a Law, violate the other received dictates of Nature, do yet maintain and hold up this. Those that have had the least of commerce and converse with civilized people, have yet had their societies for worship: And when they could find no gods to worship, they would rather make then want them. The Egyptians would rather spoyl their Sallets then be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gods; and they that whipt their gods, yet had them still. They who had no sense of another life, yet would pray to their gods for the good things of this: and they that would not pray that the gods would do them good, yet would that they might do them no hurt: So that in the most prodigious Idolatry, we have an argument for Religion; and in the strange diversities of the wayes of worship, we have an evidence how naturall a society for worship is.

But suppose onely mankind of all creatures should be liable to be thus imposed on, as is pretended: How comes it to pass that in no age of the world this Imposture hath not been discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, confuted, and shaken off by some people as wise as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? Or have there never been any such in the world? But whence come some men then to be wiser then others? Whence come some to know things which all the Reason in the World could never finde out, without Revelation? Whence comes a power to doe any thing above the course of Nature, if there be nothing but Nature? Or are all men deceived that believe such things? If so, then there must be somewhat that must deceive men; men would not deceive themselves, and they could not be so long imposed upon by other men; there must be then some evil spirit must do it; and whence should that come? from Nature too? but then whence comes Nature its self? from its self too, or some thing 'else. Did it make it self, or was it made by a greater Power then it? if it made its self, it must be and not be at the same time; it must be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, and not be as produced by that Act. And what is become of our Reason now? There must be then a Supream,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100525:57"/>
Eternal, Infinite Being, which made the world and all in it; which hath given Nature such a <hi>Touch</hi> of its own immortality and dependance upon God, that Reason capable of Religion is the most proper distinctive Character of man from all Inferior beings. And this <hi>Touch</hi> and Sense being common to the whole Nature; they therefore incline more to one anothers Society in the joynt performance of the common Duties, due from them to their Maker. And so Religion not onely makes all other Bonds firm (which without it are nothing, as Oaths, Covenants, Promises, and the like, without which no civill So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety can be upheld) but must of its self be supposed especially to tye men in a nearer Society to one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reference to the proper Acts belonging to its self. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it appears from the greater honour which redounds to God by a sociable way of Worship. Nature that dictates that God should be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, doth likewise dictate that worship should be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a way most for the honour and glory of God. Now this tends more to promote Gods honour, when his service is own'd a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the honour of a King lies in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely professed and avowed obedience of a multitude of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; it must proportionably promote and advance Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour more to have a fixed, stated Worship, whereby men may in a Community and publike Society declare and manifest their homage and fealty to the supream Governour of the World. Thus then we see the light of Nature dictates there should be a society and joyning together of men for and in the Worship of God.</p>

                     <p>The second thing the Law of Nature dictates, that this society be maintained and governed in the most convenient manner. A further inquiry, what particular Orders for Government in the Church come from the Law of Nature. Six laid down, and evidenced to be from thence. First, a distinction of some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and their superiority over others, both in power and order, cleared to be from the Law of Nature. The power and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the power distinguished; this latter not from any Law of Nature binding, but permissive: therefore may be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Peoples right of chosing Pastors considered. Order distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the form and manner of Government: the former Natural, the other not. The second is, that the persons imployed in the Service of God, should have respect answerable to their imployment, which appears from their Relation to God as his Servants; from the persons imployed in this work before posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws. Masters of Families the first Priests. The Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the first born before the Law discussed: The Arguments for it answered.

The ground of Separation of them afterwards, from <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe <hi>second</hi> thing which the Light of Nature dictates, in<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> reference to Church-Government, is, That the Society in which men joyn for the Worship of God, be preserved, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and governed in the most convenient manner. Nature, which requires Society, doth require Government in that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or else it is no Society. Now we shall inquire what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Orders for Government of this Society established for the Worship of God, do flow from the light of Nature, which I conceive are these following.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>To the maintaining of a Society, there i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> requisite a Distinction of Persons, and a Superiority of Power and Order, in some over the other.</hi> If all be Rulers, every man is <hi>sui juris,</hi> and so there can be no Society, or each man must have power over the other, and that brings confusion. There must be some
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100525:58"/>
then invested with Power and Authority over others, to rule them in such things wherein they are to be subordinate to them; that is, in all things concerning that Society they are entered into. Two things are implyed in this: First Power: Secondly Order. By Power, I mean a right to Govern; by Order, the Superiority of some as Rulers, the Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others as ruled. These two are so necessary, that no Civil Society in the World can be without them: For if there be no Power, how can men Rule? If no Order, how can men be ruled, or be subject to others as their Governours? Here several things must be heedfully distinguished. <hi>The Power</hi> from the <hi>Application</hi> of that <hi>Power,</hi> which we call the Title to Government. The <hi>Order it self</hi> from the <hi>form or manner of Government.</hi> Some of these I Assert as absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to all Government of a Society, and consequently of the Church, considered without positive Laws; but others to be accidentall, and therefore variable. I say then that there be a Governing Power in the Church of God, is immutable, not onely by Vertue of Gods own Constitution, but as a necessary result from the dictate of Nature, supposing a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: But whether this Power must be derived by Succession, or by a free Choice, is not at all determined by the Light of Nature; because it may be a lawful Power, and derived ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: And the Law of Nature as binding, onely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines of necessaries. Now in Civil Government, we see that a lawfull Title is by Succession in some places, as by Election in other. So in the Church under the Law, the Power went by lineal Descent, and yet a lawful Power: And on the other side, none deny (setting aside positive Lawes) but it might be as lawful by choice and free Election. The main Reason of this is, that the Title or Manner of conveying Authority to particular Persons, is no part of the preceptive Obligatory Law of Nature, but onely of the permissive; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not immutable, but is subject to Divine or Humane posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Determinations, and thereby made alterable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a Determination, either by Scripture or lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the exercise of that Natural Right is so far restrained as to become sinful, according to the third Proposition under the 2. Hypoth. and the 5. Hypoth. So that granting at present,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100525:58"/>
that people have the Right of choosing their own Pastors; this Right being only a part of the Permissive Law of Nature, may be lawfully restrained and otherwise determined, by those that have lawfull authority over the people, as a Civil Society, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the 5. Hypoth. If it be pleaded that they have a right by divine positive law, that law must be produced it being already proved, that no bare Example, without a Declaration by God that such an Example binds, doth constitute a Divine Right which is unalterable. We say then, that the manner of investing Church-Governours in their Authority, is not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Law of Nature; but that there should be a Power Governing, is (supposing a Society) of the immutable Law of Nature, because it is that without which no Society can be maintained. And this is one of those things which are of the Law of Nature, not in an abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lute state of Liberty; but supposing some Acts of Men which (once supposed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come immutable, and indispensable. As supposing Propriety, every Man is bound to abstain from what is in anothers Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without his consent, by an immutable Law of Nature; which yet supposeth some Act of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the voluntary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of Propriety by consent: So supposing a Society in being, it is an immutable dictate of the Law of Nature, that a Power of Government should be maintained and preserved in it.</p>
                  <p>So I say for the second thing, Order. This, as it implies the<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Subordination of some in a Society to others as their Rulers, is immutable and indispensable; but as to the Form whereby that Order should be preserved, that is, whether the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be in the hands of one or more, is no wise Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Obligatory Law of Nature; because either of them may be lawfull and usefull for the ends of Government, and so neither necessary by that Law: For as to the Law of Nature, the Case is the same in Civil and Religious Societies; Now who will say, that according to the Law of Nature, any form of Government, Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy, is unlawfull. These things are then matters of Naturall Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not of Naturall necessity, and therefore must be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined according to positive Determinations of Divine and Humane Lawes, where we shall speak of it. This then is clear
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100525:59"/>
as to our purpose, That a power in the Church must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly upheld and preserved, fitly qualified for the ends of Government, is an immutable Law; so that this power be lodged in some particular Persons to act as Governours, and so distinct from others, as subordinate to them; but whether the Power of Government come from People by Election, or from Pastors by Ordination, or from Magistrates by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Delegation; whether one, two, or all these wayes, is not determined by Naturall Law, but must be looked for in Gods positive Laws; if not there neither to be found, we must acquiesce in what is determined by lawful Authority. The same I say again, as to forms of Government, whether the Power of sole Jurisdiction, and Ordination, be invested in one person above the rank of Presbyters, or be lodged in a Colledge acting in a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rity of Power, is a plea must be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Court of common Law of Nature, to the Kings Bench; I mean to the positive Lawes of God, or the Supream power in a Common-wealth: There being no Statutes in the Law of Nature to determine it: it must be therefore <hi>Placitum Regis,</hi> some positive Law must end the controversie. We therefore traverse the Suit here, and shall enter it at the other Court.</p>
                  <p>The second thing dictated by the Law of Nature, is, <hi>That the persons imployed in the immediate Service of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the Power of governing the Society appointed for that end, should have respect paid them answerable to the Nature of their imployment.</hi> This appears to have foundation in the Law of Nature, being easily deducible from one of the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that Law, that God is to be worshipped; if so, then those whose imployment is chiefly to attend upon himself, ought to have greater Reverence then others. By the same Reason in Nature, that if we do honour the King himself, the nearer any are to the Kings Person in attendance and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the greater honour is to be shewed them. The ground of which is, that the honour given to servants as such, is not given to their persons, but to their Relation, or to the one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the account of the other; and so it doth not fix and terminate upon themselves, but rebounds back, and reflects upon the Original and Fountain of that Honour, the Prince
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100525:59"/>
himself: So if any be honoured upon the account of their immediate imployment in the service of God, it is God who is chiefly honour'd, and not they; it being the way men have to expresse their honour to God, by shewing it proportionably and respectively to those who either represent him, or are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him. <gap reason="foreign">

Whether observed by any publike religious custome, or by some private superstition, are things too large to inquire into, too difficult now to determine, and not necessary for my present purpose; It being sufficient in order to that, if they had any set times at all for worship, which shews how solemn the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God ought to be. And this is not denyed by any; it being so necessary a consectary from the duty of Worship that there must be a time for performance of it. And not only in generall that there must be some time, but a sufficient propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time to be consecrated to the publike exercise of piety, both from the consideration of mans obligation to divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from his nature, from the weight and concernment of the things that time is imployed in, and the inward sense of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality upon the soul of man. But then what this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time must exactly be, I see not how meer natural light could determine it, but it would rather suggest it to be highly reasonable to wait for and expect such a determination from the supream Rector and Governour of the world. It being far more fit for the Master to prescribe unto the servant what proportion of service he expects from him, then that the servant should both divide and choose his own time, and the proportion of service which he owes to his Master. Nay it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100525:64"/>
being so much more reasonable for us to wait for Gods order, then for a servant for his Masters, as Gods power and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the creature is greater then that of a Master over his servant; as it is the voyce and sense of nature that Gods commands cannot otherwise be but just, holy, reasonable and good: which may be otherwise from men; as the acceptance of our persons with God, lies not barely in the work done; but in the doing it out of obedience to the commands of God; which is otherwise with men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as, God can give strength to perform what he commands, which man cannot: which things considered make it evident to be highly reasonable that God himself should prescribe the proportion of time, and not mans nature. But when God hath thus determined it, nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but assent to that particular determination, that in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the works of God, it is most reasonable that rather one day in a week, then one in a month, should be dedicated to Gods service; that the seventh day of the week upon Gods resting on that day and sanctifying it, should be the precise day, unlesse some reason equivalent to that of the first institution, and approved by God for that end, be the ground of its altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another of the seven, which is the reason of the change under the Gospel.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>fourth</hi> thing which Nature dictates in reference to a<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> Church-society, is, <hi>That there must be a way agreed upon to determine and decide all those Controversies arising in this Society, which immediately tend to the breaking the peace and unity of it.</hi> We have seen already that natural reason requires a disparity between persons in a society: To form and constitute a Society, there must be order and power in some, there must be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and subjection in others answering to the former; And by these we suppose a Society to be now modeld. But Nature must either be supposed defective in its designs and contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as to the necessaries required for the management of them; or else there must likewise be implyed a sufficient provision for the maintenance and preservation of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thus entred into. It is no wise agreeable to the wisdom of Nature to erect a Fabrick with such materials, which though they may lye one upon the other, yet if not fitly compacted together, will fall in pieces again assoon as it is set up: nor yet to frame a body with meer flesh and bones, and the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of some members above the other; for unlesse there be joints and sinews and ligatures to hold the parts together,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100525:67"/>
the dissolution (will immediately) follow the formation of it. The end and design of Nature is, preservation and continuance, and therefore things necessary in order to that, must be imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the first design of the being of the thing; so that at least, as to its self, there be no defect in order to that. This must in reason be supposed in all Societies, that when they are first entred, it must be upon such terms as may be sufficient to maintain and keep up those Societies in that peace and order which is requisite in order to the continuance of them. For what diseases are to bodies, Age and fire are to buildings, that divisions and animosities are to Societies, all equally tending to the ruine and destruction of the things they seize upon. And as bodies are furnished by Nature, not only with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive and concoctive faculty, of what tends to their nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with an expulsive faculty of what would tend to the ruine of it. So all civill bodies must not only have ways to strengthen them, but must have likewise a power to expell and disperse those noxions humours and qualities which tend to dissolve the frame, compages and constitution of them. A power then to prevent mischiefs is as necessary in a Society, as a power to settle things in order to the advancement of the common good of Society. This therefore the Church as a religious Society must likewise he endowed with, <hi>viz.</hi> a power to maintain its self, and keep up peace and unity within its self: which cannot otherwise be supposed (considering the <hi>bilious</hi> humour in mens natures, not wholly purged out by Christianity) without some way to decide Controversies which will arise, disturbing the peace of it. For the clearing of this, which much concerns the power and government of the Church, we shall consider what the controversies are which tend to break the Churches peace: and what way the Law of nature finds out for the ending of them, Which we are the more necessitated to speak to, because nothing hath begotten contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies more then the power of determining them hath done.</p>
                  <p>The Controversies then which tend to break the peace of<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> a religious Society, are either matter of different practice, or matter of different opinion. The former, if it comes from no just and necessary cause, and ends in a totall separation from that Society the person guilty of it was joyned with,

                     </gap> a Lay Schism; both being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to that communion and friendlinesse which should be preserved in all Societies. The latter, if impugning somewhat fundamentall, in order to the end of constituting religious Societies, or being a lesser matter, if wilfully taken up, and obstinately maintained, is call'd <hi>Here sit;</hi> which two are seldom seen out of each others company., and when they are together, are like the blind and same man in the Fable, the one lent the other eyes, and the other lent him feet: one to find out what they desired, the other to run away with it when they had it.

But in order to the making clear what the Churches power is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to these, we are to take notice of these things. <hi>First,</hi> That the Church hath no direct immediate power over mens opinions: So that a matter of meer different opinion lyes not properly within the cognizance of any Church power; the reason of it is this, because the end of power lodged in the Church, is to preserve the peace and unity of its self: now a meer different opinion doth not violate the bonds of Society; for, <hi>Opinionum di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, Men may preserve communion under different apprehensions. So long then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as diversity of opinion tends not to the breaking the quiet and tranquillity of the Church of God, a man may safely enjoy his own private apprehensions, as to any danger of molestation from Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Governours; That is, so long as a man keeps his opinion to himself, and hath the power of being his own Counsellor. It is not the difference of opinion formally considered when it is divulged abroad that is punishable, but the tendency to Schism, which lyes in the div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lging of it, and drawing others away from the received Truths: For the opinion its self is an internall act of the mind, and therefore is punishable by no externall power, as that of the Magistrate or Church is; as no internall action is under the jurisdiction or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Magistrate, any further then as necessarily
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100525:68"/>
conjoyned with the outward action, or as it hath a direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon it. The case of blasphemy, which is a thing of the highest nature in this kind, is not punishable by men, as blasphemy implyes low and undervaluing thoughts of God; but as being a thing divulged (else no formal blaspemy) it tends apparently to the dishonour of God, and consequently to the breaking in pieces all such Societies, whose great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is the belief of the Majesty and glory of God. So Idolatry under the Law was punished, as it was immediately destructive of that obedience which men did owe to the true God. And under the Gospel, it is not meer difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, judgement, and apprehension, which layes men open to the Censures of that power which moderates and rules a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Society; but the endeavour by difference of opinion to alienate mens spirits one from another, and thereby to break the Society into fractions and divisions, is that which makes men liable to restraint and punishment. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that where the peace and unity of the Church may be preserved, and yet men keep up different apprehensions of things, there is nothing deserving any severe animadversion from the Rulers of that Society: For a power corrective, and vindictive, must suppose something acted contrary to the Laws and Rules of the Society, and the end of committing that power into the hands of Governours: now here is nothing of that nature; for the Laws of mutual Society are observed; and the end of Church-Government is to see <hi>nè quid Ecclesia detrimenti capiat,</hi> lest the Church as a Society be any wayes prejudiced: which cannot be while men maintain that love, affection, and communion which becomes the members of such a Society. The unity then required in the Church, is not an unity of judgement and apprehension among the members of it, which though it be their duty to endeavour after, yet it is no further attainable by mens endeavours then perfection is; and <hi>Unio Christianorum</hi> in this sense, is one of the Jewels belonging to the Crown of Heaven. There, is no necessity then of inquiring after an infallible Judge of Controversies, unlesse we had some promise and assurance from Christ, that the members of his Church should never differ in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from one another, and then what need of an infallible
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100525:69"/>
Judge? and if Christ had appointed an infallible Judg, he would infallibly have discovered it to the minds of all sober men; or else his infallibility could never attain its end: For while I question whether my Judge be infallible or no, I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly assent to any of his determinations. And where there is no ground for an infallible Judge, for any to pretend to it, is the worst of supposable errours, because it renders all others incurable by that apprehension, and takes away all possibility of repentance while men are under that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The Unity then of the Church, is that of Communion, and not that of Apprehension; and different opinions are no further lyable to censures, then as men by the broaching of them, do endeavour to disturb the peace of the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>That then which seems most lyable to censures in a Church,<note place="margin">§ 3.</note> is Schism, as being immediately destructive of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which should be maintained in a religious Society. But as to this too, we must observe something further, and not to think and judge every thing to deserve the name, which is by many call'd <hi>Schism;</hi> it being well observed by a very learned and judicious Divine; <hi>that Heresie and Schism, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used, are two Theologicall scare-crows, with which, they</hi>

                     <hi>who use to uphold a party in Religion, use to fright away such, as making enquiry into it, are ready to relinquish and oppose it, if it appear either erroneous or suspitious. For as</hi> Plutarch <hi>reports of a Painter, who having unskilfully painted a Cock, chased away all Cocks and Hens, that so the imperfection of his Art might not appear by comparison with nature; so men willing for ends, to admit of no fancy but their own, endeavour to hinder an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into it, by way of comparison of somewhat with it, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture truer, that so the deformity of their own might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi> Thus he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Schism then, as it imports a separation from communion with a Church-society, is not a thing intrinsecally and formally evil in it self, but is capable of the differences of good and evil according to the grounds, reasons, ends, and circumstances inducing to such a separation. The with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from Society, is but the materiality of Schism; the formality of it must be fetched from the grounds on which that is built. It is therefore a subject which deserve a strict
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100525:69"/>
inquiry, what things those are which may make a withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a religious Society, to which a man is joyned, to be lawfull: For as it is a great sin on the one hand, unnecessarily to divide and separate from Church-society; so it is an offence on the other side, to continue communion when it is a duty to withdraw it. For the resolving this knotty and intricate Question, I shall lay down some things by way of premisall, and come closely to the resolution of it.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Every Christian is under an obligation to joyn in Church-society with others,</hi> because it is his duty to professe himself a Christian, and to own his Religion publickly, and to partake of the Ordinances and Sacraments of the Gospel, which cannot be without society with some Church or other. Every Christian as such, is bound to look upon himself as the member of a body, <hi>viz.</hi> the visible Church of Christ; and how can he be known to be a member, who is not united with other parts of the body? There is then an obligation upon all Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to engage in a religious Society with others, for partaking of the Ordinances of the Gospel. It hath been a case disputed by some (particularly by <hi>Grotius</hi> the supposed Author of a little Tract, <hi>An semper sit communicandum per symbolu?</hi> when he designed the Syncretism with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) whether in a time when Churches are divided, it be a Christians duty to communicate with any of those parties which divide the Church, and not rather to suspend commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from all of them. A case not hard to be decided; for either the person questioning it, doth suppose the Churches divided to remain true Churches, but some to be more pure then others, in which case, by vertue of his generall obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to communion, he is bound to adhere to that Church which appears most to retain its Evangelicall purity; Or else he must suppose one to be a true Church, and the other not; in which the case is clearer, that he is bound to communicate with the true Church: or he must judge them alike impure, which is a case hard to be found; but supposing it is so, either he hath joyned formerly with one of them, or he is now to choose which to joyn with; if he be joyned already with that Church, and sees no other but as impure as that, he is bound to declare against the impurity of the Church, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100525:70"/>
to continue his communion with it; if he be to choose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, he may so long suspend till he be satisfied, which Church comes nearest to the primitive constitution, and no longer. And therefore I know not whether <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> act were to be commended, who after being made a Deacon in the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> by <hi>Meletius,</hi> upon his death, because <hi>Flavianus</hi> came in irregularly as Bishop of the<note place="margin">

Much lesse were the <gap reason="foreign">

But if he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn longer, he had offended against his obligation to joyn in Church-society with others, for participation of Gospel-Ordinances; which is the necessary duty of every Christian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Every Christian actually joyned in Church-society</hi>

                     <hi>with others, is so long bound to maintain society with them, till his communion with them becomes sin.</hi> For nothing else can justifie withdrawing from such a Society, but the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of continuing any longer in it. Supposing a Church then to remain true, as to its constitution and essentials, but there be many corruptions crept into that Church; whether is it the duty of a Christian to withdraw from that Church because of those corruptions, and to gather new Churches only for purer administration, or to joyn with them only for that end? This, as far as I understand it, is the state of the Controversie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100525:70"/>
between our Parochiall Churches, and the Congregationall. The resolution of this great Question must depend on this; Whether is it a sin to communicate with Churches true as to essentialls, but supposed corrupt in the exercise of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline? For Parochiall Churches are not denyed to have the essentialls of true Churches by any sober Congregational men. For there is in them the true Word of God preached, the true Sacraments administred, and an implicite Covenant between Pastor and People, in their joyning together. All that is pleaded then, is corruption, and defect in the exercise and administration of Church order and Discipline. Now that it is lawfull for Christians to joyn with Churches so defective, is not only acknowledged by Reverend Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in his answer to <hi>Apollius,</hi> but largely and fully proved.

                        </gap>ia. Thirdly,</hi> A Believer may lawfully joyn himself in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with such a Church in which such are admitted to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who give no evident signs of grace, but seem to be Lovers of this World; which he proves, because it is every ones main duty to examine himself, and because ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

                     </gap> not defiled, though the comfort of it be diminished. He brings instance from the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> among whom were many scandalous, and had not repented, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20, 21. So in the Jewish Church which lay under great corruptions, when<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34. 1 Cor. 6. 4.—15.</note> our Saviour and his Apostles communicated with it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Although a Believer joyn with such a Church, he is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bound with the guilt, nor defiled with the pollutions of others; which he proves, because it is lawfull to do it, and so he contract: no guilt by it. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A Believer that hath joyned himself to such a Church, is not bound to withdraw, and separate from such a Church under pain of guilt if he doth it not, because it implyes a contradiction to be lawfull to joyn to such a Church, and yet unlawfull to continue in its communion; for that speaks it to be a Church, and this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be no Church; and by that he doth imply it to be unlawfull to separate from any Society which is acknowledged to be a true Church, Thus for that <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>Reverend man,</hi> by whom we see that the received Principles of the sober and moderate part of those of that perswasion, are not at such a distance from others, as many imagine. We see then that communicating with a Church not so pure as we desire, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> no sin by the arguments by him produced. And how it should be then lawfull to withdraw from such a Church, meerly for purer communion, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>stand not. This I am sure was not the case of our Churches in their separation from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> the main ground of which was the sin of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with that Church in her Idolatry and Superstition, and the impossibility of communicating with her, and not partaking of her sins, because she required a profession of her errours, and the practise of her Idolatry as the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary conditions of her communion; in which case it is a sin to communicate with her.</p>
                  <p>And this leads me now to a closer resolution of the case of<note place="margin">§ 5.</note> withdrawing from Churches in which men have formerly been associated, and the grounds which may make such a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing lawfull. In order to that we must distinguish
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100525:71"/>
between these things. <hi>First,</hi> Between <hi>corruptions in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of a Church, and <hi>corruptions in the practice</hi> of a Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Between <hi>corruptions</hi> whether in doctrine, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, <hi>professed and avowed by a Church, and required as conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of communion</hi> in all members of it, and <hi>corruptions crept in, and only tolerated in a Church. Thirdly,</hi> Between <hi>non-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> as to the <hi>abuses of a Church,</hi> and a <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>totall separation from a Church,</hi> as it is such. From these things I lay down these following <hi>Propositions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Where any Church is guilty of corruptions, both in doctrine and practice, which it avoweth and professeth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the owning them as necessary conditions of communion with her, there a non-communion with that Church is necessary, and a totall and positive separation is lawfull and convenient.</hi> I have said already that the necessity and lawfulnesse of this departing from communion with any Church is wholly to be resolved by an inquiry into the grounds and reasons of the action it self. So that the matter of fact must of necessity be discussed, before the matter of Law as to separation from the Church be brought into debate. If there be a just and necessary cause for separation, it must needs be just and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; therefore the cause must be the ground of resolving the nature of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction. Schism then is a separation from any Church upon any slight, triviall, unnecessary cause; but if the cause be great and important, a Departure it may be, Schism it cannot be. They who define Schism to be a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary separation from the Church of God; if by <hi>voluntary,</hi> they mean that where the will is the cause of it: the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion stands good and true; for that must needs be groundless and unnecessary as to the Church it self: but if by <hi>voluntary</hi> be meant a spontaneous departing from communion with a Church, which was caused by the corruptions of that Church, then a separation may be so voluntary, and yet no Schism: for though it be voluntary, as to the act of departing, yet that is only consequentially, supposing a cause suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take such a resolution; but what is voluntary antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that it hath no other Motive but faction and humour, that is properly Schism, and ought so to be looked upon. But in our present case, three things are supposed as the causes and motives to such a forsaking communion. <hi>First, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:100525:72"/>
                     <hi>in Doctrine;</hi> the main ligature of a religious Society is the consent of it in Doctrine with the rule of Religion, the Word of God. Therefore any thing which tends to subvert and overthrow the foundation of the gathering such a Society (which is the profession and practice of the true Religion) yields sufficient ground to withdraw from communion with those who professe and maintain it. Not that every small errour is a just ground of separation, for then there would be no end of separation, and men must separate from one another, till knowledge comes to its perfection, which will only be in glory; but any thing which either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or consequentially doth destroy any fundamental article of Christian faith. Which may be as well done by adding to fundamental articles, as by plain denying them. And my reason is this: because the very <hi>ratio</hi> of a fundamentall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle doth imply, not only its necessity to be believed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised (and the former in reference to the latter, for things are therefore necessary to be known, because necessary to be done, and not <hi>è contrà</hi>) but likewise its sufficiency as to the end for which it is called Fundamentall. So that the articles of faith called Fundamentall, are not only such as are necessary to be believed, but if they be, are sufficient for salvation to all that do believe them. Now he that adds any thing to be believed or done as fundamentall, that is necessary to salvation, doth thereby destroy the sufficiency of those former articles in order to salvation; for if they were sufficient, how can new ones be necessary. The case wil be clear by an Instance. Who assert the satisfaction of Christ for sinners to be a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall article, and thereby do imply the sufficiency of the belief of that in order to salvation; now if a Pope or any other command me to believe the meritoriousnesse of good works with the satisfaction of Christ as necessary to salvation, by adding this he destroyes the former as a fundamentall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: for if Christs satisfaction be sufficient, how can good works be meritorious? and if this latter be necessary, the other was not; for if it were, what need this be added! Which is a thing the Papists with their new Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> would do well to consider: and others too, who so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently assert that none of their errours touch the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith. Where there is now such corruption in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100525:72"/>
supposed in a Church; withdrawing and separation from such a Church, is as necessary as the avoiding of her errours, and not partaking of her sins is. Thence we read in Scripture, of <hi>rejecting such as are hereticks,</hi> and <hi>withdrawing from their society,</hi> which will as well hold, to Churches as to persons, and so much the more, as the corruption is more dangerous, and the relation nearer of a member to a Church, then of one man to another: And from the reason of that command, we read in Ecclesiasticall History, that when <hi>Eulalius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronius,</hi> and <hi>Placentius</hi> were constituted Bishops of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> being Arrians, many both of the Clergy and people,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Lyrinensis</hi> tells us a remarkable story of <hi>Photinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Syrmium</hi> in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> a man of great abilities and same, who suddenly turned from the true faith, and though his people both loved and admired him, yet when they discerned his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, <hi>Quem antea quasi arietem gregis sequebantur, eundem deinceps veluti lupum fugere coeperunt, Whom they followed before as the leader of the flock, they now run away from as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring woolf.</hi> This is the first thing which makes separation, and withdrawment of communion, lawfull and necessary, <hi>viz.</hi> corruption of Doctrine. The <hi>second</hi> is <hi>Corruption of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:</hi> I speak not of practice, as relating to the civil conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of men, but as it takes in the <hi>Agenda</hi> of Religion. When Idolatrous customs, and superstitious practices are not only crept into a Church, but are the prescribed devotion of it: Such as the adoration of the Eucharist (chiefly insisted on by Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> in his Apology, as a cause of separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) invocation of Saints and Angels, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Images, and others of a like nature, used among the Papists, which are of themselves sufficient to make our separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100525:73"/>
from them necessary. But then <hi>thirdly,</hi> as an accession to these two, is the publike owning and professing them, and requiring them, as necessary conditions of communion, from all the members of their Church which makes our withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them unavoidably necessary, as long as we judge them to be such corruptions as indeed they are. For men not to forsake the belief of errours, supposing them to be such, is impossible: and not to forsake the practice and profession of them upon such belief, were the highest hypocrisie: and to do so, and not to forsake the communion of that Church where these are owned, is apparently contradictious (as Mr. <hi>Chilling worth</hi> well observes) seeing the condition of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ. to the Pref. p.</hi> 16. <hi>s.</hi> 22.</note> with it is, that we must professe to believe all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of that Church, not only not to be errours, but to be certain and necessary truths: So that on this account, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are any errours in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>ipso facto,</hi> to forsake the communion of that Church; because the condition of its communion is the belief that there are none: And so that learned and rationall Author there fully proves, that those who require unlawfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary conditions of communion, must take the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Schism upon themselves, by making separation from them just and necessary. In this case, when corruptions in opinion or practice are thus required, as conditions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it is impossible for one to communicate with such a Church without sin; both materially, as the things are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which he joyns with them in; and formally, as he judgeth them so. This is the first Proposition.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, <hi>Where a Church retains the purity of doctrine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>in its publick profession, but hath a mixture of some corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to practice, which are only tolerated and not imposed, it is not lawfull to withdraw communion from such a Church, much lesse to run into totall separation from it:</hi> For here is no just and lawfull cause given of withdrawing; here is no owned corruption of doctrine or practice, nor any thing required as a condition of communion, but what is in its self necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and therefore there can be no plea, but only pollution from such a communion, which cannot be to any who do not own any such supposed corruptions in the Church. Men may
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100525:73"/>
communicate with a Church, and not communicate with the abuses of a Church; for the ground of his communicating is, its being a Church, and not a corrupt or defective Church. And that men are not themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> guilty, by partaking with those who are guilty of corruptions in a Church, might be easily and largely proved, both from the Church of the Jews in the case of <hi>Elies</hi> sons, and the Christian Churches of <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Besides, what reason is there that one mans sins should defile another, more then anothers graces sanctifie another? and why corruption in another should defile him more then in himself, and so keep him from communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with himself? and what security any one can have in the most refined Churches, but that there is some scandalous; or at least unworthy person among them? and whether then it is not his duty to try and examine all himself particularly, with whom he communicates? and why his presence at one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance should defile it more then at another? and why at any more then in wordly converse, and so turn at last to make men <hi>Anchorets,</hi> as it hath done some?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Where any Church, retaining the purity of doctrine, doth require the owning of, and conforming to, any unlawfull or suspected pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, men may lawfully deny conformity to, and communion with that Church in such things, without incurring the guilt of Schism.</hi> I say not, men may proceed to positive Schism as it is call'd, that is, erecting of new Churches, which from <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> is call'd <hi>erigere Altare contra Altare;</hi> but only that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing communion from a Church in unlawfull or suspected things, doth not lay men under the guilt of Schism: which because I know it may meet with some opposition from those men, who will sooner call men Schismaticks then prove them so, I shall offer this reason for it to consideration. If our separation from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> was therefore lawfull,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100525:74"/>
because she required unlawfull things, as conditions of her communion; then where-ever such things are required by any Church; non-communion with that Church in those things will be lawfull too; and where non-communion is lawfull, there can be no Schism in it. Whatever difference will be thought of, as to the things imposed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and others, will be soon answered by the proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difference between bare non-conformity, and totall and positive separation. What was in its self lawfull and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then, how comes it to be unlawfull and unnecessary now? Did that justifie our withdrawing from them, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired things unlawfull, as conditions of communion; and will not the same justifie other mens non-conformity, in things supposed by them unlawfull? If it be said here, that the Popes power was an usurpation, which is not in lawfull Governours of Churches; it is soon replyed, That the Popes usurpation mainly lyes in imposing things upon mens consciences as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, which are doubtfull, or unlawfull; and where-ever the same thing is done, there is an usurpation of the same nature, though not in so high a degree; and it may be as lawfull to withdraw communion from one as well as the other. If it be said, that men are bound to be ruled by their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in determining what things are lawfull, and what not? To this it is answered: first, no true Protestant can swear blind obedience to Church-Governours in all things. It is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est usurpation to rob men of the liberty of their judgements: That which we plead for against the Papists, is, that all men have eyes in their heads as well as the Pope, that every one hath a <hi>judicium privata discretionis,</hi> which is the rule of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as to himself; and though we freely allow a ministeriall power, under Christ, in the Government of the Church, yet that extends not to an obligation upon men, to go against the dictates of their own reason and conscience. Their power is only directive and declarative, and in matters of duty can bind no more then reason and evidence brought from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by them doth. A man hath not the power over his own understanding, much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>quando voluerit.</hi> Either therefore men are bound to obey Church-Governours in all things absolutely, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction or limitation; (which if it be not usurpation and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over others faith in them, and the worst of implicite faith in others, it is hard to define what either of them is,) or else if they be bound to obey only in lawfull things; I then enquire who must be judge what things are lawfull in this case, what not? if the Governours still, then the power will be absolute again; for to be sure, whatever they command, they will say is lawfull, either in it self, or as they command it: if every private person must judge what is lawfull, and what not, which is commanded (as when all is said, every man will be his owd judge in this case, in things concerning his own welfare) then he is no further bound to obey then he judgeth the thing to be lawfull which is commanded. The plea of an erroneous conscience, takes not off the obligation to follow the dictates of it; for as he is bound to lay it down, supposing it erroneous, so he is bound not to go against it, while it is not laid down. But then again, if men are bound to submit to Governours in the determination of lawfull things, what plea could our Reformers have to withdraw themselves from the Popes yoke? it might have still held true, <hi>Boves arabant &amp;</hi>

not on those who withdraw communion, but on them for requiring such conditions of communion (whereby they did rather eject men out of their communion, than the others separate from them) they do not by the same arguments, lay the imputation of Schism on all who require such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of communion, and take it wholly off from those who refuse to conform for conscience sake. To this I shall subjoyn the judgement of as learned and judicious a Divine, as most our Nation hath bred, in his excellent (though little).

Secondly, it is by most suspected. Thirdly, it is by many held utterly unlawfull: Can then (saith he) the enjoyning of such a thing be ought else but abuse? Or can the refusall of communion here, be thought any other thing then duty? Here, or upon the like occasion, to separate, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure bring personal trouble or danger (against which it concerns any honest man to have <hi>pectus praeparatum</hi>); fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther harm it cannot do, so that in these cases you cannot be to seek what to think, or what you have to do. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards propounds it as a remedy to prevent Schism, to have all Liturgies and publike forms of service so framed, as that they admit not of particular and private fancies, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain only such things, in which all Christians do agree. For, saith he, consider of all the Liturgies that are, and ever have been, and remove from them whatever is scandalous to any party, and leave nothing but what all agree on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the evil shall be, that the publike service and honour of God shall no wayes suffer: Whereas, to load our publike forms, with the private fancies upon which we differ, is the most soveraign way to perpetuate Schism unto the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100525:75"/>
Worlds end. Prayer, Confession, Thanksgiving, Reading of Scriptures in the plainest and simplest manner, were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough to furnish out a sufficient Liturgy, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either of private Opinion, or of Church Pomp, of Garments or prescribed Gestures, of Imagenary, of Musick, of matter concerning the dead, of many Superfluities, which creep into the Church, under the name of Order and Decency, did interpose it self. To charge Churches and Liturgies with things unnecessary, was the first beginning of all Superstition; and when scruple of conscience began to be made or pretended, then Schism began to break in; if the special Guides and Fathers of the Church, would be a little sparing of incumbring Churches with Superfluities, or not over-rigid, either in reviving obsolete customes, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing new, there would be far less cause of Schism or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition; and all the inconvenience were likely to ensue, would be but this, they should in so doing yield a little to the imbecillity of their inferiours, a thing which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would never have refused to do: mean while, wheresoever false or suspected Opinions are made a piece of Church-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, he that separates is not the Schismatick; for it is alike unlawful, to make profession of known or suspected falshood, as to put in practice unlawful or suspected actions.</q>

Were we so happy but to take off things granted unnecessary by all, and suspected by many, and judged unlawful by some; and to make nothing the bonds of our Communion but what Christ hath done, <hi>viz.</hi> one Faith, one Baptism, &amp;c. Allowing a liberty for matters of indifferency, and bearing with the weakeness of those who cannot bear things which others account lawfull, we might indeed be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to a true Primitive luster far sooner, then by furbishing up some antiquated ceremonies, which can derive their pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree no higher, then from some ancient Custome and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God will one day convince men, that the Unnion of the Church lies more in the Unity of Faith and Affection, then in

uniformity of doubtful Rites and Ceremonies. The bond of Church-communion should be somthing common to strong and weak Christians, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith of the rule of faith, that it is <hi>pusillis magnis<expan>

And for publick forms of Divine Service, such of all things certainly should be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, as to be the least subject to any scruple from any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever; being on purpose composed for the declaring mens unity and consent in their publick worship: and those who are the most addicted to any one form, can never plead it unlawful to amend it; whereas others may, that it is not lawful or convenient at least, to use it without such alterations. And therefore, were there that spirit of mutual condescention, which was most certainly in <hi>Ecclesiâ primo-primitivâ,</hi> as <hi>Gratian</hi> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where speaks, in the first and truly primitive Church in the Apostles time; our breaches as to this thing too, might soon be closed up, and the voice of Schism be heard among us no more. It argued very much the prudence and temper of the French-Churches, in composing their publick forms of prayer, that they were so far from inserting any thing controversiall into them, that <hi>Amyraldus</hi> tels us, the Papists themselves<note place="margin">
                        <hi>De secess. ab Eccl.

The same temper was used by our Reformers in the composing our Liturgy, in reference to the Papists, to whom they had then an especial eye, as being the only party then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, whom they desired to draw into their communion, by coming as near them as they well and safely could: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly those Holy men, who did seek by any means to draw in others, at such a distance from their principles as the Papists were, did never intend by what they did for that end, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any truly tender consciences from their Communion. That which they laid as a bait for them, was never intended by them as a hook for those of their own profession, But the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100525:76"/>
same or greater reason which made them seek so much at that time (before the rent between the Papists and us was grown to that height it is now at; they being then in hopes by a fair complyance to have brought the whole Kingdom to joyn with them) I say the same reason which at that time made them yield so far to them then, would now have perswaded them to alter and lay aside those things which yield matter of offence, to any of the same profession with themselves now. For surely none will be so uncharitable toward those of his own professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as not to think there is as much reason to yield in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with them, as with the Papists. And it cannot but be looked upon as a Token of Gods severe displeasure against us, if any, though unreasonable Proposals of Peace between us and the Papists should meet with such entertainment among many; and yet any fair Offers of Union and Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among our selves, be so coldly embraced and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far shewed how far the Obligation to keep in<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> a Church Society doth reach to the several Members of it: I now proceed to shew what way the light of nature directs men to, for the quieting and composing any differences which may arise in such a Society tending to break the Peace of it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the particular wayes directed to by the Law of Nature, for ending Controversies in the Church, I shall lay down some things by way of caution, for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of what is already spoken, lest I should be thought, instead of pleading for peace, to leave a door open for an universal liberty, and so pave a new cawse-way towards <hi>Babel. First,</hi> That though it be lawful not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to unlawful or suspected practises in a Church: yet it is not therefore lawful to erect new Churches. For all other essentials supposed in a Church, a meer requiring conformity in some suspected rites, doth not make it to be no true or sound Church, as to other things, from which it is lawful to make a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal divorce and separation. A total separation is, when a new and distinct society for worship is entered into, under distinct and peculiar officers governing by Laws and Church-rules different from that form which they separate from. This I do not assert to be therefore lawfull, because some things are required,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100525:77"/>
which mens consciences are unsatisfied in: unless others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to eject and cast them wholly out of communion on that account, in which case their separation is necessary, and their Schism unavoidable. <hi>Secondly,</hi> therefore I assert, that as to things in the judgement of the Primitive and Reformed Churches left undetermined by the Law of God, and in matters of meer order and decency, and wholly as to the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, every one notwithstanding what his private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be of them, is bound for the Peace of the Church of God to submit to the determination of the lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church. And this is that power of ending Controversies, which I suppose to be lodged in a Church-Society; not such a one as whereto every man is bound to conform his private judgement; but whereto every private person is bound to submit in Order to the Churches Peace. That is, that in any Controversies arising in a Church, there is such a power supposed, that may give such an authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Decision of the controversie in which both parties are bound to acquiesce, so as to act nothing contrary to that Decision. For as it is supposed that in all Contracts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements for mutuall Society, men are content to part with their own Liberties for the good of the whole: so likewise to part with the Authority of their own judgements, and to submit to the Determination of things by the Rulers of the Society constituted by them. For there must be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made between the <hi>Liberty and freedom</hi> of a mans own judgment, and the <hi>Authority</hi> of it: for supposing men out of all Society, every man hath both; but Societies being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and Contracts made, though men can never part with the freedom of their Judgements (Men not having <hi>a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potical power</hi> over their own understandings) yet they must part with the Authority of their Judgements; <hi>i. e.</hi> in matters concerning the Government of the Society, they must be ruled by Persons in Authority over them. Else there can be nothing imagined but confusion, and disorder, in stead of Peace and Unity in every civil State and Society. The case is the same in a religious Society too, in which men must be supposed to part with the Authority of their own judgements in matters concerning the Government of the Church, and to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100525:77"/>
submit to what is constituted and appointed by those who are intrusted with the care and welfare of it. Else it is impossible there should be Unity and Peace in a Church considered as a Society; which is as much as to say, there neither is, nor can be such a Society. And that God hath commanded that which is Naturally impossible; I mean, freedom from divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Unity and Peace of his Church: Which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from hence, because it can never be expected that all men should be exactly of one mind: Either then men retaining their private apprehensions, are bound to acquiesce in what is publikely determined, or there is a necessity of perpetuall confusions in the Church of God. For the main inlet of all disturbances and divisions in the Church, is from hence that Men consider themselves absolutely, and not as Members of a governed Society, and so that they may follow their own own private judgements, and are bound so to doe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters belonging to the Government of the Church, and not to acquiesce for the Churches Peace in what is established in Order to the ruling of this so constituted Society, by lawfull Authority.</p>
                  <p>These things premised, the way is now fully cleared for the<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> discovering what wayes are prescribed by the light of Nature for ending controversies in the Church; which will appear to be these two.</p>

So that in every thing requiring special determination, this is to be esteemed the most just and final decision which is done by the major part: For it would be manifestly unjust for the lesser part to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the greater, and therefore by the Law of nature, the greater part hath the right of the whole.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100525:78"/>
in order to that, nature dictates that there ought to be a subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Powers one to another, lest any injury done through corruption or ignorance of the immediate Judges, prove irremediable.

And in order to a redress of wrongs, and ending contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, Nature tells us that Appeals must not be infinite, but there must be some Power, from whence Appeals must not be made: What that should be, must be determined in the same manner that it is in Civils; not that every Controversie in the Church must be determined by an Oecumenical Council, but that it is in the Power of the Supream Magistrate, as Supream head in causes Ecclesiastical, to limit and fix this Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and determine how far it shall go, and no further. The Determination being in order to the Peace of the Church, which Christian Magistrates are bound to look after, and see that causes hang not perpetually without Decision: And so we find the Christian Emperours constituting to whom Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals should be made, and where they should be fixed, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi>

                     </gap>, it is so hotly pleaded, that Christ hath given every particular Congregation a Power over its own Members, to determine controversies arising be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: but, that if one, or many of these particular Congregations should erre, or break the Rule, he hath left no power Authoritatively to decide what should be done in such cases. Can we conceive that Christ should provide more for the Cases of particular Persons, then of particular Churches? And that he should give Authority for Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining one, and not the other? Is there any more coactive Power given by any to Synods, or greater Officers, then there is by them to particular Churches? which power is onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative as to the Rule, though Authoritative as to persons where-ever it is lodged. Is there not more danger to Gods People, by the scandals of Churches, then Persons? Or did Christs Power of governing his People reach to them onely as particular Congregations? Doth not this too strongly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Pars Donati?</hi> only the <hi>Meridies</hi> must be rendred a particular Congregationall Church, where Christ causeth his Flock to rest?

                     </gap>; and the Original of this mistake, is, that the Churches we read of first Planted in Scripture, were onely particular Congregations; and therefore there is no proper Church-power beyond them, or above them. I meddle not with the Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For what a strange shortness of Discourse is it to Argue thus; If when there was but one Congregation, that Congregation had all Power within its self; then when there are more particular congregations, it must be so; and yet this is the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all those Kingdomes of <hi>Yvetos,</hi> as one calls them, those sole self-governing congregations. When there was but one congregation in a Church, it was necessary if it had any Church-power, that it must be lodged in that one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But when this congregation was multiplyed into many more, is it not as necessary for their mutual Government, there should be a common power governing them together, as a joynt-society? Besides, the first congregational Church in the New Testament, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> could be no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Organical Church; for it had many, if not all, Universall Officers in it; and if they were the fixed Pastours of that Church, they could not, according to the Principles of those who thus speak, Preach to any other congregation but their own, by vertue of their Office: And so, either their Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Office and Commission must be destroyed, if they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were Pastors of particular Organical Churches; or if their Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Office be asserted, their Pastorship of particular Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Churches is destroyed by their own Principles, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssert, that the Pastor of a Church can do no Pastorall Office out. of his own congregation. The case is the same, as to other Churches planted by the Apostles, and govern'd by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; which two, as far as I can find in the New Testament, were of an equal extent; <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Churches planted by Apostles, were chiefly governed by themselves, though they had subordinate officers under them. These first Churches then were not such particular Organized Churches, but they were as the <hi>first matter</hi> of many congregations to be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated out of them; which after made one Society, consisting
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100525:80"/>
of those several congregations imbodyed together, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by one common Government. As in a Colledge, every Tutor hath his own Pupils, wich he rules; and if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose but one Tutor at first in the Colledge, with his Pupils, all the power, both common to the Society, and peculiar to his Flock, is joyned together; but when there are many more Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, having Pupils under their charge, all these, for their better ordering as a Society, must be governed by the common Government of the Colledge, to which the particular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every Tutor is and must be subordinate: But this will be more fully made appear in the Original of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It is far more evident, that all Civil power lay at first in <hi>Adam</hi> and his Family, and afterwards in particular Families, than that all Church-power lay in particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations at first. We may then with as good Reason say, that there is no lawfull civil: Government now, but that of particular Families; and that no Nationall Government hath any right or power over particular Families, because Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies had once all civil Power within themselves; as because it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Let them shew then, how any Government in the State is lawfull, when Families had the first power, and by what right now those Families are subordinate to the civill Magistrate, and what necessity there is for it; and by the very same Reasons will we shew the lawfulness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Government in the Church over many Congregations, and that those are by the same right, and upon the same necessity, to subordinate themselves to the Government of the Church, considere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> a Society taking in many particular Congregations. The Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel runs on further and clearer still: For as the heads of the severall Families after the Flood, had the command over all dwelling under their Roofs, while they remained in one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and when that increased into more, there power was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over them too; which was the first Original of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in the World: So the Planters of the first Churches,

                     <p>The fifth thing dictated by the Law of Nature, That all that are admitted into this Society, must consent to be governed by the Lawes and Rules of it. Civil Societies founded upon mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al consent; express in the first entrance, implicite in others born under societies actually formed. Consent as to a Church necessary, the manner of Consent determined by Christ by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and Profession. Implicite Consent supposed in all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; explicite, declared by challenging the priviledges, and observing the duties of the Covenant. Explicite by express owning the Gospel when adult, very usefull for recovering the credit of Christianity. The Discipline of the Primitive Church cleared from <hi>Origen, Iustin Martyr, Pliny, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> The necessary requisites of Church Membership, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther positive signs of Grace: Explicite Covenant, how far necessary; not the formal Constitution of a Church, * proved by several Arguments.</p>

                  <p>THe Law of Nature dictates, <hi>That all who are admitted into</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>this Society, must consent to be governed by the Laws and Rules of that Society, according to its Constitution.</hi> For none can be looked upon as a Member of a Society, but such a one as submits to the Rules and Laws of the Society, as constituted at the time of his entrance into it. That all civil Societies are founded upon voluntary consent and agreement of parties, and do depend upon Contracts and Covenants made between them, is evident to any that consider that men are not bound by the Law of Nature to associate themselves with any but whom they shall judge fit; that Dominion and Propriety was
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100525:81"/>
introduced by free consent of men: and so there must be Laws and Bonds fit, agreement made, and submission acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to those Lawes, else Men might plead their Naturall Right and Freedom still, which would be destructive to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature of these Societies. When men then did first part with their natural Liberties, two things were necessary in the most express terms to be declared: First, a free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary consent to part with so much of their Natural Rights as was not consistent with the well being of the Society: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a free submission to all Laws, which should be agreed upon at their entrance into Society, or afterwards as they see cause. But when Societies were already entred, and Children born under them, no such express consent was required in them, being bound by vertue of the Protection they find from Authority to submit to it, and an implicite consent is supposed in all such as are born under that Authority. But for their more full understanding of this Obligation of theirs, and to lay the greater tye of Obedience upon them, when they come to understanding, it hath been conceived very requisite by most States to have an explicite Declaration of their consent, either by some formal Oath of Allegiance, or some other way suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expressing their fidelity, in standing to the Covenants long since supposed to be made. To apply this now to the Church.</p>
                  <p>We have all along hitherto considered the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as a Society or Corporation which was necessary in order to our discovering what is in it from the light of nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Positive Laws.</p>

But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of this Society was first himself, and he appointed what Orders, Rules, and Lawes should govern this Society; and wherein he hath determined any thing, we are bound to look upon that, as necessary to the maintaining of that Society which is built upon his Constitution of it. And in many of those Orders which Christ hath settled in his Church, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them is in the Law of nature; but the particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100525:82"/>
of the manner of them is from himself. Thus it is in the case we now are upon; Nature requires that every one entring into a Society, should consent to the Rules of it. Our Saviour hath determined how this Consent should be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>viz.</hi> by receiving Baptism from those who have the power to dispense it: which is the federal Rite whereby our consent is expressed to own all the Laws and submit to them, whereby this Society is governed: Which at the first entring of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Society of the Church was requisite to be done by the express and explicite consent of the parties themselves, being of sufficient capacity to declare it, but the Covenant being once entred into by themselves, not onely in their own name, but in the name of their Posterity (a thing implyed in all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 15.

                  <p>The one great cause of the great flourishing of Religion in<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the Primitive times, was certainly the strictness used by them in their admission of members into Church-Societies, which is fully described by <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus,</hi> who tells us they did <gap reason="foreign">

And we find by <hi>Pliny,</hi> that when the <hi>hetaeriae</hi> were forbidden, he brought the Christians in under that Law; the ground of those Societies was onely a mutual compact and agreement among the persons of it: Such as among the Essens of the Jewes, and the Schools of Philosophers among the Greeks. <hi>Iosephus</hi> mentions the <gap reason="foreign">

Thus I acknowledge it to be in Christianity, that there must be such a supposed contract or voluntary consent in the persons engaged in such Societies. But with this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable difference, that although there must be a consent in both, yet the one is wholly free, as to any pre-engagement or obligation to it, as well as to the act its self; but in religious soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, though the Act of consent be free, yet there is an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Obligation upon men, binding them to this volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consent. The want of the understanding this Difference, is the very Foundation of that Opinion men call <hi>Erastianism;</hi> For the followers of <hi>Erastus,</hi> when they finde that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did act <hi>ex confoederatâ disciplinâ,</hi> they presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all Church-power lay onely in mutuall consent.

                  <p>I confesse, when persons are entred into a visible Church-So<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> ciety by Baptism, if they will own that profession they were baptized into, and are not guilty either of plain ignorance of it, or manifest scandall, and demand as their right the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Gospel; I see not by what power they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. If we fix not in a serious visible prosession as the ground of giving right, but require positive evidences of grace in every one to be admitted to Ordinances as the only thing giving right, for my part, setting aside the many inconveniences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which attend that in reference to the persons to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I see not how with a safe and good conscience Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can be administred by any. My reason is this: Every one, especially a Minister, in that case ought to proceed upon certain grounds that the person admitted hath right to the Ordinance to be administred; but if positive signs of grace be required, a mans conscience cannot proceed upon any certainty, without infallible knowledge of anothers spiritual state, which I suppose none will pretend to. My meaning is, that which gives right, must be something evident to the person admitting into it, if it be his duty to enquire after it; but if only positive signs of grace be looked on, as giving right, the ground of right can never be so evident to another person, as to proceed with a good conscience, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a full perswasion of another right to the administration of any Ordinance to him. If it be said, that these are required only as tokens of a true visible professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is that which gives the right; I reply, Our knowledge of, and assent to the conclusion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can be no stronger, nor more certain then to the premisses from when<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> it is inferred; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true profession gives right, and our knowledge of that proceeds upon our knowledge of the work of grace, we are left at the same uncertainty we were at before. But if we say, that an outward profession of the Gospel (where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rendring men uncapable of owning it, which is ignorance, nor declaring they do not own it, which is s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>andall) is that which gives a visible right to the Ordinances of the Church as visible, we have something to fix our selves upon, and to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom a perswasion of the right of persons to Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:100525:84"/>Christ when he instituted Churches, did institute them as visible Societies, that is, to have marks whereby to be known and distinguished, as other Societies in the world are; now that which puts a difference between this and other Societies, is an open profession of Christianity, which profession is looked upon as the outward expression of the internal consent of the soul to the Doctrine and Laws of the Gospel. Which outward evidence of consent, where there is nothing evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly oppugning it, is that which the Church of God in admission of visible members is to proceed upon. I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where find that ever Christ or his Apostles in making disciples, or admitting to Church-membership, did exact any more then a professed willingnesse to adhere to the Doctrine which they preached; nor that they refused any who did declare their desire to joyn with them. An owning Christianity is all we read of antecedent to admission of Church-members. And if any thing else be further required as necessary, we must either say, the Word of God is defective in institutions of necessity to the Church, which I suppose the assertors of it will not be so inconsistent to their own principles, as to do; or else must produce, where any thing further is required by the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>By this we may see what to answer those who require an<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> explicite Covenant from all members of the Church, as that which gives the form and being to a Church. If they mean only in the first constitution of a visible Church, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse owning of the Gospel-covenant; there is none will deny that to be necessary to make one a member of the visible Church of Christ. If they further mean, that there must be a real confederation between those who joyn together in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Ordinances in order to their being a Church, I know none will question it that know what it is that makes a Society to be so; which is such a real confederation with one another: If they mean further, that though Christians be bound by vertue of their Gospel-covenant to joyn with some Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Society, yet not being determined by Scripture to what particular Church they should joyn; therefore for Christians better understanding what their mutuall duty is to one another; and who that Pastor is to whom they owe the relation of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100525:84"/>
that there should be some significant declaration either by words or actions of their willingnesse to joyn with such a particular Society in Gospel-Ordinances; I shall grant this to be necessary too. But if beyond this their meaning be, that a formal explicite covenant be absolutely necessary to make any one a member of a Church, I see no reason for it. For,</p>
                  <p>1. If there may be a real confederation without this; then this is not necessary; but there may be a real confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration without this explicite covenant: as appears in those Churches of Christ, both in the primitive times, and since the Reformation, who have never used it, which none I suppose who maintain this opinion will deny to have been true visible Churches of Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Gospel-covenant entred into by any gives a right to Gospel-Ordinances by its self, then an explicite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is not that which makes one a member of a Church; but the Gospel-covenant gives that right to all Gospel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. If by Baptism, the person baptized have a legal title to all Gospel-Ordinances, then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> appears, in that they are admitted Church-members by Baptism; and how can any be a Member of a Church, and not have right to all Ordinances in it, supposing capacity to receive them? A right once received, continues till it be forfeited, especially when it is such a right as is not limited to any particular priviledges, but to all the priviledges of that Society into which they are entred.</p>
                  <p>3. The reality of consent may be sufficiently manifested without an explicite covenant; as in the joyning with those who are under the same profession in the common acts of the Society and acceptance of, and submission to the Rulers of that Society, which implicitely is that Covenant which they would have expressed; and actions in this case, are as declarative and significative as words.</p>
                  <p>4. If a Church may cease to be a true Church, without explicite disowning such a Covenant, then it is not explicite covenanting which makes a Church; but a Church may cease to be a true Church without explicite disowning it; as in case of universall corruption, as to Word and Sacraments; as in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that still owns her self for a Church.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100525:85"/>
The ground of the consequence, is from the parity of reason as to contraries.</p>
                  <p>But though I see no reason at all, why an explicite Covenant<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> should be so necessary to a Church, that we cannot suppose a true Church without it; yet I no wayes deny the lawfulnesse or expediency, in many cases, of having a personal profession from all baptized in Infancy, when they come to age (which we may, if we please, call <hi>Confirmation</hi>) and the necessity of of desiring admission, in order to participation of all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: which desire of admission, doth necessarily imply mens consenting to the Laws of that Society, and walking according to the duties of it; and so they are <hi>consequentially</hi> and <hi>virtually,</hi> though not <hi>expresly</hi> and <hi>formally,</hi> bound to all the duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them in that relation. When Churches are over-run with loosnesse, ignorance, and prophanesse, or when Christians are under persecution, an externall profession of the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant, and declaring their owning the Society they are entred into, and submitting to the Laws of it, may be, if not wholly necessary, yet very usefull and expedient: And indeed, at all times we see people understand so little of their duty or engagements, and are so hardly brought under the exercise of Gospel-discipline, that an open profession of their submission to the Rules of the Gospel, seems the most likely way to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the practise, Power, and purity of Religion: But of this much is spoken by others lately, and therefore I supersede. From all this we see, that every Society implying a joyning together in some common duties, Nature tells us there must be a reall consenting together, explicite, or implicite in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who enter into such a Society.</p>

                  <p>These things being thus in general considered, come we<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> now to apply it to the Church considered as a Society. That it hath peculiar Laws to be governed by, appears by the distinct nature, end, and design of the constitution of it; which is not to preserve any outward Rights, but to maintain and keep up a religious Society for the service of God; and therefore the penall sanctions of these Laws cannot properly be any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or pecuniary mulct, but somewhat answerable to the nature of the Society. It must be then somewhat which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes the deprivation of that which is the chiefest benefit of that Society. The benefits of it are the priviledges and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100525:86"/>
which men enjoy by thus associating themselves for so high an employment: That punishment then must be the loss of those priviledges which the Corporation enjoyes, which must be by exclusion of the offending person from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Society. Hence we see it is evident, that which we call Excommunication is the greatest penalty which the Church, as a Society, can inflict upon the members of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as such. And hence it is likewise clear, that as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Church is distinct from others, the Laws, ends, Governours of a different nature; so the punishment must be a punishment distinct from civill, and ordained wholly in order to the peculiar ends of this Society; which they do not well consider, who deny any such power as that of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication peculiar to the Church, which is as much as to deny that the Laws whereby the Church is ruled, are different from the civil Laws, or the end of this Society from the ends of civil Societies: for the punishment must be proportioned to the Laws, and referred immediately to its proper ends. It were no wayes difficult to answer the pretences brought against this: For although I acknowledge a subordination of this religious Society to the Supream Authority in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and that the Rules concerning the Government of the Society in common must have their sanction from thence; yet this no wayes implyes but it may have its peculiar penalties and power to inflict them, any more then any Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Tradesmen have not power to exclude any from their Company for breaking the Rules of the Company, because they are subordinate to the Supream Authority: or any Colledge to expell any from thence, for breaking the locall Statutes of it, which are distinct from the Common-Laws. Nor is it any argument, that because Christians had mutuall confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in times of persecution for the exercise of censures, therefore these censures were only arbitrary and humane; unless it be proved, that it was not a duty in them so to confederate &amp; joyn together, nor was there any antecedent obligation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict those censures upon offenders. Much lesse, thirdly, because their jurisdiction is not civil and coactive, therefore they have none at all; which is as much as to say, the Laws of Scripture are not our common-Laws, therefore they are none at all.</p>

                  <p>The practice of Excommunication among the Jews is not questioned by any, but the right ground and orignall of that practice, with the effect and extent of it. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to have been only taken up among the Jews, after the power of capitall punishments was taken from them; and that it was used by them, wholly upon a civill account, not extending to the exclusion of men from their worship in the Temple or Synagogues, but only to be a note of insamy upon offending persons. This opinion though entertained by persons of much skill and learning in the Jewish antiquities, yet carries not that evidence with it to gain my assent to it. For first, the causes of excommunication were not such as were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by their Law to deserve such civil punishments as might have been inflicted by them upon offenders, nor were they generally matters of a civill nature, but matters of offence and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100525:87"/>
scandall, as will appear to any that shall peruse the twenty four causes of Excommunication, related out of the Jewish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Ioh. Coch.</hi> Such were <hi>the neglecting the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Scribes, the vain pronouncing the Name of God, bearing witness against a Iew before Heathen tribunals, doing</hi>

                     <hi>any common work in the afternoon of the day before the Passover,</hi> with others of a like Nature. If Excommunication had been then taken up among them onely <hi>ex confoederatâ disciplinâ,</hi> to supply the defect of civil Judicatories, at least all Capitall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders must have lain under the Sentence of Excommunication. But here we read not of any being Excommunicated for those, but for other lesser matters, which were looked upon as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of scandal among them: and though some of them were matters of civil injuries, yet it follows not that men were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for them as such, but for the scandall which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them. As, in the Christian Church, men are Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for matters which are punishable by the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, but not under that notion, but as they are offences to that Christian Society which they live among. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that Excommunication was not a meer civil Penalty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the increasing or abatement of that Penalty did depend upon the person's Repentance, and desire of Absolution. Now civil Penalties do not regard the intention and mind of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but the quality and desert of the Action; the Reason is, because Humane Lawes do respect immediately <hi>actionem ipsam,</hi> and not <hi>animum agentis,</hi> unless it be onely so far as the mind hath influence upon the Action. But now it is otherwise in such Lawes which take immediate Notice of the intention of the minde, and onely of outward Actions as they are signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative and expressive of the inward intention: for in these, though the ground of proceeding to Penalties be from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of the outward Action, yet that outward Action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subject to Penalty, as expressive of the minds intention; where there may be sufficient evidence given of the Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Uprightness of the Intention afterwards, there may be proportionably a Relaxation of the penalty; because the end of the Penalty inflicted was not to be an Act of Justice excluded from Mercy in the end of Administration as in Civil Judicatories, but an Act of Justice whose end was
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100525:88"/>
mercy, that is, the regaining and recovering the offenders soul from sin, by inflicting such a penalty upon him, as might humble him under the sense of it. Hence appears the great reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse of their proceedings in the managery of Discipline in the primitive times, who did not fix a certain time as a standing Law for all offenders, but did encrease, or lessen both the time and weight of their penance, according to the evidences given of their submission and true repentance for their miscarriages.

From whence it is evident that this was an Ecclesiasticall censure, and not meerly Civill, because the main end of it was not satisfaction to the Law, but the repentance of the person who lay under the fault; and according to the evidence given of it, the penalty was relaxed or encreased, which argument not yet taken notice of nor improved by Writers on this subject, seems to make the case clear, that excommunication among the Jews was not a meer <hi>out-lawry,</hi> as some conceive it to have been.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I argue, If it was not the breach of the Law, but the<note place="margin">§, 5.</note> publikeness of the offence, or the scandall of it which was the ground of excommunication; then it was not a meer civil penalty, but an Ecclesiasticall censure: for civill penalties do

Another thing which hath been, I believe a great ground of mistaking in this matter, is, that excluding from the civill Society among them was alwayes consequent upon Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; the Reason whereof was, because the Church and Common-wealth were not distinct among the Jews; and the same persons who took care of Sacred, did likewise of Civil things (there being no distinct <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> among them as some imagine:) but from hence it no wayes follows, but their Excommunication might be an exclusion from Sacred Worship as well as Civil Society. However, were it as they pretend, that

Thus we see the Church of the Jews had this power among them; and for the Christian Church, the practice of Discipline upon offenders was never questioned, though the right hath been; so that from hence we gather, in that it hath been the practice of Societies consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the Worship of God, to call offenders to an account for their offences, and if upon examination they be found guilty, to exclude them their Society; that it is a dictate of the Law of Nature, That every offender against the Laws of a Society must give an account of his actions to the Rulers of it, and submit to the Censures inflicted on him by them.

                     <p>The other ground of Divine Right considered, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods positive Laws; which imply a certain knowledge of Gods intention to bind men perpetually. As to which, the Arguments drawn from Tradition, and the practice of the Church in after-ages, proved invalid by several arguments. In order to a right stating the Question, some Concessions laid down. First, That there must be some form of Government in the Church. The notion of a Church explained: whether it belongs only to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, which are manifested not to be of Gods primary intention, but for our necessity. Evidence for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches under the Gospel. A National Church-Government necessary.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Now come to the second way, whereby any<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> thing comes to be of unalterable Divine Right, which is, by the positive Laws of God, which do bind universally to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. In the entrance into this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, it is necessary to lay down the ways, whereby we find out a Divine posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law determining an unalterable Obligation: which must be either by express words of Scripture, or by some other certain way, whereby to gather from thence, that it was Gods intention to bind men. For the main thing requisite to make a standing universal positive Law, is Gods declaring his mind, that the thing enquired into, should unalterably bind men to the practice of it. Now whatever doth sufficiently manifest Gods intention, is a <hi>medium</hi> to find out such a Law by, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100525:90"/>
else: But it must be such a manifestation as gives a mans mind sufficient evidence and testimony whereon to build a true, certain, and divine assent to the thing, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: So that whatsoever binds the conscience as a Law, must first be entertained by the understanding as a matter of faith; not as it imports something meerly <hi>doctrinall</hi> and <hi>dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall,</hi> but as it implyes the <hi>matter</hi> of a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and the object of an assent upon the credibility of a <hi>Testimony.</hi> For God having the only immediate authority over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men, nothing can bind immediately the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but a Divine Law, neither can any thing bind as such, but what the understanding assents unto, as revealed by God himself. Now the Word of God being the only <hi>Codex</hi> and <hi>Digests</hi> of Divine Laws, whatever Law we look for, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be found there in express terms, or at least so couched therein, that every one by the exercise of his understanding, may by a certain and easie collection, gather the universall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the thing enquired after. In this case then, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is not immediately founded upon a Divine <hi>Testimony,</hi> cannot be made use of as a <hi>Medium</hi> to infer an universally binding Law by: So that all Traditions and Historicall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will be unserviceable to us, when we enquire into Gods intentions in binding mens consciences. Matters of fact, and meer Apostolicall practice, may I freely grant, receive much light from the Records of succeeding ages; but they can never give a mans understanding sufficient ground to inferr any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, arising from those facts attested to be the practice or Records of succeeding ages.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>first,</hi> The foundation and ground of our assent in this<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> case, is not the bare testimony of Antiquity; but the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which we have, either that their practice did not vary from what was Apostolicall; or in their Writings, that they could not mistake concerning what they deliver unto us: And therefore those who would inferr the necessary obligation of men to any form of Government, because that was practised by the Apostles, and then prove the Apostolicall practice from that of the ages succeeding, or from their Writings, must first of all prove, that what was done then, was certainly the Apostles practice, and so prove the same thing by its self, or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100525:91"/>
that it was impossible they should vary from it, or that they should mistake in judging of it: For here something more is required then a meer matter of fact, in which I confess their nearnesse to the Apostles times doth give them an advantage above the ages following, to discern what it was; but such a practice is required, as inferrs an universall obligation upon all places, times, and persons. Therefore these things must be manifested, <hi>that such things were unquestionably the practice of those ages and persons; that their practice was the same with the Apostles; that what they did, was not from any prudential motives, but by vertue of a Law which did bind them to that practice.</hi> Which things are easily passed over by the most eager Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the controversie about Church-Government, but how necessary they are to be proved before any form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be asserted, so necessary, that without it there can be no true Church, any weak understanding may discern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Supposing that Apostolicall practice be sufficiently attested by the following ages, yet unless it be cleared from Scripture, that it was Gods intention that the Apostles actions should continually bind the Church, there can be nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that doth concern us in point of Conscience. I say, that though the matter of fact be evidenced by Posterity, yet the obligatory nature of that fact must depend on Scripture: and the Apostles intentions must not be built upon mens bare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urmises, nor upon after-practices, especially if different from the constitution of things during the Apostles times. And here those have somewhat whereon to exercise their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who assert an obligation upon men to any form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by vertue of an Apostolicall practice, which must of necessity suppose a different state of things from what they were when the Apostles first established Governours over Churches. As how those who were appointed Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours over particular Congregations by the Apostles, come to be by vertue of that Ordination, Governours over many Congregations of like nature and extent with that over which they were set: And whether, if it were the Apostles intention that such Governours should be alwayes in the Church, is it not necessary that that intention of theirs be declared by a standing Law, that such there must be; for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100525:91"/>
here matter of fact and practice can be no evidence, when it is supposed to be different from the constitution of Churches afterward: But of this more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Supposing any form of Government in its self necessary, and that necessity not determined by a Law in the Word of God, the Scripture is thereby apparently argued to be insufficient for its end; for then <hi>deficit in necessariis;</hi> some things are necessary for the Church of God which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is wholly silent in. I say not, that every thing about Church-Government must be written in Scripture; but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing any one form necessary, it must be there commanded, or the Scripture is an imperfect Rule, which contains not all things necessary by way of Precept: For there can be no other necessity universall, but either by way of <hi>means to an end,</hi> or by way of <hi>Divine Command:</hi> I know none will say, that any particular form of Government is necessary abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, by way of means to an end; for certainly, supposing no obligation from Scripture, Government by an equality of power in the Officers of the Church, or by superiority of one order above another, are indifferent in order to the generall ends of Government, and one not more necessary then the other. If any one form then be necessary, it must be by that of command; and if there be a command universally binding, whose footsteps cannot be traced in the Word of God, how can the Scriptures be a perfect Rule, if it fails in determining binding Laws? So that we must, if we own the Scriptures sufficiency as a binding Rule, appeal to that about any thing pleaded as necessary, by vertue of any Divine command: and if such a Law cannot be met with in Scripture, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the case in hand one way or other by way of necessary obligation, I have ground to look upon that which is thus left undetermined by Gods positive Laws, to be a matter of Christian-liberty; and that neither part is to be looked upon as necessary for the Church of God, as exclusive of the other.</p>
                  <p>This I suppose is the case, as to particular forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> in the Church of God: but that I may not only suppose but prove it, I now come to the stating of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, which if ever necessary to be done any where, it is in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100525:92"/>
the Controversie of Church-Government, the most of mens heats in this matter arising from want of right understanding the thing in question between them. In the stating the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, I shall proceed by degrees, and shew how far we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any thing belonging to Government in the Church to be of an unalterable Divine Right. <hi>First,</hi> That there must be a form of Government in the Church of God, is necessary by vertue, not only of that Law of Nature which provides for the preservation of Societies, but likewise by vertue of that Divine Law, which takes care for the Churches preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in peace and unity. I engage not here in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, Whether a particular Congregation be the first <hi>Political</hi> Church or no; it sufficeth for my purpose, that there are other Churches besides particular Congregations: I mean, not only the <hi>Catholick</hi> visible Church, which is the <hi>first,</hi> not only in <hi>order</hi> of <hi>consideration,</hi> but <hi>nature</hi> too, as a <hi>totum Integrale</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>similar parts</hi> of it, but in respect of all other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall modifications of Churches, from the severall wayes of their combination together. They who define a Church by stated worshipping Congregations, do handsomely beg the thing they desire, by placing that in their definition of a Church, which is the thing in question: which is, Whether there be no other Church but such particular Congregations? Which is as if one should go about to prove, that there were no civil Societies but in particular Corporations, and to prove it, should give such a definition of civill Society, that it is, A company of men joyned together in a Corporation, for the preservation of their Rights and Priviledges, under the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of such a place. It must be first proved, that no other company of men can be call'd a civill Society besides a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and so that no other society of men joyning together in the profession of the true Religion, can be call'd a Church, but such as joyn in particular Congregations.</p>
                  <p>To which purpose it is very observable, That particular<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> Congregations are not <hi>de primariâ intentione divinâ;</hi> for if the whole world could joyn together in the publike Worship of God, no doubt that would be most properly a Church, but particular Congregations are only accidental, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Gods intention of having a Church, because of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100525:92"/>
impossibility of all mens joyning together for the convenient distribution of Church-priviledges, and administration of Gospel-Ordinances. For it is evident, that the Priviledges and Ordinances, do immediately and primarily belong to the Catholick visible Church, in which Christ to that end hath set Officers, as the Apostle clearly expresseth, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 28. (for how Apostles should be set as Officers over particular Congregations, whose Commission extended to the whole World, is, I think, somewhat hard to understand) but for the more convenient participation of Priviledges and Ordinances, particular Congregations are necessary: This will be best il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by Examples. We read that (<hi>Esther</hi> 1. 3.) King <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuerus</hi> made a feast for all his Princes and Servants: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the King did equally respect them all as a Body in the feasting of them, and did bestow his entertainment upon them all as considered together; but by reason of the great multitude of them, it was impossible that they should all be feasted together in the same Room; and therefore for more convenient participation of the Kings bounty, it was necessary to divide themselves into particular companies, and to asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate as many as conveniently could in order to that end. So it is in the Church, Christ in donation of priviledges equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respects the whole Church; but because men cannot all meet together to participate of these priviledges, a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular distribution was necessary for that end. But a clearer example of this kind we have yet in Scripture, which is <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 39. in our Saviours feeding the multitude with five loaves and two fishes; where we see our Saviours <hi>primary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> was to feed the whole multitude; but for their more convenient partaking of this food, our Saviour commands them to sit down <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, according to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braism</hi> of ingeminating the words, to note the distribution of them, and therefore the Vulg. Lat. renders it <hi>secundum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tubernia,</hi> that is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Camerarius</hi> expounds it, according to so many companies and divisions as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently sit together, as at a Table: Where we plainly see this distribution was only accidentall, as to Christs prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intention of feeding the multitude, but was only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for their own conveniency. Thus the case is evident,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100525:93"/>
as to the Church of God, it is our necessity and conveniency which makes severall Congregations of the Catholike visible Church, and not Gods primary intention, when he bestowed such priviledges upon the Church, that it should be understood of particular Congregations.</p>
                  <p>If then particular Congregations be only accidentall for our<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> conveniency, it evidently follows that the primary notion of a Church, doth not belong to these; nor that these are the first subject of Government which belongs to a Church as such, and not as crumbled into particular Congregations; although the actual exercise of Government be most visible and discernable there; Because the joyning together for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Gospel-Ordinances must be in some particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or other associated together for that end. Where ever then we find the notion of a Church particular, there must be government in that Church; and why a National Society in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into one civil Government, joyning in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christianity, and having a right thereby to participate of Gospel-Ordinances in the convenient distributions of them in particular congregations, should not be called a Church; I confesse I can see no reason. The main thing objected against it, is, that a Church implyes an actual joyning together for participation of all Gospel-Ordinances; but as this, as I said before, is only a begging the Question, so I say now, that actual communion with any particular Congregation, is not absolutely necessary to a member of a Church; for supposing one baptized at Sea, where no setled Congregation is (nor any more Society then that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) yet such a one is thereby a member of the Church of God, though not of any Congregation; so likewise a Church then may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of such as have a right to Ordinances, without the inserting their actual participation of them in fixed Congregations. A particular Church then I would describe thus, That it is, A <hi>society of men joyning together in the visible profession of the true Faith; having a right to, and enjoying among them the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel.</hi> That a whole Nation professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, in which the Ordinances of the Gospel are duly administred in particular Congregations, is such a Society, is plain and evident.

of a Church under the Gospel, we have in the Prophesie of the Conversion of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Assyria</hi> in Gospel-times. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 19. 19, 21, 24, 25. <hi>We have Egypts professing the true Faith, and enjoying Gospel Ordinances, vers.</hi> 19. 21. which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophetical stile are set down under the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of such things as were then in use among the Jewes: <hi>by an Altar in the midst of the Land,</hi> ver. 19. The Altar noting the true worship of God; and being in the midst of the Land, the universal owning of this worship by all the people of the land. God owns them for a Church, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Whom the Lord of hosts shall bless,</hi> saying, <hi>Blessed be Egypt my people.</hi> The very name whereby Israel was called while it was a Church. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Hosea,</hi> 2. 1. And when God unchurched them, it was under this name, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Ye are not my people.</hi> As much then as Israel was a Church when God owned it for his People: so should Egypt be upon their conversion to the Faith of Christ, which was done upon <hi>Marks</hi> preaching at <hi>Alexandria</hi> not long after the death of Christ.</p>
                  <p>This then we have now briefly cleared, that a Nation joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> in profession of Christianity, is a true Church of God: whence it evidently follows, that there must be a Form of Ecclesiastical Government over a Nation as a Church, as well as of Civil Government, over it, as a Society governed by the same Lawes. Therefore some make this necessary to a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note place="margin">Hudson <hi>of the Church</hi> cap. 1. sect. 3.</note> Church, <hi>National Union in one Ecclesiasticall body in the same Community of Ecclesiasticall Government.</hi> For every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety must have its Government belonging to it as such a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and the same Reason that makes Government necessary in any particular Congregation, will make it necessary for all the particular Congregations joyning together in one visible society as a particular National Church. For the unity and peace of that Church, ought much more to be looked after then of any one particular Congregation, in as much as the Peace of all the particular combinations of men for participation of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances doth depend upon, and is comprehended in the Peace of the whole. But though I say from hence that some form of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Government by the subordination of particular Assemblies to the Government of the whole body of them is necessary, yet I am far from asserting the necessity of any one form of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100525:94"/>
that Government, much more, from saying that no Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Church can subsist without one Nationall Officer, as the High-Priest under the Law, or one Nationall place of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as the Temple was. The want of considering of which, <hi>viz</hi> that Nationall Churches may subsist without that Form of them under the Jewes, is doubtless the great Ground of Mens quarrelling against them; but with what Reason, let Men impartially judge. This then we agree, that some from of Government is necessary in every particular Church, and so that Government in the Church of Divine and unalterable Right; and that not onely of particular Congregations, but of all Societies which may be called Churches, whether Provinciall, or Nationall.</p>

                     <hi>SEcondly,</hi> That the Government of the Church ought to be<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> Administred by Officers of Divine appointment, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing I will yield to be of Divine Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Church here, I take not in that latitude which I did in the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, but I take it chiefly here for the Members of the Church, as distinct from Officers, as it is taken in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 22. So that my meaning is, that there must be a standing perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Ministry in the Church of God, whose care and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be, to oversee and Govern the People of God, and to administer Gospel-Ordinances among them, and this is of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100525:94"/>
Divine and perpetuall Right. That Officers were appointed by Christ in the Church for these ends at first, is evident from the direct affirmation of Scripture, <hi>God hath set in the Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8, 11. and other places to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. This being then a thing acknowledged, that they were at first of Divine Institution, and so were appointed by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine positive Law, which herein determines and restrains the Law of Nature (which doth not prescribe the certain quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the persons to govern this Society, nor the instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or admission of them into this employment, <hi>viz</hi> by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.) The only enquiry then left, is, Whether a standing Gospel-ministry be such a positive Law, as is to remain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in the Church, or no? which I shall make appear by those things which I laid down in the entrance of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, as the Notes whereby to know when positive Laws are unalterable.</p>
                  <p>The first was, when the same reason of the command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> still; and what reason is there why Christ should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Officers to rule his Church then, which will not hold now? Did the people of God need Ministers then to be as <hi>Stars</hi> (as they are call'd in Scripture) to lead them unto<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 16.</note> Christ, and do they not as well need them now? Had people<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7. Heb. 2. 3.</note> need of <hi>guides</hi> then, when the doctrine of the Gospel <hi>was confirmed to them by miracles,</hi> and have they not much more now? Must there be some then to <hi>oppose gainsayers,</hi> and must<note place="margin">Titus 1. 9. 2 Tim. 3. 1.</note> they have an absolute liberty of prophecying now, when it is foretold what times of seduction the last shall be? Must there be some then <hi>to rule over their charge, as they that must give an</hi>

                     <hi>of season,</hi> and is there not the same necessity of these things still? Was it not enough then, that there were so many in all Churches that had extraordinary gifts of <hi>tongues, prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

apart and wholly designed for this work? Were Ordinances<note place="margin">Matth 28. 18.</note> only then administred by those whom <hi>Christ commissioned,</hi> and such as derived their authority from them; and what reason is there that men should arrogate and take this imployment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves now? If Christ had so pleased, could he not have left it wholly at liberty for all believers to have gone about preaching the Gospel? or why did he make choice of 12. Apostles chiefly for that work, were it not his Will to have some particularly to dispense the Gospel? and if Christ did then separate some for that work, what Reason is there why that Office should be thrown common now, which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self inclosed by his own appointment?</p>
                  <p>There can be no possible Reason imagined, why a Gospel-Ministry<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> should not continue still, unless it be that Fanatick pretence of a <hi>Seculum Spiritus Sancti, a Dispensation of the Spirit,</hi> which shall evacuate the use of all means of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the use of all Gospel-Ordinances; which pretence is not so Novell as most imagine it to be; for setting aside the <hi>Montanistical spirit</hi> in the Primitive Times, which acted upon Principles much of the same Nature with these we now speak of: The first rise of this <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> was from the <hi>bogs</hi> of Popery, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Orders of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans,</hi> about the middle of the twelfth <hi>Century.</hi> For no sooner did the <hi>Pauperes de Lugduno,</hi> or the <hi>Waldenses</hi> appear, making use of the Word of God to confute the whole Army of Popish Traditions, but they finding themselves worsted at every turn while they disputed that ground, found out a <hi>Stratagem</hi> whereby to recover their own Credit, and to beat their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries quite out of the field.

This Gospel of the Spirit they so much magnified above
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100525:95"/>
the Gospel of Christ, that the same Author relates these words of theirs concerning it; <hi>Quod comparatum ad Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium Christi, tanto plus perfectionis ac dignitatis habet, quantum Sol ad Lunam comparatus, aut ad nucleum testa;</hi> that it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as much as the kernell doth the shell, or the Light of the Sun doth that of the Moon.

                  <p>If there be such a dispensation of the Spirit which takes<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> away the use of Ministry and Ordinances, it did either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence from the time of the effusion of the Spirit upon the Apostles, or some time since. Not then; for even of those who had the most large portion of the Spirit poured upon them, we read that they continued in all Gospel ordinances, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42, and among the chief, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apostles Ministry,</hi> it may be better rendred than <hi>in the Apostles Doctrine:</hi> And which is most observable, the Prophecy of <hi>Ioel</hi> about the Spirit, is then said to be fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 17. Besides, if either that place of <hi>Ioel,</hi> or that of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> cited <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>or the Unction of the Spirit,</hi> 1 John 2. 20, 27. did take away the use of preaching, how did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves understand their meaning, when they were so diligent in preaching and instructing others: <hi>Iohn</hi> writes to those, <hi>to try the Spirits,</hi> of whom he saith, <hi>They have an</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 1. 1 Joh. 2. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Unction to know all things:</hi> and those to whom the Apostle writes, that <hi>they need not teach every one his Neighbour;</hi> of them he saith, <hi>that they had need to be taught the first principles of the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Oracles of God.</hi> And even in that very Chapter where he seems to say, they that are under the New Covenant, need not be taught, he brings that very Speech in as an argument, that the old dispensation of the Law was done away: And so goes <hi>about to teach,</hi> when he seems to <hi>take away the use of it.</hi> These Speeches then must not be understood in their abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and literal sense, but with a reflection upon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with, the state of things in the times wherein those Prophecies were utter'd: For God to heighten the Jews ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the great blessings of the Gospel, doth set<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calvin. in</hi> Joel. 2. 28.</note> them forth under a kind of Hyperbolical expressions, that the dull capacity of the Jews might at least apprehend the just
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100525:96"/>
weight and magnitude of them, which they would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have done. So in that place of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> God to make<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 31.</note> them understand how much the knowledge of the Gospel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that under the Law, doth as it were set it down in this Hyperbolicall way, that it will exceed it as much, as one that needs no teaching at all, doth one that is yet but in his rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of learning. So that the place doth not deny the use of teaching under the Gospel, but because Teaching doth commonly suppose ignorance, to shew the great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge, he doth it in that way, as though the knowledge should be so great, that men should not need be taught in such a way of Rudiments as the Jews were, <hi>viz</hi> by Types and Ceremonies, and such things. We see then no such dispensation was in the Apostles times; for the same Apostle after this in Chapt. 10. 25. bids them <hi>not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Assembling themselves together as some did;</hi> Wherefore were these Assemblies, but for Instruction? and in the last<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> Chapter, <hi>bids them obey their Rulers.</hi> What need Rulers, if no need of Teaching? But so sensless a dream will be too much<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7.</note> honour'd with any longer confutation. In the Apostles times then, there was no such dispensation of the Spirit, which did take away the use of Ministry and Ordinances. If it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected since their times, I would know whence it appears, that any have a greater measure of the Spirit then was poured out in the Apostles times; for then the Ministry was joyned with the Spirit: and what Prophecies are fulfilled now, which were not then? Or if they pretend to a Doctrine distinct from, and above what the Apostles taught, let them produce their evidences, and work those miracles which may induce men to believe them: Or let them shew what obligation any have to believe pretended new Revelations, without a power of miracles, attesting that those Revelations come from God? Or whereon men must build their faith, if it be left to the dictates of a pretended Spirit of Revelation? Or what way is left to discern the good Spirit from the bad, in its actings upon mens minds, if the Word of God be not our Rule still? Or how God is said to have spoken <hi>in the last dayes by his Son,</hi> if a<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> further speaking be yet expected? For the Gospel-dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:100525:96"/>
is therefore called the Last dayes, because no other is to be expected: Times being differenced in Scripture according to Gods wayes of revealing himself to men. But so much for this.</p>
                  <p>The second way whereby to know when Positive Lawes are<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> unalterable, is when God hath declared that such Lawes shall bind still. Two wayes whereby God doth express his own Will concerning the perpetuity of an Office founded on his own Institution. <hi>First,</hi> if such things be the work belonging to it, which are of necessary and perpetual use. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if God hath promised to assist them in it perpetually, in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their work. <hi>First,</hi> the Object of the Ministerial Office are such things which are of necessary and perpetual use; I mean the Administration of Gospel-Ordinances. <hi>viz.</hi> the Word and Sacraments, which were appointed by Christ for a perpetual Use. The Word as a means of Conversion and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; the Sacraments not onely as notes of distinction of Professors of the true faith from others, but as Seals to confirm the Truth of the Covenant on Gods part towards us, and as Instruments to convey the blessings sealed in the Covenant to the hearts of Believers. Now the very Nature of these things doth imply their perpetuity and continuance in the world, as long as there shall be any Church of God in it. For these things are not <hi>typi rerum futurarum,</hi> only Ceremonies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present somthing to come, but they are <hi>symbola rerum invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilium,</hi> signs to represent to our Senses things invisible in their own Nature: and between these two there is a great difference, as to the perpetuity of them: For Types of things as to come, must of necessity expire when the thing typified appears; but representation of invisible things cannot expire on that account, because the thing represented as invisible, cannot be supposed to be made visible, and so to evacuate the use of the Signes which represents them to us. <hi>Types</hi> represent a thing which is at present invisible; but under the Notion of it as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Symbols</hi> represent a thing at present invisible, but as present; and therefore <hi>Symbols</hi> are designed by Gods Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for a perpetuall help to the weakness of our Faith. And therefore the Lords Supper is appointed <hi>to set forth the Lords</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11: 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Death, till he come:</hi> whereby the continuance of it in the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100525:97"/>
Church of God is necessarily implied. Now then, if these things which are the proper object of the Ministerial Function be of a perpetual Nature; when these things are declared to be of an abiding Nature, it necessarily follows, that that Function to which it belongs to administer these things, must be of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Nature.</p>
                  <p>Especially if we consider in the second place, that Christ<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> hath promised to be with them continually in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these things: For that, notwithstanding the dust late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown upon it, we have a clear place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go teach and baptize,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Loe I am with you alwayes to the end of the World.</hi> If <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, did not signifie perpetuity, yet certainly the latter words do; for how could Christ be with the Apostles themselves personally to the end of the World? It must be therefore with them, and all that succeed them in the Office of Teaching and Baptizing, to the Worlds end: For that I assert to be the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. I insist not barely on the signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, where the Antecedents and Consequents fully Declare, what the time there is meant, which is the general Judgement of the world.

                     <hi>there should be the State of Eternity.</hi> So that the Disciples, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sense of the Jewes, doe not onely inquire of the signs of his altering the present state of things among them, but likewise of the Destruction of the whole World too. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it is observable, that throughout that Chapter, our Saviour intermixeth his answers to these 2 Questions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times speaking in reference to the Jewish State, as it is plain he doth, <hi>verse</hi> 15, 16. and so on; and when he saith, <hi>that</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:100525:98"/>
                     <hi>this Generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled,</hi> ver. 34. But then it is as evident, that some places must relate to the destruction of the World, as when he saith, <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no Man, no not the Angels of Heaven, but the Father onely,</hi> ver. 36. which will appear more plainly, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. <hi>Where the Son is excluded from knowing that hour too;</hi> But how can any say, that the Son did not know the time of the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which he himself foretold when it should be? And those words <hi>Heaven and Earth shall pass away,</hi> ver. 35. seem to be our Saviours Transition to the Answer of the other Question, about the final destruction of all things. However that be, as we see no reason at all why <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, should onely respect the subversion of the Jewish State: But supposing it should, yet there is far less reason why it should be so meant, in the place whose sense we are inquiring into. For if by Christs coming to destroy <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the old Sate and Dispensation should be taken away, we must suppose a new state <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nder the messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to begin from thence. And how Rationall doth this sound, that Christ should promise his peculiar Presence with his own Apostles, whom he imployed in erecting the Gospel State, onely till the Old Jewish State be subverted; but his Promise not at all to extend to that Time, wherein the State of the Kingdome of the Messias should be set up in stead of it: And how could any of the Apostles, for example, Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> who survived the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> expect Christs Presence with him, by vertue of this Promise, if it extended no further then to the Destruction of the Jewish State? Besides, it is a meer groundlesse fancy, and favours of the Jewish appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the State of the Messias Kingdome, to imagine that the Temporall State of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> must be first subverted before that <gap reason="foreign">

For the Jewish State and Dispensation did not lie in the <hi>Iewish Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> but in Obligation to the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> which expired together with Christ.

                  <p>The third thing, whereby to know when positive instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> are unalterable, is, when they are necessary to the being, succession, and continuance of the Church of God.

Which order is by an <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomasia</hi> called <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> The Question now, is not, which of these two doth come the <hi>nearest</hi> to <hi>Apostolical practice,</hi> and the first Institution, which hath hitherto been the controversie so hotly debated among us; but whether either of these two forms be so setled by a <hi>jus divinum, that is,</hi> be so determined by a positive Law of God, that all the Churches of Christ are bound to observe that one form so determined, without varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it: or whether Christ hath not in setling of his Church
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100525:100"/>
(provided there be some form of Government, and a setled Ministry for the exercise of it,) left it to the prudence of every particular Church, consisting of many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to agree upon its own form which it judgdeth most conducing to the end of Government in that particular Church. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Here now we fix our selves, and the first thing we do, is to agree upon our wayes of resolution of this Question, whereby to come to an end of this debate. And the most probable way to come to an issue in it, is, to go through all the wayes whereon men do fix an unalterable divine Right, and to see whether any of these do evince a divine Right setled upon a positive Law or no, for one of these forms. The pleas then for such a divine Right are these: Either some formal Law standing in force under the Gospel, or some plain Institution of a New Law by Christ in forming his Church, or the obligatory nature of Apostolical practice, or the general sense of the Primitive Church, to which we shall add by way of Appendix, the Judgement of the chief Divines and Churches since the Reformation; if we go happily through these, we may content our selves with having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the thing we aim at.</p>
                  <p>The first inquiry then is, Whether any formal Law of God<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> concerning a form of government for his Church, either by persons acting in an equality of Power, or subordination of one Order to another, under the Gospel, doth remain in force or no, binding Christians to the observing of it. The Reason why I begin with this, is, because I observe the Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants on both sides make use of the Pattern under the Law to establish their form by. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> Those who are for Superiority of one Order above another in the government of the Church, derive commonly their first argument from the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern under the Law. <note n="*" place="margin">Herl <hi>of Indep.</hi> p. 4. Apol. Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem. omnes.</note> Those who are for an equality of Power in the persons acting in government, yet being for a subordination of Courts, they bring their first argument for that, from the Jewish Pattern. So that these latter are bound by their own argument, though used in another case, to be ruled in this Controversie by the Jewish Pattern. For why should it be more obligatory as to subordination of Courts, then as to the superiority of Orders? If it holds in one case:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100525:101"/>
it must in the other. And if there be such a Law for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority standing unrepealed, there needs no New Law to inforce it under the Gospel. We shall therefore first enquire what foundation there is for either form in that Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and how far the argument drawn from thence is obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to us now. For the practice then in the Jewish Church, That there was no universal equality in the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> which God singled out from the rest for his own service, is obvious in Scripture. For there we find <hi>Priests</hi> above the <hi>Levites;</hi> the family of <hi>Aaron</hi> being chosen out from the other families of <hi>Cohath</hi> (one of the three sons of <hi>Levi</hi>) to be employed in a nearer attendance upon Gods Service then any of the other families. And it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that among both <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> there was a Superiority; For God placed <hi>Eleazar</hi> over the <hi>Priests,</hi>

                     <hi>the chief Fathers of the several distinct families,</hi> as they are called <hi>Exodus</hi> 6. 25. Thus we briefly see the subordination that there was in the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> the <hi>Levites</hi> first, over them the <hi>heads of the Families,</hi> over them the <hi>Rulers,</hi> or the <hi>chief</hi> of the <hi>heads,</hi> over them <hi>Ithamar,</hi> over both <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites, Eleazar;</hi> Over all, <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>High Priest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There being then so manifest an inequality among them,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> proceed we to shew how obligatory this is under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. For that end it will be necessary to consider, whether this imparity and Superiority were peculiarly appointed by God for the Ecclesiastical government of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> as it consisted of persons to be employed in the service of God, or it was only such an inequality and Superiority as was in any other Tribe. If only common with other Tribes,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100525:101"/>
nothing can be inferred from thence peculiar to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call government under the Gospel, any more then from the government of other Tribes to the same kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in all civil States. We must then take notice that <hi>Levi</hi> was a particular distinct Tribe of it self, and so not in subordination to any other Tribe; for they had <hi>the heads of their Fathers as well as others, Exodus</hi> 6. 25. and although when they were setled in <hi>Canaan,</hi> their habitations were intermixt with other Tribes in their <hi>forty eight</hi> Cities, yet they were not under the government of those Tribes among whom they lived, but preserved their authority and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intire among themselves. And therefore it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there should be the same form of government among them, which there was among the rest. The whole body of the Nation then was divided into <hi>thirteen Tribes;</hi> these Tribes into their <hi>several families;</hi> some say <hi>seventy,</hi> which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, these Families were divided into so many Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, their Housholds into persons <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; over the several persons were the several Masters of Families; over the several Housholds were the Captains of 1000 and 100, 50—10. Over the Families, I suppose, were the heads of the Fathers. And over the thirteen Tribes were the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the chief Fathers of the Tribes of the Children of Israel, Numb.</hi> 32. 28. and we have the names of them set down, <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. 17, &amp;c. So that hitherto, we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar to this Tribe, nor proper to it as employed in the service of God. For their several Families had their several Heads, and <hi>Eleazar</hi> over them as chief of the Tribe. And so we find throughout <hi>Numbers</hi> 2. all the Heads of the several Tribes are named and appointed by God as <hi>Eleazar</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>The only things then which seem proper to this Tribe, were<note place="margin">§ 5.</note> the superiority of the Priests over the Levites in the service of God, and the supereminent power of the High Priest, as the type of Christ. So that nothing can be inferred from the order under the Law to that under the Gospel, but from one of these two. And from the <hi>first</hi> there can be nothing deduced but this, that as there was a superiority of Officers under the Law, so likewise should there be under the Gospel; which is granted by all in the superiority of <hi>Priests</hi> over <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:100525:102"/>
to whom these two answer in the Church of God, in the judgement of those who contend for a higher order by divine Institution above Presbyters. And withall we must consider, that there was under that order no power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction invested in the Priests over the Levites, but that was in the heads of the Families; and ordination there could not be, because their office descended by succession in their several Families. Those who would argue from <hi>Aarons</hi> power, must either bring too little, or too much from thence; <hi>Too little,</hi> if we consider his office was typical and ceremonial, and as High Priest had more immediate respect to God then men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1. and therefore <hi>Eleazar</hi> was appointed over the several Families during <hi>Aarons</hi> life-time; and under <hi>Eleazar,</hi> his son <hi>Phinehas. Too much,</hi> If a necessity be urged for the continuance of the same authority in the Church of God; which is the argument of the Papists, deriving the Popes Supremacy from thence. Which was acutely done by Pope <hi>Innocentius the third,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> who proved, that the Pope may exercise temporall jurisdiction from that place in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 17. 8. and that by this reason, because <hi>Deuteronomy did imply the second Law, and therefore what was</hi> there written, <hi>in Novo Testamento debet observari,</hi> must be observed under the Gospel, which according to them is a new Law.</p>
                  <p>All that can be inferred then from the Jewish pattern,<note place="margin">§ 5.</note> cannot amount to any obligation upon Christians, it being at the best but a judicial Law, and therefore binds us not up as a positive Law; but only declares the equity of the thing in use then. I conclude then, That the Jewish pattern is no standing Law for Church-Government now, either in its common or peculiar form of Government; but because there was some superiority of order then, and subordination of some persons to others under that government, that such a superiority and subordination is no wayes unlawfull under the Gospel; for that would destroy the equity of the Law. And though the form of Government was the same with that of other Tribes, yet we see God did not bind them to an equality, because they were for his immediate service, but continued the same way as in other Tribes; thence I inferr,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100525:102"/>
that as there is no necessary obligation upon Christians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that form under the Jews, because their Laws do not bind us now; so neither is there any repugnancy to this Law in such a subordination, but it is very agreeable with the equity of it, it being instituted for peace and order, and therefore ought not to be condemned for Antichristian. The Jewish pattern then of Government, neither makes equality unlawfull, because their Laws do not oblige now; nor doth it make superiority unlawfull, because it was practised then. So that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jewish pattern, the Church of Christ is left to its own liberty for the choyce of its form of Government, whether by an equality of power in some persons, or superiority and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of one order to another.</p>

                     <p>Whether Christ hath determined the form of Government by any positive Laws. Arguments of the necessity why Christ must determine it, largely answered; as First, Christs faithfulness compared with <hi>Moses,</hi> answered, and retorted; and proved, that Christ did not institute any form of Church Government, because no such Law for it as <hi>Moses</hi> gave; and we have nothing but general Rules, which are applyable to several forms of Government. The office of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> what it proves in order to this question: the lawfulnesse of Episcopacy shewn thence, but not the necessity. A particular form, how far necessary, as Christ was the Governour of his Church; the similitudes the Church is set out by, prove not the thing in question. Nor the difference of Civil and Church Government; nor Christ setting Officers in his Church; nor the inconvenience of the Churches power in appointing new Officers. Every Minister hath a power respecting the Church in common, which the Church may restrain. Episco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of the Jewish Church, to the <hi>Founder</hi> of the Christian: To see whether our Lord &amp; Saviour hath determined this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or any one form of government for his Church, by any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally binding act or Law of his. And here it is pleaded more hotly by many that <hi>Christ must do it,</hi> than <hi>that he hath done it.</hi> And therefore I shall first examine the pretences of the necessity of Christs determining the particular form; and then the arguments that are brought that he hath done it. The main pleas that there must be a perfect form of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government laid down by Christ for the Church of God, are <hi>from the comparison of Christ with</hi> Moses, <hi>from the equal neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of forms of Government now which there is for other</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2, 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Societies, from the perfection and sufficiency of the Scriptures;</hi> all other arguments are reducible to these three Heads. Of these in their order.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the comparison of Christ with</hi> Moses, they argue<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.</note> thus: If <hi>Moses was faithfull in his house as a servant, much more Christ as a Son; now</hi> Moses <hi>appointed a particular form of Government for the Church under the old Testament; therefore Christ did certainly lay down a form of Church Government for the New Testament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer: first, Faithfulnesse implyes the discharge<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> of a trust reposed in one by another: so that it is said <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>he was faithful to him that appointed him:</hi> Christs faithfulnesse then lay in discharging the Work which his Father laid upon him, which was the Work of mediation between God and us; and therefore the comparison is here Instituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Moses</hi> as typical <hi>Mediator,</hi> and Christ as the true <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator;</hi> that as <hi>Moses</hi> was faithfull in his Work, so was <hi>Christ</hi> in his. Now <hi>Moses</hi> his faithfulnesse lay in keeping close to the Pattern received in the Mount, that is, observing the commands of God; Now therefore if Christs being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his office, doth imply the setling any one form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment in the Church, it must be made appear that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this form was part of Christs Mediatory Work, and that which the Father commanded him to do as Mediator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that Christ received such a form from the Father for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, as <hi>Moses</hi> did for the Jewish. To this it is said, That the <hi>Government is laid upon Christs shoulders, and all</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:100525:103"/>
                     <hi>power in his hands;</hi> and therefore it belongs to him as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.<note place="margin">Isa. 9. 6. Matth 28. 18.</note> Christ I grant is the King of the Church, and doth govern it outwardly by his Laws, and inwardly by the conduct of his Spirit: but shall we say, that therefore any one form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is necessary, which is neither contained in his Laws, nor dictated by his Spirit? the main original of mistakes here, is, the confounding the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> Government of the Church of Christ, and thence whensoever men read of Christs power, authority and government, they fancy it refers to the outward Government of the Church of God, which is intended of his internal Mediatory power over the hearts and consciences of men. But withall I acknowledge, that Christ for the better government of his Church and people, hath appointed Officers in his Church, invested them by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his own power with an authority to preach and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, and administer all Gospel-Ordinances in his own Name,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>that is, by his authority,</hi> for it is clearly made known to us in the Word of God, that Christ hath appointed these things. But then, whether any shall succeed the Apostles in superiority of power over Presbyters, or all remain governing the Church in an equality of power, is nowhere determined by the Will of Christ in Scripture, which contains his Royal Law: and therefore we have no reason to look upon it as any thing flowing from the power and authority of Christ as Mediator; and so not necessarily binding Christians.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer; If the correspondency between Christ<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> and <hi>Moses</hi> in their work, doth imply an equal exactnesse in Christs disposing of every thing in his Church, as <hi>Moses</hi> did among the Jews; then the Church of Christ must be equally bound to all circumstances of Worship as the Jews were. For there was nothing appertaining in the least to the Worship of God, but was fully set down even to the pins of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle in the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> but we find no such thing in the Gospel. The main Duties and Ordinances are prescribed indeed, but their circumstances and manner of performance are left as matters of Christian-liberty, and only couched under some general Rules: which is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the legal and Gospel-state. Under the Law all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Circumstances are exactly prescribed: but in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100525:104"/>
Gospel we read of some general Rules of direction for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans carriage in all circumstantial things. These four especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally contain all the directions of Scripture concerning Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>All things to be done decently and in order. All to be done for edification. Give no offence. Do all to the glory</hi>

                     <hi>of God.</hi> So that the particular circumstances are left to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-liberty with the observation of general Rules. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 32.</note> as to Baptism and the Lords Supper, which are unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> of divine Institution, yet as to the circumstances of the administration of them, how much lesse circumstantial is Christ<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 6, 7.</note> then <hi>Moses</hi> was! As to circumcision and the pass-over under the Law, the age, time, persons, manner, place, form, all fully set down; but nothing so under the Gospel: Whether Baptism shall be administred to Infants or no, is not set down in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words, but left to be gathered by Analogy and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; what manner it shall be administred in, whether by dipping or sprinkling, is not absolutely determined; what form of words to be used, whether in the name of all three persons, or sometimes in the Name of Christ only, as in the Acts<note place="margin">Acts 2. 38. 8. 12, 19, 5.</note> we read (if that be the sense, and not rather in Christs Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Christs authority). Whether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>sprinkling or dipping shall be thrice as some Churches use it, or only once as others. These things we see relating to an Ordinance of Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, are yet past over without any expresse command deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining either way in Scripture. So as to the Lords Supper; What persons to be admitted to it, whether all visible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, or only sincere Christians: upon what terms, whether by previous examination of Church-officers, or by an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their faith, or else only by their own tryal of themselves, required of them as their duty by their Ministers; whether it should be alwayes after Supper as Christ himself did it; whether taking fasting, or after meat; whether kneeling, or sitting, or leaning? Whether to be consecrated in one form of words, or several? These things are not thought fit to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>determined by any positive command of Christ, but left to the exercise of Christian-liberty; the like is as to preaching the Word, publike Prayer, singing of Psalmes; the duties are required, but the particular Modes are left undetermined. The case is the same as to Church-governwent. That the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100525:104"/>
Church be governed, and that it be governed by its proper Officers, are things of Divine appointment: but whether the Church should be governed by many joyning together in an equality, or by Subordination of some persons to others, is left to the same liberty which all other Circumstances are; this being not the Substance of the thing it self, but onely the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performance of it.</p>
                  <p>3. I answer, That there is a manifest disparity between the<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> Gospel and Jewish state: and therefore Reasons may be given why all Punctilioes were determined then which are not now: as</p>
                  <p>1. The perfection and liberty of the Gospel-state above the Jewish. The Law was onely as a Paedagogy, the Church then in her Infancy and Nonage, and therefore wanted the <hi>Fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cues</hi> of Ceremonies to direct her, and every part of her lesson set her, to bring her by degrees to skill and exactness in her Understanding the mystery of the things represented to her. But must the Church now grown up under Christ be still <hi>sub ferula,</hi> and not dare to vary in any Circumstance, which doth not concern the thing it self! A Boy at School hath his Lesson set him, and the manner of learning it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed him in every mode and circumstance. But at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity hath his Lectures read him, and his work set, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Directions given, but he is left to his own liberty how to perform his work, and what manner to use in the doing of it. So it was with the Church under age: Every mode and circumstance was Determined; but when the fulnesse of Time was come, the Church then being grown up, the main Offices themselves were appointed, and generall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections given; but a liberty left how to apply and make use of them, as to every particular case and occasion. Things Morall remain still in their full force, but circumstantials are left more at liberty by the Gospel-liberty; as a Son that is taught by his Father, while he is under his instruction, must observe every particular direction for him in his Learning: but when he comes to age, though he observes not those things as formerly, yet his Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ship continues, and he must obey his Father as a Childe still, though not in the same manner. The similitude is the Apostles, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 10. which
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100525:105"/>
he there largely amplifies to this very purpose of freeing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians from Judaical ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>2. The Form of Government among the Jewes in the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> was agreeable to the Form of Government among the other Tribes; and so <hi>Moses</hi> was not more exact in Reference to that, then to any other; and those persons in that Tribe who were the chief before the Institution of the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ronicall Priest-hood, were so after; but now under the Gospel, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not under the same Restrictions for civil Government by a Judicial Law, as they were then. For the Form of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Government then took place among them as one of their Judicial Laws; And therefore if the Argument hold, Christ must as well Prescribe a Form for civil Government as Ecclesiastical; if Christ in the Gospel must by his Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse follow the Pattern of <hi>Moses.</hi> But if Christ be not bound to follow <hi>Moses</hi> Pattern as to Judicial Law, for his Church and People; neither is he as to a Form of Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, because that was a part of their Civil and Judicial Law.</p>
                  <p>3. The people of the Jewes was a whole and entire people, subsisting by themselves when one set Form of Government was prescribed them; but it is otherwise now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. The Church of Christ was but Forming in Christs own time, nor the Apostles, in whose time we reade of but some Cities and no whole Nations converted to the Faith; and therefore the same Form of Government would not serve a Church in its first constitution, which is necessary for it when it is actually formed. A Pastour and Deacons might serve the Church of a City while believers were few, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not when they are increased into many Congregations. And so proportionably when the Church is enlarged to a whole Nation, there must be another Form of Government then. Therefore they who call for a National Church under the Gospel, let them first shew a Nation Converted to the Faith, and we will undertake to shew the other. And this is the chief Reason why the Churches Polity is so little described in the New Testament, because it was onely growing then: and it doth not stand to Reason, that the coat which was cut out for one in his Infancy, must of necessity serve him when
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100525:105"/>
grown a man; which is the argument of those who will have nothing observed in the Church, but what is expressed in Scripture. The Apostles looked at the present state of a Church in appointing Officers, and ordered things according to the circumstances of them, which was necessary to be done in the founding of a Church; and the reason of Apostolical practice binds still, though not the individual action, that as they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Churches for the best conveniency of Governing them, so should the Pastours of Churches now. But of this largely afterwards.</p>
                  <p>4. Another difference is, that the People of the Jewes lived all under one civil Government; but it is otherwise with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians who live under different Forms of civil Government. And then by the same reason that in the first institution of their Ecclesiastical Government it was formed according to the civil, by the same reason, must Christians doe under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, if the argument holds that Christ must be faithful as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was. And then because Christians do live under several and distinct Forms of civil Government, they must be bound by the Law of Christ, to contemperate the Government of the Church to that of the State. And what they have gained by this for their cause, who assert the necessity of any one Form from this Argument, I see not; but on the contrary this is evident, that they have evidently destroyed their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by it. For if <hi>Moses</hi> did prescribe a Form of Government for <hi>Levi</hi> agreeable to the Form of the Common-wealth, and Christ be as faithfull as <hi>Moses</hi> was, then Christ must likewise order the Government of Christian Churches, according to that of the State, and so must have different Forms as the other hath. Thus much will serve abundantly to shew the weakness of the argument drawn from the agreement of Christ and <hi>Moses,</hi> for the proving any one form of Government necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but this shall not suffice. I now shall <hi>ex abundanti</hi> from the answers to this argument, lay down several arguments that Christ did never intend to institute any one Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Church.</p>
                  <p>1. Whatever binds the Church of God as an institution of<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> Christ, must bind as an universal standing Law; but one form of Government in the Church cannot bind it as a standing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100525:106"/>
Law. For whatever binds as a standing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aw, must either be expressed in direct terms as such a Law; or deduced by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Consequence from his Lawes, as of an universally bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature; but any one particular form of Government in the Church, is neither expressed in any direct terms by Christ, nor can be deduced by just Consequence; therefore no such form of Government is instituted by Christ. If there be any such Law, it must be produced, whereby it is determined in Scripture, either that there must be Superiority or Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among Church Officers, as such, after the Apostles decease. And though the Negative of a Fact holds not, yet the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a Law doth, else no superstition. I have not yet met with any such produced, and therefore shall see what consequences can be made of a binding Nature. To this I say, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences can be deduced to make an institution, but onely to apply one to particular Cases: because Positives are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves indifferent without Institution and Divine appointment; and therefore that must be directly brought for the making a Positive universally binding, which it doth not in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do. Now here must be an Institution of something meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Positive supposed, which in its self is of an indifferent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore no consequence drawn can suffice to make it unalterably binding, without express Declaration that such a thing shall so bind; for what is not in its own Nature moral, binds only by vertue of a command, which command must be made known by the Will of Christ, so that we may understand its Obligatory nature. So that both a consequence must be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily drawn, and the Obligation of what shall be so drawn must be expressed in Scripture: which I despair of ever find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in reference to any one Form of Government in the Church.</p>
                  <p>2. If the standing Laws for Church-Government be equally applyable to several distinct Forms, then no one Form is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in Scripture; but all the standing Lawes respecting Church-Government, are equally applyable to several Forms: All the Lawes occurring in Scripture respecting Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, may be referred to these three heads. Such as set down the <hi>Qualifications of the Persons for the Office of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, such as require a right management of their Office, and</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:100525:106"/>
                     <hi>such as lay down Rules for the management of their Office.</hi> Now all these are equally applyable to either of these two forms we now discourse of. We begin then with those which set down the qualifications of persons employed in Government, those we have largely and fully set down by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Order</hi> to<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 1. to the 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> prescribing what manner of persons those<note place="margin">Titus 1. 5. to the 10.</note> should be who are to be employed in the Government of the Church. <hi>A Bishop must be blamelesse as the Steward of God, not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker,</hi> &amp;c. All these, and the rest of the Qualifications mentioned, are equally required as necessary in a Bishop, whether taken for one of a Superiour Order above Presbyters, or else only for a single Presbyter; however that be, if he hath a hand in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government, he must be such a one as the Apostle prescribes; And so these commands to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> given by <hi>Paul,</hi> do equally respect and concern them, whether we consider them as Evangelists acting by an extraordinary Commission, or as fixed Pastors over all the Churches in their several pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts; so that from the Commands themselves nothing can be inferred either way to determine the Question; only one place is pleaded for the perpetuity of the Office <hi>Timothy</hi> was employed in, which must now be examined: The place is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13, 14. <hi>I give thee charge in the sight of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that thou keep this commandement without spot, unrebukable, untill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> From hence it is argued thus: The Commandment here was the Charge which <hi>Timothy</hi> had of governing the Church; this <hi>Timothy</hi> could not keep personally till Christs second coming; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be a Succession of Officers in the same kind till the second coming of Christ. But this is easily answered. For first, it is no wayes certain what this Command was which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of; Some understand it of fighting the good fight of Faith, others of the precept of Love, others most probably the sum of all contained in this Epistle, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse implies in it (as being one great part of the Epistle) <hi>Pauls</hi> direction of <hi>Timothy</hi> for the right discharging of his Office; but, granting that the command respects <hi>Timothy's</hi> Office, yet I answer, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It manifestly appears to be something <hi>personal,</hi> and not <hi>successive;</hi> or at least nothing can be inferr'd
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100525:107"/>
for the necessity of such a Succession from this place which it was brought for: Nothing being more evident then that this command related to <hi>Timothy's</hi> personal observance of it. And therefore <hi>thirdly,</hi> Christs appearing here, is not meant of his second coming to judgement, but it only imports the<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, The precepts of the Gospel requiring a right<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> management of the work, are equally applyable to either form. <hi>Taking heed to the flock over which God hath made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers,</hi> is equally a duty; whether by <hi>flock</hi> we understand either the particular Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or the adjacent Churches of <hi>Asia;</hi> Whether by <hi>Overseers</hi> we understand some acting over others, or all joyning together in an equality.

                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 22.</note> may be equally applyable to men acting in either of these two forms of Government: There being no precept occurring<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 19.</note> in all those Epistles prescribing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> whether he must act only as a <hi>Consul in Senatu</hi> with the consent of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, or whether by his sole power he should determine what was the common interest, and concern of those Churches he was the Superintendent over. Neither doth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100525:107"/>
the Apostle determine at all in those Epistles chiefly concerning Church-government, whether upon the removal of <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> thence as Evangelists, as some pretend, or upon their death as fixed Pastors and Bishops, as others, any should succeed them in the power they enjoyed, or no: nor in what manner the Pastors of the several Churches should order things of common concernment, Which would seem to be a strange omission, were either of these two forms so necessary, taken exclusively of the other, as both parties seem to affirm. For we cannot conceive but if the being and right constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church did depend upon the manner of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours acting in it, but that care which <hi>Paul</hi> had over all the Churches would have prompted him (especially being assisted and guided by an infallible Spirit in the penning those Epistles) to have laid down some certain Rules for the acting of the Pastors of the Churches after the departure of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> Considering especially that the Epistles then writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him, were to be of standing perpetual use in the Church of God; and by which the Churches in after-ages were to be guided as well as those that were then in being. The Apostle in both Epistles takes care for a succession of Pastors in those Churches: <hi>Timothy</hi> is charged to <hi>commit the things he had</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>heard of</hi> Paul <hi>to faithful men; who shall be fit to teach others.</hi> Had it not been as requisite to have charged him to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his power of Government to men fit for that, had the Apostles looked on the form of Government to be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary as the office of preaching? <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he left <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creete</hi> on purpose <hi>to settle the Churches and ordain Presbyters</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Titus 1. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>in every City:</hi> had it not been as necessary to have shewed in what order the Churches must be setled, and what power did belong to those Presbyters, and how they should act in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning their Churches, had he thought the constitution of the Churches did depend upon the form of their acting? We see here then, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> doth not expresse any thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily inferring any one constant form to be used in the Church of God, And whence can we inferr any necessity of it, but from the Scriptures laying it down as a duty that such a form and no other there must be used in the Church of God? For all that we can see then by <hi>Pauls</hi> direction for Church-Government,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100525:108"/>
(when if ever, this should have been expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) it was left to the Christian wisdome and prudence of the Churches of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creet</hi> to consult and determine in what manner the government of their Churches should be provided for, upon the departure of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>But here it will be soon replyed, That though nothing be<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> expressed in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus, yet</hi> Pauls <hi>appointing</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>over those Churches, did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the form of Government, and they were entrusted with a power to provide for future Governours after them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>answer: <hi>First,</hi> The superiority which <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had over those Churches, doth not prove that form of Government necessary in all Churches; I dispute not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were <hi>Evangelists or no,</hi> or acted as such in that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority (of that afterwards) it is evident they might be so; there being no convincing argument to the contrary. And the bare possibility of the truth of the Negative, destroys the necessity of the Affirmative of a Proposition. As, <hi>Si posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile est, hominem non esse animal,</hi> then that Proposition is false, <hi>Necesse est hominem esse animal.</hi> For, <hi>Necesse est esse,</hi> and <hi>Non possibile est non esse,</hi> being <hi>

                        </gap>quipollents</hi> on the one side; and <hi>Possibile est non esse, Et non necesse est esse,</hi> being <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>quipollents</hi> on the other; <hi>Possibile est non esse,</hi> must be contradictory to <hi>Necesse est esse,</hi> as <hi>Non possibile est non esse,</hi> is to <hi>Non necesse est esse.</hi> So that if only the possibility of their acting as <hi>Evangelists,</hi> that is, by an extraordinary Commission, be evicted, which I know none will deny; the necessity of their acting as fixed Bishops is destroyed, and consequently the necessity of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their office too, which depends upon the former. For if they acted not as Bishops, nothing can be drawn from their example necessarily inforcing the continuance of the Superiority which they enjoyed. But though nothing can be inferred from hence as to the necessity of that office to continue in the Church, which <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in; yet from the Superiority of that power which they enjoyed over those Churches, whether as Evangelists, or as fixed Bishops, These two things may be inferred. <hi>First,</hi> That the superiority of some Church-Officers over others, is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100525:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not contrary to the Rule of the Gospel: for all parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the superiority of their power above the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the several Cityes; only the continuance of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> disputed by many. But if they had any such power at all, it is enough for my present design, <hi>viz.</hi> that such a superiority is not contrary to the Gospel-Rule: or that the nature of the Government of the Church doth not imply a necessary equality among the Governours of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hence I infer, that it is not repugnant to the constitution of Churches in Apostolical times, for men to have power over more than one particular Congregation. For such a power <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had, which had it been contrary to the nature of the regiment of Churches, we should never have read of in the first planted Churches. So that if those popular arguments of a necessary relation between a Pastor and particular peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of personal knowledge, care and inspection, did destroy the lawfulnesse of extending that care and charge to many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, they would likewise overthrow the nature, end and design of the office which <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> acted in: which had a relation to a multitude of particular and Congregational Churches. Whether their power was extraordinary or no, I now dispute not; but whether such a power be repugnant to the Gospel or no; which from their practice is evident that it is not. But then others who would make this office necessary, urge further, that <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus might ordain and appoint others to succeed them in their places and care over all those Churches under their charge.</hi> To which I answer, First, What they might do is not the question, but what they did, as they might do it; so they might not do it, if no other evidence be brought to prove it: for, <hi>Quod possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile est esse, possibile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st non esse. Secondly,</hi> Neither what they did, is the whole question, but what they did with an opinion of the necessity of doing it, whether they were bound to do it or no? and if so, whether by any Law extant in Scripture, and given them by <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles, or some private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and particular instructions when he deputed them to their several charges: If the former, that Law and command must be produced, which will hardly be, if we embrace only the received Canon of the Scripture. If the latter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we must
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100525:109"/>
then fetch some standing Rule and Law from unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: for no other evidence can be given of the Instructions by word of mouth, given by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> at the taking their charges upon them. But yet <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Were it only the matter of fact that was disputed, that would hold a Controversie still, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether any did succeed <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in their Offices: but this I shall leave to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to be discussed, when I come to examine the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Apostolical Succession. Thus we see then that neither the qualification of the persons, nor the commands for a right exercise of the office committed to them, nor the whole Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> do determine any one form of Government to be necessary in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us see whether the general Rules do require<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> any one form; which rules in that they are general, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine nothing of the authority it self as to its particular mode, being intended only for the regulation of the exercise of the authority in which men are placed. And it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that nothing is particularly determined in this case, when the Spirit of God only lays down such Rules for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which are applyable to distinct forms.

Rom. 10. 14.</note> have been applyed to nothing but to that one form. <hi>That none take the office of preaching without a Call, nor go without sending,</hi> will equally hold whether the power of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lye in a Bishop with Presbyters, or in Presbyters acting with equality of power, <hi>That offenders be censured, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made to the Church in case of scandal,</hi> determines nothing to whom the power of Jurisdiction doth solely belong, nor what that Church is which must receive these complaints. <hi>That all things be done with decency and order,</hi> doth prescribe nothing wherein that Decency lyes, nor how far that Order may extend; nor yet who must be the Judges of that Decency and Order. <hi>That all be done for edification, and the common benefit of the Church,</hi> doth no wayes restrain his Churches free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in disposing of its self as to the form of its government, so the aym of the Church be for the better edification of the body of the Church, and to promote the benefit of it. But
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100525:109"/>
methinks, these general Orders and Rules for Discipline do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the particular manner of government to be left at liberty to the Church of God, so that in all the several forms these general Rules be observed. Whereas had Christ appointed a superiour Order to govern other subordinate Officers and the Church together; Christs command for governing the Church would have been particularly addressed to them: and again, had it been the will of Christ there should be no supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Order above the Pastours of particular Churches, there would have been some expresse and direct prohibition of it; which because we no where read; it seems evident that Christ hath left both the one and the other to the freedom and liberty of his Church. So much shall serve in this place, to shew how improbable it is that Christ did ever prescribe any one form of Government in his Church, since he hath only laid down general Rules for the management of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>But this will not yet suffice those, who plead that Christ<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> must determine one immutable form of Government in his Church: but although it be a high presumption to determine first what Christ must do, before we examine what he hath done, yet we shall still proceed and examine all the pretences that are brought for this opinion. The next thing then which is generally urged for it, is, <hi>the equal necessity of Christs institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a certain form as for any other Legislator who models a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi> Now for answer to this, I say first, That Christ hath instituted such an immutable government in his Church, as is sufficient for the succession and continuance of it, which is all which Founders of Common-wealths do look after, <hi>viz.</hi> that there be such an Order and distinction of persons, and subordination of one to the other, that a Society may still be preserved among them; now this is sufficiently provided for by Christs appointing Officers continually to rule his Church, and establishing Laws for the perpetuating of such Officers; so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is necessary in order to the general ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is acknowledged to be appointed by Jesus Christ. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then that it be proved that one form of government is in it self absolutely necessary for the being of a Church, this argument can prove nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what is drawn from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100525:110"/>
will prove nothing but in a case of necessity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I answer, That those things which are not absolutely necessary to the being of a Church, are left to Christs liberty, whether he will determine them or no; and are no further to be looked on as necessary then as he hath determined by his Laws whether they shall be or no, in his Church. The thing will be thus cleared. When I read that <hi>Zaleucus, Lycurgus,</hi> or <hi>Numa,</hi> did form a Common-wealth and make Laws for it; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently conclude that there must be some order or distinction of persons in this Common wealth; and some rules whereby persons must be governed, and whereby others must Rule: But I cannot hence inferr that <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> or <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did institute Monarchical, Aristocratical, or Democratical Government, because any of these forms might be agreeable to their design; and therefore what kind of government they did appoint, can no otherwise be known then by taking a view of the Laws which they made in order thereto. So it is in reference to Christ, when we read that Christ hath instituted a Church alwayes to continue in the World, we presently apprehend that there must be some power and order in the members of that Society, and Laws for the governing it: but we cannot hence gather that he hath bound up his Officers to act in any one form, because several forms might in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves equally tend to the promoting the end of Government in his Church. And therefore what Christ hath expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in his positive Laws, must be our Rule of judging in this case, and not any presumption of our own, that such a form was necessary, and therefore Christ must institute and<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ecclesiast. Polity lib.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 11.</note> appoint it, Which is fully expressed by judicious <hi>Mr. Hooker,</hi> whose words will serve as a sufficient answer to this Objection. <hi>As for those marvellous Discourses, whereby they adventure to argue, that God must needs have done the thing which they imagine was to be done; I must confesse, I have often wondred at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding boldnesse herein. When the question is, Whether God have delivered in Scripture (as they affirm he hath) a compleat parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular immutable form of Church-Polity: why take they that other, both presumptuous and superfluous labour, to prove he should have done it: there being no way in this case to prove the deed of God, saving only by producing that evidence wherein he</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100525:110"/>
                     <hi>hath done it? But if there be no such thing apparent upon record, they do as if one should demand a Legacy, by force and vertue of some written Testament, wherein there being no such thing specified, he pleadeth that there it must needs be, and bringeth arguments from the Love and good will which alwayes the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator bore, imagining that these or the like proofs will convict a Testament to have that in it, which other men can no where by reading find. In matters which concern the actions of God, the most dutiful way on our part, is, to search what God hath done, and with meekness to admire that, rather then to dispute what he in congru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty of reason ought to do.</hi> Thus he, with more to the same purpose. The sum then of the answer to this Argument, is this, That nothing can be inferred of what Christ must do, from his relation to his Church, but what is absolutely necessary to the being of it; as for all other things, they being arbitrary constitutions, we can judge no more of the necessity of them, then as we find them clearly revealed in the Word of God. And therefore the Plea must be removed from what Christ must do, to what he hath done, in order to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the particular form of Government in his Church.</p>
                  <p>But still it is argued for the necessity of a particular form<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> of Government in the Church from the similitudes <hi>the Church is set out by in Scripture; It is called a</hi> Vine, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Parker de Polit. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 40.</note> 
                     <hi>must have</hi> Keepers: <hi>an</hi> House, <hi>and therefore must have</hi> Government; <hi>a</hi> City, <hi>and therefore must have a</hi> Polity; <hi>a</hi> Body, <hi>and therefore must have</hi> Parts. I answer, <hi>First,</hi> All these Similitudes prove only that which none deny, that there must be Order, Power, and Government in the Church of God; we take not away the Keepers from the Vine, nor the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the House, nor Polity from the City, nor distinction of parts from the Body; we assert all these things as necessary in the Church of God. The keepers of the Vine to defend and prune it; the Governours of the House to rule and order it; the Polity of the City to guide and direct it; the parts of the Body to compleat and adorn it. But <hi>Secondly;</hi> None of these Similitudes prove what they are brought for; <hi>viz.</hi> that any one immutable form of Government is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. For may not the Keepers of the Vine use their own
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100525:111"/>
discretion in looking to it, so the flourishing of the Vine be that they aym at? and if there be many of them, may there not be different orders among them, and some as Supervisors of the others work? The House must have Governours; but those that are so, are entrusted with the power of ordering things in the House according to their own discretion; and where there is a multitude, is there not diversity of Offices among them? and is it necessary that every House must have Offices of the same kind? In great and large Families there must be more particular distinct Orders and Offices, than in a small and little one. The City must have its Polity; but all Cities have not the like; some have one form, and some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet there is a City still and a Polity too. A body must have all its parts; but are all the parts of the body equal one to another? it sufficeth that there be a proportion, though not equality in them: the several parts of the body have their several offices, and yet we see the head is superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent over them all: and thus if we make every particular Church a Body, yet it follows not that the form of cloathing that Body must alwayes be the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is rather the cloathing to the Body than the parts of it, the Governours indeed are parts of the Body; but their manner of governing is not, that may alter according to the proportion and growth of the Body, and its fashion change for better conveniency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if these Similitudes prove nothing; yet certainly,</hi> say<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> they, <hi>the difference as to Civil and Ecclesiastical Government will; for though there may be different forms in civil Government, which are therefore call'd</hi> an Ordinance of man; <hi>yet there must be but one in Church-Government, which is an Ordinance of God,</hi>

                     <hi>and Christ hath appointed Officers to rule it.</hi> I answer, <hi>first,</hi> We grant and acknowledge a difference between the Church and the Common-wealth, they are constituted for other ends; the one Political, the other Spiritual; one temporal, the other eternal; they subsist by different Charters; the one given to men as men, the other to men as Christians: They act upon different principles; the one to preserve civil Rights, the other to promote an eternal Interest; nay, their formal constitution is different; for a man by being a member of a Common-wealth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100525:111"/>
doth not become a Member of the Church, and by being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated out of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth not cease to be a Member of the Common-wealth: The Officers of the one are clearly distinct from the other, the one deriving their power from the Law of Christ, the other from Gods general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: the Magistrate hath no power to Excommunicate formally out of the Church any more then to admit into it, nor have the Church-officers any power to cast men out of the common-wealth. We see then there is a difference between Civil and Ecclesiastical Government: But then I answer, <hi>Secondly,</hi> The power of the Magistrate is not therefore called an Ordinance of man, because of the mutability of its Form, and as distinguished from the Form of Church-government. For <hi>First,</hi> The Apostle speaks not of the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of the Power; <hi>Submit to every Ordinance of man,</hi> &amp;c. the ground of Submission is not the form, but the power of civil government; and therefore there can be no opposition expressed here between the Forms of Civil and Ecclesiastical government: but if any such opposition be, it must be between the powers; and if this be said as to civils, that the power is an Ordinance of Man in that sense, (whereas <hi>Paul</hi> saith it is of God) yet as to the Church it is freely acknowledged<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> that the Power is derived from God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The civil power is not called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, because it is a creature of mans making, and so subject to mens power; but the ground of that Speech is, because all civil power respects men as men, without any further connotation. <hi>Humana dicitur, non quod ab hominibus sit excogitata, sed quod hominum sit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria,</hi> saith <hi>Beza.</hi> And to the same purpose <hi>Calvin, Humana dicitur Ordinatio, non quod humanitùs inventa fuerit; sed quod propria hominum est digesta &amp; ordinata vivendi ratio.</hi> Pisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Humanam appellat, non quod magistratus homines autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res habeat, sed quod Homines eam gerant.</hi> So then the civil power is not called an Ordinance of man, as it is of mans set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, but as it is proper to man; and so if there be any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position between the civil and Church power, it is onely this, that the one belongs to men as men, the other to men as Christians. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Although it be granted that Christ hath appointed and set up his own Officers in his Church; yet
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100525:112"/>
it doth not thence follow that he hath determined in what manner they shall Rule his Church. It is true, Christ hath set up in his Church, <hi>some Apostles, some Evangelists, and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>some Pastours and Teachers:</hi> but it doth not thence follow, that Christ hath determined, whether the Power of Apostles and Evangelists should continue in his Church or no, as it implied Superiority over the ordinary Pastors of the Churches; nor whether the Pastors of the Church should act in an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Governing Churches. I grant, that all Church-Government must be performed by Officers of Christs appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but that which I say is not determined in Scripture, is, the way and manner whereby they shall Govern Churches in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                  <p>It is yet further argued, <hi>That if the Form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Churches Power, to make new Officers which Christ never made, which must be a plain addition to the Lawes of Christ, and must argue the Scripture of Imperfection.</hi> This being one of the main Arguments, I have reserved it to the place of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> and shall now examine what strength there lies in it. To this therefore I answer, <hi>First,</hi> Those Officers are onely said to be new, which were never appointed by Christ, and are contrary to the first appointments of Christ for the Regulating of his Church; such it is granted the Church hath no power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute: but if by new Officers be meant onely such as have a charge over more then one particular congregation by the consent of the Pastours themselves; then it is evident, such an Office cannot be said to be new. For, besides the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of God, from the first Primitive times which have all consented in the use of such Officers; we finde the Foundation of this Power laid by Christ himself in the Power which the Apostles were invested in, which was extended over many, both Churches and Pastours. But if it be said, <hi>The Apostolical Power being extraordinary, must cease with the persons which enjoyed it:</hi> I answer: <hi>First,</hi> What was extraordinary did cease; but all the Dispute is, what was extraordinary, and what not; some things were ordinary in them, as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Baptizing, Ordaining, Ruling Churches; some things were again extraordinary, as immediate mission from Christ
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100525:112"/>
(the main distinguishing Note of an Apostle) a Power of working Miracles to confirm the Truth of what they Preached. Now the Question is, whether the power which they enjoyed over Presbyters and Churches, be to be reckoned in the first or the second number. It must therefore be proved to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, before it can be said to cease with them, and that must be done by some Arguments proper to their persons; for if the Arguments brought be of a common and moral Nature, it will prove the Office to be so too. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By ceasing may be meant either ceasing as to its <hi>necessity,</hi> or ceasing as to its <hi>lawfulness:</hi> I say not, but that the <hi>necessity</hi> of the Office, as in their persons, for the first Preaching and propagating the Gospel, did cease with them; but, that after their death it became <hi>unlawful</hi> for any particular persons to take the care and charge of <hi>Diocesan</hi> Churches, I deny. For to make a thing unlawfull which was before lawfull, there must be some expresse prohibition forbidding any further use of such a power, which I suppose men will not easily produce in the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>I answer therefore <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the extending of any<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> Ministerial power, is not the appointing of any New Office; because every Minister of the Gospel hath a Relation <hi>in actu primo</hi> to the whole Church of God: the restraint and inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which power is subject to Positive Determinations of prudence and conveniency <hi>in actu secundo;</hi> and therefore if the Church see it fit for some men to have this power enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for better government in some, and restrained in others, that inlargement is the appointing no new Office, but the making use of a power already enjoyed for the benefit of the Church of God. This being a Foundation tending so fully to clear the lawfulnesse of that Government in the Church which implies a superiority and subordination of the Officers of the Church to one another: and the Churches using her prudence in ordering the bounds of her Officers, I shall do these two things. <hi>First,</hi> Shew that the power of every Minister of the Gospel doth primarily and habitually respect the Church in common. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the Church may in a peculiar manner single out some of its Officers for the due Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ecclesiastical power. <hi>First,</hi> that every Minister of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100525:113"/>
Gospel hath a power respecting the Church in common: This I find fully and largely proved by those who assert the equality of the power of Ministers; <hi>First,</hi> from Christs bestowing the several Offices of the Church, for the use of the whole Church, <hi>Ephesians,</hi> 4. 12, 13. Christ hath set Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pastours and Teachers in his Church; now this Church must needs be<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 28, 29.</note> the catholicke visible Church, because indisputably the Apostles Office did relate thereto, and consequently so must that of Pastours and Teachers too: Again, the end of these Offices is the building up the Body of Christ, which cannot otherwise be understood then of his whole Church: else Christ must have as many Bodies as the Church hath parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregations. Which is a new way of <hi>Consubstantiation. Secondly,</hi> The Ministerial Office was in being before any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregations were gathered: For Christ upon his Ascension to Glory <hi>gave these Gifts to men;</hi> and the Apostles<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 8.</note> were impowered by Christ before his Ascension, Either then<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19.</note> they were no Church Officers, or if they were so, they could have no other <hi>Correlate,</hi> but the whole body of the Church of God then lying under the power of Darkness, a few persons excepted. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because the main Designe of appointing a Gospel Ministry was the conversion of Heathens and Infidels: and if these be the proper Object of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Function, then the Office must have reference to the whole Church of Christ; else there could be no part of that Office performed towards those who are not yet converted. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Else a Minister can perform no office belonging to him as such beyond the bounds of his particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and so can neither Preach nor Administer the Sacraments to any other but within the Bounds of his own particular place and people. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Because Ministers by Baptizing do admit men into the catholike visible Church, (else a man must be baptized again every time he removes from one Church to another) and none can admit beyond what their office doth extend to; therefore it is evident that every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Pastor of a Church hath a Relation to the whole Church; To which purpose our former observation is of great use; <hi>viz.</hi> That particular congregations are not of Gods <hi>primary intention,</hi> but for <hi>mens conveniency,</hi> and so consequently is the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100525:113"/>
fixedness of particular Pastors to their several places for the greater conveniency of the Church; every Pastor of a Church then hath a Relation to the whole Church; and that which hinders him from the exercise of this power, is not any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse in the thing, but the preserving of order and conveniency in the Church of God. This being premised, I say, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the officers of the Church may in a peculiar manner attribute a larger and more extensive power to some particular persons for the more convenient exercise of their common power. We have seen already that their power extends to the care of the Churches in common, that the restraint of this power is a matter of order and decency in the Church of God; Now in matters of common concernment, without all question it is not unlawful when the Church judgeth it most for Edification, to grant to some the <hi>executive part</hi> of that power, which is Originally and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally common to them all. For our better understanding of this, we must consider a twofold power belonging to Church-Officers, <hi>a power of Order,</hi> and <hi>a power of jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for in every <hi>Presbyter,</hi> there are some things inseparably joyned to his Function, and belonging to every one in his personal capacity, both <hi>in actu primo,</hi> and <hi>in actu secundo,</hi> both as to the <hi>right and power</hi> to do it, and the <hi>exercise and execution</hi> of that power; such are preaching the Word, visiting the sick, administring Sacraments. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there are other things which every Presbyter hath an aptitude, and a <hi>jus</hi> to, <hi>in actu primo,</hi> but the limitation and exercise of that power doth belong to the Church in common, and belong not to any one personally, but by a further power of choice or delegation to it, such is the power of visiting Churches, taking care that particular Pastors discharge their duty; such is the power of ordination and Church censures, and making Rules for decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Church; this is that we call the <hi>power of jurisdiction.</hi> Now this latter power, though it belongs habitually and <hi>in actu primo</hi> to every Presbyter; yet being about matters of publike and common concernment, some further Authority in a Church constituted is necessary, besides the power of order; and when this power, either by consent of the Pastors of the Church, or by the appointment of a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100525:114"/>
or both, is devolved to some particular persons, though <hi>quoad aptitudinem</hi> the power remain in every Presbyter, yet <hi>quoad executionem</hi> it belongs to those who are so appointed. And therefore <hi>Camero</hi> determins that, <hi>Ordinatio non fit à pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Ecclesia in <hi>Mat. 18.</hi> 15. Tom. 1. op. in 40. p. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>quatenus pastor est, sed quatenus ad tempus singularem authoritatem obtinet,</hi> i. e. That Ordination doth not belong to the Power of Order but to the Power of Jurisdiction, and therefore is subject to Positive restraints, by Prudential De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations. By this we may understand how lawfull the Exercise of an Episcopal Power may be in the Church of God, supposing an equality in all Church-Officers as to the Power of Order. And how incongruously they speak, who suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing an equality in the Presbyters of Churches at first, do cry out, that the Church takes upon her the Office of Christ, if she delegates any to a more peculiar Exercise of the power of Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>The last thing pleaded why an immutable Form of Church-Government<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> must be laid down in Scripture, is, <hi>from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and sufficiency of the Scriptures; because otherwise the Scriptures would be condemned of imperfection.</hi> But this will receive an easie dispatch: For, <hi>First,</hi> The Controversie about the perfection of the Scriptures, is not concerning an essential or integral Perfection, but a perfection <hi>ratione finis &amp; effectuum</hi> in order to its end; now the end of it, is to be an<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rivet. Isagog. ad Script. sacr. cap.</hi> 24. <hi>s.</hi> 3.</note> adaequate Rule of Faith and Manners, and sufficient to bring men to salvation; which it is sufficiently acknowledged to be, if all things necessary to be believed or practised be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Word of God: now that which we assert not to be fully laid down in Scripture, is not pleaded to be any wayes necessary, nor to be a matter of Faith, but something left to the Churches Liberty; but here it is said by some, that this <hi>is adding to the Law of God,</hi> which destroyes the Scriptures perfection; therefore I answer: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whatever is done with an Opinion of the necessity of doing it, destroyes the Scriptures perfection if it be not contained in it: for that were to make it an imperfect Rule; and in this sense every <hi>additio perficiens</hi> is <hi>additio corrumpens,</hi> because it takes away from the perfection of the Rule which it is added to: and thus Popish Traditions are destructive of the Scriptures sufficiency.

But the doing of any thing not positively determined in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, not looking upon it as a thing we are bound to do from the necessity of the thing, and observing the general Rules of Scripture in the doing it, is far from destroying the perfection or sufficiency of the Word of God. Thirdly, All essentials of Church-Government are contained clearly in Scripture: The essentials of Church-Government, are such as are necessary to the preservation of such a Society as the Church is: Now all these things have been not only granted, but proved to be contained in Scripture; but whatever is not so necessary in its self, can only become necessary by vertue of Gods express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and what is not so commanded, is accidental, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial, and a matter of Christian liberty, and such we assert the Form of Church-Government to be. It is not our work to enquire, why God hath determined some things that might seem more circumstantial than this, and left other things at liberty; but whether God hath determined these things or no. Which determination being once cleared, makes the thing so commanded necessary as to our observance of it; but if no such thing be made appear, the thing remains a matter of liberty, and so the Scriptures perfection as to necessaries in order to Salvation, is no wayes impeached by it. So much now for the necessity of Christs determining the particular form of Government: We now proceed to the consideration of Christs Actions, whether by them the form of Church-Government is determined or no?</p>

                     <p>Whether any of Christs Actions have determined the Form of Government. All Power in Christs hands for Governing his Church: What order Christ took in order thereto when he was in the World. Calling Apostles the first action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting outward Government: The Name and Office of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles cleared; An equality among them proved during our Saviours life. <hi>Peter</hi> not made Monarch of the Church by Christ. The Apostles Power over the seventy Disciples consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, with the nature and quality of their Office, <hi>Matth. 20. 25, 26, 27.</hi> largely discussed and explained. It makes not all inequality in Church Officers unlawful; by the difference of Apostles and Pastors of Churches, <hi>Matth. 18. 15.</hi> How far that determins the Form of Church-Government. No evidence of any exact Order for Church-Government from thence, <hi>Matth. 16. 15, 16 17, 18.</hi> considered how far that concerns the Government of the Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving considered and answered the Arguments which<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> are brought, why Christ must determine the particular Form of Government: Our next task will be to enquire into those Actions of our Saviour which are conceived to have any plausible aspect towards the setling the Form of Government in his Church. And were it not that men are generally so wedded to an <hi>hypothesis</hi> they have once drunk in by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of interest or education, we might have been superseded from our former labour, but that men are so ready to think that Opinion to be most necessary, which they are most in love with, and have appeared most zealous for. Men are loth to be perswaded that they have spent so much breath to so little purpose, and have been so hot and eager for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which at last appears to be a matter of Christian liberty. Therefore we finde very few that have been ever very earnest in the maintaining or promoting any matter of opinion, but have laid more weight upon it, than it would really bear; lest men should think, that with all their sweat and toile, they only
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100525:115"/>
beat the ayr, and break their Teeth in cracking a Nut, with a hole in it; which if they had been so wise as to discern before, they might have saved their pains for somewhat which would have better recompenced them. But thus it generally fares with men; they suck in principles according as interest and education disposeth them, which being once in, have the advantage of insinuating themselves into the understanding, and thereby raise a prejudice against whatever comes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb them; which prejudice being the <hi>Yellow-jaundise</hi> of the Soul, leaves such a tincture upon the eyes of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that till it be cured of that <hi>Icterism,</hi> it cannot discern things in their proper colours. Now this prejudice is raised by nothing more strongly, than when the opinion received is entertained, upon a presumption that there is a <hi>Divine stamp</hi> and <hi>Impress</hi> upon it, though no such <hi>Effigies</hi> be discernable there. Hence come all the several contending parties about Church-Government, equally to plead an interest in this <hi>Ius Divinum,</hi> and whatever opinion they have <hi>espoused,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently conceive it to be of no lesse than <hi>Divine</hi> extract and <hi>Original,</hi> And as it sometimes was with great personages among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> when their miscarriages were discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the eye of the World, the better to <hi>palliate</hi> them among the <hi>vulgar,</hi> they gave themselves out to be impreguated by some of their adored Deities; so I fear it hath been among some whose Religion should have taught them better things, when either faction, design, or interest, hath formed some conceptions within them suitable thereunto, to make them the more passable to the World, they are brought forth under the pretence of Divine Truths. Far be it from me to charge any sincere, humble, sober Christians with an offence of so high a nature, who yet may be possessed with some mistakes and apprehensions of this nature; but these are only wrought on by the <hi>Masters of parties,</hi> who know, unlesse they fly so high, they shall never hit the game they aym at. This is most discernable in the <hi>Factors</hi> for the <hi>Roman Omnipotency</hi> (as <hi>Paulus</hi> the fifth was call'd <hi>Omnipotentiae Pontifici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the great supporters of that Interest, the power they plead for is plainly given them from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and not only offer to prove that it was so, but that it was not consistent with the Wisdom of Christ that it should be otherwise. Lest I should seem to wrong those of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, hear what the Author of the <hi>Gloss</hi> upon the <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Extravag. unum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.</note> (so they may be well called) saith to this purpose, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that place of our Saviour, <hi>all power is given to me in heaven and earth, Matthew</hi> 28. 18. to the <hi>Pope,</hi> adds these words, <hi>Non videretur Dominus discretas fuisse, ut cum reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia ejus loquar; nisi unicum post se talem Vicarium reliquisset, qui hac omnia posset.</hi> We see by this, what blasphemies men may run into, when they argue from their private fancies and opinions, to what must be done by the Law of Christ. It therefore becomes all sober Christians impartially to enquire what Christ hath done, and to ground their opinions only upon that, without any such presumptuous intrusions into the Counsels of Heaven. We here therefore take our leave of the Dispute, Why it was necessary a form of Government should be established, and now enter upon a survey of those grounds which are taken from any passages of our Saviour, commonly produced as a Foundation for any particular Forms.</p>
                  <p>I shall not stand to prove, that <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Mediator</hi> hath all<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> the power over the <hi>Church</hi> in his own hands, it being a thing so evident from Scripture, and so beyond all dispute with<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> those whom I have to deal with.

                     </hi> he acquaints us with the ends of Christs choosing them. First, That they might continually attend upon him, the better to be fitted for their employment afterwards; which he expresseth, when he adds, That he might send them out to preach, and to give them power over Devils and Diseases, to cast out the one, and to cure the other. Their actual sending out was not (say some) till half a year after, which is the story related by <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1. near a <hi>twelve</hi>-moneth (say others) but presently upon their choyce <hi>Christ</hi> makes the Sermon in the Mount, as appears by comparing <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 17, 20. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 1. wherein among other things, our Saviour takes occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to declare their duty to them, telling them, They were the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> &amp;c. Which he doth, the more to fit them for the discharge of their employment.</p>
                  <p>Having thus laid these things together about the Apostles,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> from their first calling to the time of their <hi>mission,</hi> we shall take notice of those things from them which may relate to the Office which the Apostles were called to, and to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by them. <hi>First,</hi> We here observe, that our Saviour no sooner began to preach the Gospel himself, but he made choyce of some persons as a peculiar Order of men for the propagation of the Gospel in the World. The peculiarity of the Function of a Gospel-Ministry under Christ was, we see, designed from Christs first publike appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in his Office: he might have left the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the common order of <hi>Disciples,</hi> had he not intended an office in his Church distinct and peculiar from all other employments; and therefore it is observable, that Christ did not call the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:100525:118"/>
off from their other employments, till he designed to make them <hi>Apostles;</hi> before, when they were only private Disciples, they did follow their employments at some times still; but when he calls them to be <hi>Fishers of men,</hi> be bids them leave all and follow him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We take notice of the admirable wisdom of our Saviour in the choice he made of the Persons for first founding his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the means he used to fit them for it. The persons were such as were most suitable to his design; the means such as were most suitable to the persons. The persons were such, who by reason of the known meanness of their condition, and supposed weakness of abilities, were the fittest to convince the World, that the Doctrine which they preached was not the product of humane wisdom, but the <hi>express Image</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Divine truth;</hi> whose nakednesse and simplicity would gain more upon mens belief by the power which accompanied the Preaching of it, then the most refined and sublimated Notions of their wise men should do, managed with the greatest subtilty and prudence by the maintainers of them. <hi>Christ</hi> would make men see that his Doctrine stood not in need either of the wisdom or power of men, to defend or propagate it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore made choice of the most unlikely Instruments for that end, <hi>that mens faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>God.</hi> But withall, we are to take notice of Christs admirable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the means he used to fit and qualifie them for the first builders of his Church; for although the power and efficacy of their preaching was wholly from God, and not from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet our Saviour doth not <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>presenly upon his calling them, place them in the highest Office he intended them for, but proceeds gradually with them, and keeps them a long time under his own eye and instruction, before he sends them abroad: and that for two ends chiefly: First, <hi>To be witnesses of his actions.</hi> Secondly, <hi>To be Auditors of his Doctrine. First,</hi> To be witnesses of his actions, which was looked on by the Apostles, as the most necessary qualification for an Apostle in the place fore-cited, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 21, 22. <hi>Peter</hi> calls himself a <hi>witnesse of the sufferings of Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,</hi>

                        </gap>ds have handled of the Word of Life; that which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you,</hi> 1 John 1. 1, 3. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>credibility</hi> of the Gospel was sufficiently evidenced to the World, when the chief Preachers of it spoke nothing but what their own senses were witnesses of, both as to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and actions of Christ; and therefore it is no wayes <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,</hi> they should be deceived themselves in what they spoke; and more <hi>improbable</hi> they would deceive others, whose <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> lay wholly upon the <hi>truth</hi> of the Doctrine which they Preoched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for by the very Preaching of that Doctrine they rob'd themselves of all the comforts of Life, and exposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a thousand miseries in this Life; so that unlesse their Doctrine was true in order to another Life, they were guilty of the greatest folly this World ever heard of. We see what care our Saviour took to satisfie the reasons of men concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>credibility</hi> of his Doctrine, when the persons he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the founding a Church upon it, were only such as were intimately conversant with the whole Life, Doctrine, and Works of him from whom they received it; and thereby we cannot suppose any ignorance in them concerning the things they spoke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lest men should mistrust they might have a design to impose on others, he made their faithfulness appear, by their exposing themselves to any hazards to make good the truth of what they preached.

Another end of our Saviours training up his Apostles so long in his School before he sent them abroad, was, that they might be Auditors of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and so might learn themselves before they taught others. Christ was no friend to those hasty births which run abroad with the shell on their heads; no, although it was in his power to conferr the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as well at their first entrance into Discipleship as afterwards, yet we see he nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And we see what industry and diligence was used in the training up of those for the Apostleship, who were in an immediate way sent out by Christ. And it is very probable that upon their first sending abroad they taught not by immediate Revelation, but only what they had learned from Christ during their being with him. Whence we see what a subordination there is in acquired parts, labour, and industry to the Teachings and Inspirations of the Divine Spirit; our Saviour looked not on his labour as lost, although afterwards the <hi>Unction from the Holy One should teach them all things.</hi> It was Christs design to have them go <gap reason="foreign">

from him that hath authority over him for the doing some special service. Thus were Christs disciples called Apostles from the immediate commission which they had from Christ for the discharge of that work which he imployed them in. Thence our Saviour makes use of the word <hi>sending</hi> in the proper and peculiar sense when he gives the Apostles their commission, in those remarkable words of Christ to them; <hi>As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</hi> John 20. 21. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Saviour delegates his power and authority which he had as Doctour of the Church, to his Apostles upon his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the World, not in a <hi>privative way,</hi> so as to destroy his own authority over the Church, but in a <hi>cumulative way,</hi> investing them with that authority which they had not before, for both Teaching and Governing the Church. No Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then can be drawn for the Right or Form of Church-Government from Christs actions towards his Disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the last and full Commission was given unto them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had no power of Church-government before that time.</p>
                  <p>Which will be further cleared if we consider their first<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> sending out, spoken of <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 1. Several things lie in our way to be observed in reference to this <hi>Mission</hi> of the Apostles. <hi>First,</hi> that though the Apostles had been now for some competent time, not onely called to their Office, but solemnly chosen to it; yet we no where read that they did ever exercise that Office till now they were sent forh by Christ. They remained still at Christs feet, learning for their own instruction, and fitting themselves for their future imployment, and thought it no inconvenience while they lay for a wind, to lay in sufficient lading and provision for their voyage. Baptize indeed they did before, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 2. but that I suppose was done by them by an immediate present Order from Christ himself, being by as the chief in the action, thence Christ in one place is said to baptize, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 22. and yet he is said not to baptize, but his Disciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 2. Christ did it <hi>authoritatively,</hi> the Disciples <hi>ministerially.</hi> Yet if we should grant the Disciples did then baptize as private men after the received custome of the Jews, (among whom onely a <hi>Confessus trium</hi> was requisite to Baptize a prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte)
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100525:120"/>
this doth not at all take off from the peculiarity of a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction both to Preach and Baptize, because as yet the Gospel-Ministry was not instituted; and therefore what might be lawfull before restraint, doth not follow it should be so after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when all those scattered rayes and beam, which were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed abroad before, were gathered into the Ministerial Office upon Christs appointing it, as that great <hi>Hemisphere</hi> of Light in the creation, was after swallowed up in the body of the Sun. But now were the Apostles first sent out to Preach, and now God first begins to null the Jewish Ministry, and set up another instead of it, and makes good that threatning: <hi>That he was against the Shepherds, and would require the flock at their hand, and cause them to cease to feed the Flock,</hi> &amp;c. Here<note place="margin">Ezek. 34. 10.</note> then we have the first Exercise of the Apostles Ministry, for which we see, besides their former call and choice, particular mission was after necessary. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we observe that the imployment <hi>Christ</hi> sent them upon now, was onely a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary imployment, confined as to work and place, and not the full Apostolicall work. The want of considering and understanding this, hath been the ground of very many mistakes among Men, when they argue from the Occasional Precepts here given the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as from a standing perpetual Rule for a Gospel-Ministry: Whereas our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour onely suited these instructions to the present case, and the nature and condition of the Apostles present imployment, which was, not to preach the Gospel up and down themselves, but to be as so many <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> to call people to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Christ</hi> himself; and therefore the Doctrine they were to Preach was the same with his, <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven is at</hi>

                     <hi>hand,</hi> whereby it appears their Doctrine was only preparatory to <hi>Christ;</hi> it being onely to raise up higher expectations of the Gospel-state under the <hi>Messias;</hi> and these were they <hi>whom the King now sent into the high-wayes to invite men to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi>

                     <hi>Feast, and to bid them to come in to him.</hi> This was the only present imployment of the Apostles in their first mission: in which they were confined to the Cities of <hi>Iudea,</hi> that they might have the first refusal of the Gospel-Offers. This mission then being <hi>occasional, limited,</hi> and <hi>temporary,</hi> can yield no Foundation for any thing <hi>perpetual</hi> to be built upon it.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100525:121"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we observe that those whom <hi>Christ</hi> imploied in the first dispersing of the Gospel abroad, were furnished with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments sufficient to evince not onely the <hi>credibility,</hi> but the certain <hi>truth</hi> of what they preached. Therefore <hi>Christ</hi> when he now sent them out, gave them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not only <hi>a meer power to work miracles,</hi> but <hi>a right conferrèd on them to</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>do it</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> These were the <hi>Credentials</hi> which the Apostles carried along with them to shew from whom they derived their power, and by whose authority they acted. And these were the most suitable to them, as making it appear that a Divine presence went along with them, and therefore they could not salsifie to the world in what they Declared unto them; which was the best way for them to evidence the Truth of their Doctrine, because it was not to be discovered by the Evidence of the things themselves, but it depended upon the Testimony of the Authour; and therefore the onely way to confirm the truth of the Doctrine, was to confirm the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Authour, which was best done by doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above what the power of nature could reach unto. And this was the prerogative of the <hi>Apostles</hi> in their first mission above <hi>Iohn the Baptist:</hi> For of him it is said that he did no miracle. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we observe that the Apostles in this mission were invested in no power over the Church, nor in any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of Order one over another. The first is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ did not now send them abroad to gather Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but onely to call persons to the Doctrine of the <hi>Messias;</hi> and while Christ was in the World among them, he retained all Church power and authority in his own hand. When this temporary mission expired, the <hi>Apostles</hi> lived as private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons still under Christs Tutorage, and we never read them acting in the least as Church-Officers all that while. Which may appear from this one argument, because all the time of our Saviours being in the World, he never made a total sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> but frequented with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the <hi>Temple worship</hi> and Service to the last; although he super-added many <hi>Gospel Observations</hi> to those of the <hi>Law.</hi> And therefore when no Churches were gathered, the <hi>Apostles</hi> could have no Church power over them. All that can be pleaded then in order to Church-Government from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100525:121"/>
of the Form of Government as setled by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, must be either from <hi>a supposed inequality among the Apostles themselves, or their superiority over the LXX. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; or from some Rules laid down by Christ in order to the Government of his Church: of which two are the most insisted on,</hi> Matthew 20. 25. Matth. 18. 17. Of these in their Order.</p>
                  <p>The first argument drawn for an established form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> in the Church, from the state of the Apostles under Christ, is, <hi>from a supposed inequality among the Apostles, and the superiority of one as Monarch of the Church;</hi> which is the Papists Plea from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as the chief and head of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Whose loud Exclamations for Saint <hi>Peters</hi> authority a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> much of the same nature with those of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-Smith at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> with his fellow craftsmen, who cried up, Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> not from the honor they bore to her as <hi>Diana,</hi> but from the gain which came to them from her worship at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> But I dispute not now the <hi>entail</hi> of Saint <hi>Peters power,</hi> what ever it was to the <hi>Roman Bishop:</hi> but I onely inquire into the <hi>Pleas</hi> drawn for his authority from the Scriptures, which are written in so small a character, that without the <hi>spectacles</hi> of an implicite Faith, they will scarce appear legible to the Eyes of men. For what though <hi>Christ changed</hi> Saint <hi>Peters name?</hi> must it therefore follow that Christ baptized him Monarch of his Church?

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.—9. 5. No Argument then can be drawn hence, if it would hold but onely a Primacy of Order; and yet even that fails too in the Scriptures changing of the Order so often. <hi>But, say they, whatever becomes of this Order, we have a strong Foundation for Saint</hi> Peters <hi>Power, because Christ said, he would build his Church upon him, Matth.</hi> 16. 17. This were something indeed, if it were proved; but I fear this <hi>Rock</hi> will not hold water, as it is brought by them; nor Saint <hi>Peter</hi> prove to be <hi>that Rock.</hi> For indeed, Was the <hi>Church</hi> built upon Saint <hi>Peter?</hi> then he must be the chief Foundation stone, and <hi>Peter</hi> must build upon himself, and not upon Christ, and all the Apostles upon him; and thus in exalting the Servant, we depress the Master; and in setting a <hi>new Foundation,</hi> we take<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> away the <hi>only Foundation, Iesus Christ.</hi> If by being built upon <hi>Peter,</hi> they mean no more then being built by him as the chief Instrument; it is both a very incongruous Speech, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies nothing more then what was common to him, and the rest of the Apostles, who were all Master-builders in the Church of Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi> calls himself; and in that respect are<note place="margin">Rev, 21. 19.</note> set forth as <hi>the twelve Foundation stones,</hi> in the walls of the <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Rock</hi> then spoken of by Christ, in his Speech to <hi>Peter,</hi> if taken <hi>Doctrinally,</hi> was Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Confession, as many of the Fathers interpret it; if taken <hi>personally,</hi> it was none other but Christ himself, who used a like Speech to this, when he<note place="margin">John 2. 19.</note> said, <hi>Destroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raise it up.</hi> Which words, though spoken by occasion of the material Temple (as those were of <hi>Peters</hi> name) yet Christ understood them of the Temple of his Body, (as here likewise he doth of his person.) <hi>But still they urge, Christ put the Keyes into Saint</hi> Peters <hi>hands,</hi> Matthew, 16. 19. <hi>Now the power of the Keyes doth denote Regal Authority.</hi> I answer, <hi>First,</hi> The Keyes may be given two wayes, either <hi>from a Prince to a Subject,</hi> or <hi>from a City to a Prince.</hi> In this latter acception, they denote principality in the Receiver, but withall inferiority and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the Given: and in this sense, I am so charitable, as to think they will not say that Christ gave the Keyes to <hi>Peter;</hi> it must be then as a Prince to a Subject; and when they are so given, it doth not imply an universal power in the persons
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100525:123"/>

                        </gap>equality of power with them.</hi> For so were the rest of the Apostles with <hi>Peter</hi> in the same power of the Keyes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 23. This-power of the Keyes then was given to <hi>Peter</hi> in a <hi>peculiar manner,</hi> but <hi>nothing peculiar</hi> to him given thereby. <hi>But still there remains another Ward in Saint</hi> Peters <hi>Keyes, and the last foot to the Popes Chair which is</hi> Pasce oves, <hi>Feed my sheep; a charge given particularly to</hi> Peter, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 15.

And afterwards we find <hi>Peter</hi> called <hi>the Apostle of Circumcision,</hi> and <hi>the Apostles sending him</hi>

Such pretences then as these are for such an Extravagant power in the Church of God,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100525:123"/>
from such miserably weak Foundations, for the upholding a corrupt Interest, have given the occasion to that tart <hi>Sarcasm, In Papatu sub</hi> Petri <hi>nudo nomine Satan non amplius Larva.</hi> But that which would seem sufficient to awaken any out of this dream of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> power over the rest of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 1. Mat. 9. 34. Luk. 9. 46.</note> is, the frequent contendings of the twelve Apostles, one among another, Who should be the greatest; and that even after that Christ had said, Upon this Rock will I build my Church, as we may see <hi>Matthew</hi> 20 24. If Christ had conferred such a power on Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> what little ground had there been for the request of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn?</hi> and would not our Saviour rather have told them, the chiefest place was conserred on <hi>Peter</hi> already, then have curbed their ambition in seeking who should be greatest; and would have bid them be subject to <hi>Peter</hi> as their Head and Ruler. We see not then the least foundation for an universal <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the Church of God; and so this form of Government is not determined by any actions or commands of Christ.</p>
                  <p>We come now to consider the pleas of others, who joyn in<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> renouncing any Supream power under Christ, over the Church of God; but differ as to the particular forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church; those who are for an <hi>inequality,</hi> usually fix on the <hi>imparity between the Apostles and the LXX.</hi> Those that are for a <hi>parity</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 25. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. I shall here proceed in the former method, to shew that none of those can prove the Form they contend for as only <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> nor their adversaries prove it <hi>unlawful. First</hi> then for the inequality between the Apostles and the <hi>LXX.</hi> Disciples; by that inequality is meant, either only <hi>an inequality of order;</hi> or else, an <hi>inequality carrying superiority and subordination.</hi> It is evident that the <hi>LXX. disciples</hi> were not of the same <hi>Order</hi> with the <hi>twelve Apostles,</hi> whom Christ had designed for the chief Government of his Church, after his <hi>Ascension;</hi> and in this respect the comparison of the <hi>twelve heads of the Tribes,</hi> and the <hi>seventy Elders,</hi> seems parallel with the <hi>twelve Apostles;</hi> and the <hi>LXX. disciples;</hi> but if by imparity, be meant, that the twelve Apostles had a <hi>superiority of power and jurisdiction</hi> over the <hi>LXX.</hi> disciples; there is not the least evidence or foundation, in Reason or Scripture for it. For
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100525:124"/>
the <hi>LXX.</hi> did not derive their power from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but immediately from <hi>Christ;</hi> they enjoyed the same privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, were sent upon the same message, (making way for<note place="margin">Luke 10. 1.</note> Christs entertainment in the several Cities they went to) yea, all things were parallel between them and the Apostles in their mission (unlesse any difference be made in the Cities they went to, and their number). So that there is no superiority of office in the Apostles, above the <hi>LXX.</hi> nor of power and jurisdiction over them; their Commissions being the same: And it seems most probable that both their missions were only temporary, and after this the <hi>LXX.</hi> remained in the nature of private Disciples, till they were sent abroad by a new Commission after the Resurrection, for preaching the Gospel, and planting Churches. For we see that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves were only <hi>Probationers,</hi> till Christ solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized them for their <hi>Apostolical employment, Matth.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21. when their full Commissions were granted to them, and then indeed they acted with a <hi>plenitude of power,</hi> as Governours of the Church, but not before. Nothing can be inferred then for any necessary standing Rule for Church-government, from any comparison between the Apostles and the <hi>LXX.</hi> during the life of Christ, because both their missiors were temporary and occasional. Only we see, that because Christ did keep up the number of the <hi>twelve</hi> so strictly, that as the <hi>LXX.</hi> were a distinct number from them, so when one was dead, another was to be chosen in his stead (which had been needlesse, if they had not been a distinct Order and Colledge by themselves), it is thence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Apostolical power, was a superiour power to any in the Church; and that such an inequality in Church-Officers as was between them and particular Pastors of Churches, is not contrary to what our Saviour saith, when he forbids that dominion and authority in his Disciples, which was exercised by the Kings of the earth, <hi>Matthew</hi> 20. 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25. which places, because they are brought by some, to take away all inequality among Church-Officers, I shall so far examine the meaning of them, as they are conceived to have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence thereupon. <hi>First</hi> then, I say, that it is not only the <hi>abuse of civil power,</hi> which our Saviour forbids his Disciples,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100525:124"/>
but the <hi>exercise of any such power as that is.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Papists</hi> are mistaken, when from the words of <hi>Luke, Vos autem non sic,</hi> they conclude, <hi>All power</hi> is not forbidden, but only <hi>such a tyrannical power,</hi> as is there spoken of. For those words are not a <hi>limitation</hi> and <hi>modification</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, but a <hi>total prohibition</hi> of it; for <hi>first,</hi> the comparison is not between the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Tyrants,</hi> but between <hi>them and Princes,</hi> yea such as <hi>Luke</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Indeed, had Christ<note place="margin">Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12, 25.</note> said, The Kings of the earth abuse their authority; <hi>vos autem non sic;</hi> then it would have been onely a limitation of the exercise of power; but the meer exercise of civil authority being spoken of before, and then it being subjoyned, <hi>but you not so;</hi> it plainly implyes a forbidding of the power spoken of, in the persons spoken to.

                     </gap>, which import the abuse of their power, which is forbidden. But I answer, <hi>first,</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> it is otherwise; for there it is the simple <gap reason="foreign">

an absolute denyal of giving bills of divorce from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Thirdly;</hi> This no wayes answers to the scope of the Apostles contention, which was meerly about Primacy and Power, and not at all about the abuse of this Power. So that by this place, all affectation and use of a civil, co<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>active, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal power is forbidden to the Officers of the Church; the power of the Church being only a directive, voluntary power; and is rather a <hi>Ministry</hi> then a <hi>Power,</hi> as our Saviour expresseth there, <hi>Matthew</hi> 20. 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 26. But having thus excluded all Civil Power from the Governours of the Church, as such: I say, <hi>secondly,</hi> That this place doth no wayes imply a prohibition of all inequality among the Governours of the Church; which is abundantly cleared by this reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the acknowledgement of all parties, the Apostles had a Superiour power over the ordinary Pastors of Churches; Now if the exercise of all Superiority had been forbidden, this must have been forbidden too; as implying plainly an exercise of authority in some over others in the Church. And therefore <hi>Musculus</hi> thus explains the place: <hi>Non exigit hoc Christus ut omnes in regno suo sint aequales, sed nè quispiam cupiat magnus &amp; primus haberi &amp; videri.</hi> It is not an inequality of Order, but ambition which Christ forbids; and therefore he observes that Christ saith not. Let none be great among you, and none first; which should have been, if all Primacy and Superiority had been forbidden, and a necessity of an equality among Church-Officers: <hi>but he that will be great among you, let him be your Minister.</hi> Let those that are above others, look upon themselves as the servants of others, and not as their masters. For God never bestows any power on any, for the sake of those that have it, but for the sake of those for whom they are employed: When men seek then their own greatnesse, and not the service of the Church, they flatly contradict this Precept of Christ, <hi>But with you it shall not be so.</hi> But however an inequality of Power and Order for the Churches good is not thereby prohibited: Which is sufficient for my purpose.</p>

Christ answers him, <hi>till seventy times seven,</hi> that is, as often as he doth it. And thence Christ brings the parable of the King forgiving his Servants, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Were it meant of any scandalous sin committed with the privacy of any particular person (as many understand trespassing <hi>against thee,</hi> that is, <hi>te conscio</hi>) then this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience must necessarily follow, that matters of scandal must be brought to the Churches cognizance when there can be no way to decide them; that is, when one offends, and only one person knows it; here will be a single affirmation on one side, and denyal on the other side, and so there can be no way to decide it; the matter here spoken of then is somewhat only relating to the offence or injury of some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100525:126"/>
and not a matter of scandal to the whole Church. The Question then as propounded to be spoken to by our Saviour, is, <hi>What is to be done in case of private offences between man and man?</hi> and not in case of secret sins against God, and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the Church? Now to this our Saviour layes down his answer gradually: first, there must be <hi>private admonition;</hi> if that succeed not, <hi>admonition before witnesses;</hi> if not that, <hi>telling the Church;</hi> if not that neither, <hi>reputing him as a Heathen and Publican.</hi> Now in this answer, we must conceive our Saviour speaks as to an ordinary case, so in a way easie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by all that heard him: and therefore he must speak in allusion to what was at that time among the Jews in such cases, which is freely acknowledged both by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>

And certainly, our best way to understand the meaning of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100525:127"/>
Scripture is to consider <hi>what, of whom, to whom</hi> the Scripture speaks; for although the Scripture, as a Rule of Faith for us, be supposed to be so written, as to be easily understood by us, yet as the parcels of it were spoken upon several Occasions, they must be supposed to be so spoken, as to be apprehended by them to whom they were spoken in the common senss of the words, if nothing peculiar be expressed in the Speech, whereby to restrain them to another sense. And therefore the <hi>Church</hi> must be understood in the same sense wherein the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or the <hi>Syriack</hi> answering to it, was apprehended among the Jewes in our Saviours time. Which could not be for any new Consistory or <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to be erected under the Gospel. Thence others conceiving that Christ did speak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custome of the Jewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> understand nothing else but the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and so make the sense of the words to be this. The Case our Saviour speaks to is that of private Quarrels, wherein our Saviour layes down two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in a way of Charity, <hi>private admonition,</hi> and <hi>before witnesses;</hi> but if the party continues refractory, then it may be lawful to convent him before the Courts of Judicature among them, the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> the 23. or the great <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> for although the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken away the power of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in Capital matters, yet they allowed them liberty of judgeing in the case of private quarrels: but if he neglect to hear the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> then it may be lawful to implead him before the <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Province</hi> in his Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, by which Heathens and Publicans were to be judged; which is meant by <hi>Let him be to thee,</hi> not as a brother Jew, but <hi>as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi> This Exposition is said to be first Broached by <hi>Erastus;</hi> but much improved and enlarged by <hi>Reverend Bishop Bilson,</hi> who spends a whole<note place="margin">Thes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 41<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perpetual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> Chapter upon it. But this Exposition though it seems fair and plausible, yet there are several things in it which keep me from imbracing it; as <hi>First,</hi> It seems not very probable that our Saviour should send his Disciples to whom he speaks, to the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> for the ending any Controversies ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing among themselves; knowing how bitter Enemies they wer to all who were the followers of Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it seems not very agreeable with the scope of our Saviours Speech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:100525:128"/>
which was to take up differences as much as may be among his Disciples, and to make them shew all lenity and forherance towards those that had offended them, and to do good to the Souls of those that had injured and provoked them; whereas this command of telling the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and inpleading offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors before Heathen Courts, tends apparently to heighten the bitterness and animosities of Mens spirits one against another: and layes Religion so open to Obloquies, which makes <hi>Paul</hi> so severely reprove the <hi>Christians at Corinth, for going to Law</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 1.—6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>before Heathen Magistrates;</hi> therefore to say that <hi>Christ</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows there going to Law before Heathens, and <hi>Paul</hi> to forbid it, were, instead of finding a way to end the differences among <hi>Christians,</hi> to make one between <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Paul. Thirdly,</hi> the thing chiefly aimed at by <hi>Christ,</hi> is not a mans Vindication of himself, or recovering losses by injuries received, but the recovering and <hi>gaining the offending brother;</hi> which evidently appears by what our Saviour adds to the using admonition in private, <hi>If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</hi> Now <gap reason="foreign">

Our Saviour then speaks not to the manner of proceeding as to civil injuries, which call for <hi>Restitution,</hi> but to such as call for <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> And so the Case I conceive is that of <hi>private Differences and Quarrels</hi> between men, and not <hi>Law-Suites nor civil Causes:</hi> I mean such <hi>Differences</hi> as respect <hi>persons</hi> and not <hi>things,</hi> which our Saviour layes down these Rules for the ending of. And therefore I cannot but wonder to see some men insist so much on that place against such an Exposition of this <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 14. where Christ saith, <hi>Who made me a Iudge, and a Divider among you?</hi> For doth it any wayes follow, Because Christ would not take upon him to be a temporal Judge among the Jewes, therefore he should take no course for the ending differences among his Disciples, and the taking away all animosities from among them? Nay on the contrary doth not our Saviour very often designedly speak to this very purpose, to root out all bitterness, malice, envy, and rancour from mens spirits, and to perswade them to forgive injuries, even to pray for persecutours, and by any
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100525:128"/>
means to be reconciled to their Brethren. Which he makes to be a Duty of so great necessity, <hi>that if a man had brought his gift</hi>

                     <hi>to the Altar, and remembred his brother had ought against him, he bids him leave his gift there, and go, be reconciled to his Brother, and then offer up the Gift.</hi> We see hereby how suitable it was to our Saviours Doctrine and Design to lay down Rules for the ending of any differences arising among his Disciples; and this being now cleared to be the state of the Case, it will not be difficult to resolve what is meant by <hi>telling the Church.</hi> Which I make not to be any <hi>appeal</hi> to a <hi>juridical court,</hi> acting <hi>authoritatively</hi> over the persons brought before it, but the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>highest step of Charity</hi> in a man towards a person that hath offended him, <hi>viz.</hi> That when neither private admonition, nor before two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses would serve to reclaim the offendor, <hi>then to call a select company together</hi> (which is the Natural importance of the word <gap reason="foreign">

Which Sense of the place, I humbly conceive to have the least force in it, and in every part of it to be most genuine and natural, and fully agreeable to the received practice among the Jewes: which the Author of the Book <hi>Musar</hi> cited by <hi>Drusius</hi> fully acquaints<note place="margin">

                     <hi>excommunication</hi> in Christian Churches; for if every particular person might withdraw from the Society of such a one as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues refractory in his Offences, then much more may a whole Society, and the Officers of it declare such a one to be avoided both in religious and familiar civil Society, which is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Nature of Excommunication. Herein we see the wisdom of our Saviour, who in speaking to a particular case, hath laid down such general Rules as are of perpetual use in the Church of God for accommodating differences arising therein. Thus have we hitherto cleared that our Saviour hath determined no more of Church-Govern-ment then what is appliable to a diversity of particular Forms, and so hath not by any Law or practice of his own determined the necessity of any one form.</p>

                     <p>The next thing pleaded for determining the Form of Government, is Apostolical practice; two things inquired into concerning that, What it was? How far it binds? The Apostles invested with the power and authority of Governing the whole Church of Christ by their Commission, <hi>Io. 20. 21.

How the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did divide Provinces; whether <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the circumcision and uncircumcision, and different Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches erected by them in the same Cities? What the Apostles did in order to settling particular Churches? The Names and Office of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons considered. Four gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Considerations laid down about the Apostles practice. First, It cannot be fully known what is was. 2. Great probability, they observe no one certain Form in setling Churches; proved from <hi>Epiphanius, Ierome, Ambrose</hi> or <hi>Hilary.</hi> 3. Their Case different from ours in regard of the paucity of Believers. 4. If granted for any Form, yet proves not the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. For, 1. Offices appointed by them are ceased. Widdows, Deaconesses abolished. 2. Rites and Customs Apostolical grown out of use. 1. Such as were founded upon Apostolical Precepts, Acts 15. 29. considered. 2. Such as were grounded on their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, Holy kiss, Love-feasts, dipping in Baptism, community of goods, with several others.</p>

In which Sense the <hi>Church of England</hi> understands that Expression in the Ordination of Ministers, as it implies onely the conferring thereby an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the preaching of the Gospel, which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by Ordination, is fitly expressed by the same word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which our Saviour used in the conferring the same Power upon his Apostles at his sending them forth to be Gospel-Preachers.</p>
                  <p>After this comes the solemn appointed meeting of Christ with his Disciples at the mountain of <hi>Galilee,</hi> (where in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 16</note>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:100525:131"/>
besides the eleven, were present the five hundered<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 6</note> Brethren at once.) And here Christ more solemnly inaugurates the Apostles in their Office, declaring all power to be in his hands; and therefore appoints the Apostles <hi>to preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi> that is, to all men indefinitely, Gentiles<note place="margin">Mark 16. 15.</note> as well as Jewes, which <hi>Matthew</hi> fully expresseth by all <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 19</note> Now are the Apostles left as chief Governours of the Church under Christ; and in this last Commission wherein the extent of the Apostles power is more fully expressed, there is nothing mentioned of any order for the Government of the Church under them, not what course should be taken by the Church after their decease. All that remains then to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, is what the Apostles practice was, and how far they acted for the determining any one form of Government as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles being thus invested in their authority, we proceed to consider the Exercise of this authority for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of the Church. And here we are to consider, that the Apostles did not presently upon their last Commission from Christ goe forth abroad in the World to Preach, but were commanded by Christ to go first to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there to expect the coming of the Holy Ghost according to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours own appointment, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. And therefore what <hi>Mark</hi> adds, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 20. that after Christs appearance to them, <hi>the Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> went abroad and preached every where, working Miracles,</hi> must either be understood of what they did onely in their way returning from <hi>Galile oo Ierusalem:</hi> or else more probably of what they did indefinitely afterwarps.

For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is plainly nothing else but that <hi>office of the Apostleship</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Iudas,</hi> without any relation to a <hi>Province;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, is that proper place which belonged to <hi>Iudas,</hi> as he is call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the Son of perdition,</hi> and no other. But the very foundation of this mistake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, that the several <hi>Provinces,</hi> into which the Apostles were to go for preaching the Gospel, were distributed among them before they were filled with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which is an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> will not easily be granted by any one that doth but impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these things. That if the <hi>Provinces</hi> were so distributed among them, it must be either before the death of Christ, or after; and it must be before, if <hi>Iudas</hi> had a peculiar <hi>Province</hi> assigned to him, which this Exposition necessarily implyes; but how <hi>Provinces</hi> could be divided among them before they had their Commission given them to preach to all Nations, is somewhat hard to understand. It must be then immediately after Christ had bid them preach to every creature, that they
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100525:132"/>
thus distributed the <hi>Provinces</hi> among them; but several things make this very improbable. <hi>First,</hi> The grosse mistake of the Apostles concerning the very nature of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they jointly ask Christ, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the Kingdom to</hi> Israel? They dream<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> still of a temporal Kingdom, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of the Jews; and, Is it probable they should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute among themselves the several <hi>Provinces</hi> for Preaching the Gospel, who thought that Christs Kingdom would have been established by other means then going up and down the World? They looked that Christ himself should do it by his own power, <hi>Wilt thou at this time,</hi> &amp;c. and did not think it must be done by their means; much lesse by their single going into such vast parts of the World, as the twelve divisions of the World would be. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appears very improbable any such division of <hi>Provinces</hi> should be made then, when they were commanded to stay at <hi>Ierùsalem,</hi> and not to stir thence till the promise of the Spirit was fulfilled upon them. <hi>Tarry ye in the City of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>till ye be endued with power from on high,</hi> Luke 24. 49. <hi>And being assembled together with them, be commanded them not to depart from</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>but wait for the promise of the Father,</hi> Acts 1. 4. Is it likely, when the Apostles were thus straightly charged not to leave <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> till they were endued with the power of the Holy Ghost, they should contrive the dispersing themselves abroad all over the World? especially when Christ told them, that it should be after the coming of the Spirit that they should go abroad, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 8. and that the Spirit should fit them for their work, (<hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 26, 27. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 13.) <hi>by teaching them, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Christ. Thirdly,</hi> If such a distribution of <hi>Provinces</hi> had been made so early among the Apostles, how comes it to passe, that after they were endued with the Holy Ghost, they did not every one betake himself to his several <hi>Province?</hi> there could have been then no plea nor excuse made for their stay any longer at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> after the promise of the Spirit was fulfilled upon them. And yet after the persecution raised at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when most of the Church were dispersed abroad, we find the Apostles remaining still at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Acts 8. 1, 14. Would they have been so long absent from their charge, if
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100525:132"/>
any such distribution had been made among themselves? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Apostles occasional going to places as they did, argues there was no such set division of <hi>Provinces</hi> among them. The first departure of any of the Apostles from <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> was that of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who were sent by common order of the Apostles to <hi>Samaria,</hi> after they heard that by <hi>Philips</hi> preaching, they had received the Word of God.<note place="margin">Acts 8. 14.</note> Not the least mention of any peculiar <hi>Province</hi> of theirs which they were sent to. So <hi>Peters</hi> going from <hi>Ioppa</hi> to <hi>Casarea,</hi> was occasioned by <hi>Cornelius</hi> his sending for him.<note place="margin">Acts 10. 5, 32.</note> 
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That <hi>Provinces</hi> were not divided, appears, because of so frequent reading of many of the Apostles being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place: first the whole twelve at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> after that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> together at <hi>Samaria;</hi> about four years after <hi>Pauls</hi> conversion, we met with <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 18, 19.</note> at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> fourteen years after this, we find <hi>Iames, Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> there. Is it any wayes probable, if all<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 1, 9.</note> these had their distinct <hi>Provinces</hi> assigned then, they should be so often found together at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which certainly must belong but to the Province of one of them? <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It seems evident that they divided not the World into Provinces among them, because it was so long before they thought it to be their duty to preach unto the <hi>Gentiles; Peter</hi> must have a Vision first before he will go to <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 10. 11.</note> and as yet we see they retained that perswasion, <hi>that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for a Iew to keep company, or come unto one that is of another Nation, Acts</hi> 10. 28. Nay more then this, <hi>Peter</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for this very action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the Apostles at <hi>Ierusalem, Acts</hi> 11. 2, 3. and they laid this a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the ground of their quarrel, that he went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them: how this is reconcilable with the whole Worlds being divided into <hi>Provinces</hi> so early among the Apostles, is not easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: unlesse some of them thought it unlawful to go to their own <hi>Provinces,</hi> which certainly must be of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, most of them. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Another evidence that <hi>Provinces</hi> were not divided so soon, is, that <hi>Peters province</hi> so much spoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the circumcision, fell not to his share, till near twenty years after this time we now speak of, upon the agreement between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> then we see thought not himself excluded from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Jews, because they were <hi>St. Peters</hi> Province.

I deny not but at the meeting of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when they observed how God did blesse the one most in the circumcision, the other in the uncircumcision, there was an agreement between them, for the one to lay out his pains chiefly upon the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the other upon the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> and in probability where they met in any City, the one gathered a <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the other of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but this makes no such distinction of Provinces, as to exclude the one from the others charge: and further, this agreement between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> then after both had preached so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, makes it fully clear, that the pretended division of Provinces so early among the Apostles, is only the wind-egge of a working Fancy, that wants a shell of Reason to cover it. As for the division of Provinces mentioned in Ecclesiastical Writers, though as to some few they generally agree; as that <hi>Thomas</hi> went to <hi>Parthia, Andrew</hi> to <hi>Scythia, Iohn</hi> to the<note place="margin">

                  <p>Having shewed that the Apostles observed no set-order<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> for distributing <hi>Provinces,</hi> we come to shew what course they took for the setling of Churches in the places they went to. In the clearing of which, nothing is more necessary then to free our judgements of those prejudices and prepossessions, which the practice either of the former ages of the Church, or our own have caused within us. For it is easie to observe, that nothing hath been a more fruitful mother of mistakes and errours, then the looking-upon the practice of the primitive Church through the glass of our own customs. Especially when under the same name, (as it is very often seen) something far different from what was primarily intended by the use of the word, is set forth to us. It were no difficult task to multiply examples in this kind, wherein men meeting with the same names, do apprehend the same things by them, which they now through custome signifie, without taking notice of any alteration in the things themselves signified by those names. Thus since the name <hi>Missa</hi> was appropriated by
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100525:134"/>
the <hi>Papists</hi> to that which they call the Sacrifice of the Altar, wherever they meet among ancient Writers with that Name, they presently conceive the same thing was understood by it then. Whereas it was then only taken for the publike Service of the Church, so called from the dismission of the people after<note place="margin">

For though they innovated things never so much, yet it hath been alwayes the Policy of that Church not to innovate names, that so the incautelous might be better deceived with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of antiquity; and thus under the anciently simple name of <hi>Missa,</hi> lyes at this day couched a <hi>Masse</hi> of errours.

For which we are to take notice, how much our Saviour in the New Testament did delight to take up the received practices among the Jews only, with such alterations of them as were suitable to the Nature and Doctrine of Christianity, as hath been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifested by many learned men, about the Rites of the Lords Supper, taken from the <hi>post-coenium</hi> among<note place="margin">

As to which things, it may be observed, that those Rites which our Saviour transplanted into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-soyl, were not such as were originally founded on <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, but were introduced by a confederate Discipline among themselves. And thus it was in reference to the government of the Synagogues among them; for although the reason of erecting them was grounded on a command in the Levitical Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 3. where holy Convocations are required upon the Sabbath-dayes; yet the building of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues in the Land, was not, as far as we can find, till a great while after. For although <hi>Moses</hi> require the duty of assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, yet he prescribes no orders for the place of meeting, nor for the manner of spending those dayes in Gods service, nor for the persons who were to super-intend the publike worship performed at that time. These being duties of a moral nature, are left more undetermined by <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, which is most punctual in the Ceremonial part of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And therefore even then when God did determine the positives of Worship, we see how much he left the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of morals to the wisdom and discretion of Gods people, to order them in a way agreeable to the mind and will of God. We shall not here discourse of the more elder Customs and observations of the Synagogues, but take the draught of them by the best light we can about our Saviours time, when the Apostles copyed out the Government of Christian-Churches by them.</p>
                  <p>About the time of Christ, we find Synagogues in very great request among the Jews; God so disposing it, that the moral part of his service should be more frequented now the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial

was expiring; and by those places so erected, it might be more facile and easie for the Apostles to disperse the Gospel by preaching it in those places, to which it was the custome for the people to resort. And as <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> observing the Altar inscribed <gap reason="foreign">

Now the persons thus ordained with this power onely, were thereby no Members of any civil Court of Judicature, nor thereby made capable of it: it appears then that this Ordination was peculiar to a particular function, which exactly answers to the Ministerial Office under the Gospel.

So it was in all the <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> among the Jews, and in all well-ordered Senates and Councils in the World.

Which things, as I have already observed, God hath looked on to be so natural to man, as when he was most strict and punctual in ceremonial Commands, he yet left these things wholly at liberty. For we read not of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that in the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> one should have some peculiarity of honour above the rest; this mens natural reason would prompt them to, by reason of a necessary priority of Order in some above others; which the very instinct of Nature hath taught irrational creatures, much more should the Light of Reason direct men to. But yet all order is not power, nor all power juridical, nor all juridical power a sole power; therefore it is a meer Paralogism in any from Order to inferr power, or from a delegated power by consent, to inferr a juridical power by Divine Right; or lastly, from a power in common with others, to deduce a power excluding others. All which they are guilty of, who meerly from the name of an <hi>Archisynagogue,</hi> would fetch a perpetual necessity of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction

                  <p>Having thus far represented the Jewish Synagogue, that<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> the Idea of its government may be formed in our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we now come to consider how far, and in what the Apostles in forming Christian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Churches did follow the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Jewish Synagogue. Which is a notion not yet so far improved as I conceive it may be, and I know no one more conducible to the happy end of composing our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, touching the government of the Church then this is. I shall therefore for the full clearing of it, premise some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral considerations to make way for the entertainment of this <hi>hypothesis</hi> in mens minds, at least as probable; and then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour particularly to shew how the <hi>Apostles</hi> did observe the model of the Synagogue; <hi>in its publike service, in ordination of Church Officers, in forming Presbyteries in the several Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in ruling and governing those Presbyteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> The general consideration I premise, to shew the probability of what I am asserting, shall be from these things: <hi>from the community of name and customs between the believing Iews and others, at the first forming of Churches: from the Apostles forming Churches out of Synagogues in their travelling abroad; from the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse of that model of Government to the State of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches at that time.</hi> I begin with the first, <hi>From the community of names and customs between the believing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Iews at the first forming Churches.</hi> All the while our blessed Saviour was living in the World, Christ and his Disciples went still under the name of Jews; they neither renounced the name, nor the customs in use among them. Our Saviour goes up to the <hi>Feasts</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> conforms to all the Rites and Customs in use then; not only those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God himself, but those taken up by the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if not contrary to Gods commands, as in observing the feast of Dedication, in going into their Synagogues, and teaching so often there, in washing the Feet of the Disciples,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100525:142"/>
(a custome used by them before the Passeover) in using baptism, for the proselyting men to the profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In these and other things our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the received practice among them, though the things themselves were no wayes commanded by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And after his Resurrection, when he took care for the forming of a Church upon the doctrine he had delivered, yet we find not the Apostles withdrawing from communion with the Jews, but on the contrary, we find the Disciples fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Temple, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 20, 21, 26. Whereby it appears how they owned themselves as Jews still, observing the same both time and place for publike Worship which were in use among the Jews. We find <hi>Paul</hi> presently after his conversion in the Synagogues, preaching<note place="margin">Acts 9. 20.</note> that Christ whom he had before persecuted; and where ever he goes abroad afterwards, we find him still entering into the Synagogues to preach; where we cannot conceive he should have so free and easie admission, unlesse the Jews did look upon him as one of their own Religion, and observing the same customs in the Synagogues with themselves, only<note place="margin">Acts 13. 5, 14. 17. 10. 18. 4. 19. 8.</note> differing in the point of the coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and the obligation of the ceremonial Law, the least footsteps of which were seen in the Synagogue-worship. But that which yet further clears this, is the general prejudice of the Disciples against the Gentiles, even after the giving of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as appears by their contending with <hi>Peter</hi> for going in to men<note place="margin">Acts 11. 3.</note> uncircumcised. It is evident, that then the Apostles themselves did not clearly apprehend the extent of their Commission; for else what made <hi>Peter</hi> so shy of going to <hi>Corn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore we see the necessity of circumcision much pressed by the believing Jews which came down from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which raised so high a Dispute, that a Convention of the Apostles<note place="margin">Acts 15. 1.</note> together at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was called for the ending of it; And even there we find great heats before the businesse could be decided, <gap reason="foreign">

Might not they have been charged as well as <hi>Paul</hi> with relinquishing <hi>the customs,</hi> if they had thrown off the model of the Jewish Synagogue, and take up some customes different from that?

the Jews and Christians. Thence we read in the time of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> when the Edict came out against the Jews, <hi>Aquila</hi> and<note place="margin">Acts 18. 2,</note>

But <hi>Marcellus Donatus</hi> conjectures this <hi>Christus</hi> to have been some seditious Jew called by that name; for which he brings many <hi>Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> wherein the name occurrs, but none wherein it is given to a Jew; which should be first produced, before we leave the received interpretation of it. However that be, we see the Jews and Christians equally undergo the punishment without any difference observed in them; and therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> was brought before <hi>Gallio</hi> the <hi>Proconsul</hi> of <hi>Achaia,</hi> he looked upon the difference between the Jews and <hi>Paul</hi> to be only <hi>a Question of words and names, and of their Law,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act. 18. 15.</hi> Apud. Orig. lib. 3. cont. Cels.</note> refused to meddle with it. And so <hi>Celsus</hi> upbraids both Jews and Christians, as though their contentions were about a matter of nothing. By all this we may now consider, how little the Christians did vary from the customs and practice of the Jews, when they were thought by those who were equally enemies to both, to be of the same body and community. Which consideration will make the thing I aim at, seem more probable, when withall we observe that the Jewish customs in their Synagogues, were those whereby they were most known among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and therefore when they looked on the Christians as of the same Religion with the Jews, it is evident they observed no difference as to their publick pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100525:143"/>
in their religious Societies. Which is the first conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to shew how probable it is that Christians observed the same form in Government with what they found in the Synagogues.</p>
                  <p>To which I add a <hi>second</hi> Consideration; which is the<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> Apostles forming Christian Churches out of Jewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. We have already shewed how much their resort was to them in their preaching from the constant practice of <hi>Paul,</hi> although he was in a more peculiar manner the <hi>Apostle of the uncircumcision;</hi> much more then is it probable that the others, especially <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> did resort to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. And in the setling things at first, we see how fearful the Apostles were of giving offence to the Jews, how ready to condescend to them in any thing they lawfully might. And can we think that <hi>Paul</hi> would yield so far to the Jews as to circumcise <hi>Timothy,</hi> rather then give offence to the Jews in<note place="margin">Acts 16 3.</note> those parts where he was, (and that in a thing which seemed most immediately to thwart the design of the Gospel, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note> did, witness the Apostle himself;) that yet he would scruple the retaining the old model of the Synagogue, when there was nothing in it at all repugnant to the Doctrine of the Gospel, or the nature and constitution of Christian Churches? When the Apostles then, did not only gather Churches out of Synagogues, but at some places in probability whole Synagogues were converted as well as whole Churches formed, What shew of reason can be given why the Apostles should flight the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Jewish Synagogues, which had no dependance on the Jewish Hierarchy, and subsisted not by any command of the ceremonial Law? The work of the Synagogue not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Priest as such, but as persons qualified for instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, and the first model of the Synagogue government is with a great deal of probability derived from the <hi>Schools of the Prophets</hi> and the Government thereof. This consideration would be further improved, if the notion of distinct <hi>coetus</hi> of the Jewish and Gentile Christians in the same places could be made out by any irrefragable Testimony of Antiquity, or clear evidence of reason drawn from Scripture: Because the same reason which would ground the distinction of the Jewish Church from the Gentile, would likewise hold for the Jewish
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100525:144"/>
Church to retain her old form of Government in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue way. For it must be some kind of peculiarity supposed by the Jews in themselves as distinct from the Gentiles, which did make them form a distinct Congregation from them; which peculiarity did imply the observing those customes among them still, by which that peculiarity was known to others; among which those of the Synagogue were not the least known or taken notice of. But I must freely confesse, I find not any thing brought by that learned Person, who hath managed this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> with the greatest dexterity, to have<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> of Schism <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> that evidence in it which will command assent from an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicated mind. And it is pitty that such infirm <hi>Hypotheses</hi> should be made use of for the justifying our separation from <hi>Rome,</hi> which was built upon reasons of greater strength and evidence, then those which have been of late pleaded by some assertors of the Protestant Cause, though men of excellent abilities and learning. For there are many reasons convictive enough, that <hi>Peter</hi> had no universal power over the Church, supposing that there was no such thing as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between the Jewish and Gentile <hi>Coetus.</hi> I deny not but at first, before the Jews were fully satisfied of the Gentiles right to Gospel priviledges, they were very shy of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with them, especially the believing Jews of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,:</hi> Upon the occasion of some of whom coming down to <hi>Antioch</hi> from <hi>Iames,</hi> it was, that <hi>Peter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew and separated himself from the Gentiles,</hi> with whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 12.</note> he familiarly conversed. Which action of his is so far from being an <hi>argument</hi> of the setling any distinct Church<note place="margin">Schism <hi>sect.</hi> 8.</note> of the Jews from the Gentiles there, that it yields many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against it. For <hi>first, Peters</hi> withdrawing was only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional, and not out of design; whereas, had it been part of his commission to do it, we cannot conceive <hi>Peter</hi> so mindlesse of his Office, as to let it alone till some Jews came down from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to tell him of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was not for the sake of the Jews at <hi>Antioch</hi> that he withdrew, but for the Jews which came down from <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> whereas, had he intended a distinct Church of the Jews, he would before have setled and fixed them as members of another body; but now it evidently appears, that not only <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100525:144"/>
but the Jews with him, did before those Jews coming to <hi>Antioch</hi> associate with the Gentiles, which is evident by <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>And other Iews dissembled likewise with him, in so much that Barnabas also was carryed away with their dissimulation.</hi> Whereby it is clear, that these Jews did before joyn with the Gentile-Christians, or else they could not be said to be led away with the dissimulation of <hi>Peter. Thirdly,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> is so far from looking upon this withdrawing of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> society to be a part of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Office, that he openly and sharply reproves him for it. What then, was <hi>Paul</hi> so ignorant, that there must be two distinct Churches of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> there, that he calls this action of his <hi>dissimulation?</hi> In all reason then, supposing this Notion to be true, the blame lights on <hi>Paul,</hi> and not on <hi>Peter:</hi> as not understanding, that the Jews were to be formed into distinct bodies from the Gentile-Christians.

What is further produced out of <hi>Antiquity</hi> to this purpose, hath neither evidence nor pertinency enough, to stop the passage of one who is returning from this digression to his former matter.

But instead of that, it was most suitable and agreeable to the state of the Churches in Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical times, which was the <hi>third consideration</hi> to make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Synagogue form of Government was used by the Christians. And the suitablenesse of this Government to the Churches, lay in the conveniency of it for the attaining all ends of Government in that condition wherein the Churches were at that time. For Church Officers acting then either in gathering or governing Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any authority from Magistrates, such a way of Government was
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100525:145"/>
most suitable to their several Churches, as whereby the Churches might be governed, and yet have no dependancy upon the secular power, which the way of Government in the Synagogues was most convenient for; for the Jews, though they enjoyed a bare permission from the civil state where they lived, yet by the exercise of their Synagogue Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were able to order all affairs belonging to the service of God, and to keep all members belonging to their several Synagogues in unity and peace among themselves. The case was the same as to Synagogues and Churches; these subsisted by the same permission which the others enjoyed; the end of these was the service of God, and preserving that order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them which might best become societies so constituted; there can be no reason then assigned, why the Apostles in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling particular Churches should not follow the Synagogue in its model of Government. These things may suffice to make it appear probable that they did so, which is all these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tend to.</p>
                  <p>Having thus prepared the way by making it probable, I<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> now further enquire into the particular part of Government, and what orders in the Synagogue were, which there is any evidence for, that the Apostles did take up and follow. Here I begin with the thing first propounded, <hi>The orders of publick Worship,</hi> which did much resemble those of the Synagogue; Only with those alterations which did arise from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of Christianity. That the Christians had their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and set<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>meetings for the service of God, is evident from the first rising of a society constituted upon the account of Christianity. We read of the <hi>three thousand</hi> converted by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>That they continued in the Apostles doctrine and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>fellowship, and breaking of bread, and prayers.</hi> Where we have all that was observed in the Synagogue, and somewhat more; here there is publick joyning together, implyed in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, their solemn prayers expressed, which were constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed in the Synagogue; instead of reading the Sections of the Law and Prophets, we have the Apostles teaching by immediate inspiration; and to all these as the proper service of Christianity, is set down the celebration of the Lords-sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which we shall seldome or ever in the Primitive Church,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100525:146"/>
read the publick service on Lords Dayes performed without. During the Apostolical times, in which there was such a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flood of extraordinary gifts overflowing the Church, in the publick meeting we find those persons who were indued with those gifts, to be much in exercising them (as to the custom, agreeing with the Synagogue; but, as to the gifts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it) concerning the ordering of which for the publick edification of the Church, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> layes down so many Rules in the fourteenth Chapter to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> but assoon as this flood began to abate, which was then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the quicker softening the World for receiving Christianity, the publick service began to run in its former channel, as is apparent from the unquestionable testimonies of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who most fully relate to us, the order of publick Worship used among the Christians at that time. <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> the most ancient next to <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> (whose Epistle is lately recovered to the Christian World) of the unquestionable Writers of the Primitive Church, gives us a clear Narration of the publick Orders observed by the Church in his time: <gap reason="foreign">

So the Jewish Doctors tell us <gap reason="foreign">

The Priest that was found defective, put on mourning garments, and so went forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that was not, put on white, and went in and ministred with the Priests his Brethren. And when no fault was found in the sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>they observed a festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val solemnity for it.

The <hi>second,</hi> is, That the great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> had this inspection over, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Priests before their admission; For what that Learned man <hi>Const.

                        <hi>Not in Cod. Middoth. p.</hi> 187, 188.</note> on these things, is overthrown by the very words of the <hi>Talmudists</hi> already cited. The last thing observable, is, The garments which the Priests put on, <hi>viz. white rayment</hi> upon his approbation by the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and soon after they were admitted into the Temple with great joy; to which our saviour manifestly alludes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 4. 5. <hi>Thou hast a few names even in</hi> Sardis <hi>which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be cloathed in white Rayment.</hi> But the Priests under the Law, were never ordained by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, as the Elders and Rulers of the Synagogue
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100525:147"/>
were; and if any of them came to that Office, they as well as others had peculiar designation and appointment to it. It is then a common mistake to think that the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel succeed by way of correspondence and Analogy to the Priests under the Law; which mistake hath been the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and original of many Errors. For when in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, the name of Priests came to be attributed to Gospel-Ministers from a fair Complyance (as was thought then) of the Christians onely to the name used both among Jewes and Gentiles; in process of time, corruptions increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the Church, those names that were used by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians by way of Analogy and Accommodation, brought in the things themselves primarily intended by those names; so by the Metaphorical names of Priests and Altars, at last came up the sacrifice of the Mass; without which, they thought the names of Priests and Altar were insignificant. This mistake we see run all along through the Writers of the Church, assoon as the name Priests was applyed to the Elders of the Church, that they derived their succession from the Priests of <hi>Aarons</hi>

The scope and drift of his Epistle, is to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise the arrogance of one who made Deacons superiour to Presbyters. <hi>Audio quendam in tantam erupisse vecordiam ut Diaconos Presbyteris,</hi> id est, <hi>Episcopis anteferret,</hi> and so spends a great part of the Epistle, to prove that a Bishop and Presbyter are the same; and at last brings in these words; giving the account, Why <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> mentions no Presbyters; <hi>Quia in Episcopo &amp; Presbyter continetur.

                     <hi>Curatores urbis,</hi> and set the <hi>Praefectus</hi> in an Office above them. Such an incongruity is scarce incident to a man of very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary esteem for intellectuals, much less to such a one as <hi>Ierome</hi> is reputed to be. The plain meaning then of <hi>Ierome</hi> is no more but this, that <hi>as</hi> Aaron <hi>and his sons in the order of Priesthood were above the Levites under the Law: So the Bishops and Presbyters in the order of the Evangelical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are above the Deacons under the Gospel.</hi> For the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison runs not between <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons under the Law, and Bishops and Presbyters under the Gospel; but between <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes as one part of the comparison under the Law, and the Levites under them as the other; so under the Gospel, Bishops and Presbyters make one part of the comparison, answering to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes in that wherein they all agree; <hi>viz. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Priest hood;</hi> and the other part under the Gospel is that of Deacons answering to the Levites under the Law. The Opposition is not then in the power of jurisdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bishops and Priests, but between the same power of Order, which is alike both in Bishops and Presbyters (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the acknowledgement of all) to the Office of Deacons which stood in Competition with them. Thus I hope we have left <hi>Ierome</hi> at perfect Harmony with himself, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the attempt made to make him so palpably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himself; which having thus done, we are at liberty to proceed in our former course; onely hereby we see how unhappily those arguments succeed which are brought from the Analogy between the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priest hood, to endeavour the setting up of a <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of a parallel superiority under the Gospel. All which arguments are taken off by this one thing we are now upon, <hi>viz.</hi> that the orders and degrees under the Gospel, were not taken up from Analogy to the Temple, but to the Synagogue: Which we now make out as to Ordination, in three things; <hi>the manner of conferring it, the persons authorized to do it, the remaining effect of it upon the person receiving it.</hi>

But the most solemn and peculiar use of this Imposition of hands among the Jews was in the designing of any Persons for any publike imployment among them: Not as though the bare Imposition of hands, did conferre any power upon the Person, (no more then the bare delivery of a thing in Law gives a legall Title to it,

Which is a thing deserving consideration by those who use the rite of imposing hands in Ordination, without any thing expressing that authority they convey by that Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This custome being so generally in use among the Jews in the time when the Apostles were sent forth with Authority for gathering and setling Churches, we find them accordingly making use of this, according to the former practice, either in any more solemn invocation of the presence of God upon any persons, or designation and appointing them for any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar service or function: For we have no ground to think that the Apostles had any peculiar command for laying on their hands upon persons in Prayer over them, or Ordination of them: But the thing its self being enjoyned them, <hi>viz.</hi> the setting apart some persons for the peculiar work of attendance upon the necessities of the Churches by them planted, they took up and made use of a laudable Rite and Custome then in use upon such occasions.

So that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie is not such as should divide the Church. For those that are for ordinations only by a Superiour order in the Church, acknowledging a radical power for ordination in Presbyters, which may be exercised in case of necessity, do thereby make it evident, that none who grant that, do think that any positive Law of God hath forbidden Presbyters the power of ordination; for then it must be wholly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and so in case of necessity it cannot be valid. Which Doctrine I dare with some confidence assert to be a stranger to our Church of <hi>England,</hi> as shall be largely made appear afterwards. On the other side, those who hold ordinations by Presbyters lawful, do not therefore hold them necessary, but it being a matter of liberty, and not of necessity (Christ having no where said that none but Presbyters shall ordain) this power then may be restrained by those who have the care of the Churches Peace; and matters of liberty being restrained, ought to be submitted to, in order to the Churches Peace.

Thirdly,</hi> had Episcopacy been instituted on the occasion of the schism at <hi>Corinth,</hi> certainly of all places, we should the soonest have heard of a Bishop at <hi>Corinth</hi> for the remedying of it; and yet almost of all places, those <hi>Heralds</hi> that derive the succession of Bishops from the Apostles times, are the most plunged, whom to fix on at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> And they that can find any one single Bishop at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>

which came up upon the occasion of so many schisms; it is something therefore consequent upon the first setting up Episcopacy, which is the general obtaining of it in the Churches of Christ, when they saw its usefulness in order to the Churches peace; therefore the Emphasis lies not in <hi>decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est,</hi> but <hi>in toto orbe;</hi> noting how suddenly this order met with universal acceptance when it first was brought up in the Church after the Apostles death.

After this when the Apostles were taken out of the way, who kept the main power in their own hands of ruling the several Presbyteries, or delegated some to do it (who had a main hand in the planting Churches with the Apostles, and thence are called in Scripture some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Fellow-labourers in the Lord, and sometimes Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, and by <hi>Theodoret</hi> Apostles, but of a second order) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I say, these were deceased, and the main power left in the Presbyteries, the several Presbyters enjoying an equal power among themselves, especially being many in one City, thereby great occasion was given to many schisms, partly by the bandying of the Presbyters one against another, partly by the sidings of the people with some against the rest, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the too common use of the power of ordinations in Presbyters, by which they were more able to increase their own party, by ordaining those who would joyn with them, and by this means to perpetuate schisms in the Church; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, when the wiser and graver sort considered the abuses following the promiscuous use of this power of ordination;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100525:156"/>
and withall having in their minds the excellent frame of the Government of the Church under the Apostles, and their Deputies, and for preventing of future schisms and divisions among themselves, they unanimously agreed to choose one out of their number, who was best qualified for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so great a trust, and to devolve the exercise of the power of ordination and jurisdiction to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet so as that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct nothing of importance, without the consent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Presbyters, who were still to be as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council to the Bishop. This I take to be the true and just account of the Original of Episcopacy in the Primitive Church according to <hi>Ierome:</hi> Which model of Government thus contrived and framed, sets forth to us a most lively cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of that great Wisdom and Moderation, which then ruled the heads and hearts of the Primitive Christians; and which, when men have searched and studyed all other wayes, (the abuses incident to this Government, through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of men and times being retrenched) will be found the most agreeable to the Primitive form, both as asserting the due interest of the Presbyteries, and allowing the due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Episcopacy, and by the joynt harmony of both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the affairs of the Church with the greatest Unity, Concord, and Peace. Which form of Government I cannot see how any possible reason can be produced by either party, why they may not with chearfulness embrace it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> another evidence that <hi>Ierome</hi> by <hi>decretum est</hi> did not mean an order of the Apostles themselves, is by the words which follow the matter of the decree, <hi>viz. Ut unus de Presbyteris electus superponeretur caeteris,</hi> one chosen not only <hi>out of,</hi> but <hi>by</hi> the Presbyters, should be set above the rest; for so <hi>Ierome</hi> must be understood; for the Apostles could not themselves choose out of all Presbyteries one person to be set above the rest; and withall the instance brought of the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> makes it evident to be meant of the choosing by the Presbyters, and not by the Apostles. Besides, did <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> mean choosing by the Apostles, he would have given some intimations of the hand the Apostles had in it: which we see not in him the least ground for. And as for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that <hi>Ecclesiae consuetudo</hi> is <hi>Apostolica traditio,</hi> I have
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100525:156"/>
already made it appear that <hi>Apostolica traditio</hi> in <hi>Ierome,</hi> is nothing else but <hi>Consuetudo Ecclesiae,</hi> which I shall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by a pregnant and unanswerable testimony out of <hi>Ierome</hi> himself. <hi>Unaquaeque provincia abundet in sensu suo, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta</hi>

Thus we have once more cleared <hi>Ierome</hi> and the truth together; I only wish all that are of his judgement for the practice of the primitive Church, were of his temper for the practice of their own; and while they own not Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy as necessary by a divine right, yet (being duly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, and joyned with Presbyteries) they may embrace it, as not only a lawful, but very useful constitution in the Church of God. By which we may see what an excellent temper may be found out, most fully consonant to the primitive Church for the management of ordinations, and Church power, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Presidency of the Bishop and the concurrence of the Presbyterie. For the Top-gallant of Episcopacy can never be so well managed for the right steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ship of the Church, as when it is joyned with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-sails of a Moderate Presbyterie. So much shall suffice to speak here as to the power of ordination, which we have found to be derived from the Synagogue, and the customes observed in it, transplanted into the Church.</p>
                  <p>There are yet some things remaining as to Ordination,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> wherein the Church did imitate the Synagogue, which will admit of a quick dispatch, as <hi>the number of the persons,</hi> which under the Synagogue were alwaies to be at least <hi>three.</hi> This being a fundamental constitution among the<note place="margin">

regular Ordination. The last thing as to Ordination bearing Analogy to the Synagogue, is the <hi>effect of this Ordination upon the person:</hi> It was the Custom of the Jews, to speak of all that were legally Ordained among them, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>and the Divine Presence or</hi> Schecinah <hi>rested upon them,</hi> which sometimes they called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> supposed to be in a peculiar manner present after this solemn Separation of them from others in the world, and Dedication of them unto God. Answerable to this may that of our Saviour be, when he gives his Apostles authority to preach the Gospel, he doth it in that Form of words, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost,</hi> and<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> then gives them the power of binding and loosing, usually conveyed in the Jewish Ordinations. <hi>Whose sins ye remit, they</hi>

                        <hi>v.</hi> 29.</note> 
                     <hi>are remitted; and whose sins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> So that as under the Law, they by their Ordination received a moral Faculty or Right to exercise that power they were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to; so under the Gospel, all who are Ordained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gospel Rules, have a right, authority and power conveyed thereby for the dispensing of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Which right and power must not be conceived to be an internal indelible Character, as the Papists groundlesly conceive, but a moral legal Right, according to the Lawes of Christ, because the persons Ordaining do not act in it in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but a moral Capacity, and so the effect must be moral and not physical, which they must suppose it to be, who make it a Character, and that indelible. Thus much may serve to clear how Ordination in all its circumstances was derived from the Jewish Synagogue.</p>

                     </gap> have to say then concerning the course taken by the Apostles in setling the Government of the Churches, (under which will be contained the full Resolution of what I promised, as to the correspondency to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue in the Government of Churches) lies in these three Propositions, which I now shall endeavour to clear, <hi>viz. That neither can we have that certainty of Apostolical practice which is necessary to Constitute a Divine right; nor</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Is it probable that the Apostles did tye themselves up to any one fixed course in modelling Churches; nor thirdly, if they did, doth it necessarily follow that we must observe the same.</hi> If these three considerations be fully cleared, we may see to how little purpose it is to Dispute the Significancy and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of words and names as used in Scripture, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the main quarrel hath been about. I therefore begin with the first of these, <hi>That we cannot arrive to such an absolute certainty what course the Apostles took in Governing Churches as to inferr from thence the only Divine Right of that one Form which the several parties imagine comes the nearest to it.</hi> This I shall make out from these following arguments. <hi>First,</hi> from the equivalency of the names, and the doubtfulness of their signification from which the Form of Government used in the New Testament should be determined. That the Form of Government must be derived from the Importance of the names of Bishop and Presbyter, is hotly pleaded on both sides. But if there can be no certain way sound out whereby to come to a Determination of what the certain Sense of those names is in Scripture, we are never like to come to any certain Knowledge of the things signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those names. Now there is a fourfold equivalency

of the names Bishop and Presbyter taken notice of 1. That<note place="margin">

By this variety of Interpretation of the Equivalency of the names of Bishop and Presbyter, we may see how far the argument from the promiscuous use of the names is from the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie in hand; unless some evident arguments be withall brought, that the Equivalency of the words cannot possibly be meant in any other Sense, then that which they contend for. Equivocal words can never of themselves determine what Sense they are to be taken in, because they are Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal, and so admit of different Senses. And he that from the use of an Equivocal word would inferr the necessity onely
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100525:159"/>
of one sense, when the word is common to many, unless some other argument be brought inforcing that necessity, will be so far from perswading others to the same belief, that he will only betray the weakness and shortness of his own reason.

All that can be infer'd from the promiscuous sense of the words, is, that they may be understood only in this sense; but it must be proved that they can be understood in no other sense, before any one particular form of Government as necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nay, if in the Prophetical style, an unity may be set down by way of representation of a multitude: what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can be brought from the name, that by it some one particular person must be understood? And by this means<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> may avoid being charged <hi>with leaving his first Love,</hi> which he must of necessity be, by those that make him the Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> at the time of writing these Epistles. Neither is this any wayes solved by the Answer given, that the name <hi>Angel</hi> is representative of the whole Church, and so there is no necessity, the Angel should be personally guilty of it. For <hi>first,</hi> it seems strange that the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100525:160"/>
whole diffusive body of the Church should be charged with a crime by the name of the <hi>Angel,</hi> and he that is particularly meant by that name should be free from it. As if a Prince should charge the Maior of a Corporation as guilty of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and by it should only mean that the Corporation was guilty, but the Maior was innocent himself. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy things in the Epistles be directed to the Angel, but yet so as to concern the whole body, then of necessity the Angel must be taken as Representative of the Body; and then, why may not the word <hi>Angel</hi> be taken only by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the body its self, either of the whole Church, or which is far more probable, of the <hi>Consessus</hi> or Order of Presbyters in that Church? We see what miserably uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding arguments those are, which are brought for any form of Government from Metaphorical or Ambiguous expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or names promiscuously used, which may be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to different senses. What certainty then can any rational man find what the form of Government was in the Primitive times, when onely those arguments are used which may be equally accommodated to different forms? And without such a <hi>certainty,</hi> with what confidence can men speak of a Divine Right of any one particular form? <hi>Secondly,</hi> The uncertainty of the Primitive form is argued, from the places most in controversie about the form of Government; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that without any apparent incongruity they may be understood of either of the different forms. Which I shall make out by going through the several places. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie then on foot is this, (as it is of late stated), Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Churches in the Primitive times were governed by a Bishop only and Deacons, or by a Colledge of Presbyters acting in a parity of power? The places insisted on, on both sides are these, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 30. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 17 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. The thing in controversie, is, Whether <hi>Bishops</hi> with <hi>Deacons</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> in a parity of power, are understood in these places? I begin then in order with <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 30. The first place wherein the name <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> occurrs, as applyed to the Officers of the Christian Church, Those that are for a Colledge of Presbyters, understand by these Elders, those of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who did govern the affairs of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100525:160"/>
that Church: those that are for a solitary Episcopacy, by these Elders understand not the local Elders of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but the several Bishops of the Churches of <hi>Iudea.</hi> Let us now see whether there be any evidence from the place to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which of these two must necessarily be understood. There is nothing at all mentioned in the place, but only that <hi>upon the occasion of the Famine, they sent relief to the Brethren of</hi> Judea, <hi>and sent it to the Elders by the hands of</hi> Barnabas <hi>and Paul;</hi> Which might either be to the Elders of the Church at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to be distributed to the several Churches of <hi>Iudea,</hi> or else to the several Pastors of those Churches, either collectively as met together at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to receive this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, or distributively as they were in their several Churches. The relief might be sent to all the Brethren of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and yet either be conveyed to the particular Elders of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to send it abroad, or to the several Elders of the Churches within the circuit of <hi>Iudea.</hi> But other places are brought by both parties for their particular sense in this, As <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 6. here indeed mention is made of the Apostles and Elders together at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but nothing expressed whereby we may know whether the fixed Elders of that Church, or else the Elders of all the Churches of <hi>Iudea</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled upon this solemn occasion of the Council of the Apostles there. So <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 11. when <hi>Paul</hi> went in to <hi>Iames,</hi> it is said, That <hi>All the Elders were present.</hi> No more certainty here neither; for, either they might be the fixed Officers of that Church, meeting with <hi>Iames</hi> upon <hi>Pauls</hi> coming; or else they might be the Elders of the several Churches of <hi>Iudea</hi> met together, not to take account of <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministry (as some improbably conjecture,) but assembled together there at the Feast of Pentecost, <hi>at which</hi> Paul came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is more probable upon the account of what we read, <hi>v.</hi> 20. of the <hi>many thousand believing Iews then at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>who were zealous of the Law:</hi> who in all probability were the believing Jews of <hi>Iudea,</hi> who did yet observe the annual Festivals of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and so most likely their several El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders might go up together with them, and there be with <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Pauls</hi> coming in to him. No certainty then of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> how that was governed; whether by

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100525:161"/>
so for the other places in <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> it is certain the care of those persons did extend to many places, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elders or Bishops made by them, are not necessarily to be understood of a Plurality of Elders in one place. Thus we see, that there is no incongruity in applying either of these two forms to the sense of the places in Question. I dispute not which is the true, or at least more probable sense, but that we can find nothing in the several places which doth necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine, how they are to be understood as to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form of Government, which is the thing I now ayme at the proving of. And if neither form be repugnant to the sense of these places, how can any one be necessarily inferred from them? As if the several motions and <hi>phaenomena</hi> of the Heavens may be with equal probability explained according to the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> or <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypothesis, <hi>viz.</hi> about the rest or motion of the earth; then it necessarily follows, that from those <hi>Phaenomena</hi> no argument can be drawn evincing the necessity of the one <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and overturning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the other. If that great wonder of Nature the flux and reflux of the Sea, might with equal congruity be solved according to the different opinions, of its being caused by Subterraneous fires, or from the motion of the Moon, or the depression of the Lunar <hi>vortex,</hi> or (which to me is far the most probable) by a motion of consent of the Sea with all the other great bodies of the World; we should find no necessity at all of entertaining one opinion above another, but to look upon all as probable, and none as certain. So likewise for the composition and motion of all Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, the several <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of the old and new <hi>Philosophy,</hi> implying no apparent incongruity to Nature, do make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that all or any of them, may be embraced as Ingenious <hi>Romances</hi> in Philosophy (as they are no more) but that none of them are the certain truth; or can be made appear so to be to the minds of men. So it is in Controversies in <hi>Theology,</hi> If the matter propounded to be believed, may as to the truth and substance of it be equally believed under different wayes of explication, then there is no necessity as to the believing the truth of the thing, to believe it under such an explication
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100525:162"/>
of it, more then under another. As for instance, in the case of Christs Descent <gap reason="foreign">

By this time I suppose it is clear, that if these places of Scripture may be understood in these two different senses of the word <hi>Elders, viz.</hi> either taken collectively in one City, or distributively in many, then there is no certainty which of these two senses must be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and so the form of Church-government, which must be thence derived, is left still at as great uncertainty as ever, notwithstanding these places of Scripture brought to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it; <gap reason="foreign">

When men are by the force of the former arguments driven off from Scripture, then they presently run to take Sanctuary in the Records of succeeding ages to the Apostles. Thus <hi>Estius,</hi> no mean School-man, handling this very Question of the difference of Bishops and Presbyters, very fairly quits the Scriptures, and betakes himself to other Weapons. <hi>Quod autem jure divino sint Episcopi Presbyteris superiores, et si non ita clarum est è sacris Literis, aliunde tamen</hi>

We follow therefore the scent of the Game into this wood of Antiquity, wherein it will be easier to lose our selves, then to find that which we are upon the pursuit of, a <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of any one particular form of Government. I handle now only the Testimony of Antiquity (for the practice of it will call for a particular Discourse afterwards)
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100525:162"/>
and herein I shall endeavour to shew the incompetency of this Testimony, as to the shewing what certain form of Church-government was practised by the Apostles; for that, I shall make use of this four fold Argument; From the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectivenesse</hi> of this Testimony, from the <hi>Ambiguity</hi> of it, from the <hi>Partiality</hi> of it, and from the <hi>Repugnancy</hi> of it to its self. <hi>First,</hi> then, for the defectivenesse of the Testimony of antiquity, in reference to the shewing what certain form the Apostles observed in setling the Government of Churches; A threefold defectivenesse I observe in it, as to <hi>places,</hi> as to <hi>times,</hi> as to <hi>persons. First,</hi> defectivenesse as to <hi>places;</hi> for him that would be satisfied, what course the Apostles took for governing Churches, it would be very requisite to observe the uniformity of the Apostles practice in all Churches of their plantation. And if but one place varied, it were enough to overthrow the necessity of any one form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, because thereby it would be evident, that they observed no certain or constant course, nor did they look upon themselves as obliged so to do. Now the ground of the necessity of such an universal Testimony as to places, is this; We have already made it appear, that there is no Law of Christ absolutely commanding one form, and forbidding all other. We have no way then left to know, whether the Apostles did look upon themselves as bound to settle one form, but by their practice; this practice must be certain and uniform in them; this uniformity must be made known to us by some unquestionable way: the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are very silent in it, mentioning very little more then <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, nor that fully and clearly; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must gather it from Antiquity, and the Records of following ages; if these now fall short of our expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cannot give us an account of what was done by the Apostles in their several Churches planted by them, how is it possible we should attain any certainty of what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles practice was? Now that antiquity is so defective as to Places, will appear from the general silence as to the Churches planted by many of the Apostles. Granting the truth of what <hi>Eusebius tells us,</hi> That <hi>Thomas</hi> went into
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100525:163"/>
                     <hi>Parthia, Andrew</hi> into <hi>Scythia, Iohn</hi> into the lesser <hi>Asia, Peter</hi> to the Jews in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Bithynia, Cappadocia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Asia;</hi> besides what we read in Scripture of <hi>Paul,</hi> what a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful short account have we here given in, of all the Apostles Travels, and their several fellow-labourers! And for all these, little or nothing spoke of the way they took in setling the Churches by them planted, Who is it will undertake to tell us what course <hi>Andrew</hi> took in <hi>Scythiae,</hi> in governing Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? If we believe the Records of after-ages, there was but one Bishop, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Tomis</hi> for the whole Countrey; how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent is this from the pretended course of <hi>Paul,</hi> setting up a single Bishop in every City? Where do we read of the Presbyteries setled by <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Parthia</hi> or the <hi>Indies?</hi> what course <hi>Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon Zelotes, Matthias</hi> took. Might not they for any thing we know, settle ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Government from what we read <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> did, unlesse we had some evidence that they were all bound to observe the same? Nay, what evidence have we what course <hi>Peter</hi> took in the Churches of the Circumcision? Whether he left them to their Synagogue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>way, or altered it, and how or wherein? These things should be made appear, to give men a certainty of the way and course the Apostles did observe in the setling Churches by them planted. But instead of this, we have a general silence in antiquity, and nothing but the forgeries of latter ages to supply the vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: whereby they filled up empty places as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut. in Theseo.</note> expresseth it, as Geographers do Maps with some fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous creatures of their own invention. Here is work now for a <hi>Nicephorus Callisthus,</hi> a <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes,</hi> the very <hi>Iacobus de Voragine</hi> of the Greek Church (as one well calls him) those Historical Tinkers, that think to mend a hole where they find it, and make three instead of it. This is the first defect in Antiquity as to places. The <hi>second</hi> is as observable as to <hi>times;</hi> and what is most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: Antiquity is most defective where it is most useful, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time immediately after the Apostles, which must have been most helpfull to us in this inquiry. For, who dare with confidence believe the conjectures of <hi>Eusebius</hi> at three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

years distance from Apostolical times, when he hath no other Testimony to vouch, but the <hi>Hypotyposes</hi> of an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Clement</hi> (certainly not he of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> if <hi>Ios. Scaliger</hi> may be credited) and the Commentaries of <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> whose Relations and Authority are as questionable as many of the reports of <hi>Eusebius</hi> himself are in reference to those elder times: For which I need no other Testimony but <hi>Eusebius</hi> in a place enough of its self to blast the whole credit of antiquity, as to the matter now in debate. For speaking of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Churches by them planted, and coming to enquire after their Successours, he makes this very ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Confession. <gap reason="foreign">

But yet <hi>Thirdly,</hi> here is another defect consequent to that of Time, which is that of Persons; arising not onely from a defect of Records, the <hi>Diptychs</hi> of the Church being lost, which would have acquainted us with the times of suffering of the severall Martyrs (by them called their Natalitia) at which times their several names were inrolled in these Martyrologies, which some, as <hi>Iunius</hi> observes, have ignorantly mistaken for the time of their being made Bishops of the places wherein their<note place="margin">

Hence even the Martyrologies are so full stuffed with Fables, witness one for all, the famous Legend of <hi>Catharina</hi> who suffered, say they, in <hi>Diocletian's</hi>

                        <hi>V. Chamier. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.</note> time. And truly the story of <hi>Ignatius</hi> (as much as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with his Epistles) doth not seem to be any of the most probable. For, wherefore should <hi>Ignatius</hi> of all others be brought to <hi>Rome</hi> to suffer, when the <hi>Proconsuls</hi> and the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides provinciarum</hi> did every where in time of persecution ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their power in punishing Christians at their own Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, without sending them so long a journey to <hi>Rome</hi> to be martyred there? And how came <hi>Ignatius</hi> to make so many and such strange excursions, as he did by the story, if the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were his Guard were so cruel to him, as he complains they were? Now all those uncertain and fabulous Narrations as to Persons then, arising from want of sufficient Records made at those times, make it more evident how incompetent a Judge antiquity is as to the certainty of things done in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical times. If we should onely speak of the Fabulous Legends of the first Planters of Churches in these Western parts, we need no further evidence of the great defect of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity as to persons. Not to goe out of our own Nation;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100525:164"/>
Whence come the stories of <hi>Peter, Iames, Paul, Simon, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stobulus,</hi> besides <hi>Ioseph of Arimathea,</hi> and his company; all being Preachers of the Gospel, and planters of Churches here, but onely from the great defect in Antiquity, as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of persons imployed in the several places for preaching the Gospell? Thus much to shew the defectiveness as to the Records of antiquity, and thereby the incompetency of them for being a way to find out the certain course the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles took in Setling and Governing Churches by them Planted.</p>
                  <p>The next thing shewing the incompetency of the Records<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> of the Church for deciding the certain Form of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Apostles times, is, the <hi>ambiguity</hi> of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony given by those Records. A Testimony sufficient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decide a Controversie, must be plain and evident, and must speak full and home to the Case under debate. Now if I make it appear that antiquity doth not so; nothing then can be evident from thence, but that we are left to as great uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as before. The matter in Controversie is, whether any in a Superiour Order to Presbyters were instituted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves for the Regulating of the Churches by them planted? For the proving of which, <hi>three</hi> things are the most insisted on: <hi>First,</hi> the Personal succession of some persons to the Apostles in Churches by them planted: <hi>Secondly,</hi> the appropriating the name <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to Bishops in a Superiour Order to Presbyters, after the Apostles decease: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Churches owning the Order of Episcopacy, as of Divine Institution. If now we can make these three things evident: <hi>First, That personall Succession might be without such supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Order: Secondly, That the names of Bishop and Presbyters were common after the Distinction between them was introduced:</hi> and <hi>Thirdly, That the Church did not own Episcopacy as a Divine Institution, but Ecclesiasticall; and those who seem to speak most of it, do mean no more:</hi> I shall suppose enough done to invalidate the Testimony of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as to the matter in hand. <hi>First,</hi> Then <hi>for the matter of Succession in Apostolical Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> I shall lay down these four things, to evince that the argument drawn from thence, cannot fully clear the certain course which the Apostles
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100525:165"/>
took in setling the Government of Churches. <hi>First, That the Succession might be onely as to different</hi> Degree, <hi>and not as to a different</hi> Order; where the Succession is clear, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing possibly can be inferred from it beyond this. For bare Succession implies no more then that there was one in those Churches succeeding the Apostles, from whom afterwards the succession was derived. Now then suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing onely at present, that it was the Custome, in all the Churches at that time to be ruled by a Colledge of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters acting in a parity of Power, and among these, one to sit as the <hi>Nasi</hi> in the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> having a priority of Order above the rest in place, without any superiory of Power over his Colleagues; will not the matter of Succession be clear and evident enough notwithstanding this? <hi>Succession of Persons</hi> was the thing inquired for, and not a <hi>Succession of Power;</hi> if therefore those that would prove a Succession of Apostolical Power, can onely produce a List and Catalogue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of names in Apostolical Churches, without any evidence of what power they had, they apparently fail of proving the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, which is not, whether there might not be found out a List of persons in many Churches derived from the Apostles times; but whether those persons did enjoy by way of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and appropriation to themselves, that power which the Apostles had over many Churches while they lived? Now this, the meer Succession will never prove which will best appear by some Parallel instances. At <hi>Athens,</hi> after they grew weary of their ten yeares <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or whether by choice, as at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but I onely now shew that this argument from Succession is weak, and proves not at all the certainty of the power those persons enjoyed. <hi>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Succession is not so evident and convincing in all places as it ought to be, to demonstrate the thing intended.</hi> It is not enough to shew a List of some persons in the great Churches of <hi>Ierusalem, Antioch, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (although none of these be unquestionable) but it should be produced at <hi>Philippi, Corinth, Caesarea,</hi> and in all the seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> (and not onely at <hi>Ephesus</hi>) and so likewise in <hi>Creet,</hi> some succeeding <hi>Titus;</hi> and not think Men will be satisfied with the naming a Bishop of <hi>Gortyna</hi> so long after him. But, as I said before, in none of the Churches most spoken of is the Succession so clear as is necessary. For at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it seems somewhat strange how fifteen Bishops of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision should be crouded into so narrow a room as they are; so that many of them could not have above two years time to rule in the Church. And it would bear an inquiry where the Seat of the Bishops of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was from the time of the Destruction of the City by <hi>Titus,</hi> when the Walls
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100525:166"/>
were laid even wih the Ground by <hi>Musonius</hi>) till the time of <hi>Adrian;</hi> for till that time the succession of the Bishops of the Circumcision continued. For <hi>Antioch,</hi> it is far from being agreed, whether <hi>Evodius</hi> or <hi>Ignatius</hi> succeeded <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul;</hi> or the one <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other <hi>Paul;</hi> much less at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether <hi>Cletus, Anacletus,</hi> or <hi>Clemens</hi> are to be reckoned first; (but of these afterwards). At <hi>Alexandria</hi> where the succession runs clearest, the Originall of the power is imputedito the choice of Presbyters, and to no Divine Institution. But at <hi>Ephesus</hi> the succession of Bishops from <hi>Timothy</hi> is pleaded with the greatest Confidence; and the Testimony brought<note place="margin">

                     <hi>From</hi> Timothy <hi>to this day there hath been a succession of seven and twenty Bishops, all of them ordained in</hi> Ephesus. I shall not insist so much on the incompetency of this single witness to pass a judgement upon a thing of that Nature, at the distance of four hundred Years, in which time Records being lost, and Bishops being after settled there, no doubt they would begin their account from <hi>Timothy,</hi> because of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment there once for setling the Churches thereabout. And to that end we may observe that in the after-times of the Church, they never met with any of the Apostles, or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists in any place, but they presently made them Bishops of that place. So, <hi>Philip</hi> is made Bishop of <hi>Trallis, Ananias</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Damascus, Nicolaus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Samaria, Barnabas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Milan, Silas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corinth, Sylvanus</hi> of <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica, Crescens of Chalcedon, Andreas</hi> of <hi>Byzantium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and upon the same grounds <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> No wonder then if <hi>Leontius</hi> make <hi>Timothy</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and derive the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession down from him. But again, this was not an act of the Council its self, but onely of one single person delivering his private opinion in it; and that which is most observable, is, that in the thing mainly insisted on by <hi>Leontius,</hi> he was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in the face of the whole Council, by <hi>Philip</hi> a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> For the case of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100525:166"/>
by the Council where the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was to be regularly ordained, according to the <hi>Canons. Leontius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Magnesia</hi> saith, that there had been twenty seven Bishops of <hi>Ephesus</hi> from <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all of them ordained in the place. His business was not to derive exactly the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Bishops, but speaking according to vulgar tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he insists that all had been ordained there. Now if he be convicted of the <hi>crimen falsi</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>i. e.</hi> if he were out in his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, no wonder if he were deceived in his tradition. Now as to the Ordination of the Bishops in <hi>Ephesus, Philip,</hi> a Presbyter of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> convicts him of falsehood in that; for, saith he, <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> going into <hi>Asia,</hi> deposed fifteen Bishops there, and ordained others in their room. And <hi>Aetius</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Constantinople</hi> instanceth in <hi>Castinus, Heraclides, Basilius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> all ordained by the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> If then the certainty of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession relyes upon the credit of this <hi>Leontius,</hi> let them thank the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> who have sufficiently blasted it, by determining the cause against him in the main evidence produced by him. So much to shew how far the clearest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for succession of Bishops from Apostolical times is from being convincing to any rationall Man. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession so much pleaded by the Writers of the Primitive Church, was <hi>not a succession of Persons in Apostolicall Power, but a succession in Apostolical Doctrine;</hi> Which will be seen by a view of the places produced to that purpose.

Some expressions I grant in some of them seem to extoll Episcopacy very high; but then it is in Order to the Peace and Unity of the Church, and in that Sense they may sometimes be admitted to call it <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Apostolical,</hi> not in regard of its institution, but of its end, in that it did in their Opinion tend as much to preserve the Unity of the Church, as the Apostles Power did over the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100525:172"/>
Churches while they were living. If any shall meet with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions seeming to carry the Fountain of Episcopal power higher, let them remember to distinguish between the power it self, and the restrained Exercise of that power; the former was from the Apostles, but common to all Dispensers of the Word; the latter was appropriated to some, but by an Act of the Church, whereby an eminency of power was attributed to one, for the safety of the whole. And withall let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that every Hyperbolical expression of a Father will not bear the weight of an Argument: and how common it was to call things Divine, which were conceived to be of excellent use, or did come from persons in authority in the Church.

It hath been already observed how ready they were to call any custome of the Church before their times an Apostolical Tradition. And as the Heathens when they had any thing which they knew not whence it came, they usually called it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as though it came immediately from Heaven; So the Fathers when Traditions were convey'd to them without the names of the Authors, they conclude they could have no other Fountain but the Apostles. And thus we see, many Traditions in several Churches directly contrary to one another, were looked on as Apostolical, onely from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of this perswasion, that whatever they derived from their Fathers, was of that nature. But then for that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the <hi>Council,</hi> and <hi>Isidore,</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> that they make but one testimony: I say, that although the words be of the same Sense, yet they have the nature of a different testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, upon these accounts. <hi>First</hi> as produced by persons of different condition in the Church; some think they are even with <hi>Ierome,</hi> when they tell us what a <hi>pique</hi> there was between him and <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and, that he might have the better advantage of his adversary, when he could not raise himself up to the Honour of Episcopacy, he would bring that down to the State of Presbytery; but as such entertain too unworthy thoughts of one of those Fathers,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100525:173"/>
whom they profess themselves admirers of; so this prejudice cannot possibly lie against <hi>Isidore,</hi> or the <hi>Council:</hi> For the first was himself a Bishop of no mean account in the Church of God; and the <hi>Council</hi> was composed of such; it could be no biass then of that nature could draw them to this Opinion: and no doubt they would have been as forward to maintain their own authority in the Church, as the Truth and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would give them leave. Therefore on this account one Testimony of a single Bishop, much more of a whole Council of them, against their acting by Divine Authority in the Church, is of more validity then ten for it; in as much as it cannot but be in Reason supposed that none will speak any thing against the authority they are in, or what may tend in the least to diminish it, but such as make more Conscience of the Truth, then of their own Credit and Esteem in the World. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in that it was done in different ages of the Church: <hi>Ierome</hi> flourished about 380. <hi>Isidore</hi> succeeded <hi>Leander</hi> in <hi>Sevill,</hi> 600. The Council sat, 619. The Council of <hi>Aquen</hi> which tanscribes <hi>Isidore,</hi> and owns his Doctrine, 816. So that certainly supposing the words of all to be the same, yet the Testimony is of greater force, as it was owned in several Ages of the Church, by whole Councils, without any the least controul that we read of. And if this then must not be looked on as the Sense of the Church at that time, I know not how we can come to understand it: if what is positively maintained by different persons in different ages of the Church, and in different places without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it by Writers of those ages, or condemning it by Councils, may not be conceived to be the Sense of the Church at that time. So that laying all these things together, we may have enough to conclude the <hi>Ambiguity</hi> at least, and thereby <hi>incompetency</hi> of the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi> for finding out the certain form which the Apostles observed in planting Churches.</p>

Two things will sufficiently manifest the <hi>Partiality</hi> of the judgment of Antiquity in this Case. <hi>First</hi> their apparent
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100525:173"/>
judging of the practice of the first Primitive Church, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Customes of their own. <hi>Secondly,</hi> their stiffe and pertinacious adhering to private traditions contrary to one another, and both sides maintaining theirs as Apostolical. First, <hi>judging the practice of the Apostles by that of their own times;</hi> as is evident by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and the rest of the Greek Commentators, assigning that as the Reason why the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters spoken of in the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were not Bishops in the Sense of their age, because there could be but one Bishop in a City, whereas there are more expressed in those places, as being in the several Cities: whereas this is denyed of Apostolical times by the late pleaders for Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; and it is said of them, that they spoke according to the custome of their own time. And it is now thought there were two Bishops in Apostolical times in several Cities: the one the head of the Jewish <hi>Coetus,</hi> and the other of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. I enter not the Dispute again here, whether it were so or no, onely I hence manifest, how farr those persons themselves who plead for the judgement of the Fathers as deciding this Controversie, are from thinking them impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judges, when as to the grounds of their Sentence they are confessed to speak onely of the practice of their own time. Who can imagine any force in <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That the Presbyters who laid hands on</hi> Timothy <hi>must needs be Bishops, because none do Ordain in the Church, but Bishops,</hi> unless he makes this the <hi>medium</hi> of his argument. That whatever was the practice of the Church in his dayes, was so in Apostolical times. There is, I know not what strange influence in a received custome, if generally embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that doth possess men with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But of this I have spoken somewhat already. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that which makes it appear how <hi>partial</hi> the judgement of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is, <hi>in adhering to their particular Traditions, and calling them Apostolical, though contrary to one another.</hi> How can we then fix upon the Testimony of Antiquity as any thing certain or impartial in this Case? when it hath been found so
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100525:174"/>
evidently partial in a Case of less concernment then this is. A witness that hath once betrayed his faithfulness in the open Court, will hardly have his Evidence taken in a Case of moment, especially when the Cause must stand or fall accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his single Testimony. For my part, I see not how any man that would see Reason for what he doth, can adhere to the Church for an unquestionable Tradition received from the Apostles; when in the case of keeping Easter, whether with the Jewes on the fourteenth Moon, or only on the Lords day, there was so much unreasonable heat shewed on both sides, and such confidence, that on either side their Tradition was Apostolical. The Story of which is related by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and many others. They had herein all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages<note place="margin">Eccles. Hist. l. 5. c. 25.

The small coals of this fire kindled a whole <hi>Aetna</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the Christian world, the smoak and ashes, nay the flames of which, by the help of <hi>the Prince of the Aire</hi> were blown over into the bosome of the then almost Infant Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Churches of <hi>Brittain,</hi> where a solemn dispute was caused upon this quarrel between <hi>Colmannus</hi> on one side, and <hi>Wilfride</hi> on the other.

then, suppose we our selves now waiting for the final <hi>Verdict</hi> of Church-Tradition to determine our present cause; If the <hi>Iury</hi> cannot agree, we are as far from satisfaction as ever; and this is certainly the Case we are now in. The main difficulty lyes in the immediate succession to the Apostles: if that were but once cleared, we might bear with interruptions afterwards: but the main seat of the controversie lies there, whether the Apostles upon their withdrawing from the Government of Churches did substitute single persons to succeed them or no: so that u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Having thus far shewed that we have no absolute certainty<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> of what Form of Government was setled by the Apostles in the several Churches of their Plantation: The next <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> which follows to be spoken to, is, <hi>that the Apostles in probability did not observe any one fixed course of setling the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Churches, but setled it according to the several circumstances of places and persons which they had to deal with.</hi> This will be <hi>ex abundanti</hi> as to the thing by me designed, which would be sufficiently cleared without this: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I lay it not as the Foundation of my <hi>Thesis,</hi> but onely as a Doctrine of Probability, which may serve to reconcile the Controversies on foot about Church-Government.

Which when an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader hath soberly considered (with what hath gone before,) I am in hopes, the <hi>Novelty</hi> of this Opinion may not prejudicate its entertainment with him. My grounds are these; <hi>First, From the different state, condition and quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Churches planted by the Apostles.

Yet I do not think that all Churches in the Apostles times were but one Congregation; but as there was in Cities many Synagogues, so there might be many Churches out of those Synagogues enjoying their former liberties and priviledges. And they that will shew me where five thousand Jewes and more did ordinarily meet in one of their Synagogues for publike worship, may gain something upon me, in order to believing the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to be but one Congregation, and yet not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me, till they have made it appear, that the Christians then had as publike solemn set meetings as the Jews had; which he that understands the state of the Churches at that time, will hardly yield to the belief of. I confess, I cannot see any rule in Scripture laid down for distributing Congregations: but this necessity would put them upon; and therefore it were needless to prescribe them; and very little, if any, reason can I see on the other side, why, where there were so much people as to make distinct Congregations, they must make distinct Churches from one another; but of that largely in the next
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100525:177"/>
chapter. All Churches then we see were not of an equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The <hi>second</hi> premisal Reason will grant, <hi>viz.</hi> that a small Church did not require the same number of Officers to rule it, which a great one did. For the duty of Officers lying in Reference to the People, where the People was but few, one constant setled Officer with Deacons under him, might with as much ease discharge the work, as in a numerous Church, the joynt help of many Officers was necessary to carry it on. The same reason which tells us that a large flock of Sheep consisting of many thousands doth call for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Shepherds to attend them, doth likewise tell us that a small flock may be governed with the care of one single Shepherd watching continually over them. The <hi>third</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misall was that in great Cities the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not onely respect the present guidance of those that were converted, but established such as might be useful for the converting and bringing in of others to the Faith, who were as yet <hi>strangers to the Covenant of promise, and aliens from the</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>society of Christians.</hi> And here I conceive a mistake of some men lies, when they think the <hi>Apostles</hi> respected onely the Ruling of those which were already converted; for though this were one part of their work, yet they had an eye to the main Design then on foot, the subjecting the World to the Obedience of Faith; in order to which it was necessity in places of great resort and extent, to place not onely such as might be sufficient to superintend the Affairs of the Church, but such as might lay out themselves the most in Preaching the Gospel in order to converting others. Have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid down these things by way of premisal, we will see what advantage we can make of them in order to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <hi>First,</hi> then I say, <hi>that in Churches consisting of a small number of Believers, where there was no great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a large increase afterwards: One single Pastour With Deacons under him, were onely constituted by the Apostles for the ruling of those Churches.</hi> Where the work was not so great, but a Pastour and Deacons might do it, what need was there of having more? and in the great scarcity of fit Persons for setled Rulers then, and the great multitude and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100525:178"/>
necessity of unfixed Officers for preaching the Gospel abroad, many persons fit for that work could not be spared to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly Resident upon a place. Now that in some places at first there were none placed but onely a Pastour and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, I shall confirm by these following Testimonies. The first is that of <hi>Clement</hi> in his Epistle, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.<note place="margin">P. 54.</note> 
                     <hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles therefore preaching abroad through Countreys and Cities, ordained the First-fruits of such as believed, having proved them by the Spirit, to be Bishops and Deacons for them that should afterwards believe.</hi> Whether by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> we understand <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> or <hi>Regions,</hi> is not material; for it is certain here the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor takes it as distinct from Cities; and there is nothing, I grant, expressed where the Apostles did place Bishops and Deacons exclusive of other places, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether onely in Cities or Countreys; but it is evident by this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they planted Churches, they ordained Bishops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, whether those Churches were in the City or Countrey. And here we find no other Officers setled in those Churches, but Bishops and Deacons; And that there were no more in those Churches then he speaks of, appears from his Designe of paralleling the Church-Officers in the Gospel, to those under the Law: and therefore it was here necessary to enumerate all that were then in the Churches. The main controversie is, what these Bishops were; whether many in one place; or onely one; and if but one, whether a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in the modern Sense or no. For the first, here is nothing implying any necessity of having more then one in a place, which will further be made appear by and by, out of other Testimonies which will help to explain this. As for the other thing, we must distinguish of the Notion of a Bishop: For he is either such a one as hath none over him in the Church; or he is such a one as hath a power over Presbyters acting under him, and by authority derived from him. If we take it in the first Sense, so every Pastor of a Church having none exercising jurisdiction over him, is a Bishop; and so every such single Pastor in the Churches of the Primitive times was a Bishop in this Sense, as every Master of a Family
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100525:178"/>
before Societies for Government were introduced, might be called a King, because he had none above him to command him: but if we take a Bishop in the more proper Sense, for one that hath power over Presbyters and People, such a one these single Pastors were not, could not be. For it is supposed that these were onely single Pastors. But then it is said that after other Presbyters were appointed, then these single Pastors were properly Bishops; but to that I answer: <hi>First,</hi> they could not be proper Bishops by vertue of their first Constitution; for then they had no power over any Presbyters, but onely over the Deacons and People; and therefore it would be well worth considering how a power of jurisdiction over Presbyters can be derived, from those single Pastors of Churches that had no Presbyters joyned with them. It must be then clearly and evidently proved that it was the Apostles intention that these single Pastors should have the power over Presbyters, when the Churches necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did require their help, which intention must be manifested and declared by some manifestation of it as a Law of Christ, or nothing can thence be deduced of perpetual concernment to the Church of Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi> either they were Bishops before, or onely after the appointment of Presbyters; if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then a Bishop, and a Presbyter having no Bishop over him, are all one; if after onely, then it was by his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating power to Presbyters to be such, or their choice which made him their Bishop; if the first, then Presbyters <hi>quoad ordinem</hi> are onely a humane institution, it being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that no Evidence can be brought from Scripture for them; and for any Act of the Apostles not recorded in Scripture for the constituting of them, it must goe among unwritten Traditions; and if that be a Law still binding the Church, then there are such which occurre not in the Word of GOD, and so that must be an imperfect cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of Divine Lawes: If he were made Bishop by an Act of the Presbyters, then Presbyters have power to make a Bishop, and so Episcopacy is an humane institution depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the voluntary Act of Presbyters. But the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Evidence for one single Pastour with Deacons in some Churches at the beginning of Christianity, is that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius,</hi>

                     </gap> as the Sense, clearly carries it) <hi>there was not found any worthy of being a Bishop, the place remained without one; But where necessity required one, and there were some found fit for that Office, there some were ordained Bishops; but for want of convenient number, there could be no Presbyters found out to be Ordained, and in such places they were contented with the Bishop and Deacons; for without their Ministry the Bishop could not be.</hi> So that according to <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> there were three several states of Churches in the Apostles times; first some Churches where there were onely Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100525:179"/>
without a Bishop. For, if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speaks not at first of places where Presbyters were without a Bishop; he must be guilty of a vain and empty <hi>Tautology,</hi> for he after tells us where the necessity of the Church required it, a Bishop was made; therefore before he speaks of places only where Presbyters and Deacons were; and otherwise he would not answer <hi>Aerius</hi> about 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. which it is his design to do, about <hi>The laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie.</hi> He grants then that at first in some places there were only Presbyters and Deacons, as when the Apostle writes to <hi>Bishops and Deacons</hi> (where Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops at that time of the Church were only Presbyters) of which two orders, Presbyters and Deacons, there was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity; and the account he gives why they setled no higher order, above them is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the Apostles could not settle all things at first;</hi> which words are to be read with a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> giving an account why sometimes only Bishops and Deacons were setled, that is, Presbyters so called. But, saith he, where necessity called for a higher order of Bishops above Presbyters, and any were found qualified for it, there such were appointed; and if by reason of the want of persons of sufficient abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be made Presbyters in those places, there they were contented with such a superior Bishop and Deacons assisting of him; Some Churches then according to his judgement, had a company of Presbyters to rule them being assisted with Deacons; others had only a single Bishop with Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; and after when the numbers were increased, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons qualified were found, there were both Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100525:180"/>
say, that in the first times of the Church, there were none but Bishops and Deacons in all Churches, but in some Churches there were Presbyters and Deacons, in others Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Deacons, according to the state, condition and necessity of the Churches. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> then fully and clearly expresseth my opinion, in reference to the Apostles not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving any one constant course in all Churches, but setling sometimes many Presbyters with Deacons, sometimes only one Pastor (who is therefore called a Bishop) with Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and so setling Officers according to the particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of every Church. The next considerable testimony to our purpose, is that of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> concerning St. <hi>Iohn</hi> after his return out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is the author of the <hi>Commentaries</hi> under <hi>Ambrose</hi> his name, who frequently asserts-this opinion I am now making good. Upon the <hi>fourth of Ephesians,</hi> he largely discourseth how things were setled at first, by the Apostles, by degrees, in the Church of God, evidently shewing
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100525:180"/>
that the Apostles did not at first observe any setled constant course, but acted according to present conveniency, as they saw good, in order to the promoting and advancing the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Interest. <hi>Post quam omnibus locis Ecclesiae sunt constitutae &amp; officia ordinata, aliter composita res est quam coeperat.</hi> Thereby declaring his opinion, that while Churches were consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting, no certain course was observed. For, as he goes on, <hi>Primum enim omnes docebant, &amp; omnes baptizabant, quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque diebus vel temporibus fuisset occasio,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ut ergo cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret plebs &amp; multiplicaretur, Omnibus inter initia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessum est &amp; Evangelizare, &amp; baptizare, &amp; scripturas in Ecclesia explanare. At ubi omnia loca circumplexa est Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia, conventicula constituta sunt, &amp; rectores &amp; caetera officia in Ecclesiis sunt ordinata; ut nullus de Clero auderet, qui ordinatus non esset, prasumere ossicium quod sciret non sibi cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum vel concessum; &amp; coepit alio ordine &amp; providentiâ gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernari Ecclesia; quia si omnes eadem possent, irrationabile esset, &amp; vulgaris res, &amp; vilissima videretur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ideò non per omnia conveniunt scripta Apostoli ordinationi quae nunc est in Ecclesia, quia haec inter primordia sunt scripta; Nam &amp;</hi> Timotheum, (<hi>Presbyterum à se creatum</hi>) <hi>Episcopum vocat; quia primum Presbyteri Episcopi appellabantur, ut recedente uno sequens ei succederet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>At first,</hi> he saith, <hi>All Church-Offices lay open to all persons, and every one did preach and baptize upon all occasions; but afterwards, when Congregations were established and Churches setled, then none undertook that office but those that were ordained to it. Thence it is, that the Apostles Writings are not suitable to the present state of the Church, because they were penned in the time when things were not fully setled. For he calls</hi> Timothy, <hi>who was made a Presbyter by him, Bishop; for so at first the Presbyters were called, among whom this was the course of governing Churches, that as one withdrew, another took his place.</hi> This opinion of his, he takes occasion to speak of in several other places.

                     <hi>Secondly, In Churches consisting of a multitude of believers, or where there was a probability of great increase by preaching the Gospel; the Apostles did settle a Colledge of Presbyters, whose office was partly to govern the Church already formed, and partly to labour in the Converting more.</hi> So that in all great Cities, where either the work was already great by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of believers, in order to the discharging of Pastoral duties to them, or where it was great in reference to the number they laboured in converting of, it seems most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to reason and Scripture, that the work should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the joint assistance of many associated in the same work. For, is it any ways probable that the Apostles should ordain Bishops <gap reason="foreign">

They have either a very low opinion of the work of a Gospel-Bishop, or very little considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the zeal, activity and diligence which was then used in preaching, reproving, exhorting, in season, out of season, that think one single person was able to undergo it all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was a great deal more strict the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Besides, while we suppose this one person imployed in the duties of his flock, what leisure or time could such a one have to preach to the Gentiles and unbelieving Jews in order to their

The Apostles did not certainly aym at the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the honour of any one person, making the Office of the Church a matter of State and Dignity more then employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but they chose men for their activity in preaching the Gospel, and for their usefulness in labouring to add con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to the Church.

Praying and preaching are the <hi>Iackin</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> like <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> both which built up the house of <hi>Israel:</hi> but though <hi>Rachel</hi> be fair and beautifull, yet <hi>Leah</hi> is the more fruitful: though prayer be lovely and amiable in the sight of God, when it comes from a heart se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously affected with what it speaks, yet preaching tends more to the turning mens souls from sin unto God. Were the Apostles commissioned by Christ to go pray or preach? and what is it wherein the Ministers of the Gospel succeed the Apostles? Is it in the office of Praying, or preaching? Was <hi>Paul</hi> sent not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel? and shall we think those who succeed <hi>Paul</hi> in his office of preaching, are to look upon any thing else as more their work then that? Are Ministers in their ordination sent forth to be readers of publick Prayers, or to be Dispensers of Gods holy Word? Are they ordained wholly to this, and shall this be the lesse principal part of their work? I, but the reason is unanswerable, that praying is the more principal end of Christian-assemblies then preaching; For, the one
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:100525:182"/>
is the End, and the other the Means. If by End, be meant the ultimate end of all Christian duties, that cannot be Prayer: for that is a means it self in order to that; but the chief end is the fitting souls for eternal prayses; if then this unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reason hold good, the principal end of Christian as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies must be only prayses of God, and not prayers: If by the End, be meant the immediate end of preaching as that it referrs to, that cannot be; for the immediate end of preaching, if the Apostle may be judge, is instruction and edification in the faith; Rather preaching is the end of praying, in as much as the blessings conveyed by preaching, are the things which men pray for. But this is but one of those unhappy conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which follows mens judging of the service of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, rather by the practices of the Church, when it came to enjoy ease and plenty, than by the wayes and practices of the first and purest Apostolical times: when the Apostles who were best able to judge of their own duty, looked upon themselves as most concerned in the preaching of the Gospel. But to this it is commonly said, that <hi>there was great reason for it then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the world was to be converted to Christianity, and therefore preaching was the more necessary work at that time; but when a Nation is converted to the faith, that necessity ceaseth.</hi> It is granted, that the preaching of the Gospel in regard of its universal extent was more necessary then, which was the foundation of Christs instituting the Apostolical Office with an unlimited commission; but if we take Preaching as referring to particular Congregations, there is the same necessity now that there was then. People need as much instruction as ever, and so much the more in that they are apt to think now the name of Christians will carry them to Heaven. It is a too common and very dangerous deceit of men, to look upon Religion more as a profession, then mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life, more as a Notion then an inward temper. Men must be beat off from more things which they are apt to trust to for salvation now, than in those times: Men could not think so much then, that diligence in publike assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and attendance at publick prayers, was the main Religion. Few would profess Christianity in those times, but such as were resolved before hand rather to let go their
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100525:182"/>
lives then their profession: but the more profess it now, without understanding the terms of salvation by it; the greater necessity of preaching to instruct men in it. But I think more need not be said of this to those that know it is another thing to be a Christian, then to be called so. But however it is granted, that in the Apostles times preaching was the great Work; and if so, how can we think one single person in a great City was sufficient, both to preach to, and rule the Church, and to preach abroad in order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of more from their Gentilisme to Christianity? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Church of every City was so large as some would make it, <hi>viz.</hi> to comprehend all the Believers under the civil jurisd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction of the City, and so both City and Countrey the only charge of one single Bishop. I think the vastness of the work, and the impossibility of a right discharge of it by one single person, may be argument enough to make us inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the places of Scripture which may be understood in that sense, as of more then one Pastour in every City; as when the Apostles are said to ordain Elders in every City, and <hi>Pauls</hi> calling for the Elders from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and his writing to the Bishops and Deacons of the Church of <hi>Philippi;</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, I say, granting that the Texts may be otherwise understood, will be enough to incline men to think that in greater Cities there was a society of Presbyters acting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the carrying on the work of the Gospel in converting some to, and building up of others in the faith of Christ. And it seems not in the least manner probable to me, that the care of those great Churches should at first be intrusted in the hands of one single Pastour and Deacon, and afterwards a new order of Presbyters erected under them, without any order or rule laid down in Scripture for it, or any mention in Ecclesiastical Writers of any such after institution. But instead of that in the most populous Churches, we have many remaining footsteps of such a Colledge of Presbyters there established in Apostolical times.

For, now the voice of the people (which was used in the Primitive times) is grown out of use: such a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, whereby two or more of the peoples choice might be present at Church debates, might be very useful, so they be looked on onely as a prudential humane constitution, and not as any thing founded on Divine right. So much may serve for the first Ground of the probability of the Apostles not
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100525:185"/>
observing one setled Form of Church-Government, which was from the different state, quantity and condition of the Churches by them planted. The <hi>second</hi> was <hi>from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of unfixed Officers residing in some places, who managed the Affairs of the Church in chief, during their Residence.</hi> Such were the Apostles and Evangelists, and all persons almost of note in Scripture. They were but very sew, and those in probability not the ablest, who were left at home to take care of the spoil; the strongest and ablest, like <hi>Commanders in an Army,</hi> were not setled in any <hi>Troop,</hi> but went up and down from this company to that, to order them and draw them forth: and while they were, they had the chief authority among them; but as Commandets of the Army, and not as Officers of the Troop. Such were Evangelists who were sent sometimes into this Countrey to put the Churches in order there, sometimes into another; but where ever they were, they acted as Evangelists and not as fixed Officers.

Now where there were in some places Evangelists, in others not, and in many Churches it may be no other Officers but these, it will appear, that the Apostles did not observe one constant Form, but were with the Evangelists travelling abroad to the Churches, and ordering things in them as they saw cause. But as to this I have anticipated my self already. The <hi>last</hi> ground was from the <hi>different custome observed in the Churches, after the Apostles times.</hi> For no other rational account can be given of the different opinions of <hi>Epiphanius, Ierome,</hi> and <hi>Hilary,</hi> but this, that one speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Opinion, <hi>Timothy</hi> must have but his course in

                  <p>The third Consideration touching Apostolical practice, is<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> concerning the Obligatory force of it in reference to us; which I lay down in these terms, <hi>That a meer Apostolical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice being supposed, is not sufficient of its self for the founding an unalterable and perpetual right, for that Form of Government in the Church, which is supposed to be founded on that practice.</hi> This is a Proposition I am sure, will not be yielded without proving it; and therefore I shall endeavour to doe it by a fourfold argument. <hi>First,</hi> because many things were done by the Apostles without any intention of obliging any who succeeded them afterwards to do the same. As for instance, the twelve Apostles going abroad so unprovided as they did when Christ sent them forth at first, which would argue no great wisedome or reason in that man, that should draw that practice into consequence now. Of the like nature was <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> to some Churches, receiving no maintenance at all from some Churches, as that at <hi>Corinth.</hi> Which instance is a manifest evidence of the monstrous weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Discourse in those who would make that example of <hi>Paul</hi> Obligatory to all Ministers of the Gospel now. And while they would by this argument take away their Lands and Tythes, instead of them, they give them <hi>Plaustra convitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> whole loads of the most reproachful Speeches that ever were given to any, but Christ and his Apostles. For my part, I think the Ministers of the Gospel would want one of the Badges of Honour belonging to their Office, were they not thus reproachfully used<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is part of the State which belongs to the true Ministers of the Gospel to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by such blackmouthed Lacqueyes, who by their virulent Speeches are so farre their Friends, as to keep them from that Curse which our Saviour pronounceth; <hi>Wo be unto you</hi>

As for any Divine right of a particular<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 9.</note> way of maintenance, I am of the same Opinion as to that which I am in reference to particular Forms of Church-Government: and those that are of another Opinion. I would not wish them so much injury, as to want their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance till they prove it.

                     </gap>ce of the World in dedicating things to God, and was approved by God himself among his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Jews: So that the way of maintenance by <hi>Tythes</hi> is the most just and equitable way. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It being in the Magistrates power to determine the way of maintenance, what is so determined, doth bind the Consciences of all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that power, to an obedience to it for conscience sake: In as much as all men are bound thus to obey the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in all things established by him as Laws; and the very same reasons any can plead for disobedience as to this, may equally serve for disobedience to any other Lawes made by the Supreme Magistrate. This I suppose is the clearest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of that other more vexed then intricate Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie about the right of Tythes; which I have here spoken of by occasion of the mention of the Apostles practice; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is resolved upon the same principles with the subject I am upon. Meer Apostolical practice we see doth not bind, because the Apostles did many things without intention of binding others. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Apostles did many things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular Occasions, Emergencies, and circumstances, which things so done, cannot bind by vertue of their doing them any further then a parity of reason doth conclude the same things to be done in the same circumstances. Thus <hi>Pauls Coelibate</hi> is far from binding the Church, it being no univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal practice of the Apostles by a Law, but onely a thing taken up by him upon some particular grounds, not of perpetual<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 5.</note> and universal concernment.

If it be answered, that these are not usefull now; then we must say, that we look upon Apostolical practice to be binding no further then we judge it useful, or the reason of it holds; which is as much as to say, of its self it binds not. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Rites and customs Apostolical are altered; therefore men do not think that Apostolical practice doth bind. For if it did, there could be no alteration of things agreeable thereunto.

                     <p>The Churches Polity in the ages after the Apostles considered: Evidences thence that no certain unalterable Form of Church-Government was delivered to them. 1.

Churches first the Christians in whole Cities, proved by several arguments, the Eulogiae an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it.

The Original of Metropolitans and Patriarchs. 2. No certain Form used in all Churches. Some Churches without Bishops, <hi>Scots, Goths.</hi> Some with but one Bishop in their whole Countrey.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving largely considered the actions of Christ, and<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> the practice of the Apostles, so far as they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have reference to the determining the certain form of Government in the Church; our next stage is, according to our propounded method, to examine what light the practice of the Church in the ages succeeding the Apostles will cast upon the controversie we are upon. For although, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the principles established and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

can be nothing setled as an universal Law for the Church but what we find in Scriptures: yet because the general practice of the Church is conceived to be of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o great use for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what the Apostles <hi>intentions,</hi> as well as <hi>actions</hi> were, we shall chearfully pass over this <hi>Rubicon,</hi> because not with an intent to increase divisions, but to find out some further evidence of a way to compose them. Our Inquiry then is, Whether the primitive Church did conceive its self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to observe unalterably one individual form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as delivered down to them either by a Law of Christ, or an universal constitution of the Apostles; or else did only settle and order things for Church-government, according as it judged them tend most to the peace and settlement of the Church, without any antecedent obligation, as necessarily binding to observe onely one course. This latter I shall endeavour to make out to have been the onely Rule and Law which the primitive Church observed as to Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> the tendency of its constitutions to the peace and unity of the Church; and not any binding Law or practice of Christ or his Apostles. For the demonstrating of which, I have made choyce of such arguments as most immediately te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to the proving of it. For, <hi>If the power of the Church and its officers did encrease meerly from the inlargement of the bounds of Churches, if no one certain form were observed in all Churches, but great varieties as to Officers and Diocesses; if the course used in setling the power of the chief Officers of the Church was from agreement with the civil government, if notwithstanding the superiority of Bishops, the ordination of Presbyters was owned as valid; if in all other things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Churches Polity, the Churches prudence was looked on as a sufficient ground to establish things;</hi> then we may with reason conciude, that nothing can be inferred from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the primitive Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Demonstrative of any one fixed form of Church-government delivered from the Apostles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the several lines of the pourtraiture of the Polity of the antient Church, we now proceed to fill them up, though not with that <hi>life</hi> which it deserves, yet so far as the model of this Discourse will permit. Our first argument then is <hi>from the</hi>

                     <hi>rise of the extent of the power of Church-Governours,</hi> which I assert not to have been from any order of the Apostles, but from the gradual encrease of the Churches committed to their charge. This will be best done by the observation of the growth of Churches, and how proportionably the power of the Governours did increase with it. As to that, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of these in their order.</p>
                  <p>The first period of Church government observable in the<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> primitive Church, was, <hi>when Churches were the same with Christians in whole Cities.</hi> For the clearing of this, I shall <hi>first</hi> shew, that the primitive constitution of Churches was in a society of Christians in the same City. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall consider the form and manner of Government then obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> consider what relation the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches in Cities had to one another. <hi>First, That the Primitive Churches were Christians of whole Cities.</hi> It is but a late and novel acception of the word <hi>Church,</hi> whereby it is taken for stated, fixed congregations for publike Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and doubtless the original of it is only from the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Churches in greater Cities into their several <gap reason="foreign">

But this may be pardoned among other the religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s weaknesses of well meaning, but lesse knowing people. A Church in its primary sense, as it answers to the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, applyed to Christians, is a society of Christians living together in one City, whether
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100525:189"/>
meeting together in many Congregations, or one, is not at all material; because they were not called a <hi>Church</hi> as meeting together in one place, but as they were a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Christians inhabiting together in such a City: not but that I think a society of Christians might be called a Church, where-ever they were, whether in a City or Countrey, but because the first and chief menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we meet with in Scripture of Churches, is of such as did dwell together in the same Cities; as is evident from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pregnant places of Scripture to this purpose. As <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. compared with <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Paris</hi> from the Residence of the chief Officers and people in that City.

I conclude then, that Churches and Cities were originally of equal extent, and that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal constitution of a Church lyes not in their capacity of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling in one place, but acting as a society of Christians imbodyed together in one City, having Officers and Rulers among themselves, equally respecting the whole number of Believers: Which leads to the <hi>second</hi> thing, <hi>the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then used for the modelling the government of these Churches,</hi> Which may be considered in a double period of time, either before several Congregations in Churches were setled, or after those we now call <hi>Parishes,</hi> were divided. First, before distinct Congregations were setled; and this as far as I can find, was not only during the Apostles times, but for a competent time after, generally during the persecution of Churches. For we must distinguish between such a number of Believers as could not conveniently assemble in one place, and the distributing of Believers into their several distinct congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I cannot see any reason but to think that in the great Churches of <hi>Ierusalem, Antioch, Ephesus,</hi> and the like, there were more Believers then could well meet together, considering the state of those times; but that they were then distributed into their several <gap reason="foreign">

They had no such conveniences then of setling several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under their particular Pastors: but all the Christians in a City looked upon themselves as one body, and met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as occasion served them, where either the chief of the Governours of the Church, the <gap reason="foreign">

Neither was this proper to <hi>Rome</hi> alone, but to all other great Cities, which when the number of Presbyters was grown so great, that they could not conveniently meet, and joyn with the Bishop, for ordering the Government of the Church, there were some as the chief of them chosen out from the rest, to be as the Bishops Council, and these in many places, as at <hi>Milan, Ravenna, Naples,</hi> &amp;c. were called <hi>Cardinales Presbyteri,</hi> as well as at <hi>Rome;</hi> which were abrogated by <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> 1568<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the memory of them is preserved still in Cathedral Churches, in the <hi>Chapter</hi> there, where the <hi>Dean</hi> was nothing else but the <hi>Archipresby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> could add to them. But because this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple manifestly destroyes the main foundation of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, it is here requisite to examine the grounds on which it stands, that thereby it may be fully cleared whether the subordination of less Churches to greater, did onely arise from the mutual association of Churches among themselves, or from Apostolical appointment and institution. The two pillars which the divine right of <hi>Metropolitans</hi> is built upon, are these. First, that the Cities spoken of in the New Testament, in which Churches are planted, were <hi>Metropoles</hi> in the civil Sense. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the Apostles did so far follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the civil Government as to plant <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Churches in those Cities. If either of these prove infirm, the Fabrick erected upon them, must needs fall; and I doubt not but to make it appear that both of them are. I begin with the first. The notion of a <hi>Metropolis</hi> is confessed to be this, A City wherein the Courts of a civill Judicature were kept by the Roman Governours, under whose Jurisdiction the whole Province was contained. The Cities chiefly insisted on, are the seven Cities of the <hi>Lydian Asia,</hi> and <hi>Philippi</hi> which is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </hi> and then the conclusion had been true, what ever the premises were. But in good earnest, doth the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi> being bound by this Decree, prove their subordination to <hi>Antioch,</hi> or to the Apostles?

Lastly,</hi> in every <hi>Diocess,</hi> as
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:100525:204"/>
there was a <hi>Lievtenant-General,</hi> so was there a Primate seated also in the principal City of the <hi>Diocess</hi> as the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> was, to whom the last determining of <hi>Appeals</hi> from all the Provinces in differences of the Clergy, and the soveraign care of all the <hi>Diocess</hi> for sundry points of Spiritual Government did belong.

                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving thus far proceeded, through Divine assistance, in<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> our intended method, and having found nothing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the necessity of any one Form of Government in the several Laws of Nature and Christ, nor in the practice of Apostles, or Primitive Church; the only thing possible to raise a suspition of Novelty in this opinion, is, that it is contrary to the judgement of the several Churches of the Reformation. I know it is the last <hi>Asylum</hi> which many run to, when they are beaten off from their imaginary Fancies, by pregnant Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture and Reason, to shelter themselves under the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of some particular persons, to whom their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings are bored in perpetual slavery: But if men would but once think their understandings at age to judge for themselves, and not make them live under a continual Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillage; and but take the pains to travel over the several Churches of the Reformation, they would find themselves freed of many strange misprisions they were possessed with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and understand far better the ground and reason of their pitching upon their several Forms, than they seem to do, who found all things upon a Divine Right. I believe there will, upon the most impartial survey, scarce be one Church of the Reformation brought, which doth imbrace any Form of Government, because it looked upon that Form as one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary by an unalterable standing Law, but every one took up that Form of Government which was judged most suitable to the state and condition of their severall Churches: But that I may the better make this appear, I shall make use of some Arguments whereby to demonstrate, that the most eminent Divines that have lived since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100525:207"/>
have been all of this mind, <hi>That no one Form is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined as necessary for the Church of God in all ages of the World.</hi> For if many of them have <hi>in thesi</hi> asserted <hi>the Form of Church-Government mutable;</hi> if <hi>those who have thought an equality among Ministers the Primitive Form, have yet thought a Government by Episcopacy lawfull and usefull:</hi> If, lastly, <hi>those who have been for Episcopacy, have not judged it necessary,</hi> then I suppose it will be evident, that none of them have judged any one Form taken exclusively of others, to be founded upon an unalterable Right: For whatsoever is so founded, is made a necessary duty in all Churches to observe it, and it is unlawfull to vary from it, or to change it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prudence of the Church, according to the state and condition of it. I now therefore undertake to make these things out in their order.</p>
                  <p>First, I begin with those who have <hi>in thesi</hi> asserted the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> of the Form of Church Government. Herein I shall not follow the English humour, to be more acquainted with the state of Forreign places then their own; but it being of greatest concernment to know upon what accounts Episcopal Government was setled among our selves, in order to our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to it; I shall therefore make inquiry into the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those persons concerning it, who either have been instrumental in setling it, or the great defenders of it after its setlement. I doubt not but to make it evident, that before these late unhappy times, the main ground for setling Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government in this Nation, was not accounted any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Divine Right, but the conveniency of that Form of Church Government to the State and condition of this Church at the time of its Reformation: For which we are to consider, that the Reformation of our Church was not wrought by the Torrent of a popular fury, nor the Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one part of the Nation against another, but was wisely, gravely, and maturely debated, and setled with a great deal of consideration. I meddle not with the times of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 8. when I will not deny but the first <hi>quickning</hi> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation might be, but the matter of it was as yet rude and undigested; I date the birth of it from the first setlement of that most excellent Prince <hi>Edward</hi> 6. the <hi>Phosphorus</hi> of our

Reformation. Who, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1547. was no sooner entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne, but some course was presently taken in order to Reformation. Commissioners with Injunctions were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to the several parts of the Land, but the main busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Reformation was referred to the Parliament call'd <hi>November</hi> 4. the same year; when all former Statutes about<note place="margin">Acts and Mon. <hi>To.</hi> 2: <hi>p.</hi> 657.</note> Religion were recall'd, as may be seen at large in Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> and Liberty allowed for professing the Gospel according to the principles of Reformation, all banished persons for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being call'd home. Upon this, for the better establishing of Religion, and the publick order for the service of God, an <hi>Assembly</hi> of select Divines is call'd, by special order from the Kings Majesty, for debating of the settlement of things according to the Word of God, and the practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive<note place="margin">

The proceedings then in order to Reformation, being so dark hitherto, and obscure, by what is as yet extant, much light may accrue thereto by the help of some authentick MS. which by a hand of providence, have happily come into my hands; wherein the manner and method of the Reformation will be more evident to the World, and the grounds upon which they proceeded. In the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> that year sitting with the Parliament, I find two Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to the Archbishop and the Bishops of the upper house, for the calling an Assembly of select Divines, in order to the setling Church-affairs, and for the Kings Grant for their acting in Convocation.

                     <hi>And where in a Statute ordeyned and established by auctorite of Parliament at</hi> Westminster, <hi>in the twenty fifth year of the reigne of the most excellent Prince, King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth, the Cleregy of this Realme, submitting themselfe to the Kings Highness, did knowledge and confesse according to the truth, that the Convocations of the same Cleregie hath ben and ought to be assembled by the Kings writt, And did promise further</hi> in verbo sacerdotii, <hi>that they never from thenceforth wolde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to attempt, allege, clayme, or put in ure or enact, promulge or execute any new Canons, constitutions, ordinances, provincialls or other, or by whatsoever other name they shall bee called in the convocation, oneles the Kings most royal Assent and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence may to them be had, to make, promulge and execute the same.

Which Statute is eftsoons renewed and established in the xxvij. yere of the reigne of the said most noble Kinge, as by the tenor of both Statutes more at large will appear, the said Cleregie being presently assembled in Convocation by auctorite of the Kings Writ, do desire that the Kings Majesties licence in writeing may be for them obteyned and granted according to the effect of the said Statutes auctoriseing them to attempt, entreate and commune of such matters, and therein freely to geve their consents, which otherwise they may not doe, upon peyne and perill premised.</hi>

Their resolutions contain distinct answers to several Sets of questions propounded to them. The first Set contained several Questions about the Mass, about the instituting, receiving, nature, celebration of it; and whether in the Mass it be convenient to use such speech as the people may understand, whether the whole were fit to be translated, or only some part of it; with several other questions of the same nature. The second Set is more pertinent to our purpose, wherein are 17 Questions proposed to be resolved; Ten of them belong to the number of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the other 7. concern Church Government.

And so some tyme the Appostles and other unto whom God had given abundantly his spirit, sent or appointed Ministers of Gods word, sometime the people did chose such as they thought meete thereunto.

And besides all this mischief, it is founded on a Vice contrary to all Christian Humility, without which no Man shall see his Saviour. For they doe but abase themselves and others, that would perswade us, that Bishops by Christs Institution have any Superiority over men further then of Reverence, or that any Bishop is Superiour to another, further then Positive Order agreed upon among Christians hath prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: For we have believed him that hath told us, that in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ there is neither high nor low: and that in giving Honour, every Man should be ready to preferre another before himself: Which saying cuts off all claim certainly of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, by Title of Christianity, except Men think that these things were spoken onely to poor and private Men.

                     <hi>of</hi> secundum sub &amp; supra, <hi>all this comes from composition and agreement of men among themselves; wherefore this abuse of Christianity to make it Lacquey to Ambition, is a vice for which I have no extraordinary name of Ignominy; and an ordinary I will not give it, lest you should take so transcendent a vice to be but trivial.</hi> Thus that grave and wise person, whose words savour of a more then ordinary tincture of a true Spirit of Christianity, that scorns to make Religion a footstool to pride and ambition. We see plainly he makes all difference between Church-Officers to arise from consent of parties, and not from any Divine Law.

He asserts it to be in the Churches power and liberty to add several orders of Ministers according as it judgeth them tend to edification; and saith, he is far from condemning the Course of the Primitive Church in erecting one as Bishop over the Presbyters, for better managing Church Affairs; yea, Arch-Bishops, Metropolitans, and Patriarchs as insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Primitive Church before the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> he thinks may be both excused and defended, although afterward they degenerated into Tyranny and Ambition. And in his <hi>Observations</hi> upon his <hi>Confession,</hi> penned chiefly upon the occasion of the exceptions of <hi>Magnus quidam Vir</hi> (some will guess who that was) taken at the free delivery of his mind concerning the Polity of the Primitive Church, he hath expressions to this purpose: That what was unanimously determined by the Primitive Church without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to Scripture, did come from the Holy Spirit. <hi>Hinc fit,</hi> saith he, <hi>ut quae sint hujuscemodi, ea ego improbare nec velim, nec audeam bona conscientia.

And that he might shew he was not alone in this opinion, he produceth two large and excellent Discourses of <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> concerning the Polity of the ancient Church, which he recites with approbation; the one out of his Commentaries on the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> the other <hi>de Disciplina Clericali:</hi> whereby we have gained another Testimony of that famous and peaceable Divine, whose<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Chemnitius</hi> or <hi>Zanchy</hi> did look upon the Church as so bound up by any immutable Form of Church-Government laid down in Scripture, but it might lawfully and laudably alter it for better edification of the Church. For these Learned Divines conceiving that at first in the Church there was no difference between Bishop and Presbyter, and commending the Polity of the Church when Episcopacy was set in a higher order, they must of necessity hold that there was no obligation to observe that Form which was used in <hi>Apostolical</hi> times.</p>
                  <p>Our next inquiry is into the opinion of the <hi>French Church,</hi> and the eminent Divines therein. For <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>and one that was able to cut even betwixt the League, the Church and State:</hi> His words are these; <hi>As for the English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I say, it is grounded upon Gods Word so far forth as it keepeth the State of the Clergy instituted in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and confirmed in the New. And concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the French Church, so far as concerneth the equality of Ministers, it hath the like foundation in Gods Word: namely in the example of the Apostles; which may suffice to authorize both these Forms of Estate; albeit in several times and places. None can deny but that the Apostles among themselves were equal, as concerning authority, albeit there were an Order for their precedency. When the Apostles first planted Churches, the same being small and in affliction, there were not as yet any other Bishops, Priests or Deacons but themselves; they, were the Bishops and Deacons, and together served the Tables. Those men therefore whom God raiseth up to plant a Church, can do no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then after the examples of the Apostles to bear themselves in equal authority. For this cause have the French Ministers,</hi>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:100525:215"/>
                     <hi>planters of the Reformed Church in</hi> France <hi>usurped it, howbeit provisionally—reserving liberty to alter it, according to the occurrences. But the equality that rested among the Bishops of the primitive Church, did increase as the Churches increased; and thence proceeded the Creation of Deacons, and afterwards of other Bishops and Priests; yet ceased not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles equality in authority; but they that were created, had not like authority with the Apostles; but the Apostles remained as Soveraign Bishops, neither were any greater then they. Hereof I do inferr that in the State of a mighty and peaceable Church, as is the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or as the Church of</hi> France <hi>is (or such might be, if God should call it to Reformation) the State of the Clergy ought to be preserved. For equality will be hurtful to the State, and in time breed confusion. But as the Apostles continued Churches in their equality so long as the Churches by them planted were small; so should equality be applyed in the planting of a Church, or so long as the Church conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth small, or under persecution; yet may it also be admitted as not repugnant to Gods Word in those places where already it is received, rather then to innovate anything. I say therefore, that even in the Apostles times the state of the Clergy increased as the Church increased. Neither was the Government under the bondage of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and during the peace of the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>alike; for Israelites had first Iudges, and after their state increased, Kings.</hi> Thus far that <hi>Politique Reformer.</hi> Whose words are so full and pertinent to the scope and drift of this whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, that there is no need of any Commentary to draw them to my sense. The next I shall pitch upon in the French Church, is, a <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of three as learned persons in their several wayes as most that Church or any since the reformation hath bred; they are <hi>Blondel, Bochartus,</hi> and <hi>Amyraldus.</hi> The first is that great Church Antiquary, <hi>Blondel</hi> the known and learned assertor of <hi>Ieromes</hi> opinion concerning the primitive equality of Presbyters, who was likewise of <hi>Ieromes</hi> mind as to the mutability of that form if the Church saw fit, as appears by these words of his speaking of that Form of Ecclesiastical Polity<note place="margin">

                  <p>We come now in the <hi>second</hi> place to those, who though<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> they look upon equality of Ministers as the Primitive Form, yet do allow Episcopal Government in the Church as a very lawful and useful constitution. By which it is evident, that they did not judge the Primitive Form to carry an universal obligation along with it, over all Churches, ages, and places. Upon this account, our learned <hi>Crakanthorp</hi> frees all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches from the charge of <hi>Aërianisin,</hi> laid upon them by the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Spalato</hi> (when he licked up his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vomit in his <hi>Consilium reditûs).

Wherein then lay the difference For we have already seen that our Great Divines then, did not look upon their form of Government as necessary, but only lawfull; and <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> would not be thought to prescribe their form to other Churches. All the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference then was, not Whether their form of Government was founded on Divine Right? not Whether Episcopacy in the Church was lawfull or no? not Whether Diocesan Churches were unlawfull? or Whether every Congregation should have an Ecclesiastical Senate? But, Whether it were more agreeable to the Primitive form, that the President of the Ecclesiastical Senate should have only an order among, or a degree above the Senate its self? But chiefly it was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the present state of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> it were more convenient wholly to lay aside the form of Government by <hi>Bishops,</hi> which had been so much abused in the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> and to reduce all Ministers of the Gospel to an equality with only a Presidency of order, thereby to free <hi>themselves</hi> from the imputation of Ambition, and to prevent it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>others;</hi> or else it were more prudent only to retrench the abuses of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> under the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and to reduce it to that form wherein it was practiced in the <hi>Church,</hi> before the <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>Usurpation</hi> of the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> had ingrossed all <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical power</hi> into his own hands? The former part was embraced generally by the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> the latter by our <hi>Church of England,</hi> so that the Question was not about Divine Right, but about a matter of prudence; not What form was setled by a Law of Christ; but what form was suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the present state of the Churches of the Reformation. Therefore we see none of these forraign Divines did charge
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:100525:219"/>
the Government of this Church with <hi>unlawfulness,</hi> but <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,</hi> as it was a step to pride and ambition, and an occasion whereby men might do the Church injury by the excess of their power, if they were not men of an excellent temper and moderation. Thence that prediction of <hi>Padre Paule,</hi> that the Church of <hi>England</hi> would then, find the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of Episcopacy, when a high-spirited Bishop should once come to rule that Church; and so <hi>Beza</hi> when he had freed the Bishops of the Reformation from that imputation of <hi>Lording it over their Brethren,</hi> which he had charged the Roman Bishops with, yet he adds, that he would beg them rather to lay down their power, then to transmit that power to those after them, <hi>hanc ipsorum moderationem &amp; aequita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem minimè forsan sequuturis, Who it may be were not like</hi>

It was not then any unlawfulness in the Government of Episcopacy its self, but its lyableness to abuses, which made the Reformed Churches reduce Modern Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy into a meer Presidency of Order, which was not so ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the same inconveniences. A clear evidence that they judged not the Government unlawfull, is, their often profession of a ready and chearfull obedience to Bishops, if they would embrace the Gospel, and stand up in defence of the true Doctrine.

In <hi>Sweden</hi> there is<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Duree</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Protestant Churches beyond the Seas.</note> one <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> and <hi>seven Bishops:</hi> and so in <hi>Denmark,</hi> though not with so great authority in <hi>Holstein, Pomeren, Mecklenburgh, Brunswicke, Luneburgh, Bremen, Oldenburgh, East Frieseland, Hessen, Saxony,</hi> and all the upper part of <hi>Germany</hi> and the Protestant Imperial Cities, Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in the hands of <hi>Super-intendents.</hi> In the <hi>Palatinate</hi> they had <hi>Inspectores</hi> and <hi>Praepositi,</hi> over which was the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Consistory of three Clergy men, and three Counsellors of State with their President: and so they have their <hi>Praepositos</hi> in <hi>Wetteraw, Hessen</hi> and <hi>Anhalt.</hi> In <hi>Transylvania, Polonia,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> they have their <hi>Seniores</hi> enjoying the same power with anclent Bishops. So that we see all these <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> although they acknowledge no such thing as a divine Right of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> but stiffely maintain <hi>Ieromes</hi> opinion of the primitive equality of Gospel Ministers; yet they are so far from accounting it unlawfull to have some Church Officers acting in a higher degree above others, that they themselves embrace it under different names and titles, in order to the Peace, Unity, and Government of their several Churches; Whereby they give us an evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that they looked not upon the primitive form to be immutable, but that the orders and degrees of Ministers is

only a Prudential thing, and left in the liberty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Church, to be determined according to their tendency to preserve the peace and settlement of a Church.</p>
                  <p>We come in the last place to those who hold Episcopacy<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> to be the Primitive Form, yet not unalterably binding all Churches and places, but that those Churches who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, are truly constituted Churches; and Ministers are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ordained by meer Presbyters. This is largely proved by Mr. <hi>Francis Mason,</hi> in his excellent <hi>Defence of the Ordination</hi>

                     <hi>of Ministers beyond the Seas:</hi> to which I refer the Reader. Only I shall shew out of him how the State of the Question about the <hi>Ius divinum</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is formed. <hi>First, If by</hi> jure divino <hi>you mean that which is according to Scripture, then the preheminence of Bishops is</hi> jure divino; <hi>for it hath been already proved to be according to Scripture. Secondly, If by</hi> jure divino <hi>you mean the Ordinance of God, in this sense also it may be said to be</hi> jure divino. <hi>For it is an ordinance of the Apostles, whereunto they were directed by Gods Spirit, even by the Spirit of Prophecy, and consequently the ordinance of God. But if by</hi> jure divino <hi>you understand a Law and Commandment of God, binding all Christian Churches universally, perpetually, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and with such absolute necessity, that no other form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment may in any case be admitted; in this sense neither may we grant it, nor yet can you prove it to be</hi> jure divino.</p>
                  <p>Whereby we see this learned and moderate man was far from unchurching all who wanted Bishops; and absolutely declares, that though he look on Episcopacy as an Apostolical Institution, yet that no unalterable Divine Right is founded thereupon. So before him the both learned and pious Bishop <hi>G. Downham</hi> explains himself concerning the Right of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> in these remarkable words: <hi>Though in respect of the first</hi>

                     <hi>Institution, there is small difference between an Apostolical and Divine Ordinance, because what was, ordained by the Apostles, proceeded from God (in which sense, and no other, I do hold the Episcopal function to be a divine Ordinance, I mean in respect of of the first Institution) yet in respect of perpetuity, difference by some is made between those things which be</hi> divini, <hi>and those which be</hi> Apostolici juris; <hi>the former in their understanding</hi>

For the former, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their opinion of the primitive Form, do hold Episcopacy lawfull; and the latter, who hold Episcopacy to have been the primitive Form, do not hold it perpetually and immutably necessary, but that Presbyters (where Bishops cannot be had) may lawfully discharge the offices belonging to Bishops; both which Concessions do necessarily destroy the perpetual Divine Right of that Form of Government they assert: Which is the thing I have been so long in proving, and I hope made it evident to any unprejudicated mind.</p>

                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:100525:222"/>Having laid down this now as a sure foundation for peace<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> and union, it were a very easie matter to improve it, in order to an Accommodation of our present differences about Church Government. I shall only lay down three general Principles deducible from hence, and leave the whole to the mature consideration of the Lovers of Truth and Peace. The first Principle, is, <hi>That Prudence must be used in setling the Government of the Church.</hi> This hath been the whole design of this Treatise, to prove that the Form of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government is a meer matter of prudence, regulated by the Word of God. But I need not insist on the Arguments already brought to prove it; for, as far as I can find, although the several parties in their contentions with one another plead for Divine Right; yet when any one of them comes to settle their own particular Form, they are fain to call in the help of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, even in things supposed by the several parties, as necessary to the establishment of their own Form. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational</hi> men may despair of ever finding <hi>Elective Synods, an explicite Church-Covenant,</hi> or <hi>positive signs of Grace</hi> in admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Church-members in any Law of Christ: nay, they will not generally plead for any more for them, then general rules of Scripture, fine Similitudes, and Analogies, and evidence of natural Reason; and what are all these at last to an express Law of Christ, without which it was pretended nothing was to be done in the Church of God? The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> seem more generally to own the use of General Rules, and the Light of Nature, in order to the Form of Church Government, as in the <hi>subordination of Courts, Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Assemblies;</hi> and the more moderate sort, as to <hi>Lay elders.</hi> The <hi>Episcopal</hi> men will hardly find any evidence in Scripture, or the practice of the Apostles, for <hi>Churches consisting of many fixed Congregations for worship, under the charge of one Person;</hi> nor in the Primitive Church, for <hi>the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Bishop without the preceding election of the Clergy, and at least consent and approbation of the people;</hi> and neither in Scripture, nor antiquity, the least footstep of a <hi>delegation of Church-power.</hi> So that upon the matter at last, all of them make use of those things in Church Government, which have no other foundation but the Principles of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
                     <pb n="415" facs="tcp:100525:222"/>
                     <hi>prudence,</hi> guided by the Scriptures; and it were well if that were observed still. The second Principle is, <hi>That Form of Government is the best according to principles of Christian Prudence, which comes the nearest to Apostolical practice, and tends most to the advancing the peace and unity of the Church of God.</hi> What that Form is, I presume not to define and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but leave it to be gather'd from the evidence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Antiquity, as to the Primitive practice; and from the nature, state, and condition of that Church wherein it is to be setled, as to its tendency to the advancement of peace and unity in it. In order to the finding out of which, that proposal of his late most excellent Majesty of glorious memory,<note place="margin">His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Ministers at <hi>Now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. ad sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> is most highly just and reasonable. <hi>His Majesty thinketh it well worthy the studies and endeavours of Divines of both opinions, laying aside emulation and private interests, to reduce Episcopacy and Presbyteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>If this Proposal be embraced, as there is no reason why it should not; then, all such things must be retrieved which were unquestionably of the Primitive practice, but have been grown out of use through the length and corruption of times. Such are the <hi>restoring of the Presbyteries of several Churches,</hi> as the <hi>Senate</hi> to the Bishop, with whole counsel and advice all things were done in the Primitive Church. <hi>The contracting of Dioceses into such a compass as may be fitted for the personal inspection of the Bishop, and care of himself and the</hi> Senate; <hi>the placing of Bishops in all great Towns of resort,</hi> especially <hi>County Towns;</hi> that according to the ancient course of the Church, its Government may be proportioned<note place="margin">

they are not as much, if not more necessary then ever. And therefore all who appeal to the practice of the Primitive Church, must condemn themselves, if they justifie the neglect of them. But I only touch at these things, my design being only to lay a foundation for a happy union. <hi>Lastly, What Form of Government is determined by lawfull authority in the Church of God, ought so far to be submitted to, as it contains nothing repugnant to the Word of God.</hi> So that let mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be what they will concerning the Primitive Form, seeing it hath been proved, that that Form doth not bind unalterably and necessarily, it remains that the determining of the Form of Government is a matter of liberty in the Church; and what is so may be determined by lawfull authority; and what is so determined by that authority, doth bind men to obedience, as hath been proved by the 5. <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> in the entrance of<note place="margin">

The Church proved to be a Society distinct from the Common-wealth; by reason of its different Nature, and divine Institution; distinct Officers, different Rights, and Ends, and peculiar Offences. The Power of the Church doth not arise from me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Power of Church-Officers not meerly Doctrinal, proved by several Arguments. Church-Power as to particular persons antecedent to confederation. The Power of the Keys relates to Baptism. The Churches Power extends to Excommunication: what it is, and what grounds it had under the Law. No exclusion from Temple-worship among the Iews. Excommunication necessary in a Christian Church, because of the conditions supposed to communion in it. Of the Incestuous person, and the Grounds of the Apostolical censure. Objections against Excommunication answered. The funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Rights of the Church continue after its being incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the civil State. The Magistrates Power, as to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, cleared.</p>

to explain, what that <hi>Power</hi> is, which I attribute to the <hi>Church,</hi> and in what notion the <hi>Church</hi> is to be considered as it <hi>exerciseth</hi> this Power. <hi>First,</hi> concerning the proper notion of <hi>Power;</hi> by it I cannot see any thing else to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, than a <hi>right of governing or ordering things which belong to a Society.</hi> And so <hi>Power</hi> implies onely a <hi>moral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> in the person enjoying it, to take care <hi>ne quid civitas detrimenti capiat,</hi> whereby it is evident that every well consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Society must suppose a Power within its self of ordering things belonging to its welfare, or else it were impossible, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>being,</hi> or the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of a <hi>Society</hi> could be long preserved. <hi>Power</hi> then in its general and abstracted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth not necessarily import either <hi>meer Authority,</hi> or <hi>proper Coaction;</hi> for these, to any impartial judgement, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be rather the several <hi>modes</hi> whereby power is exercised, than any proper ingredients of the <hi>specifick Nature</hi> of it: which; in general, imports no more then <hi>a right to govern a constituted Society;</hi> but how that right shall be exercised, must be resolved not from the notion of Power, but from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>constitution</hi> of that particular Society in which it is <hi>lodged</hi> and <hi>inherent.</hi>

            <p>This being then the nature of <hi>power</hi> in general, it is I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose clear, that an outward coactive <hi>force</hi> is not <hi>necessary</hi> in order to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if some may have a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi> and others

            <p>But if now from hence it appears (as certainly it cannot<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> but appear) that this <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> doth <hi>subsist</hi> by vertue of a <hi>Divine positive Law,</hi> then it must of <hi>necessity</hi> be <hi>distinct</hi> from a <hi>civil Society,</hi> and that on these <hi>accounts: First,</hi> because there is an <hi>antecedent obligation</hi> on <hi>conscience</hi> to <hi>associate</hi> on the account of <hi>Christianity,</hi> whether <hi>Humane Laws prohibit</hi> or <hi>command</hi> it. From whence, of necessity it follows, that the <hi>constitution</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is really different from that of the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> because whether the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth</hi> be for, or against this <hi>Society,</hi> all that own it are <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>profess</hi> it openly, and declare themselves mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it. Whereas, were the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth really</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> all <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>Church society</hi> would arise meerly from the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</hi> But now there being a <hi>Divine Law, binding</hi> in <hi>conscience,</hi> whose <hi>obligation</hi> cannot bee <hi>superseded</hi> by any <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law,</hi> it is plain and evident, where are such vastly <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent obligations,</hi> there are different <hi>Powers;</hi> and in this sense I know no <hi>incongruity,</hi> in admitting <hi>imperium in imperio,</hi> if by it wee understand no <hi>external coactive power,</hi> but an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power laying obligation on conscience, distinct</hi> from the power <hi>lodged</hi> in a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> considered as such. An <hi>outward</hi>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:100525:229"/>
               <hi>coactive power</hi> was alwayes <hi>disowned</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> but certainly not an <hi>internal Power</hi> over <hi>conscience</hi> to <hi>oblige</hi> all his <hi>Disciples</hi> to what <hi>Duties</hi> hee thought fit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> I argue from those <hi>Officers,</hi> whose <hi>rights</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> this Society are <hi>founded</hi> on that <hi>Charter,</hi> whereby the <hi>Society</hi> it self subsists. Now I would willingly know why, when <hi>our Saviour</hi> disowned all <hi>outward power</hi> in the World, yet hee should <hi>constitute</hi> a <hi>Society,</hi> and <hi>appoint Officers</hi> in it, did hee not <hi>intend</hi> a peculiar <hi>distinct Society</hi> from the other <hi>Societies</hi> of the world. And therefore the argument frequently used against <hi>Church-power,</hi> because it hath no <hi>outward force</hi> with it by the <hi>constitution</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is a strong <hi>argument</hi> to me of the <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity</hi> of a <hi>Christian society</hi> from a <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> because <hi>Christ</hi> so <hi>instituted</hi> it, as not to have it ruled at <hi>first</hi> by any <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force</hi> or <hi>power.</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> saith, his <hi>Kingdome was not of this world;</hi> he implies, that he had a <hi>Society</hi> that was <hi>governed</hi> by his <hi>Laws</hi> in the world, yet <hi>distinct</hi> from all <hi>mundane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi> had not <hi>our Saviour</hi> intended his <hi>Church</hi> to have been a <hi>peculiar Society</hi> distinct from a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> it is hard to conceive why <hi>our Saviour</hi> should <hi>interdict</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> the <hi>use</hi> of a <hi>civil coactive power:</hi> Or why instead of <hi>sending abroad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> hee did not employ the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Commonwealths</hi> to have inforced <hi>Christianity</hi> by <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>temporal edicts,</hi> and the <hi>several Magistrates</hi> to have impowred several <hi>persons</hi> under them to <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Territories?</hi> And can any thing bee more plain, by our <hi>Saviours</hi> taking a contrary <hi>course,</hi> than that hee <hi>intended</hi> a <hi>Church society</hi> to bee <hi>distinct</hi> from <hi>civil,</hi> and the power belonging to it (as well as the <hi>Officers</hi>) to bee of a <hi>different</hi> nature from that which is <hi>settled</hi> in a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> I here suppose, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath by a <hi>positive Law</hi> established the <hi>Government</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> upon <hi>Officers</hi> of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">

               </gap>om the peculiar <hi>rights</hi> belonging to these <hi>Societies:</hi> For if every one <hi>born</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi> have not thereby a <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> nor every <hi>one</hi> by being of the <hi>Church,</hi> any <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>benefits</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> it must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that these are <hi>distinct</hi> from one another.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I argue from the different <hi>ends</hi> of these <hi>societies.</hi> A <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is <hi>constituted</hi> for <hi>civil ends,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>spiritual:</hi> for <hi>ends</hi> are to be <hi>judged</hi> by the <hi>primary consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> but now it is <hi>plain,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of civil <hi>society</hi> is for <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of mens rights as men (therefore <hi>Magistracy</hi> is called by St. <hi>Peter</hi>

               </gap>): but this <hi>Christian society</hi> doth not <hi>respect men</hi> under the <hi>connotation</hi> of men but as <hi>Christians.</hi> The answer given to this is very short and insufficient, when it is said, that every man in a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> is to act upon <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> accounts and ends: For there is a great deal of <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>Christianities</hi> having an influence upon mens <hi>actings</hi> in a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and making a <hi>society</hi> the same with a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> To <hi>argue</hi> therefore from one to another, is a <hi>shortness</hi> of <hi>discourse</hi> I cannot but <hi>wonder</hi> at: unless it could be proved, that <hi>Christianity</hi> aymed at <hi>nothing</hi> else but <hi>regulating men</hi> in the <hi>affairs</hi> of <hi>a Commonwealth,</hi> which is a task I suppose will not be undertaken.</p>

            <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, <hi>That the power of the Church over it's members in case of offences, doth not arise meerly from confederation and consent, though it doth suppose it.</hi> This <hi>Church power</hi> may be considered <hi>two wayes.</hi> Either, <hi>first,</hi> as it implyes the <hi>right in some of inflicting censures.</hi> Or <hi>secondly,</hi> as it implyes in <hi>others, the duty of submitting to censures inflicted;</hi> now as to both these, I shall prove that their <hi>original</hi> is higher than meer <hi>confederation.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>1. As to the right of inflicting censures</hi> on these accounts. <hi>First,</hi> What ever <hi>society</hi> doth <hi>subsist</hi> by vertue of a <hi>divine constitution,</hi> doth by vertue thereof <hi>derive</hi> all power for it's <hi>preservation,</hi> in <hi>peace, unity,</hi> and <hi>purity;</hi> but it is plain, that a <hi>power of censuring offenders,</hi> is necessary for the <hi>Churches preservation in peace</hi> and <hi>purity;</hi> and it is already proved, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath its <hi>Charter</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore from him it hath a <hi>power</hi> to inflict <hi>punishments</hi> on <hi>Offenders,</hi> suitable to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> they are of. I am very prone to think that the <hi>ground</hi> of all the <hi>mistakes</hi> on this <hi>subject</hi> have risen from hence, that some, <hi>imprudently</hi> enough, have fixt the <hi>original</hi> of this Power on some <hi>ambiguous places</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which may, and it may bee, ought to bee <hi>taken</hi> in a different <hi>sense;</hi> and their adversaries, finding those places weak and insufficient proofs of such a power, have from thence rejected any such kind of power at all; But certainly, if wee should <hi>reject</hi> every truth that is <hi>weakly proved</hi> by some who have undertaken it, I know no opinion would <hi>bid</hi> so sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>eum Ecclestae coetu, à Christo semel constituto, omnia illa imperata censeri debent, sine quibus ejus coeiûs, puritas retineri non potest.</hi> And therefore men spend needless pains to prove an <hi>institution</hi> of this <hi>power</hi> by some positive <hi>precept,</hi> when <hi>Christs</hi> founding his <hi>Church</hi> as a <hi>peculiar Society,</hi> is sufficient proof hee hath <hi>endowed</hi> it with this fundamental <hi>Right,</hi> without which the <hi>Society,</hi> were <hi>arena sino calce,</hi> a company of persons without any <hi>common tye</hi> of <hi>union</hi> among them; for if there bee any such union, it must depend on <hi>some conditions,</hi> to bee performed by the <hi>members</hi> of that Society, which how could they require from them, if they have not <hi>power</hi> to exclude them upon <hi>non performance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I prove the divine original of this power from the <hi>special appointment</hi> and <hi>designation</hi> of <hi>particular Officers</hi> by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> for the ruling of this <hi>Society.</hi> Now I say, that <hi>Law</hi> which provides there shall bee <hi>Officers</hi> to <hi>Govern,</hi> doth give them <hi>power</hi> to <hi>govern,</hi> suitably to the <hi>Nature</hi> of their <hi>society:</hi> Either then you must <hi>deny,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> hath by an <hi>unalterable Institution</hi> appointed a <hi>Gospel Ministry,</hi> or that this <hi>Ministry</hi> hath no <hi>Power</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> or that their <hi>Power</hi> extends not to <hi>excommunication.</hi> The first I have already proved, the second <hi>follows</hi> from their appointment: for by all the <hi>titles</hi> given to <hi>Church Officers</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> it appears they had a <hi>Power</hi> over the <hi>Church,</hi> (as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.) All which as you well know, do import a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi> the <hi>Society</hi> over which they are set. And that this power should not extend to a <hi>power</hi> to <hi>exclude convict Offenders,</hi> seems very strange, when no other <hi>punishment</hi> can be more <hi>suitable</hi> to the nature of the <hi>Society</hi> than this is; which is a debarring him from the <hi>priviledges</hi> of that <hi>Society,</hi> which the <hi>offender</hi> hath so much <hi>dishonoured.</hi> Can there be any <hi>punishment</hi> less imagined towards <hi>contumacious offenders</hi> then this is, or that carries in it less of <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>coactive force,</hi> it implying nothing but what the <hi>offender</hi> himself freely yielded to at his <hi>entrance</hi> into this <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I can find replyed by any of the <hi>Adversaryes</hi> of the<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> opinion I here assert, to the <hi>argument</hi> drawn from the <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> of the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is, that all those <hi>titles</hi> which are given to the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:100525:231"/>
               <hi>New Testament,</hi> that do import <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> are all to be taken in a <hi>Spiritual sense,</hi> as they are <hi>Christs Ministers</hi> and <hi>Ambassadors</hi> to preach his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>declare his Will</hi> to his Church. So that all power such persons conceive to lye in those Titles, is only <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>declarative;</hi> but how true that is, let any one judge that considers these things.</p>
            <p>1. That there was certainly a power of <hi>Discipline</hi> then in the <hi>Churches constituted</hi> by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which is most evident not onely from the passages relating to Offenders in Saint <hi>Pauls Epistles,</hi> especially to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> but from the continued Practice of succeeding Ages manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> and many others. There being then a power of <hi>Discipline</hi> in <hi>Apostolical Churches,</hi> there was a <hi>necessity</hi> it should be administred by some <hi>Persons</hi> who had the care of those <hi>Churches;</hi> and who were they but the severall <hi>Pastors</hi> of them? It being then evident that there was such a Power, doth it not stand to common sense it should be implyed in such <hi>Titles,</hi> which in their Naturall Importance do signifie a Right to Govern, as the names of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> do?</p>
            <p>2. There is a <hi>diversity</hi> in Scripture made between <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. Though this may not (as it doth not) imply a <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>two distinct Offices</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet it doth a <hi>different respect</hi> and <hi>connotation</hi> in the same person, and so imports that <hi>Ruling</hi> carries in it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then meer Teaching, and so the power implyed in <hi>Pastors</hi> to be more then meerly <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> which is all I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, <hi>viz.</hi> A right to govern the flock committed to their charge.</p>
            <p>3. What possible difference can be assigned between the <hi>Elders that Rule well, and those which labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> (1 Timothy 5. 17.) if all their <hi>Ruling</hi> were meerly <hi>labouring in the Word and Doctrine?</hi> and all their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi> nothing but <hi>Teaching?</hi> I intend not to prove an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Rulers distinct from Teachers from hence (which I know neither this place, nor any other will do) but that the <hi>formal conception</hi> of <hi>Ruling,</hi> is different from that of <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I argue from the <hi>Analogy</hi> between the Primitive
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:100525:232"/>
               <hi>Churches</hi> and the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> that, as, many of the names were taken from thence where they carried a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Discipline</hi> with them, so they must do in some <hi>proportion</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> or it were not easie understanding them. It is most certain the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> had a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Ruling,</hi> and can you conceive the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church had none, when the <hi>Societies</hi> were much of the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and the <hi>Government</hi> of the one was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed from the other, as hath been already largely proved?</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>acts</hi> attributed to <hi>Pastor</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> imply a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Governing,</hi> distinct from meer <hi>Teaching;</hi> such are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, is attributed to those who have <hi>over-sight of Churches,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 8. by which it is certainly evident, that a power more than <hi>Doctrinal</hi> is understood, as that it could not then be <hi>understood of</hi> a <hi>power meerly civil.</hi> And this I suppose may suffice to <hi>vindicate</hi> this <hi>Argument</hi> from the <hi>Titles of Church Officers,</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> that they are not <hi>insignificant things,</hi> but the persons who enjoyed them had a <hi>right to govern</hi> the Society over which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath made them <hi>Over-seers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. I argue that <hi>Church-Power</hi> ariseth not meerly from <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> because the <hi>Church</hi> may <hi>exercise</hi> her <hi>Power</hi> on such, who have not <hi>actually confederated</hi> with her; which is in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting members into the Church: For if the <hi>Church-Officers</hi> have power to <hi>judge</hi> whether <hi>persons</hi> are <hi>fit</hi> to be <hi>admitted,</hi> they have <hi>power</hi> to <hi>exclude</hi> from <hi>admission</hi> such whom they judge unfit, and so their <hi>power</hi> is <hi>exercised</hi> on those who are not <hi>confederated.</hi> To this it may be answered, <hi>That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to be judged, gives the Church power over the person suing for admission.</hi> I grant it doth, as to that particular <hi>person;</hi> but the <hi>Right</hi> in generall of <hi>judging concerning Admission,</hi> doth
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:100525:232"/>
argue an <hi>antecedent</hi> power to an <hi>actual confederation.</hi> For I will suppose that <hi>Christ</hi> should now appoint some <hi>Officers</hi> to found a <hi>Church,</hi> and gather a <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> together, where there hath been none before: I now ask Whether these <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers have power to admit any into the Church or no? This I suppose cannot be denied, for to what end else were they appointed? If it be granted they have power to admit persons, and thereby make a Church, then they had power antecedently to any confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; for the Confederation was subsequent to their Admission: and therefore they who had power to admit, could not derive their power from confederation. This Argument, to me, puts the case out of dispute, that all Church-power cannot arise from meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that which further evidenceth that the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> doth not arise from meer <hi>consent,</hi> is that <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Gift</hi> whereby our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> did confer the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keyes</hi> on the <hi>Apostle Peter,</hi> as the <hi>representative</hi> in that action of the whole <hi>Colledge</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> of which power all the <hi>Apostles</hi> were actually <hi>infeoffed,</hi> John 20. 23. By which <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keyes</hi> is certainly meant some <hi>Administration</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> which doth respect it as a visible <hi>Society,</hi> in which Sense the <hi>Church,</hi> is so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called, as in that place, <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 19.</note> and in all probability the <hi>Administration</hi> intended here by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> is that we are now discoursing of, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Admission</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, in order to the pardon of the sins of all <hi>penitent Believers,</hi> and the <hi>shutting out</hi> of such who were manifestly <hi>unworthy</hi> of so holy a <hi>communion.</hi> So that the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Keyes</hi> do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For if the <hi>Apostles</hi> as <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were <hi>invested</hi> with a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>judging</hi> of mens <hi>fitness</hi> for <hi>Admission</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>members</hi> of it, it stands to the <hi>highest Reason</hi> that they should have thereby likewise a <hi>power</hi> conveyed to them, of <hi>excluding</hi> such as are <hi>unworthy</hi> after their <hi>Admission,</hi> to maintain <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>Church.</hi> So that this interpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>1. I grant, the <hi>Passeover</hi> was <hi>commemorative</hi> as to the <hi>occasion</hi> of its <hi>Institution:</hi> but then it was withal <hi>Typical</hi> and <hi>annunciative</hi> of that <hi>Lamb of God who was to take away the sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the world;</hi> and therefore no person who desired <hi>expiation</hi> of <hi>sins,</hi> was to bee debarred from it, but the <hi>Lords-supper</hi> under the <hi>Gospel</hi> hath nothing in it <hi>propitiatory,</hi> but is <hi>intended</hi> as a <hi>Feast</hi> upon a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and a <hi>Federal Rite,</hi> as hath been fully cleared by a very <hi>learned person</hi> in his <hi>discourse</hi> about <hi>the true notion</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I grant the <hi>Iews</hi> had very many <hi>priviledges</hi> above other <hi>Nations:</hi> Nay so far, that the whole <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> were looked upon as <hi>Gods chosen,</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>holy people;</hi> and from thence I justly inferr, that whatever <hi>exclusion</hi> was among the <hi>people</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> from their <hi>society,</hi> will far better hold as an <hi>argument</hi> for <hi>Excommunication</hi> under the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> than if it had been a meer <hi>debarring</hi> from their <hi>Levitical Worship.</hi> And that I should far sooner insist upon, from the reason assigned, as the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> then the other <hi>infirm</hi> and <hi>pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Question then being thus clearly <hi>stated,</hi> it amounts to<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> this, <hi>Whether under the Gospel, there be any power in the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church by vertue of Divine Institution to exclude any Offenders out of the Christian Society, for transgressing the Laws of it?</hi> And according to our former <hi>Propositions,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it will be sufficient to prove that <hi>power</hi> to bee of <hi>Divine Institution;</hi> if I prove it to bee <hi>fundamentally</hi> and <hi>intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally resident</hi> in the <hi>Society</hi> its self.

               <hi>result</hi> from the <hi>Society</hi> its self, must have the same <hi>Original</hi> which the <hi>subject</hi> hath, because this hath the <hi>nature</hi> of an <hi>inseparable property resulting</hi> from its <hi>constitution.</hi> For the clearing of which, I shall lay down my thoughts of it as clearly and methodically as I can; and that in these following <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Where there is a power of declaring any person to bee no true member of the Society hee is in, there is a formal power of Excommunication:</hi> For this is all which I intend by it, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>authoritative pronouncing</hi> virtute officii, <hi>any convict Offender to have forfeited his interest in the Church as a Christian society: and to lose all the priviledges of it:</hi> So that if this power be lodged in any <hi>Church Officer,</hi> then he hath power <hi>formally</hi> to <hi>Excommunicate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Where the enjoyment of the priviledges of a society is not absolute and necessary, but depends upon conditions to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by every member, of which the Society is Iudge, there is a power in the Rulers of that Society to debar any person from such priviledges, upon non-performance of the conditions.</hi> As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the <hi>jus Civitatis</hi> to depend upon <hi>defending</hi> the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>City;</hi> upon a <hi>failing</hi> in reference to <hi>this,</hi> in any person <hi>admitted</hi> to <hi>Citizen-ship,</hi> the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> have the same <hi>power</hi> to take that <hi>Right</hi> away, which they had at first to <hi>give</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; because that <hi>Right</hi> was never <hi>absolutely</hi> given, but upon <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> that the person did not <hi>overthrow</hi> the <hi>ends</hi> for which it was bestowed upon him.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Church is such a Society in which Communion is not absolute and necessary, but it doth depend upon the performance of some Conditions, of which the Governours of it are the competent Iudges:</hi> And that appears,</p>
            <p>1. Because the <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Church, depends</hi> upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> to be judged by <hi>Pastors,</hi> as in case of <hi>adult persons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Infidels</hi> being <hi>Baptized:</hi> in both which cases it is evident that <hi>conditions</hi> are <hi>pre-requisite,</hi> of which the <hi>Pastors</hi> are <hi>Iudges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because the <hi>priviledges</hi> of this <hi>Society</hi> do require a <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from other <hi>Societies</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> and call for greater <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> of life; and those very <hi>priviledges</hi> are <hi>pledges</hi> of greater benefits which belong only to persons

qualified with suitable <hi>conditions;</hi> it would therefore bee a very great <hi>dishonour</hi> to this <hi>Society,</hi> if it lay as <hi>common</hi> and <hi>open</hi> as other <hi>Societies</hi> in the World do, and no more <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> required from the members of it.</p>
            <p>3. Wee have <hi>instances</hi> in the sacred <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Apostolical times,</hi> of such <hi>scandals</hi> which have been the ground of the <hi>exclusion</hi> of the <hi>persons</hi> guilty of them from the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Christian society.</hi> And here I suppose we may (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the little evasions which have been found out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>sensible</hi> of so great a <hi>dishonour</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> as that was, and had not used some means for the <hi>removing</hi> such a person from their <hi>Society; And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned that hee that hath done this deed, may be taken away from among you,</hi> 1 Corinth. 5. 2.

Thus from these three <hi>Hypotheses</hi> this <hi>Corollary</hi> follows, that where any persons in a <hi>Church</hi> do by their <hi>open</hi> and <hi>contumacious offences,</hi> declare to the world that they are far from being the persons they were supposed to be in their <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> there is a <hi>power resident</hi> in the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>debar</hi> such persons from the <hi>priviledges</hi> of it; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> 1. Because this expresseth the <hi>nearest union,</hi> and <hi>closest confederation,</hi> as the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> among the <hi>Grecians Commonwealths</hi> did. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this hath been alwayes looked on with greatest <hi>veneration</hi> in the <hi>Church of God;</hi> and therefore it is least of all fit those persons should be admitted to the, highest <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which are unworthy of the lowest of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:100525:237"/>There remain only some few <hi>Objections</hi> which are levelled<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> against this opinion concerning the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>excommunication,</hi> which from the Question being thus stated and proved, will be soon removed. The <hi>first</hi> is, <hi>that this excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an outward punishment, and therefore belongs not to Church officers, but to the Magistrate.</hi> 2. <hi>Because it neither is, nor ever was in the power of any Church officer to debar any offending member from publick worship, because any Heathens may come to it.</hi> 3. <hi>It cannot lye as to exclusion from the Lords Supper, because Christ is offered as spiritual food, as well in the Word Preached as in the Sacrament.</hi> To these I answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. I do not well understand what the <hi>Objectors</hi> mean by an <hi>outward punishment;</hi> for there can be no punishment belonging to a <hi>visible Society,</hi> (such as the <hi>Church</hi> is here considered to be) but it must be <hi>visible,</hi> i. e. <hi>outward,</hi> or a thing to be taken notice of in the World; and in this sense I deny that all <hi>visible punishment</hi> belongs only to the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> but if by <hi>outward,</hi> be mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>forcible punishment,</hi> then I grant that all <hi>coactive power</hi> belongs to the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>excommunication formally</hi> considered, is a forcible punishment. 1. Because every person at his entrance into this <hi>Society,</hi> is supposed to <hi>declare</hi> his <hi>submission</hi> to the rules of the <hi>Society;</hi> and therefore whatever he after undergoes by way of <hi>penalty</hi> in this <hi>Society,</hi> doth depend upon that <hi>consent.</hi> 2. A person stands <hi>excommunicate</hi> legally and <hi>de jure,</hi> who is <hi>declared authoritatively</hi> to be no <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> though he may be present at the <hi>acts</hi> of it, as a <hi>defranchised person</hi> may be at those of a <hi>Corporation.</hi> 3. A person falling into those <hi>offences</hi> which <hi>merit excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is supposed in so doing, <hi>voluntarily</hi> to <hi>renounce</hi> his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> in those <hi>priviledges,</hi> the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of <hi>which</hi> doth <hi>depend</hi> upon <hi>abstaining</hi> from those <hi>offences</hi> which he wilfully falls into, especially if <hi>contumacy</hi> be joyned with them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>is before <hi>excommunication;</hi> for then nothing is done <hi>forcibly</hi> towards him; for he first <hi>relinquisheth</hi> his <hi>right,</hi> before the <hi>Church-Governor</hi> declares him <hi>excluded</hi> the <hi>Society.</hi> So that the offender doth <hi>meritoriously</hi> excommunicate <hi>himself,</hi> the <hi>Pastor</hi> doth it <hi>formally,</hi> by declaring that he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self no member by his <hi>offences</hi> and <hi>contumacy</hi> joyned with

them. To the second I answer, That I do not place the <hi>formality of excommunication in exclusion from hearing the Word,</hi> but in debarring the person from hearing <hi>tanquam pars Ecclesiae,</hi> as a member of the <hi>Church,</hi> and so his hearing may be well joyned with that of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and not of <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> To the third I answer, That <hi>exclusion</hi> from the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is not on the accounts menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Objection, but because it is one of the chiefest <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as it is a visible <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus cleared and asserted the power of <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> in a <hi>Christian church,</hi> there remains only one <hi>enquiry</hi> more, which is, <hi>Whether this power doth remain formally in the Church, after its being incorporated into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, or else doth it then escheate wholly into the Civil Power?</hi> The <hi>resolution</hi> of which <hi>question</hi> mainly <hi>depends</hi> on another spoken to already; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether this power was only a kind of <hi>Widows estate,</hi> which belonged to it only du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring its <hi>separation</hi> from the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> or was the <hi>Church</hi> absolutely <hi>infeoffed</hi> of it as its <hi>perpetual Right,</hi> belonging to it in all <hi>conditions</hi> whatsoever it should be in? Now that must appear by the <hi>Tenure</hi> of it, and the <hi>grounds</hi> on which it was <hi>conveyed,</hi> which having been proved already to be <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>universal,</hi> it from thence appears that no <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> can invalidate its former <hi>title.</hi> But then as in case of <hi>marriage,</hi> the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>disposal</hi> and well <hi>management</hi> of the <hi>estate</hi> coming by the <hi>wife,</hi> belongs to the <hi>husband;</hi> so after the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>married</hi> into the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> the <hi>right</hi> of supream <hi>management</hi> of this <hi>power</hi> in an <hi>external</hi> way doth <hi>fall</hi> into the <hi>Magistrates</hi> hands. Which may consist in these following things. 1. A <hi>right</hi> of <hi>prescribing Laws</hi> for the due <hi>management</hi> of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censures.</hi> 2. A <hi>right</hi> of <hi>bounding</hi> the manner of <hi>proceeding</hi> in <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="5 letters">

The <hi>right</hi> of adding <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>civil sanctions</hi> to <hi>Church-censures,</hi> and so enforcing the <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:100525:238"/>
               <hi>weapons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with the more <hi>keen</hi> and <hi>sharp</hi> ones of the Civil State. Thus I assert the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of all <hi>Church censures in foro humano</hi> to flow from the <hi>Civil power,</hi> and that there is no proper <hi>effect</hi> following any of them as to <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> but from the <hi>Magistrates sanction.</hi> 4, To the <hi>Magistrate</hi> belongs the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>appeals</hi> in case of <hi>unjust censures,</hi> not that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> can <hi>repeal</hi> a <hi>just censure</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> as to its <hi>spiritual effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>;</hi> but he may <hi>suspend</hi> the <hi>temporal effect</hi> of it: in which case it is the duty of <hi>Pastors</hi> to <hi>discharge</hi> their <hi>office</hi> and <hi>acquiesce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But this <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> in the <hi>supream ordering</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> as well as <hi>Civil Causes,</hi> I have fully <hi>asserted</hi> and <hi>cleared</hi> already. From<note place="margin">Iren. p 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. sect. 7.</note> which it follows, That as to any <hi>outward effects</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>excommunication,</hi> the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Supream Magistrate</hi> must be <hi>exempted,</hi> both because the <hi>force</hi> of these <hi>censures</hi> doth <hi>flow</hi> from him in a <hi>Christian State,</hi> and that there otherwise would be a <hi>progress in infinitum,</hi> to know whether the <hi>censure</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> were <hi>just</hi> or no. I conclude then, that though the <hi>Magistrate</hi> hath the main care of <hi>ordering things</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet (the <hi>Magistrates</hi> power in the <hi>Church</hi> being <hi>cumulative,</hi> and not <hi>privative</hi>) the <hi>Church</hi> and her <hi>Officers</hi> retain the <hi>fundamental right</hi> of <hi>inflicting censures</hi> on <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
