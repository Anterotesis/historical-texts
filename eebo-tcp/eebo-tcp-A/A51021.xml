            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>Duncomb</hi> is Accus'd by Bill in the following Words; <hi>And whereas it appears, as well by Proof, as by the Voluntary Confeſſion of</hi> Charles Duncomb <hi>Eſq; late Caſhier of His Majeſty's Revenue of Exciſe openly made in the</hi> Houſe of Commons, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Charles Duncomb <hi>is guilty of Contriving and Adviſing <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it therefore En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the King's Most Excellent Majeſty, by and with the Advice and Conſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame; That be the ſaid</hi> Charles Duncomb, <hi>ſhall as a just Puniſhment for ſuch his High Crimes and Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, forfeit to His Majeſty His Heirs and Succeſſors, Two Third Parts of all his Mannors, Lands, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements and Hereditaments, which he, or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>The Accuſation conſiſting of Facts <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apable of Proof, he humbly hopes, That a Bill of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Nature with ſuch high Penaties, will not paſs in the Houſe of Peers, unleſs the Crimes and Facts alledg'd can be fully made <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>As to the Voluntary Confeſſion, upon which the Bill is founded, he hopes as an <hi>Engliſh-Man,</hi> and a Freeholder in this Kingdom, That he ſhall have the Right done him to have this Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Bill fairly examin'd, and wel prov'd; for, according to the beſt Recollection he is able to make, he doth not believe that any Concern he might be in at that time, could ſo deprive him of his Reaſon, as to acknowledge himſelf Guilty of That which is neither true in it ſelf, nor ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by any Proof.</p>
            <p>And, as an Inducement to paſs the Bill, and as an Aggravation of his Crime, he was Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd at the Bar of <hi>the Houſe of Commons,</hi> to have been the firſt who brought a Diſreputation upon Exchequer Bills.</p>
            <p>But when the Facts alledg'd againſt him ſhall be thoroughly look'd into, and when the Witneſſes both for and againſt him, ſhall be Examin'd upon Oath, he hopes there will appear ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not to paſs the Bill.</p>
            <p>As to his being the firſt who brought Diſcredit upon the Exchequer Bills, the contrary will be evident to ſuch as conſider, that before the Fact of which he is Accus'd, <hi>viz.</hi> about the end of <hi>March</hi> laſt, The <hi>Treaſury</hi> had Con<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>cted with Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta</hi> and others, to remit Fifty Thouſand Pound Sterling to <hi>Flanders,</hi> for which they Received Fifty Thouſand Pound in Exchequer Bills, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Bills of Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe concern'd with him, at double Uſance, and at Nine Guilders Ten Stivers for the Pound St<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rling, which will be found to be a Diſcompt of about Sixteen <hi>per Cent.</hi> And they who underſtand the Exchange know, that this was the firſt Wound that was given to Exchequer Bills: And when Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta</hi> could part with Exchequer Bills at 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Diſcompt, he gave his Bills in <hi>Flanders</hi> for Ten Guilders Eight Stivers, which was 9 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more than he gave before, and ſo much was clearly ſav'd to the Publick. The Tranſactions of Private Men, could not hurt the Credits of Exchequer Bills ſo much, as what was done by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and upon Inquiry the Lords may be ſatisfy'd that the Fifty Thouſand Pound about the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> was ſo Remitted, tho the Act appropriates the firſt Two Hundred Thouſand Pound for Payment of Quarters in <hi>England,</hi> which Bills for Quarters were not iſſu'd out till the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Fact in Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi>'s Caſe plainly ſtands thus.</p>
            <p>He was Receiver-General or Caſhier of the Exciſe; and on the 7th of <hi>May</hi> laſt, he was Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd from his Employment at which time there remain'd in his Hands Sixteen Thouſand Four Hundred and Twenty Six Pounds, Four Shillings and Six Pence Half-penny, and no more, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>And his Proceeding in this Matter, as well as that of other perſons, ſeems juſtified by the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> which by a Printed Vote of <hi>February</hi> the 22d has declared, <hi>That the rec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>He hopes his Caſe, in ſome Circumſtances, is parallel with theirs whom this Vote has Clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and in other circumſtances, a great deal more Favourable of his ſide.

The Truſtees were not Oblig'd by their Contract to Exchange Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi>'s Bills for Money, but they were Obliged to Exchange the Bills for upwards of <hi>One Hundred Thirty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> by which the Publick loſt <hi>Ten Pound per Cent.</hi> The King had a Remedy againſt Mr. <hi>Duncomb,</hi> if his Payment was not good <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

For which Reaſons he humbly hopes, that as others, whoſe Caſe in Appeara<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> is not ſo favourable, have been publickly Juſtify'd, ſo, that upon due Conſideration, his Payment will not be judg'd illegal.</p>
            <p>As to what is pretended to be a Falſe Endorſement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Endorſement that the Law requires is the day of the Month and Year when paid, and upon what the ſame was paid, to be atteſted by the Name of the Perſon who paid the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi>'s was no ſuch Endorſement, for when ſome of theſe Bills were carry'd to the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees to be exchang'd, they refus'd them, declaring ſuch a Name was no Endorſement: And the falſe Endorſements of which others are accus'd, are Fraudulently fill'd up intirely, and the Names Counterfeited, and took Effect as if they had been really paid into ſome Part of the Revenue: Tis indeed alledg'd, That one <hi>Preſgrave</hi> a Clerk, ſome Months afterwards, when Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> was out, finding ſome of theſe Bills in the Office, fill'd them up with a Day, Month, and Year, &amp;c. as paid into the Exciſe, which made it a falſe Endorſement, but this was the Act of <hi>Preſgrave,</hi> and 'tis not pretended to have been done with the leaſt Privity of Mr. <hi>Duncomb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his Tranſaction with Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta,</hi> he doubts not but to prove manifeſtly That it was in the following manner:</p>
            <p>Upon his Diſmiſſion, being to Pay in the Ballance of his Accompt, he dealt with Mr. <hi>D'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Acoſta</hi> partly in Money, and partly for ſome Orders of Courſe, due in the Exchequer, but not then paid, for <hi>Seven Thouſands Eight Hundred Eighty Four Pounds Nine Shillings Six Pence</hi> in Exchequer Bills. When theſe Bills were brought to him, Mr. <hi>Duncomb,</hi> in order to know who he had them of (it being commonly apprehended at that time, that Exchequer Bills might be Counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) did deſire Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta</hi> to ſet his Name to the Bills, which he did to ſome of them; and of his own accord, Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta,</hi> (without being thereunto induc'd by any Perſwaſion of Mr. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb</hi>'s, as he himſelf muſt own when he comes to be Examin'd upon Oath) did put the Names of his Packer and others, whoſe Names he made uſe of upon other Occaſions, ſaying, <hi>He feared it would diſoblige the Lords of the Treaſury, if his Name ſhould appear to ſo many Bills at that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note, <hi>That Mr.</hi> D' Acoſta <hi>own'd at the Bar of the Houſe of Commons, That he ſet the Names of his Packer and others upon thoſe Exchequer Bills, it being, as he there ſaid, cuſtomary for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to Sign Bills of Exchange, Bills of Lading, Envoices, and other Bills in that manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being evident that Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi> had no Contrivance with Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta,</hi> it remains for him <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſhow that he could have no Intention to make theſe Bills Paſs upon Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> for other than what they were.</p>
            <p>If he had deſign'd to <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, and that he declared at the Payment, that the others were not paid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Exciſe; not does Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> ſay, that Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi> declared that the other <hi>Seven Thouſand Eight Hundred Eighty Four Pounds Nine Shillings Six Pence</hi> had paſſed through the Revenue, but Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> pretends, that becauſe there were Names on them, he imagined they might be Received <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the Exciſe: But this Aſſertion of his ſeems altogether impoſſible, becauſe,</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>One Thouſand Three Hundred Ninety Seven Pounds Nine Shillings Five Pence</hi> Bills were fully Endors'd, and he being to caſt up the Intereſt of every Bill, muſt take them up in his hands one by one, and conſequently ſee the difference that was between them.</p>

            <p>Beſides, it can be p<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>v'd, That Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> had <hi>Three Thouſand Pounds</hi> in Bills of the like Nature of his own, refus'd at another Office; and the Reaſon aſſign'd to him for the Refuſal was, <hi>That it was impoſſible ſo many Bills ſhould ſo ſoon come through the Exciſe</hi> from whence may be juſtly argu'd That there is no manner of likelihood (that within four Days after his own Bills had been refus'd for ſo plain a Reaſon) Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> ſhould Receive almoſt <hi>Ten Thouſand Pounds,</hi> without asking this Obvious Queſtion: <hi>Whether all theſe Bills had paſs'd the Revenue, or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the true ſtate of his Caſe in relation to the Confeſſion alledg'd to have been made in the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and concerning his Tranſactions, firſt with Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta,</hi> and then with Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> he hopes it will appear,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That he has not made any Voluntary Confeſſion of being Guilty of <hi>Contriving and Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the making of Falſe Endorſements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he was far from being the firſt who brought a Diſcredit upon Exchequer Bills.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Payment of his Ballance in Exchequer Bills was, and is juſtifiable by the Law, declar'd in the King's Proclamation, by the practice of the Exciſe-Office, ſince his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and by the Similitude his Caſe bears with their Caſe, who have been lately clear'd by a Vote of the <hi>Houſe of Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Bills paid by him, can in no ſence be interpreted to have a falſe Endorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That Mr. <hi>D' Acoſta</hi> did ſet the Names of his Packer and others upon the Bills of his own Accord, and not at the Inſtance or Perſwaſion of Mr. <hi>Duncomb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That he never intended to impoſe theſe Bills on the Exchequer, as having gone through the Exciſe; And that Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> as well by Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi>'s Declaration at the time, as by other Circumſtances, muſt of Neceſſity know that part of theſe Bills had, and part had not paſs'd through the Revenue, which of it ſelf clears Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi> of any Frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Intention.</p>
            <p>And when the Premiſes ſhall be duly conſider'd, and all Matters examin'd upon Oath, he doubts not but that his Innocence will be made apparent, and that the Lords, upon whoſe Juſtice with all Humility he throws himſelf, will ſee good Reaſons not to paſs the Bill now brought againſt him.</p>
